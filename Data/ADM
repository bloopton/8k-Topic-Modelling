ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND REPORTS SECOND QUARTER RESULTS
 
Decatur, IL -- January 24, 2003 -- Archer Daniels Midland (NYSE: ADM)
Second quarter earnings per share were $ .20 compared to $ .23 last year as Operating Profit decreased
to $297 million from $341 million.
* Oilseeds Processing results were negatively impacted by lower
North American Crush margins.
* Corn Processing results increased due to improved ethanol demand.
* Wheat Processing results decreased due to adverse crop conditions.
* Agricultural Services results were negatively affected by
difficult market conditions.
* Other results improved, driven primarily by bioproducts, cocoa
and other international businesses.
Second Quarter Highlights.
(Amounts in thousands, except per share data and percentages)
Improved profits in international oilseeds processing did not fully offset
lower North American results. Poor crops in North America negatively
impacted grain storage and transportation revenues. Corn processing,
cocoa and bioproducts contributed strong results for the quarter. Our
growing global franchise continues to produce value for our shareholders.
G. Allen Andreas, Chairman and Chief Executive
 
Archer Daniels Midland
Page 2
Net earnings for the quarter ended December 31, 2002 were $ 131,245,000 or
$ .20 per share compared with $ 150,025,000 or $ .23 per share last year.
This year's results include a $ .02 per share gain from partial settlement
of the Company's claims related to vitamin antitrust litigation. Last year's
results included a $ .04 per share gain related to the vitamin antitrust litigation
settlements and a $ .02 per share loss related to security transactions. For
fiscal year 2003, six months net earnings were $ 239,320,000 or $ .37 per share
compared to $ 281,643,000 or $ .43 per share last year. Current year's six month
results include a gain of $ .02 per share from the vitamin antitrust litigation
settlements. Last year's six month results included a gain related to the vitamin
antitrust litigation settlements of $ .04 per share and a gain of $ .03 per share
from security transactions.
Segment operating profit decreased to $ 297,369,000 from $ 341,314,000 for
the quarter and to $ 537,315,000 from $ 562,545,000 for the six months.
The decline in operating profits for the quarter and six months resulted
primarily from lower North American oilseed crush margins and lower
operating results in the Agricultural Services and Wheat Processing segments
due to difficult operating conditions resulting from drought induced short crops.
These declines were partially offset by improved profits in international oilseed
processing, increased corn processing results due to improved ethanol demand and stronger results in cocoa and bioproducts operations.

ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND REPORTS SECOND QUARTER RESULTS
 
Decatur, IL -- April 23, 2003 -- Archer Daniels Midland (NYSE: ADM)
Third quarter earnings per share were $ .18 compared to $ .18 last year.
* Corn Processing results were strong due to improved selling prices and volumes.
* Oilseeds Processing results continued to be strong in South America and Asia but were offset by weaker North American and European crush margins.
* Wheat Processing and Agricultural Services results decreased due to adverse crop conditions.
* Other results increased, driven primarily by improvements in Bioproducts and Cocoa.
 
Third Quarter Highlights.
(Amounts in thousands, except per share data and percentages)
ADM's earnings per share were comparable to last year's third quarter results despite weak industry conditions in many of our markets. Our global franchise, with product and geographic diversification, delivered solid results and strong cash flows even in these challenging market conditions. We continue to position our global assets to meet shifting production and consumption patterns and to generate shareholder value.
G. Allen Andreas, Chairman and Chief Executive

Last year's results included a $ .01 per share gain related to the vitamin antitrust litigation settlements. For fiscal year 2003, nine month net earnings were $ 356,125,000 or $ .55 per share compared to $ 398,827,000 or $ .61 per share last year.

The decline in operating profits for the quarter and nine months resulted primarily from lower North American and European oilseed crush margins. In addition, operating results in the Agricultural Services and Wheat Processing segments declined due to difficult operating conditions resulting from drought induced short crops. These declines were partially offset by increased results from Corn Processing, Cocoa, and Bioproducts operations.

Corn Processing results were comparable to last year's strong quarter.
Wheat Processing results improved due to increased volumes and improved production yields.
Agricultural Services results improved due to the strength of our global grain origination and marketing system.
Other segment operations increased as Cocoa, Bioproducts, and private equity investment results improved.

First Quarter Results
Net earnings for the first quarter ended September 30, 2003 were $150 million or $.23 per share compared with $108 million or $.17 per share last year.
 
Total Segment Operating profit increased $ 57 million to $ 297 million from $ 240 million last year. Oilseed Processing results decreased to $ 68 million from $ 76 million as improved results in the South American and Asian markets were more than offset by reduced crush margins in North America and Europe. Corn Processing results of $ 85 million were comparable to last year's strong quarter. Wheat Processing results improved to $ 26 million from $ 20 million last year as the improved current year crop conditions in the United States resulted in improved US operating conditions. Agricultural Services results improved $3 million to $ 43 million due to the balanced performance of our global grain origination and marketing system. The effect of last year's poor North American crop continued to negatively impact the North American origination and marketing system results. The Other segments increased to $ 75 million from $ 20 million last year due to improvements in the Cocoa and Bioproducts processing operati ons and improved earnings of our private equity fund investments.

Discussion of Operations
Net earnings for the quarter ended December 31, 2003 were $ 221 million, or $ .34 per share, compared with $ 131 million, or $ .20 per share, last year. Net earnings for the six months ended December 31, 2003 were $ 371 million, or $ .57 per share, compared to $ 239 million, or $ .37 per share, last year. This year's results for the quarter and six months include an asset abandonment charge of $ 29 million ($ 18 million after tax, equal to $ .03 per share). Last year's quarter and six months included a gain from partial settlement of the Company's claims related to vitamin antitrust litigation of $ 25 million ($ 15 million after tax, equal to $ .02 per share) and a loss on security transactions of $ 3 million ($ 2 million after tax).
 
Total Segment Operating profit increased $ 198 million to $ 495 million for the quarter and increased $ 254 million to $ 792 million for the six months. Oilseed processing results increased in North America and Asia while operating margins weakened in South America and Europe. Corn Processing results improved as both ethanol and sweetener volumes and selling prices improved over prior year levels. Wheat Processing results increased as improved crop conditions in North America resulted in improved volumes and production yields. Agricultural Services results improved due to the performance of our balanced global grain origination and marketing systems. With varied crop conditions around the world this year and solid worldwide demand for grains and feedstuffs, our global marketing operations performed well. Strong demand for transportation also contributed to the earnings gain. The Other segment increased due primarily to improved earnings of Specialty Feed Ingredients, Cocoa and our private equity investments.
 
The increase in Corporate expense was due primarily to LIFO inventory valuation charges of $ 53 million for the quarter and $ 61 million for the six months. Last year's six months included a LIFO inventory valuation charge of $ 11 million.

Discussion of Operations
Net earnings for the quarter ended March 31, 2004 were $227 million, or $.35 per share, compared with $117 million, or $.18 per share, last year. Net earnings for the nine months ended March 31, 2004 were $598 million, or $.92 per share, compared to $356 million, or $.55 per share, last year.
 
Segment Operating profit increased $260 million to $502 million for the quarter and increased $513 million to $1.3 billion for the nine months as operating profit improvements were realized in all major segments. Oilseed Processing operating profits increased as earnings strengthened in North America and Asia. Lower net corn costs, combined with increased selling prices and volumes in all major corn product lines, resulted in improved operating profits of the Corn Processing segment. Wheat Processing operating profits increased as volumes stabilized and margins improved. Agricultural Services' balanced global grain origination and marketing system continued its strong performance resulting in improved operating profits. Strong demand for transportation also contributed to the earnings gain. Other segment operating profit increased as earnings of the Specialty Food and Feed Ingredients, Cocoa and private equity investments improved over prior year levels. Corporate expense increased $74 mil lion to $163 million for the quarter and increased $135 million to $417 million for the nine months due primarily to LIFO inventory valuation charges of $99 million for the quarter and $160 million for the nine months. Last year's LIFO inventory valuation charges were $4 million for the quarter and $15 million for the nine months. The increased LIFO charges were partially offset by security transaction gains and interest received on the insurance-related lawsuit pertaining to the flood of 1993.
 
This year's results include asset abandonment charges of $12 million ($8 million after tax, equal to $.01 per share) for the quarter and $41 million ($26 million after tax, equal to $.04 per share) for the nine months. This year's results for the quarter and nine months also include a $21 million ($13 million after tax, equal to $.02 per share) gain from an insurance-related lawsuit pertaining to the flood of 1993 and an $11 million ($7 million after tax, equal to $.01 per share) gain on securities transactions. Last year's results included a $3 million ($2 million after tax) gain for the quarter and a $28 million ($17 million after tax, equal to $.03 per share) gain for the nine months from partial settlements of the Company's claims related to vitamin antitrust litigation. Last year's quarter and nine months results also included an $11 million ($7 million after tax, equal to $.01 per share) charge related to the Company's global settlement with the EPA and a $15 million ($10 million aft er tax, equal to $.02 per share) gain related to the sale of fixed assets.

Discussion of Operations
Net earnings for the year ended June 30, 2004 were $ 495 million, or $ .76 per share, compared to $ 451 million, or $ .70 per share, last year. Results for the quarter ended June 30, 2004 were a loss of $ 103 million, or $ .16 per share, compared to earnings of $ 95 million, or $ .15 per share, last year. The quarter and year ended June 30, 2004 includes a $ 400 million charge ($ 252 million after tax, or $ .39 per share) related to the settlement of fructose litigation.
Segment operating profit increased $ 37 million to $ 268 million for the quarter and increased $ 551 million to $ 1.56 billion for the year as operating profit improvements were realized in all major segments except the Oilseed Processing segment. Oilseed Processing operating results declined to a loss of $ 15 million for the quarter and earnings of $ 291 million for the year as Chinese contract defaults in the fourth quarter had a significant impact on global oilseed markets which negatively impacted our oilseeds operation. Corn Processing operating earnings increased to $ 150 million for the quarter and $ 661 million for the year as Bioproducts results improved due to increased volumes and selling prices of alcohol and lysine product categories which more than offset higher net corn costs. Earnings of Sweetener and Starch products declined for the quarter as increased net corn costs more than offset improved volumes and selling prices. For the year, Sweetener and Starch earnings improved due to increased volumes and selling prices. Agricultural Services' balanced global grain and marketing system continued its strong performance resulting in improved operating profits. Other segment operating profit increased to $ 88 million for the quarter and $ 359 million for the year as Food and Feed Ingredient earnings increased due to improved operating results of wheat processing and cocoa processing operations. In addition, financial operations increased primarily due to improved results of our private equity fund investments. Corporate expense for the quarter increased $ 328 million to $ 426 million due principally to the $ 400 million fructose litigation settlement partially offset by a $ 42 million credit due to changing commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuations and an increase of $ 10 million in security gains. For the year, corporate expense increased $ 464 million due primarily to the $ 400 million fructose litigation settlement and an increased charge of $ 104 million due to changing commodity price effects on LIFO inventory valuations partially offset by increased security gains of $ 24 million.
Fiscal 2004 fourth quarter includes a $ 400 million ($ 252 million after tax, equal to $ .39 per share) charge for the fructose litigation settlement, $ 10 million ($ 6 million after tax, equal to $ .01 per share) of asset abandonment charges and $ 12 million ($ 8 million after tax, equal to $ .01 per share) of security gains. Last years fourth quarter included $ 13 million ($ 8 million after tax, equal to $ .01 per share) of asset abandonment charges and $ 2 million ($ 1 million after tax) of security gains. Fiscal 2004 twelve month results includes a $ 400 million ($ 252 million after tax, equal to $ .39 per share) charge for the fructose litigation settlement, $ 51 million ($32 million after tax, equal to $ .05 per share) of asset abandonment charges, a $ 21 million ($ 13 million after tax, equal to $ .02 per share) gain from an insurance-related lawsuit pertaining to the flood of 1 993 and $ 24 million ($ 15 million after tax, equal to $ .02 a share) of security gains. Fiscal 2003 twelve month results include $ 13 million ($ 8 million after tax, equal to $ .01 per share) of asset abandonment charges, a $ 28 million ($ 17 million after tax, equal to $ .03 per share) gain from partial settlements of the Company's claims related to vitamin antitrust litigation, and an $ 11 million ($ 7 million after tax, equal to $ .01 per share) charge related to the company's global settlement with the EPA.

Net earnings for the quarter ended September 30, 2004 were $ 266 million, equal to $ .41 per share, compared to $ 150 million, equal to $ .23 per share last year, an increase of 77%.
Segment operating profit for the quarter ended September 30, 2004 increased $ 42 million to $ 339 million as operating profit improvements were realized in all major segments except the Corn Processing segment. Oilseeds Processing operating earnings increased to $ 91 million from $ 68 million last year as improved North American and European operating results were partially offset by decreased operating results in our Asian operations. Corn Processing operating earnings declined to $ 103 million from $ 107 million last year. Bioproducts results improved to $ 48 million from $ 18 million last year as higher ethanol and feed ingredient bioproduct selling prices more than offset higher net corn costs. Sweeteners and Starches were negatively impacted by higher net corn costs resulting in earnings of $ 55 million co mpared to earnings of $ 89 million last year. Agricultural Services operating earnings increased to $ 51 million from $ 43 million last year as improvements in North American origination and transportation operating results more than offset a decline from the prior year's strong global grain merchandising results. Other segment operating earnings increased to $ 93 million from $ 79 million last year. Food and Feed Ingredient earnings increased $ 29 million to $ 89 million due to improved operating results of our Cocoa operations and improved earnings of the GRUMA corn flour venture. Financial operations declined $ 15 million primarily due to a decrease in results of our private equity fund investments. For the quarter, Corporate improved to $ 47 million of income this year from $ 79 million of expense last year due primarily to a $ 116 million credit from the effect of changing commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuations compared to a LIFO charge of $ 8 million last year.

Item 1.01
   
Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On December 17, 2004, the Compensation/Succession Committee of the Board of Directors of Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (the "Company") adopted the ADM Deferred Compensation Plan for Selected Management Employees II (As Adopted As Of December 1, 2004) (the "Deferred Compensation Plan II") and the ADM Supplemental Retirement Plan II (As Adopted As Of December 1, 2004) (the "SERP II," and together with the Deferred Compensation Plan II, the "Plans"). The Plans are intended to comply with the requirements imposed under new Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") (as added by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 ("Jobs Act")), and the provisions of the Plans will be construed i n a manner consistent with the requirements of such section of the Code. The Company intends to amend the Plans, to the extent necessary, to comply with guidance that the United States Department of Treasury is expected to issue with respect to Section 409A of the Code.
The obligations of the Company under the Plans are unsecured general obligations to pay in the future the balance of the deferred compensation accounts or accrued benefits, as the case may be, pursuant to the terms of the Plans.
Certain highly compensated and management employees of the Company are eligible to participate in the Deferred Compensation Plan II.
The Deferred Compensation Plan II allows eligible employee participants to annually defer between 5% and 75% of their base salary on a pre-tax basis. Deferred amounts are credited to the participants' accounts and the accounts are credited with earnings based on one or more benchmark funds offered under the Deferred Compensation Plan II. Participants can set up to five scheduled distribution accounts. Each scheduled distribution account will be paid in a lump-sum in January of the year designated by the participant. With respect to one of the s cheduled distribution accounts, a participant can elect to receive installments over a period of up to 5 years instead of a lump-sum. Participants can further defer the payment by making a deferral election at least 12 months prior to the scheduled payment, provided the new payment year is at least five years after the scheduled payment year. Participants can also elect to have any scheduled distribution accounts paid six months after termination of employment (or in January of the year following termination, if later) if that such termination occurs before the scheduled payment dates. Participants can also set up a retirement account that results in a lump-sum or installment payments, as elected by the participant, to be paid six months after retirement (or in January of the year following retirement, if later).
 
Certain highly compensated employees of the Company are eligible to participate in the SERP II. Employees who become eligible after December 31, 2004, must enroll in the SERP II during the 30 day period following notification of eligibility. Participants become vested in their supplemental retirement benefits if the participant is vested in his or her interest in the Company's qualified retirement plan. Vested participants will be entitled to receive a benefit after termination calculated in accordance with the SERP II. The payments will begin on the later of the first day of the month beginning six months after the participant's separation from service or the first day the participant could elect to receive his or her pension under the qualified retirement p lan and will be paid in the form of either a life annuity, which results in monthly payments to the participant during his or her life, or a joint and survivor annuity, which results in monthly payments to the participant during his or her life and then to the participant's designated beneficiary after the participant dies.
Also on December 17, 2004,
the Compensation/Succession Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company adopted amendments to the Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Amended and Restated Stock Unit Plan For Nonemployee Directors (the "Director Plan"). The Director Plan provides a means for nonemployee directors on the Company's Board of Directors to receive part or all of their compensation in the form of stock units. The amendments to the Director Plan modify the ability of participants to extend the day of payment under the stock units in order to comply with the Jobs Act. Under the Director Plan, as amended and restated, participants must make an election to extend the payment date at least 12 months prior to the previously scheduled payment date and the new payment date must be at least 5 years after the previously scheduled payment date unless the election to extend is received by the benefits committee prior to the calendar year in which the stock unit award is made.

(1)
   
Any acquisition directly from ADM;
For purposes of this definition, a "person" means a person within the meaning of Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("Exchange Act"), "beneficial ownership" means beneficial ownership within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act, and "subsidiary" of ADM means any entity of which securities or other ownership interests having general voting power to elect a majority of the board of directors or other persons performing similar functions are at the time directly or indirectly owned by ADM.
If a Participant has a Separation from Service prior to satisfying the conditions specified above for a Disability, the provisions of the Plan relating to Separation from Service (or Retirement, if applicable) will apply with respect to the Participant, and not the provisions relating to Disability.
The ADM Board of Directors (or its Compensation Committee), or the ADM Chief Executive Officer (in each case acting in a corporate capacity), in its/his/her sole and absolute discretion, may determine that an Employee described above will not be an Eligible Employee, or may determine that an Employee not described above will be an Eligible Employee. However, the Plan is intended to cover only those Employees who are in
a select group of management or highly compensated employees within the meaning of ERISA  201(2), 301(a)(3) and 401(a)(1); and, accordingly, if any interpretation is issued by the Department of Labor that would exclude any Employee from satisfying that requirement, such Employee immediately wi ll cease to be in the Eligible Employee.
If one-third (1/3
rd
) of the Participants, separately or together, provide a written statement to ADM that, in their good faith opinion, a Potential Change in Control has occurred, then a Potential Change in Control will be deemed to have occurred for purposes of this Plan unless ADM, within ten (10) business days after such statement has been received from the Participants, provides the Participants with an opinion of a nationally or regionally recognized law firm that a Potential Change in Control has not occurred for purposes of the Plan.
For purposes of this definition, a "person" means a person within the meaning of Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act.
2.1.19 "
Prior Plan
" means the ADM Deferred Compensation Plan for Selected Management Employees I, as amended.
2.1.23 "
Termination of Employment
" means that the common-law employer-employee relationship has ended between the individual and ADM and its Affiliates, as determined under the employment policies and practices of ADM (including by reason of voluntary or involuntary termination, retirement, death, failure to
 
   return from a recognized leave of absence, etc.). For an Employee working for an Affiliate, a termination of employment will occur upon sale of the stock of such employer such that it no longer satisfies the definition of an Affiliate (assuming he/she continues in the employ of that employer or a new affiliate of that employer after the sale). A termination of employment does not occur merely as a result of transfer of employment from one Affiliate to another Affiliate, or from ADM to an Affiliate or from an Affiliate to ADM.
   
Enrollment is required and must be made in such manner and in accordance with such rules as may be prescribed for this purpose by ADM (including by means of a voice response or other electronic sy
stem under circumstances authorized by ADM).
An election (or the modification or revocation of an election) must be made in such manner and in accordance with such rules as may be prescribed for this purpose by ADM (including by means of a voice response or other electronic system under circumstances authorized by ADM). An election must be made as part of enrollment described in Section 3.1.2 and must specify the Account(s) to which the Elective Deferrals are to be credited pursuant to Section 4.1.1, and the payment form associated with such Account.
Additional Accounts may also be maintained if considered appropriate by ADM in the administration of the Plan.
Distributions from Account B, C, D, E and/or F - Scheduled Distribution Accounts will be made in accordance with Article VI, or in the event of a Separation from Service or Disability over-ride election made by the Participant in accordance with Article VI, following Separation from Service or Disability in accordance with Article VII, or in either event following death in accordance with Article VIII.
A Participant (or Beneficiary following the death of the Participant) will be allowed on a hypothetical basis to direct the investment of his/her Accounts among the investment options available under the Plan. Hypothetical i
nvestment directions may be given with such frequency as is deemed appropriate by ADM, and must be made in such percentage or dollar increments, in such manner and in accordance with such rules as may be prescribed for this purpose by ADM (including by means of a voice response or other electronic system under circumstances so authorized by ADM).
If an investment option has a loss, the Earnings Credit attribut able to such investment option will serve to reduce the Account; similarly, if an investment option has a gain, the Earnings Credit attributable to such investment option will serve to increase the Account. If the Participant fails to elect an investment option, the Earnings Credit will be based on a money market investment option or such other investment option as may be selected for this purpose by ADM.
A Participant at all times will have a fully vested interest in his/her Accounts under the Plan.
Payment will be made (or installments will commence) from a Scheduled Distribution Account during January of the scheduled distribution Plan Year.
When a Participant directs that Scheduled Distribution Account B be established, he/she must specify the Plan Year during which payment is to be made (or installments are to commence) with respect to such Account.
If so permitted by ADM, a Participant may make a different over-ride election to apply in the case of Retirement or Disability than will apply in the case of any other Separation from Service (for example, the Participant may elect that Article VII will over-ride in the event of Retirement or Disability, but not any other Separation from Service, or that Article VII will over-ride in the event of any Separation from Service or Disability).
A Scheduled Distribution Account that will be paid in a given Plan Year will not count toward the maximum five (5) Scheduled Distribution Accounts. Accordingly, if a Participant has five (5) Scheduled Distribution Accounts, and one such Account will be paid in a given Plan Year, a Participant will be allowed to establish another Scheduled Distribution Account with respect to Elective Deferral Credits made for such Plan Year.
In the event of death, distributions from a Scheduled Distribution Account will be determined under Article VIII.
Any election under paragraph (a)(2) or (b)(2) will not apply to a Company Matching Account - Account G; rather, such Account will be paid in all cases as of the date specified in paragraph (a)(1) or (b)(1), as applicable.
 
7.2.2
   
Form of Distribution
. A distribution will be made in the following form:
Notwithstanding the above, if the Participant dies while he/she is receiving installments under Sec. 7.2.2(a), such installments will continue to his/her Beneficiary over the same period such benefits would have been paid to the Participant.
Any valid designation in effect under the Prior Plan will apply to this Plan unless and until changed by the Participant, or revoked upon marriage as provided in Sec. 8.2.2.
A Beneficiary designation will be automatically revoked upon marriage of a Participant unless the new Spouse was designated as the sole primary Beneficiary. Further, if a Spouse is designated as Beneficiary, such designation will be automatically revoked upon the divorce of the Participant and former Spouse.
A Participating Affiliate is not responsible for (and has no contractual obligation with respect to) benefits payable to a Participant who is or was employed with ADM or a Participating Affiliate. If a Participant is employed with two or more employers (ADM and a Participating Affiliate, or two or more Participating Affiliates, etc.), either concurrently or at different times, each will be responsible for the benefit attributable to Elective Deferral Credits and Company Matching Credits made while the Participant was employed with that employer, adjusted for Earnings Credits.
Notwithstanding the contractual obligation, no Participant or Beneficiary entitled to benefits under this Plan has any right, title or claim in or to any specific assets of ADM or any Participating Affiliate, but instead has the right of a general creditor of such employer.
The assets of any rabbi trust hereby established will not be held or transferred outside of the United States, and the trust will not have any other feature that would result in a transfer of property being deemed to have occurred under Code  409A (for example, there will be no funding obligation or restrictions on assets in connection with a change in financial health of ADM or any Affiliate).
A Participant will have the right to enforce the funding obligation imposed hereunder;
provided that,
in the case of a funding obligation that arises as a result of a Potential Change in Control, a Participant will have the right to enforce the funding obligation only if the Participants have first followed the procedures specified in Sec. 2.1.18 and there has been no timely opinion letter of a nationally or regionally recognized law firm delivered to the Participants that a Potential Change in Control has not occurred for purposes of the Plan.
The Benefit Plans Committee or Chief Executive Officer acts on behalf ADM in its corporate capacity in connection with any amendment to the Plan.
Where action is to be taken by the ADM Board of Directors (or its Compensation Committee) under the Plan, such action is taken in a corporate capacity (and not as administrator) with respect to the Plan.
The arbitrator(s) may award reasonable fees and expenses to the prevailing party in any dispute hereunder and will award reasonable fees and expenses in the event that the arbitrator(s) find that the losing party acted in bad faith or with intent to harass, hinder or delay the prevailing party in the exercise of its rights in connection with the matter under dispute.

The ADM Board of Directors (or its Compensation Committee), or the ADM Chief Executive Officer (in each case acting in a corporate capacity), in its/his/her sole and absolute discretion, may determine that an Employee described above will not be an Eligible Employee. However, the Plan is intended to cover only those Employees who are in
a select group of management or highly compensated employees within the meaning of ERISA  201(2), 301(a)(3) and 401(a)(1); and, accordingly, if any interpretation is issued by the Department of Labor that would exclude any Employee from satisfying that requirement, such Employee immediately will cease to be an Eligible Employee.
ADM will determine the Prior Plan Offset in any reasonable manner, taking into account any Treasury regulations or guidance with respect to amounts that are "grandfathered" under Code  409A. The Prior Plan Offset will not include any accrual under the Prior Plan that vests after December 31, 2004, and is thus covered by this Plan.
Whenever this document references an annuity that "would be" paid under the Prior Plan or Qualified Retirement Plan as of a given date, such annuity will be determined as if the Participant (or Spouse) had received (or started to receive) his/her benefit under the Prior Plan or Qualified Retirement as of the specified date, regardless of whether the benefit under such plan is actually paid then or at a later time.
Enrollment is required, and must be made in such manner and in accordance with such rules as may be prescribed for this purpose by ADM (including by means of a voice response or other electronic sy
stem under circumstances authorized by ADM).
A participant in the Prior Plan on December 31, 2004, must enroll for this Plan by December 31, 2004.
The first payment made under paragraph (a) will include a catch-up payment of all monthly payments that would have been made to the Participant (without any adjustment for interest or earnings) from the payment date under paragraph (b) (this adjustment applies only if the payment date under paragraph (a) is later than the payment date under paragraph (b).
A joint and survivor annuity will be payable only if the Participant has a surviving Spouse on the scheduled commencement date of the Supplemental Pension Benefit. If the Participant is not married on the scheduled commencement date (including if the Spouse predeceased the Participant or in the event of a divorce), the Supplemental Pension will be paid as a life annuity in accordance with paragraph (a).
A joint and survivor annuity will be the actuarial equivalent of the life annuity starting on the same date.
Actuarial equivalence for this purpose will be determined using
the following actuarial assumptions: Interest - six percent (6%) annual rate; Mortality - the mortality table prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service for purposes of Code  417(e) (as specified in Revenue Ruling 2001-62 or as specified in any subsequent ruling, regulation, or other guidance of general applicability that supercedes Revenue Ruling 2001-62 for distributions with an annuity starting date on or after the earliest available date thereunder).
Present value for this purpose will be determined
using
the following actuarial assumptions: Interest - the annual rate of interest prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service for purposes of Code  417(e), with the interest rate prescribed for October applying with respect to any payment date during the next Plan Year; Mortality - the mortality table prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service for purposes of Code  417(e) (as specified in Revenue Ruling 2001-62 or as specified in any subsequent ruling, regulation, or other guidance of general applicability that supercedes Revenue Ruling 2001-62 for distributions with an annuity starting date on or after the earliest available date thereunder).
Present value for this purpose will be determined
using
the following actuarial assumptions: Interest - the annual rate of interest prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service for purposes of Code  417(e), with the interest rate prescribed for October applying with respect to any payment date during the next Plan Year; Mortality - the mortality table prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service for purposes of Code  417(e) (as specified in Revenue Ruling 2001-62 or as specified in any subsequent ruling, regulation, or other guidance of general applicability that supercedes Revenue Ruling 2001-62 for distributions with an annuity starting date on or after the earliest available date thereunder).
A Participating Affiliate is not responsible for (and has no contractual obligation with respect to) benefits payable to a Participant who is or was employed with ADM or a Participating Affiliate. If a Participant is employed with two or more employers (ADM and a Participating Affiliate, or two or more Participating Affiliates, etc.), either concurrently or at different times, each will be responsible for the benefit attributable to the period of service with such employer.
Notwithstanding the contractual obligation, no Participant or Spouse entitled to benefits under this Plan has any right, title or claim in or to any specific assets of ADM or any Participating Affiliate, but instead has the right of a general creditor of such employer.
Any rabbi trust used to fund benefits payable under this Plan may be used to fund benefits payable under any other non-qualified deferred compensation plan maintained by ADM or any Participating Affiliate.
The assets of any rabbi trust hereby established will not be held or transferred outside of the United States, and the trust will not have any other feature that would result in a transfer of property being deemed to have occurred under Code  409A (for example, there will be no funding obligation or restri
ctions on assets in connection with a change in financial health of ADM or any Affiliate).
The Benefit Plans Committee or Chief Executive Officer acts on behalf ADM in its corporate capacity in connection with any amendment to the Plan.
Where action is to be taken by the ADM Board of Directors (or its Compensation Committee) under the Plan, such action is taken in a corporate capacity (and not as administrator) with respect to the Plan.
 
The arbitrator(s) may award reasonable fees and expenses to the prevailing party in any dispute hereunder and will award reasonable fees and expenses in the event that the arbitrator(s) find that the losing party acted in bad faith or with intent to harass, hinder or delay the prevailing party in the exercise of its rights in connection with the matter under dispute.

Introduction
The Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Stock Unit Plan for Nonemployee Directors is intended to promote the interests of the Company and its Stockholders by paying part or all of the compensation of the Company's nonemployee directors in the form of an economic equivalent of an equity interest in the Company, thereby providing appropriate incentives and rewards to encourage nonemployee directors to take a long-term outlook when formulating policy applicable to the Company and encouraging them to remain on the Board. In general, the Plan provides for the conversion of at least 50 percent and up to 100 percent of a nonemployee director's fees for each calendar year into units of measurement relating to the value of the Company's common stock, and for payment t o the director of the value of such units on the earlier of (a) the passage of five full calendar years or (b) upon termination from service on the Board (in either case, subject to deferral of the payment date by the nonemployee director in accordance with the terms of the Plan). A nonemployee director will thus normally receive payment under the Plan each successive year in respect of the fees originally converted into units in the year preceding the fifth calendar year prior to the year of payment. A nonemployee director will participate in the Plan for all periods of service on the Board following the effective date of the Plan, notwithstanding any future payments to the director of any part of his interest under the Plan.
The original Plan was approved by the Stockholders of the Company at its 1996 Annual Meeting and become effective on January 1, 1997. In July 1997, the Board of Directors amended the original Plan by increasing the minimum portion of the nonemployee directors' fees to be converted into units from 25 percent to 50 percent. The Plan was further amended in October 2001 to permit nonemployee directors to defer payment under the Plan in certain circumstances and again in December 2003 to provide nonemployee directors with additional flexibility in electing to defer payment under the Plan. Most recently, the Plan was amended effective January 1, 2005 to comply with Section 409A of the Code, which was added by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.

Discussion of Operations
Net earnings for the quarter ended December 31, 2004 were $ 314 million, or $ .48 per share, compared to $ 221 million, or $ .34 per share, last year. Net earnings for the six months ended December 31, 2004 were $ 580 million, or $ .89 per share, compared to $ 371 million, or $ .57 per share, last year. This year's results for the quarter and six months ended December 31, 2004 include an after-tax gain of $ 45 million, or $ .07 per share, representing the Company's equity share of the gain reported by its unconsolidated affiliate, CIP, upon the sale of its interest in Tate & Lyle. Last year's results for the quarter and six months included an asset abandonment charge of $ 29 million ($ 18 million after tax, equal to $ .03 per share).
Segment Operating profit declined $ 10 million to $ 485 million for the quarter but increased $ 32 million to $ 823 million for the six months.
Oilseed Processing operating profit for the quarter of $ 119 million declined slightly from $ 121 million last year as improved operating results in Europe and Asia were offset by decreased operating results in our North and South American operations. For the six months, Oilseed Processing operating profit increased to $ 210 million from $ 189 million last year as improved European operating results were partially offset by a decline in North American, South American and Asian operating earnings.
Corn Processing operating profit declined $ 40 million to $ 132 million for the quarter and declined $ 44 million to $ 235 million for the six months due principally to higher net corn and energy costs as compared to last year. However, as net corn costs in fiscal 2005 continue to decline, second quarter Corn Processing operating profits increased 28% over first quarter levels. Sweetener and Starches earnings declined $ 31 million to $ 45 million for the quarter and declined $65 million to $ 100 million for the six months due principally to higher net corn and energy costs. For the quarter, Bioproducts operating profits declined $ 9 million to $ 87 million as the effect of higher net corn and energy costs, lower ethanol sales volumes and lower lysine selling prices more than offset the positive impact of higher ethan ol selling prices. For the six months, Bioproducts operating profits increased $ 21 million to $ 135 million due principally to higher ethanol selling prices.
Agricultural Services operating profit decreased $ 18 million to $ 88 million for the quarter and decreased $ 10 million to $ 139 million for the six months as improvements in North American origination and transportation operating results were more than offset by a decline from the prior year's strong global grain merchandising results.
Other segment operating profit increased to $ 146 million from $ 96 million for the quarter and increased to $ 239 million from $ 174 million for the six months due principally to improved Financial operating results. Food and Feed Ingredient earnings of $ 71 million for the quarter were comparable to last year. Earnings of Food and Feed Ingredients increased to $ 160 million for the six months due principally to improved operating results of our Cocoa operations and improved earnings of GRUMA. Financial operations increased to $ 75 million for the quarter and $ 79 million for the six months primarily due to improved results of our private equity fund investments and captive insurance operations.
Corporate improved by $ 145 million for the quarter and $ 271 million for the six months primarily due to the Company's $45 million equity share of the gain reported by CIP upon the sale of its Tate & Lyle interest in this year's second quarter and the positive impact of $ 72 million for the quarter and $ 196 million for the six months from the effect of declining commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuations. In addition, last year's quarter and six months included an abandonment charge of $ 14 million.

Discussion of Operations
 
Net earnings for the quarter ended March 31, 2005 were $ 269 million, or $ .41 per share, compared to $ 227 million, or $ .35 per share, last year. Net earnings for the nine months ended March 31, 2005 were $ 849 million, or $ 1.29 per share, compared to $ 598 million, or $ .92 per share, last year. This years results for the quarter and nine months include a gain of $ 114 million ($ 74 million after tax, equal to $ .11 per share) from the sale of the Companys direct share interest in Tate & Lyle. This years results for the nine months also include an after tax gain of $ 45 million ($.07 per share) representing the Companys equity share of the gain reported in the second quarter by its unconsolidated affiliate, CIP, upon the sale of its interest in Tate & Lyle. Last years results for the quarter and nine months included asset abandonment charges of $ 12 million ($ 8 million after tax, equal to $ .01 per share) and $ 41 million ($ 26 million after tax, equal to $ .04 per share) respectively. Last years results for the quarter and nine months also included a $ 21 million ($ 13 million after tax, equal to $ .02 per share) gain from an insurance-related lawsuit pertaining to the flood of 1993 and an $ 11 million ($ 7 million after tax, equal to $ .01 per share) gain on securities transactions. 
 
Segment Operating profit declined $125 million to $ 377 million for the quarter and declined $ 93 million to $1.2 billion for the nine months.
 
Oilseeds Processing operating profit declined $ 57 million to $ 61 million for the quarter and declined $ 35 million to $ 271 million for the nine months as improved operating results in Europe were offset by decreased operating results in North American and Asian operations. Operating results in South America improved for the quarter but lagged prior year results for the nine months.
 
Corn Processing operating profit declined $ 54 million to $ 178 million for the quarter and declined $ 98 million to $ 413 million for the nine months due principally to higher energy costs and reduced lysine selling prices as compared to last year. In addition, higher average net corn costs negatively impacted the nine month comparison. However, as net corn costs in fiscal 2005 continue to decline, third quarter Corn Processing operating profits increased 35% over second quarter levels. Sweetener and Starches earnings declined $ 12 million to $ 80 million for the quarter due principally to higher energy costs and declined $ 77 million to $ 179 million for the nine months due principally to higher average net corn and energy costs. For the quarter, Bioproducts operating profits declined $ 42 million to $ 98 million as the effect of higher energy costs, lower ethanol sales volumes and lower lysine selling prices more than offset the positive impact of higher ethanol selling prices and lower net corn costs. For the nine months, Bioproducts operating profits decreased $ 21 million to $ 233 million due principally to higher average net corn and energy costs, lower ethanol sales volumes and lower lysine selling prices partially offset by the higher ethanol selling prices.
 
Agricultural Services operating profit of $ 55 million for the quarter and $194 million for the nine months were down slightly from last year levels as improvements in North American origination and transportation operating results were offset by a decline from the prior years strong global grain merchandising results.
 
Other segment operating profit decreased to $ 83 million from $ 97 million for the quarter and increased to $ 322 million from $ 271 million for the nine months. Food and Feed Ingredient earnings of $ 44 million for the quarter declined from prior year levels due principally to reduced results from Cocoa and Natural Health and Nutrition operations. Earnings of Food and Feed Ingredients of $ 204 million for the nine months were comparable to last year. Financial operations increased to $ 40 million for the quarter and $ 119 million for the nine months primarily due to improved results of private equity fund investments. In addition, results of the captive insurance operations improved in the nine month period.

Corporate results for the quarter improved $ 195 million to a profit of $ 32 million from a loss of $ 163 million last year. For the nine months, Corporate results improved $ 466 million to a profit of $ 49 million from a loss of $ 417 million last year. These improvements were related to the current year gains of $ 114 million for the quarter and $ 159 million for the nine months related to the sale of the Companys Tate & Lyle interests. In addition, changing commodity price levels had no impact on LIFO inventory valuation for the current year quarter but rising prices resulted in a $ 99 million LIFO charge last year. For the nine months, declining commodity price levels this year resulted in LIFO income of $ 135 million compared to a LIFO charge of $ 160 million for the nine months last year due to rising price levels.

Segment operating profit increased $ 83 million to $ 351 million for the quarter and declined $ 10 million to $ 1.551 billion for the year as operating profit improvements were realized in all major segments except the Corn Processing segment.
Oilseeds Processing operating profit increased $ 89 million to $ 74 million for the quarter and increased $ 54 million to $ 345 million for the year due to improved operating results in Europe, South America and Asia.

Last years results included abandonment losses of $1 million for the quarter and $4 million for the year.
Corn Processing operating profit declined $ 33 million to $ 117 million for the quarter and declined $ 131 million to $ 530 million for the year due principally to lower lysine selling prices and higher energy costs as compared to last year. Sweeteners and Starches operating profit increased $ 30 million to $ 92 million for the quarter due to higher sweetener and starch volumes and lower net corn costs partially offset by increased energy costs. For the year, Sweetener and Starch operating profit declined $ 47 million to $ 271 million as higher sweetener and starch selling prices were more than offset by increased energy and net corn costs. Last years fourth quarter and fiscal year results also included a $ 15 million gain from an insurance-related lawsuit. Bioproducts operating profit declined $ 63 million to $ 25 million for the quarter due to lower lysine selling prices and higher energy costs partially offset by lower net corn costs. For the year, Bioproducts operating profit declined $ 84 million to $ 259 million due to lower lysine selling prices and higher average net corn and energy costs. For the year, these declines were partially offset by higher ethanol selling prices. In addition, Bioproducts results for the fourth quarter and year include a charge for abandonment and write-down of long-lived assets of $ 16 million. Last years Bioproducts results included abandonment losses of $ 14 million for the year.
Agricultural Services operating profit increased by $ 23 million to $ 68 million for the quarter due principally to improved grain operations and transportation results.

Last years Agricultural Services results included abandonment losses of $ 5 million for the year.
Other segment operating profit increased $ 4 million to $ 92 million for the quarter and increased $ 55 million to $ 414 million for the year as both Food and Feed Ingredients and Financial operations showed improvements over last year. Food and Feed Ingredients operating profits of $ 60 million for the quarter and $ 264 million for the year were comparable to last year. In addition, Food and Feed Ingredients results include a charge for abandonment and write-down of long-lived assets of $11 million for the quarter and $13 million for the year.

News Release
     Paul B. Mulhollem, President and Chief Operating Officer, today announced his decision to retire from the Company, effective immediately. G. Allen Andreas, Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer of ADM, will temporarily assume the duties of President and COO.
     "Mr. Mulhollem's contributions to the Company in his various assignments over his years with ADM are significant," said Mr. Andreas. "Paul's insight and acumen will be missed. During his tenure, Paul worked closely with me in expanding our global reach and building a solid foundation for the continued growth and success of ADM. On both a personal and professional level, Paul's contributions are appreciated by all of us at ADM."
     "In retiring from ADM, I am leaving behind a great company and many friends and colleagues," said Mr. Mulhollem. "I wish them and the Company continued success in the future."
     The ADM Board of Directors announced plans to initiate a search for a new President to take on Mr. Mulhollem's responsibilities and also to assume the position of Chief Executive Officer as a successor for Mr. Andreas in his role as CEO. "With the full approval and support of the Board of Directors, Mr. Andreas has, for a period of time, been developing a succession plan for executive leadership at the Company," said O.G. Webb, Vice Chairman of ADM's Board. "This is a continuation of that process." At the Board's direction, Mr. Webb will chair a select committee of directors who will interview and engage an executive search firm to seek candidates from within and outside the Company for the position of President and CEO. Upon the selection of a new President and CEO, Mr. Andreas will be elected Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors.

     2. .

Purchase and Sale
     If so provided in Schedule I hereto, the Underwriters are authorized to solicit offers to purchase Securities from the Company pursuant to delayed delivery contracts ("Delayed Delivery Contracts"), substantially in the form of Schedule III hereto but with such changes therein as the Company may authorize or approve. The Underwriters will endeavor to make such arrangements and, as compensation therefor, the Company will pay to the Representatives, for the account of the Underwriters, on the Closing Date, the compensation set forth in Schedule I hereto with respect to Securities for which Delayed Delivery Contracts are made. Delayed Delivery Contracts are to be with institutional investors, including commercial and savings banks, insurance companies, pension funds, investment companies and educational and charitable institutions. The Company will make Delayed Delivery Contracts in all cases where sales of Contract Securities arranged by the Underwriters have been approved by the Company but, except as the Company may otherwise agree, each such Delayed Delivery Contract must be for not less than the minimum amount set forth in Schedule I hereto and the aggregate amount of Contract Securities may not exceed the maximum aggregate amount set forth in Schedule I hereto. The Underwriters will not have any responsibility in respect of the validity or performance of Delayed Delivery Contracts. The amount of Securities to be purchased by each Underwriter as set forth in Schedule II hereto shall be reduced by an amount which shall bear the same proportion to the total amount of Contract Securities as the amount of Securities set forth opposite the name of such Underwriter bears to the aggregate amount set forth in Schedule II hereto, except to the extent that you determine that such reduction shall be otherwise than in such proportion and so advise the Company in writing; provided, however, that the total amount of Securities to be purchased by all Underwriters shall be the aggregate amount set forth in Schedule II hereto, less the aggregate amount of Contract Securities.
     3. Delivery of and payment for the Purchased Securities shall be made on the date and at the time specified in Schedule I hereto or at such time on such later date not more than three Business Days after the foregoing date as the Representatives shall designate, which date and time may be postponed by agreement between the Representatives and the Company or as provided in Section 9 hereof (such date and time of delivery and payment for the Securities being herein called the "Closing Date"). Delivery of the Purchased Securities shall be made to the Representatives for the respective accounts of the several Underwriters against payment by the several Underwriters through the Representatives of the purchase price thereof to or upon the order of the Company by wire transfer payable in same-day funds to an account specified by the Company. Delivery of the Purchased Securities shall be made through the facilities of The Depository Trust Company unless the Representatives shall otherwise instruct.
Delivery and Payment.
 
     4.  It is understood that the several Underwriters propose to offer the Securities for sale to the public as set forth in the Final Prospectus.
Offering by Underwriters
.
     5. The Company agrees with the several Underwriters that:
Agreements.
     (a) The Company will use its best efforts to cause the Registration Statement, if not effective at the Execution Time, and any amendment thereof, to become effective. Prior to the termination of the offering of the Securities, the Company will not file any amendment of the Registration Statement or supplement (including the Final Prospectus or any Preliminary Final Prospectus) to the Basic Prospectus or any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement unless the Company has furnished you a copy for your review prior to filing and will not file any such proposed amendment or supplement to which you reasonably object. Subject to the foregoing sentence, if the Registration Statement has become or becomes effective pursuant to Rule 430A, or filing of the Final Prospectus is otherwise required under Rule 424(b), the Company will cause the Final Prospectus, properly completed, and any supplement thereto to be filed in a form approved by the Representatives with the Commission pursuant to the applicable paragraph of Rule 424(b) within the time period prescribed and will provide evidence satisfactory to the Representatives of such timely filing. The Company will promptly advise the Representatives (1) when the Registration Statement, if not effective at the Execution Time, shall have become effective, (2) when the Final Prospectus, and any supplement thereto, shall have been filed (if required) with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) or when any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement shall have been filed with the Commission, (3) when, prior to termination of the offering of the Securities, any amendment to the Registration Statement shall have been filed or become effective, (4) of any request by the Commission or its staff for any amendment of the Registration Statement, or any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement, or for any supplement to the Final Prospectus or for any additional information, (5) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for that purpose and (6) of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Securities for sale in any jurisdiction or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose. The Company will use its best efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order or the suspension of any such qualification and, if issued, to obtain as soon as possible the withdrawal thereof.
     (b) If, at any time when a prospectus relating to the Securities is required to be delivered under the Act, any event occurs as a result of which the Final Prospectus as then supplemented would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading, or if it shall be necessary to amend the Registration Statement or supplement the Final Prospectus to comply with the Act or the Exchange Act or the respective rules thereunder, the Company promptly will (1) notify the Representatives of such event, (2) prepare and file with the Commission, subject to the second sentence of paragraph (a) of this Section 5, an amendment or supplement which will correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance and (3) supply any supplemented Final Prospectus to you in such quantities as you may reasonably request.
 
     (c) As soon as practicable, the Company will make generally available to its security holders and to the Representatives an earnings statement or statements of the Company and its subsidiaries which will satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Act and Rule 158 under the Act.
     (d) The Company will furnish to the Representatives and counsel for the Underwriters, without charge, copies of the Registration Statement (including exhibits thereto) and each amendment thereto which shall become effective on or prior to the Closing Date and, so long as delivery of a prospectus by an Underwriter or dealer may be required by the Act, as many copies of any Preliminary Final Prospectus and the Final Prospectus and any amendments thereof and supplements thereto as the Representatives may reasonably request. The Company will pay or cause to be paid the following: (i) the fees, disbursements and expenses of the Company's counsel and accountants in connection with the registration of the Securities under the Act and all other expenses in connection with the preparation, printing and filing of the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus and the Final Prospectus and amendments thereof and supplements thereto and the mailing and delivering of copies thereof to the Underwriters and dealers; (ii) the expenses of printing all documents relating to the offering (other than any agreement among Underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities); (iii) all expenses in connection with the qualification of the Securities for offering and sale under state securities laws as provided in Section 5(e) hereof, including the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Underwriters in connection with such qualification and in connection with the Blue Sky and legal investment surveys; (iv) any fees charged by securities rating agencies for rating the Securities; (v) the cost of preparing the Securities; (vi) the fees and expenses of the Trustee and the Warrant Agent and any agent thereof and the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Trustee and the Warrant Agent in connection with this Agreement, the Indenture, the Warrant Agreement and the Securities; and (vii) all other costs and expenses incident to the performance of its obligations hereunder which are not otherwise specifically provided for in this Section. It is understood, however, that, except as provided in this Section, Section 7 and Section 8 hereof, the Underwriters will pay all of their own costs and expenses, including the fees and disbursements of their counsel, transfer taxes on resale of any of the Securities by them, and any advertising expenses connected with any offers they may make.
     (e) The Company will arrange for the qualification of the Securities for sale under the laws of such states as the Representatives may designate, will maintain such qualifications in effect so long as required for the distribution of the Securities and will arrange for the determination of the legality of the Securities for purchase by institutional investors; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not now so qualified or to take any action which would subject it to general or unlimited service of process in any jurisdiction where it is not now so subject.
     (f) The Company will use its best efforts to list the Securities on the stock exchange, if any, set forth in Schedule I hereto.
     (g) The Company will not, without the prior written consent of the Representatives, offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge, or otherwise dispose of, (or enter into any transaction which is
 
designed to, or might reasonably be expected to, result in the disposition (whether by actual disposition or effective economic disposition due to cash settlement or otherwise) by the Company or any affiliate of the Company or any person in privity with the Company or any affiliate of the Company) directly or indirectly, including the filing (or participation in the filing) of a registration statement with the Commission in respect of, or establish or increase a put equivalent position or liquidate or decrease a call equivalent position within the meaning of Section 16 of the Exchange Act, any debt securities issued or guaranteed by the Company (other than the Securities and any debt securities that mature within one year of their date of issue) or publicly announce an intention to effect any such transaction, until the Business Day set forth on Schedule I hereto.
     (h) The Company will not take, directly or indirectly, any action designed to or that would constitute, under the Exchange Act or otherwise, stabilization or manipulation of the price of any security of the Company to facilitate the sale or resale of the Securities.
     6. The obligations of the Underwriters to purchase the Purchased Securities shall be subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties on the part of the Company contained herein as of the date hereof, as of the date of the effectiveness of any amendment to the Registration Statement filed prior to the Closing Date (including the filing of any document incorporated therein by reference) and as of the Closing Date, to the accuracy of the statements of the Company made in any certificates pursuant to the provisions hereof, to the performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder and to the following additional conditions:

     (ix) to the best knowledge of such counsel, there is no pending or threatened action, suit or proceeding before any court or governmental agency, authority or body or any arbitrator involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries, of a character required to be disclosed in the Registration Statement which is not adequately disclosed in the Final Prospectus, and there is no franchise, contract or other document of a character required to be described in the Registration Statement or Final Prospectus or to be filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement which is not described or filed as required;

stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or that the Final Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, (except as aforesaid) includes any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
     (xi) no consent, approval, authorization or order of any court or governmental agency or body is required for the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein or in any Warrant Agreement or in any Delayed Delivery Contract, except such as have been obtained under the Act and such as may be required under state securities laws in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Securities by the Underwriters and such other approvals (specified in such opinion) as have been obtained; and

     In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely (A) as to matters involving the application of laws of any jurisdiction other than the States of Minnesota or with respect to its corporation law, Delaware, or the United States, to the extent deemed proper and specified in such opinion, upon the opinion of other counsel of good standing believed to be reliable and who are satisfactory to counsel for the Underwriters; and (B) as to factual matters, to the extent deemed proper, on certificates of responsible officers of the Company and its subsidiaries and public officials.
     (c) Stuart E. Funderburg, Esq., Corporate Counsel of the Company, shall have furnished to the Representatives his written opinion, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that:
     (i) the Company has been duly organized and is validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware; the Company has full corporate power and authority to conduct its business as described in the Final Prospectus;
     (ii) the Company is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in every jurisdiction where, in light of the nature of the business transacted or the property owned by it, such qualification is necessary and the failure so to qualify might permanently impair title to property material to its operations or its right to enforce a material contract against others or expose it to substantial liabilities in such jurisdictions;
     (iii) he has no reason to believe that either the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof, at the time it became effective (except that he need express no opinion as to the financial statements and other financial and statistical information
 
included therein or incorporated therein by reference) contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or that the Final Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, (except as aforesaid) includes any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
     (iv) the descriptions in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus of statutes, legal and governmental investigations and proceedings, contracts and other documents are accurate and fairly present the information required to be shown; and he does not know of any statute or legal or pending or threatened governmental investigation or proceeding required to be described in the Final Prospectus which is not described as required, or of any franchise, contract or other document of a character required to be described in the Registration Statement or Final Prospectus or to be filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement which is not described or filed as required; and
     (v) no holders of securities of the Company have rights to the registration of such securities under the Registration Statement.
     In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely (A) as to matters involving the application of laws of any jurisdiction other than the States of Illinois or, with respect to its corporation law, Delaware, or the United States, to the extent deemed proper and specified in such opinion, upon the opinion of other counsel of good standing believed to be reliable and who are satisfactory to counsel for the Agent and (B) as to matters of fact, to the extent deemed proper, on certificates of responsible officers of the Company and public officials. References to the Prospectus in this paragraph (c) include any supplements thereto at the date such opinion is rendered.
     (d) The Representatives shall have received from Mayer, Brown, Rowe & Maw LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, such opinion or opinions, dated the Closing Date, with respect to the issuance and sale of the Securities, this Agreement, the Indenture, any Warrant Agreement, any Delayed Delivery Contracts, the Registration Statement, the Final Prospectus and other related matters as the Representatives may reasonably require, and the Company shall have furnished to such counsel such documents as they request for the purpose of enabling them to pass upon such matters.
     (e) The Company shall have furnished to the Representatives a certificate of the Company, signed by the Chairman of the Board, the President or any Vice President and the principal financial or accounting officer of the Company, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that the signers of such certificate have carefully examined the Registration Statement, the Final Prospectus, any supplements to the Final Prospectus and this Agreement and that to the best of their knowledge:
     (i) the representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement are true and correct in all material respects on and as of the Closing Date with the same effect as if made on the Closing Date and the Company has complied with all the agreements and
 
satisfied all the conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied at or prior to the Closing Date;
     (ii) no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, as amended, has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or, to their knowledge, threatened; and
     (iii) since the date of the most recent financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto), there has been no Material Adverse Change, except as set forth or contemplated in the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto).
     (f) At the Closing Date, Ernst & Young L.L.P. shall have furnished to the Representatives a letter or letters (which may refer to letters previously delivered to the Representatives), dated as of the Closing Date, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, confirming that they are independent accountants within the meaning of the Act and the Exchange Act and the respective applicable published rules and regulations thereunder and stating in effect that:
     (i) in their opinion the audited financial statements, financial statement schedules and pro forma financial statements, if any, included or incorporated in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus and reported on by them comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the Exchange Act, as applicable. and the published rules and regulations thereunder;
     (ii) on the basis of a reading of the latest unaudited financial statements made available by the Company and its subsidiaries; their limited review in accordance with standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants of the unaudited interim financial information as indicated in their reports incorporated in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus; carrying out certain specified procedures (but not an examination in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards) which would not necessarily reveal matters of significance with respect to the comments set forth in such letter; a reading of the minutes of the meetings of the stockholders, directors and the Audit, Salary (Compensation), and Nominating committees of the Company since the end of the most recent fiscal year for which audited financial statements have been included or incorporated in the Registration Statement; and inquiries of certain officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters of the Company as to transactions and events subsequent to the date of the most recent audited financial statements included or incorporated in the Final Prospectus, nothing came to their attention which caused them to believe that:
     (1) any unaudited financial statements included or incorporated in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus do not comply as to form in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules and regulations of the Commission with respect to financial statements included or incorporated in quarterly reports on Form 10-Q under the Exchange
 
Act; and said unaudited financial statements are not in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a basis substantially consistent with that of the audited financial statements included or incorporated in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus;
     (2) with respect to the period subsequent to the date of the most recent financial statements (other than any capsule information), audited or unaudited, included or incorporated in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus, there were any changes, at a specified date not more than three Business Days prior to the date of the letter, in the capital stock of the Company or any net increase in short-term debt or long-term liabilities of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries or any decreases in net current assets or shareholders' equity of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries as compared with the amounts shown on the most recent consolidated balance sheet included or incorporated in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus; or for the period from the date of the most recent financial statements included or incorporated in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus to such specified date there were any decreases, as compared with the corresponding period in the preceding year, in consolidated earnings before income taxes or in the total or per share amounts of earnings of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries, except in all instances for changes or decreases set forth in such letter, in which case the letter shall be accompanied by an explanation by the Company as to the significance thereof unless said explanation is not deemed necessary by the Representatives; or
     (3) the amounts included in any unaudited "capsule" information included or incorporated in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus do not agree with the amounts set forth in the unaudited financial statements for the same periods or were not determined on a basis substantially consistent with that of the corresponding amounts in the audited financial statements included or incorporated in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or do not conform with generally accepted accounting principles;
     (iii) they have performed certain other specified procedures as a result of which they determined that certain information of an accounting, financial or statistical nature (which is limited to accounting, financial or statistical information derived from the general accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries) set forth in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus and in Exhibit 12 to the Registration Statement, including the information included or incorporated in Items 1, 2, 6, 7 and 11 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, incorporated in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus, and the information included in the "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" included or incorporated in the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, incorporated in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus, agrees with the accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries, excluding any questions of legal interpretation; and
 
     (iv) if unaudited pro forma financial statements are included or incorporated in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus, on the basis of a reading of the unaudited pro forma financial statements, carrying out certain specified procedures, inquiries of certain officials of the Company and the acquired company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters, and proving the arithmetic accuracy of the application of the pro forma adjustments to the historical amounts in the pro forma financial statements, nothing came to their attention which caused them to believe that the pro forma financial statements do not comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of Rule 11-02 of Regulation S-X or that the pro forma adjustments have not been properly applied to the historical amounts in the compilation of such statements.
     References to the Final Prospectus in this paragraph (f) include any supplement thereto at the date of the letter.
     Such letter or letters, dated as of the Closing Date, of Ernst & Young L.L.P. shall appropriately reflect (x) the inclusion in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus of any additional financial or statistical information, including any financial or statistical information dated subsequent to the issue date of the Final Prospectus, and (y) the incorporation by reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus of any document incorporated therein by reference pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 filed under the Exchange Act, including any such document filed by the Company with the Commission on a date subsequent to the issue date of the Final Prospectus. In addition, at the time this Agreement is executed, Ernst & Young L.L.P. shall have furnished to the Representatives a letter or letters, dated the date of this Agreement, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Representatives, to the effect set forth in Schedule I hereto.
     (g) Subsequent to the Execution Time or, if earlier, the dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement (exclusive of any amendment thereof) and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto), there shall not have been (i) any change or decrease specified in the letter or letters referred to in paragraph (f) of this Section 6 or (ii) any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the condition (financial or otherwise), earnings, business or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto) the effect of which, in any case referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above, is, in the sole judgment of the Representatives, so material and adverse as to make it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Registration Statement (exclusive of any amendment thereof) and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto).
     (h) Subsequent to the Execution Time, there shall not have been any decrease in the rating of any of the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as defined for purposes of Rule 436(g) under the Act) and no such organization
 
shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the Company's debt securities.
     (i) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall have furnished to the Representatives such further information, certificates and documents as the Representatives may reasonably request.
     (i) The Company shall have accepted Delayed Delivery Contracts in any case where sales of Contract Securities arranged by the Underwriters have been approved by the Company.
     If any of the conditions specified in this Section 6 shall not have been fulfilled in all material respects when and as provided in this Agreement, or if any of the opinions and certificates mentioned above or elsewhere in this Agreement shall not be in all material respects reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Representatives and counsel for the Underwriters, this Agreement and all obligations of the Underwriters hereunder may be canceled by the Representatives at, or at any time prior to, the Closing Date. Notice of such cancellation shall be given to the Company in writing or by telephone or telegraph confirmed in writing.
     7. If the sale of the Securities provided for herein is not consummated because any condition to the obligations of the Underwriters set forth in Section 6 hereof is not satisfied, because of any termination pursuant to Section 10(i)(with respect to a suspension in the trading of the Company's common stock only) hereof or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof other than by reason of a default by any of the Underwriters, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters severally through the Representatives on demand for all out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) that shall have been reasonably incurred by them in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of the Securities.
Reimbursement of Underwriters' Expenses.
     8. (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the registration statement for the registration of the Securities as originally filed, or in any amendment thereof, or in the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that (i) the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged
Indemnification and Contribution.
 
untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for use therein, and (ii) such indemnity with respect to the Basic Prospectus or any Preliminary Final Prospectus shall not inure to the benefit of any Underwriter (or any person controlling such Underwriter) from whom the person asserting any such loss, claim, damage or liability purchased the Securities which are the subject thereof if such person did not receive a copy of the Final Prospectus (or the Final Prospectus as amended or supplemented) excluding documents incorporated therein by reference at or prior to the confirmation of the sale of such Securities to such person in any case where such delivery is required by the Act and the untrue statement or omission of a material fact contained in the Basic Prospectus or any Preliminary Final Prospectus was corrected in the Final Prospectus (or the Final Prospectus as amended or supplemented). This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
     (b) Each Underwriter severally agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for use in the preparation of the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have. The Company acknowledges that the following statements set forth under the heading "Underwriting" in any Preliminary Final Prospectus and the Final Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus: (i) the list of Underwriters and their respective participation in the sale of the Securities, (ii) the sentences related to concessions and reallowances and (iii) the paragraph related to stabilization and over-allotment transactions.
     (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such Indemnified Party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 8. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it may elect by written notice delivered to the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party; provided, however, that if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to assert such legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties. Upon receipt of
 
notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense of such action and approval by the indemnified party of counsel, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 8 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof unless (i) the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in connection with the assertion of legal defenses in accordance with the proviso to the next preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel, approved by the Representatives in the case of subparagraph (a), representing the indemnified parties under subparagraph (a) who are parties to such action), (ii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of commencement of the action or (iii) the indemnifying party has authorized the employment of counsel for the indemnified party at the expense of the indemnifying party; and except that, if clause (i) or (iii) is applicable, such liability shall be only in respect of the counsel referred to in such clause (i) or (iii).
     (d) In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnification provided for in paragraph (a) of this Section 8 is due in accordance with its terms but is for any reason held by a court to be unavailable from the Company on grounds of policy or otherwise, the Company and the Underwriters shall contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) to which the Company and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion so that the Underwriters are responsible for that portion represented by the percentage that the underwriting discount bears to the sum of such discount and the purchase price of the Securities specified in Schedule I hereto and the Company is responsible for the balance; provided, however, that (y) in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among Underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder and (z) no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 8, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of the Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to clause (y) of this paragraph (d). Any party entitled to contribution will, promptly after receipt of notice of the commencement of any action against such party in respect of which a claim for contribution may be made against another party or parties under this paragraph (d), notify such party or parties from whom contribution may be sought, but the omission to so notify such party or parties shall not relieve the party or parties from whom contribution may be sought from any other obligation it or they may have otherwise than under this paragraph (d).
     9. If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters
Default by an Underwriter.
 
hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the amount of Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule II hereto bear to the aggregate amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; provided, however, that in the event that the amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate amount of Securities set forth in Schedule I hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such non-defaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 9, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding seven days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company and to any non-defaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.
     10. . This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the Securities, if at any time prior to such time (i) trading in the Company's Common Stock shall have been suspended by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange or trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been established on such Exchange, (ii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared either by Federal or New York State authorities or a material disruption shall have occurred in securities settlement, payment or clearance services in the United States or (iii) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war, or other calamity or crisis the effect of which on the financial markets is such as to make it, in the judgment of the Representatives, impracticable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto)
Termination

     11. The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or the Company or any of the officers, directors or controlling persons referred to in Section 8 hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.

No purchaser of any of the Securities from an Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.

     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
Table of Contents

 
Exhibit 10
     THIS AGREEMENT ("Agreement") is made as of the 29 day of September, 2005, by and between Paul B. Mulhollem ("Mulhollem") and Archer-Daniels-Midland Company, a Delaware corporation ("ADM").
th
     WHEREAS, Mulhollem has been employed by ADM in the capacity of President and Chief Operating Officer; and
     WHEREAS, Mulhollem and ADM desire to effect an amicable separation of employment, without litigation or controversy, in light of Mulhollem's September 15, 2005 retirement from ADM.
     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises and mutual covenants contained herein, it is agreed as follows:
     1. Upon his retirement, Mulhollem became entitled to certain benefits as set forth in this paragraph 1. These benefits are subject to Mulhollem remaining retired (within the meaning of the ADM Retirement Plan as in effect on the date hereof) and may be forfeited if he ceases to be retired (other than with respect to his consultation and cooperation obligations to ADM set forth herein), and are composed of the following:
a. The restricted stock granted to Mulhollem in the Restricted Stock Award Agreements dated August 8, 2005 and August 19, 2004 will continue to vest according to the terms of those agreements. Mulhollem's separation from ADM shall conclusively be deemed to be pursuant to "Retirement," as such term is used in the various stock award and stock option agreements which Mulhollem participates in. Mulhollem is entitled to exercise all vested stock options according to the terms of the applicable stock option agreements between him and ADM;
 
b. Mulhollem is permitted to roll over all amounts in his 401(k)/ESOP account into a self directed IRA;
c. Mulhollem will receive all salary he has previously deferred pursuant to the ADM Deferred Compensation Plan(s) in accordance with the terms of such plan(s); and
d. Mulhollem is permitted to participate in any retiree benefit programs for which he is eligible.
     2. 
Non-competition, etc.
a. As ADM's President and Chief Operating Officer ("COO"), Mulhollem had direct access to and personal knowledge of ADM's most important proprietary business information including, but not limited to, business plans and strategies, financial information, trading and hedging strategies, and operational methods, plans and strategies. This information is proprietary to ADM and subject to reasonable efforts by ADM to secure its confidentiality. This proprietary information has significant value to ADM as it provides ADM with a strategic advantage over it competitors. Were this information provided to ADM's competitors, ADM would be irreparably harmed. ADM and Mulhollem agree that if Mulhollem were to work for one of ADM's competitors within the next three years, he would be unable to perform his duties without disclosing ADM's confidential and proprietary business information.
b. Consequently, without the prior written consent of ADM, which consent must be signed by the Chief Executive or President of ADM until September 15, 2008, Mulhollem shall not own any interest in, except the
 
ownership of stock in a publicly-traded company, take any employment with, or act as a director, officer, agent, consultant, advisor, independent contractor or in any other capacity whatsoever, directly or indirectly, with or to any person, corporation, partnership, limited liability company, firm, joint venture or any other form of entity, anywhere in the world, that competes with ADM or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates or provides the same goods or services as ADM or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates.
c. Mulhollem acknowledges that, in light of his responsibilities while employed as ADM's President and COO, the scope of these post-employment restrictions is reasonable and that if he were to come out of retirement, he would have ample job opportunities based upon his experience and education. Mulhollem further acknowledges that a violation of this paragraph 2 would cause irreparable damage to ADM and that in the event of a breach or threatened breach, hereof, ADM would be entitled to injunctive relief, without the posting of any bond, in addition to such other relief as may be appropriate at law or in equity.
d. For the period from the Effective Date of this Agreement through September 15, 2008, Mulhollem shall not hire or solicit for employment any employee on the payroll of ADM or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates.
     3. The Non-Disclosure Agreement between ADM and Mulhollem dated January 6, 1992, a copy of which is marked Exhibit A, attached hereto and by this reference incorporated herein, shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.
     4. In consideration of the post-employment restrictions placed on Mulhollem in this Agreement and the continuing application of the Non-Disclosure Agreement, ADM shall
 
provide Mulhollem the following valuable consideration to which he would not otherwise have been entitled:
a. ADM shall pay Mulhollem the cash value of the restricted stock granted to him under the terms of the October 14, 2003 Restricted Stock Award Agreement as provided for herein. The amount shall be determined by multiplying the number of shares of restricted stock by $23.16, the closing price for ADM's Common Stock on September 15, 2005. Payments shall be made as follows:
i.25% of the amount on the Effective Date of this Agreement; ii.25% of the amount on September 15, 2006, provided Mulhollem has fully complied with paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Agreement;
iii.25% of the amount on September 15, 2007, provided Mulhollem has fully complied with paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Agreement; and
iv.25% of the amount on September 15, 2008, provided Mulhollem has fully complied with paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Agreement.
b. ADM shall retain Mulhollem as a consultant for a three-year period from September 15, 2005 expiring September 15, 2008. Mulhollem shall perform such reasonable duties as he may be requested to perform by ADM's Chief Executive. ADM shall compensate Mulhollem by paying him $550,000 per year (payable monthly in arrears) for his consulting services provided Mulhollem has fully complied with paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Agreement.
 
     5. 
Release
a. Mulhollem hereby forever releases ADM, and its subsidiaries and affiliates and each of ADM's and its subsidiaries' and affilicates' officers, directors, representatives, shareholders, agents, employees, predecessors, successors and assigns (collectively "Releasees"), from any and all complaints, charges, claims, liabilities, demands, debts, accounts, obligations, promises, suits, actions, causes of action, demands in law or equity, including claims for damages, attorneys' fees or costs, whether known or unknown, which Mulhollem now has, or claims to have, or which Mulhollem at any time may have had, or claimed to have, or which Mulhollem at any time hereafter may have, or claim to have, arising at any time in the past to and including the date of this Agreement, including, but without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any matters relating in any way to Mulhollem's employment relationship with ADM or his retirement from ADM.

Discussion of Operations
 
Net earnings for the quarter ended September 30, 2005 were $ 186 million, equal to $ .29 per share, compared to $ 266 million, equal to $ .41 per share last year. Earnings for the quarter ended September 30, 2005 include an after-tax charge of $19 million, equal to $ .03 per share, as a result of the Companys recent adoption of Financial Accounting Standard Number 123 (revised 2004) requiring the acceleration of share-based compensation expense into this quarter relating to grants issued to retirement-eligible employees pursuant to the Companys Incentive Compensation Plan.
Segment operating profit for the quarter ended September 30, 2005 increased $ 12 million to $ 351 million as operating profit improvements were realized in all major segments except Agricultural Services.
Oilseeds Processing operating profit increased $ 8 million to $ 99 million for the quarter as improved South America, Europe and Asia operating results were partially offset by decreased operating results of our North America operations.
Corn Processing operating profit increased $ 33 million to $ 136 million for the quarter due principally to lower net corn costs partially offset by lower lysine selling prices and higher energy costs. Sweeteners and Starches results increased $ 37 million to $ 92 million for the quarter due principally to lower net corn costs partially offset by higher energy costs. Bioproducts results declined $ 4 million to $ 44 million for the quarter due primarily to lower lysine selling prices, lower citric acid operating results and higher energy costs partially offset by lower net corn costs and increased ethanol sales volumes.
Agricultural Services operating profits declined $ 31 million to $ 20 million for the quarter due to a decline in global grain merchandising results and the negative impact of hurricanes on North American origination and export operating results. These declines were partially offset by improved operating results of transportation operations.
Other segment operating earnings increased to $ 95 million from $ 93 million last year due to improved operating results of Financial operations partially offset by a decline in operating results of Food and Feed Ingredient operations. Financial operating results increased $ 22 million to $ 26 million for the quarter due principally to improved results of insurance operations. Food and Feed Ingredient results declined to $ 69 million from $ 89 million last year as operating results of the natural health and nutrition, cocoa, and wheat product lines declined from last years levels.
Significant components of Corporate results are as follows (in millions)

Discussion of Operations
Net earnings for the quarter ended December 31, 2005 were $ 368 million, or $ .56 per share, compared to $ 314 million, or $ .48 per share, last year. Net earnings for the six months ended December 31, 2005 were $ 554 million, or $ .85 per share, compared to $ 580 million, or $ .89 per share, last year. This years results for the quarter and six months ended December 31, 2005 include a $ 36 million tax credit related to the adjustment of state and federal income taxes, a $ 31 million ($ 19 million after tax) Food and Feed Ingredient asset impairment charge, and severance costs of $ 15 million related to a citric acid plant shut down. Net earnings for the quarter ended December 31, 2004 included a gain of $ 45 million representing the Companys equity share of the gain reported by the Companys unconsolidated affiliate, Compagnie Industrielle et Financiere des Produits Amylaces SA (CIP), upon the sale of its Tate & Lyle interest.
 
Segment operating profit increased $ 39 million to $ 524 million for the quarter and increased $ 51 million to $ 874 million for the six months.
 
Oilseeds Processing operating profit increased $ 9 million to $ 128 million for the quarter and increased $ 17 million to $ 227 million for the six months due principally to improved processing results in North America, South America and Europe. Operating results of Asia declined in the quarter and were slightly ahead of last years levels for the six months.
 
Corn Processing operating profit increased $ 105 million to $ 237 million for the quarter and increased $ 138 million to $ 373 million for the six months due primarily to lower net corn costs and, to a lesser extent, improved ethanol prices and volumes. These gains were partially offset by lower lysine selling prices and higher energy costs. Sweeteners & Starches operating profit increased $ 69 million to $ 114 million for the quarter and increased $ 107 million to $ 206 million for the six months due to lower net corn costs partially offset by higher energy costs. Bioproducts operating profit increased $ 35 million to $ 122 million for the quarter and increased $ 31 million to $ 166 million for the six months due to higher ethanol selling prices and volumes and lower net corn costs partially offset by lower lysine selling prices and $ 15 million of employee severance costs associated with the closure of a citric acid plant.
 
Agricultural Services operating profit increased $ 6 million to $ 94 million for the quarter due principally to improved operating results of transportation operations. For the six months, operating profit decreased $ 26 million to $ 114 million as improved results from transportation operations were more than offset by a decline in global grain merchandising results and the negative impact of the hurricanes on North American origination and export operating results.
 
Other segment operating profit decreased $ 80 million to $ 66 million for the quarter and decreased $ 78 million to $ 161 million for the six months due primarily to Food & Feed Ingredients impairment charges of $ 31 million and a $ 45 million decline in earnings of our private equity funds.

News Release
 
Archer Daniels Midland Company (NYSE: ADM), one of the worlds largest agricultural processors, today announced that Patricia A. Woertz has been selected as President, Chief Executive Officer and member of the Board of Directors, succeeding G. Allen Andreas, who remains as Chairman of the Board.
Woertz, 53, most recently was Executive Vice President of Chevron Corporation, in charge of the oil companys downstream operations, including refining, marketing, lubricant, supply and trading businesses in 180 countries, with more than $100 billion in annual revenues and a global workforce of 30,000. Chevron is one of the worlds leading energy companies, and Woertz was one of the highest-ranking executives in the energy industry.
Pat Woertz is a proven executive with an exceptional blend of strategic, analytic, business and leadership skills, said Andreas. Her selection was endorsed unanimously by our Board of Directors, and we are confident that she is the ideal person to sustain ADMs strong performance and lead the Company into the next chapter of its history.
Woertz becomes only the 8th CEO in the 104-year history of ADM.
Commenting on her appointment, Woertz said:
I am honored and excited to be part of the ADM organization and look forward to working with its outstanding leadership team and Board of Directors. ADM is one of the leading agricultural companies in the world, with a long tradition of applying innovation and resourcefulness to feed and fuel the world. While most of my executive experience has been in the field of energy, there are considerable similarities in commodity-based businesses as we build competitive advantages across the value chain.

She has delivered record earnings and returns at Chevron and has further distinguished herself working with a diverse range of government, community and commercial stakeholders. She has also been widely admired for her integrity, her high ethical standards and her collegial and collaborative leadership style.
Prior to becoming Executive Vice President at Chevron in 2001, Woertz was President of Chevron Products Co. since November 1998. In January 1996, she was named President of Chevron International Oil Co. and a Vice President of logistics and trading for Chevron Products Co. In October 1993, she was named President of Chevron Canada Ltd., a refining and marketing company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Chevron Corp.
Woertz started her career as a certified public accountant with Ernst & Young. In 1977, she joined Gulf Oil Corporation in Pittsburgh and held positions in refining and marketing, strategic planning and finance. From 1985 to 1987, during the merger of Gulf and Chevron, she worked on asset divestitures as part of the debt-reduction process. In 1989, she became finance manager with Chevron Information Technology Co. and, in 1991, was named head of strategic planning at Chevron.
A native of Pittsburgh, Woertz earned her Bachelor of Science degree from Pennsylvania State University and also is a graduate of Columbia Universitys International Executive Development Program. She serves on the Board of Trustees of the University of San Diego and on the Board of Visitors of Pennsylvania State University. In addition, she was formerly a director of the American Petroleum Institute.

Discussion of Operations
Net earnings for the quarter ended March 31, 2006 were $ 348 million, or $ .53 per share, compared to
$ 269 million, or $ .41 per share, last year. Net earnings for the nine months ended March 31, 2006 were
$ 902 million, or $ 1.38 per share, compared to $ 849 million, or $ 1.29 per share, last year. This years nine month results include a $ 36 million tax credit related to the adjustment of state and federal income taxes, securities gains of $ 29 million ($ 18 million after tax), Brazilian transactional tax credits of $19 million ($12 million after tax), asset impairment charges of $ 36 million ($ 22 million after tax), and a charge of $ 22 million related to costs associated with a citric acid plant shut down and an exit from the European animal feed business. Net earnings for the quarter and nine months ended March 31, 2005 included a gain of $ 114 million ($ 74 million after tax) from the sale of the Companys direct interest in Tate & Lyle. Last years results for the nine months also included an after-tax gain of $ 45 million representing the Companys equity share of the gain reported by its unconsolidated subsidiary, CIP, upon the sale of its interest in Tate & Lyle.
Segment operating profit increased $ 173 million to $ 549 million for the quarter and increased $ 224 million to $ 1.4 billion for the nine months.
Oilseeds Processing operating profit increased $ 116 million to $ 177 million for the quarter and increased $ 133 million to $ 404 million for the nine months as improved global market conditions resulted in improved operating results in North America, South America, Europe and Asia.
Corn Processing operating profit increased $ 41 million to $ 219 million for the quarter and increased
$ 179 million to $ 591 million for the nine months reflecting improved starch, sweetener and ethanol selling prices and lower net corn costs. Sweeteners and Starches operating profits increased $ 33 million to $ 113 million for the quarter and increased $ 140 million to $ 320 million for the nine months due to lower net corn costs and increased sweetener and starch selling prices, partially offset by higher energy costs. Bioproducts operating profits increased $ 7 million to $ 105 million for the quarter and increased
$ 38 million to $ 271 million for the nine months due to lower net corn costs and higher ethanol selling prices, partially offset by increased energy costs. For the quarter, ethanol sales volumes declined versus year-ago levels as last years volumes included a draw-down of ethanol stocks which were built up in anticipation of new markets. For the nine months, Bioproducts operating profit improved as increased ethanol sales volumes were partially offset by lower lysine selling prices and $ 20 million of employee severance costs associated with the closure of a citric acid plant.
Agricultural Services operating profit increased $ 24 million to $ 79 million for the quarter due principally to improved operating results of transportation operations. For the nine months operating profits decreased $ 2 million to $ 192 million as improved results from transportation operations were offset by a decline in global grain merchandising operations and the negative impact of hurricanes on North American origination and export operating results.
Other segment operating profit decreased $ 8 million to $ 76 million for the quarter due principally to decreased results of Food and Feed Ingredients related principally to costs associated with exiting the European animal feed business. Financial results for the quarter were comparable to last year as an $ 18 million reduction in earnings of the Companys private equity fund investments was offset by improved earnings of ADM Investor Services and captive insurance operations. For the nine months, Other segment operating profit declined $ 86 million to $ 236 million. Food and Feed Ingredient operations declined $ 65 million due principally to impairment charges of $ 32 million, decreased operating results of natural health and nutrition, and costs associated with exiting the European animal feed business. Financial results declined $ 21 million primarily due to a $ 63 million decrease in earnings of our private  
equity funds partially offset by improved earnings of ADM Investor Services and captive insurance operations.

Payments
. Upon Executives retirement, ADM shall provide Executive with the following payments and benefits:
 
(a)
  
Continued Chairman Compensation
. If the Retirement Date is prior to September 1, 2009, Executive shall continue to receive his Chairman Compensation until September 1, 2009; provided, however, that if Executive voluntarily elects to retire and resign as a Director and Chairman prior to July 1, 2007, he shall not receive Chairman Compensation after his Retirement Date, and he shall forfeit any unvested equity awards as of his Retirement Date that were granted under ADMs equity plans other than ADMs 2002 Incentive Compensation Plan, but he shall receive the remainder of the benefits described in this Agreement. Such Chairman Compensation shall be paid in accordance with ADMs regular payroll cycles and in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code). If the Retirement Date is on or after September 1, 2009, Executive shall not receive any Chairman Compensation after his Retirement Date.
 
(b)
  
Equity Awards
. Upon Executives Retirement Date, Executive shall continue to vest in his outstanding equity awards as provided in this paragraph. With respect to awards granted under the terms of ADMs 2002 Incentive Compensation Plan (including the normal August 2006 award), Executives retirement shall conclusively be deemed to be pursuant to Retirement, as such term is used in Executives various stock award and stock option agreements. With respect to awards granted under other equity plans, subject to Executives full compliance with Section 5 below, such awards shall continue to vest in accordance with their regular vesting schedules, and any awards that have not previously vested on September 1, 2009 shall become fully vested on that date. In addition, any vested options shall remain exercisable as if Executive remained employed
 
until the end of the original term (or such shorter period of time as is necessary so that such options are not subject to the tax imposed by Code Section 409A). To the extent any equity awards under ADMs equity plans other than ADMs 2002 Incentive Compensation Plan cannot be fully vested and Executive is otherwise entitled to have them vested under the terms of this Agreement, ADM will pay to Executive the cash value of such awards (including the spread between the option price and the current fair market value of ADMs stock) on the later of the date when such award would otherwise have become vested or the first date on which such payment would not be subject to the tax imposed by Code Section 409A.
 
(c)
  
Benefits
.
 
(i)
  
Executive shall receive any and all benefits accrued under any deferred compensation or qualified or non-qualified pension plan in which he currently participates (other than any severance plan) in accordance with, and subject to, the terms thereof; provided that no such deferred compensation or non-qualified pension benefits shall be paid prior to the first date on which they would not be subject to the tax imposed by Code Section 409A.
 
(ii)
  
If Executives Retirement Date is prior to July 1, 2008, Executive and his family shall be entitled to continued participation as an employee in all medical, health and life insurance plans at the same benefit level at which Executive and his family were participating on the Retirement Date until the earlier of (A) July 1, 2008, or (B) the date, or dates, Executive receives substantially similar coverage and benefits under the plans and programs of a subsequent employer (such coverage and benefits to be determined on a coverage-by-coverage, or benefit-by-benefit, basis). Such coverage shall be determined as if Executive had continued to be an active employee of ADM, and ADM shall continue to pay the costs of such coverage under such plans on the same basis as is applicable to active employees covered thereunder; provided that, if participation in any one or more of such plans is not possible under the terms thereof, ADM shall provide substantially identical benefits or, at Executives election, reimburse Executive for his cost of obtaining comparable coverage from a third-party insurer. In any event, Executive and his eligible dependents shall be eligible to participate in ADMs retiree welfare benefits program.
 
(iii)
  
If Executives Retirement Date is prior to July 1, 2008, Executive shall be credited with service and age credits as an employee under ADMs supplemental retirement plans until July 1, 2008, and Executive may commence benefits on July 1, 2008 in any form permitted by the applicable retirement plan as of the date of this Agreement. If Executives Retirement Date is on or after July 1, 2008, Executive may commence benefits upon his Retirement Date (or the first date on which payment of such benefits would not be subject to tax imposed by Code Section 409A) in any form permitted by the applicable retirement plan as of the date of this Agreement.
 
(iv)
  
If Executives Retirement Date is prior to July 1, 2008, Executive shall, until July 1, 2008, receive office and secretarial support similar to his current arrangements at a location to be mutually agreed upon by the parties. If Executives Retirement Date is on or after July 1, 2008, he shall not receive office and secretarial assistance after his Retirement Date.
 
(v)
  
Executive shall be reimbursed for the reasonable legal and professional fees incurred by him for the negotiation and documentation of this Agreement.
 
(vi)
  
Executive shall be paid for any (A) base salary (at the rate of salary in effect immediately prior to the Retirement Date) to the extent earned but unpaid as of the Retirement Date, (B) accrued but unused vacation days and (C) reasonable business and fringe benefit expenses incurred by him prior to the Retirement Date in accordance with Company policy in effect on the Retirement Date which have not yet been reimbursed. Such payment shall be made in accordance with ADMs standard payroll and expense reimbursement practices.
 
Section 5.
  
Covenant Not To Compete
. Executive acknowledges and agrees that he has, from time to time, executed Non-Disclosure Agreements with ADM which continue in full force and effect during the period of his employment and thereafter by their terms, and further acknowledges and agrees that during his tenure as CEO Executive had direct access to and personal knowledge of ADMs most important proprietary business information including, but not limited to, business plans and strategies, financial information, trading and hedging strategies, and operational methods, plans and strategies. This information is proprietary to ADM and subject to reasonable efforts by ADM to secure its confidentiality. This proprietary information has significant value to ADM as it provides ADM with a strategic advantage over its Competitors (as defined below). Were this information provided to ADMs Competitors, or were Executive to be engaged by ADMs Competitors, since Executive would not be unable to perform his duties for such Competitors without disclosing ADMs confidential and proprietary business information, ADM would be irreparably harmed. Therefore, beginning on Executives Retirement Date and continuing until September 1, 2009, Executive shall not, without the prior written consent of the Board of Directors of ADM, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, own any interest in, except the ownership of stock in a publicly-traded company, take any employment with, or act as a director, officer, agent, consultant, advisor, independent contractor or in any other capacity whatsoever, directly or indirectly, with or to any any entity that would compete with any of the material businesses of ADM (Competitors). As further consideration for Executives agreement to forego such opportunities, ADM will pay Executive $1,000,000 on September 1, 2009 provided that Executive is then in full compliance with the provisions of this Section 5. In the event that Executive continues to serve as Chairman or as a director of ADM after July 1, 2008, the period of non-competition shall begin on the last day of Executives service as a director and shall continue for fifteen (15) calendar months thereafter, at which time ADM will pay Executive the $1,000,000 described in the preceding sentence, provided that Executive is then in full compliance with the provisions of this Section 5. During these same periods, Executive will not hire or solicit for employment any executive of ADM or its subsidiaries or affiliates without the prior written consent of the CEO or President of ADM. ADMs exclusive remedy for Executives failure to fully comply with this Section 5 shall be the forfeiture of the payment described in the preceding sentence, the forfeiture of any equity awards issued under plans other than ADMs 2002 Incentive Compensation Plan that are unvested at the time of such breach, and the forfeiture of any unpaid Chairman Compensation.
 
Section 6.
  
Setoff; No Mitigation
. No payments or benefits payable to or with respect to Executive pursuant to this Agreement shall be reduced by any amount Executive may earn or receive from employment with another employer or from any other source, except as expressly provided in Section 4(c)(ii). Executive shall have no duty to mitigate his damages by seeking other employment.
 
Section 7.
  
Indemnification; D&O Coverage
. ADM shall continue to indemnify Executive and provide directors and officers liability insurance coverage (including, where required, legal defense) for actions prior to Executives Retirement Date to the same extent it indemnifies and provides liability insurance coverage to then-current officers and directors of ADM.
 
Section 8.
  
Release
. In consideration of the post-retirement compensation and benefits to which Executive would not otherwise be entitled by law, contract or under the policies or practices of ADM that will be provided to Executive pursuant to this Agreement, Executive agrees to execute and deliver to ADM between the Retirement Date and 21 days following the Retirement Date a general release and waiver in a form substantially similar to that used for other senior executives of ADM under which Executive releases and discharges ADM and its affiliates, subsidiaries, joint ventures and related entities, and each of their past and present officers, directors, managers, attorneys, benefit plans and plan administrators and agents, from all claims and causes of action of any kind, including, but not limited to, claims and causes of action arising out of Executives employment and retirement, but excluding claims and causes of action relating solely to ADMs obligations to make payments or provide benefits after Executives retirement pursuant to the express terms of this Agreement. Executive will not be entitled to receive such post-retirement benefits until the general release and waiver becomes effective in accordance with its terms.
 
Section 9.
  
Death or Disability of Executive
. If Executive dies or becomes disabled (as such term is defined in ADMs long term disability plan) at any time after the date hereof, he (or his estate) shall receive the compensation and benefits described in this Agreement to the extent not previously paid to him.
 
Section 10.
  
Binding Effect; Revocation; Modification
. The parties understand and agree that this Agreement is final and binding and, together with the Non-Disclosure Agreements previously executed by Executive, constitute the complete and exclusive statement of the terms and conditions relating to Executives retirement, that this Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings (oral or written) between Executive and ADM relating to Executives employment, Retirement Date, or otherwise, that no representations or commitments were made by the parties to induce this Agreement other than as expressly set forth herein and that this Agreement is fully understood by the parties. This Agreement may not be modified or supplemented except by a subsequent written agreement signed by the party against whom enforcement of the modification is sought.
 
Section 11.
  
Governing Law
. The validity, construction and enforceability of this Agreement shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the State of Illinois, without regard to its conflicts of laws rules.
 
Section 12.
  
Resolution of Disputes
. Any disputes under or in connection with this Agreement shall, at the election of either party, be resolved by arbitration, to be held in Chicago, Illinois in accordance with the rules and procedures of the American Arbitration Association then in effect. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Each party shall bear its own costs, including but not limited to attorneys fees, of the arbitration or of any litigation arising out of this Agreement. Pending the resolution of any arbitration or litigation, ADM shall continue payment of all amounts due the Executive under this Agreement and all benefits to which the Executive is entitled at the time the dispute arises.
 
Section 13.
  
Waiver; Severability
. No waiver by any party at any time of any breach by any other party of, or compliance with, any condition or provision of this Agreement to be performed by any other party shall be deemed a waiver of any other provision of this Agreement, or of any subsequent breach by such party of a provision of this Agreement. If any of the provisions of this Agreement shall otherwise contravene or be invalid under the laws of any state or other jurisdiction where it is applicable but for such contravention or invalidity, such contravention or invalidity shall not invalidate all of the provisions of this Agreement, but rather this Agreement shall be reformed and construed, insofar as the laws of that state or jurisdiction are concerned, as not containing the provision or provisions, but only to the extent that they are contravening or are invalid under the laws of that state or jurisdiction, and the rights and obligations created hereby shall be reformed and construed and enforced accordingly.
 
Section 14.
  
Withholding
. ADM may withhold from any amounts payable under this Agreement such federal, state and local taxes as may be required to be withheld pursuant to applicable laws or regulations.
 
Section 15.
  
Counterparts
. This Agreement may be executed by either of the parties hereto in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF

Discussion of Operations

$ 1.59 per share, last year. Net earnings for the quarter ended June 30, 2006 were $ 410 million, or $ .62 per share, compared to $ 195 million, or $ .30 per share, last year.

Net earnings for the year ended June 30, 2005 include a gain of $ 114 million ($ 74 million after tax) from the sale of the Companys direct interest in Tate & Lyle, an after tax gain of $ 45 million representing the Companys equity share of the gain reported by its unconsolidated subsidiary, CIP, upon the sale of its interest in Tate & Lyle and asset impairment charges of $ 42 million ($ 26 million after tax).

Corn Processing operating profit increased $ 169 million to $ 286 million for the quarter as Sweeteners and Starches earnings increased $ 20 million to $ 112 million and Bioproducts earnings increased $ 149 million to $ 174 million. For the fiscal year, Corn Processing operating profit increased $ 347 million to $ 877 million as Sweeteners and Starches earnings increased $ 160 million to $ 432 million and Bioproducts increased $ 187 million to $ 446 million. Increased starch, sweetener and ethanol selling prices and volumes contributed to the earnings improvements for both the quarter and fiscal year. Lower lysine selling prices negatively impacted Bioproducts results for the fiscal year. For the quarter, average net corn costs increased. For the year, net corn costs decreased, but were partially offset by higher energy costs.
Agricultural Services operating profits increased $ 15 million to $ 83 million for the quarter and increased $ 14 million to $ 275 million for the year principally due to improved operating results of transportation operations partially offset by a decline in global grain merchandising operations. In addition, fiscal year operating profits of the North American origination and export operations declined due to the negative impact of the hurricanes in the first half of the fiscal year.
Other segment operating profit declined $ 18 million to $ 73 million for the quarter due principally to a $ 40 million decline in Food and Feed Ingredients operating results, primarily due to reduced operating profits of the natural health and nutrition, wheat milling and cocoa operations, partially offset by a $ 21 million improvement in operating profit of the financial operations. For the year, Other segment operating profit declined $ 104 million to $ 310 million due to a decline in operating profit of the Food and Feed Ingredient businesses due principally to asset abandonment charges and reduced operating results of the natural health and nutrition, wheat milling and cocoa operations.

A stockholder request for a special meeting shall be signed, dated and delivered to the Secretary, shall state the purpose of the proposed meeting, and shall provide the information required by Section 1.4(c) hereof. The Board of Directors or, in the absence of action by the Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board, shall have the sole power to determine the date, time and place for any special meeting of stockholders and to set a record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting pursuant to Section 1.11 hereof. Following such determination, it shall be the duty of the Secretary to cause notice to be given to the stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting, in the manner set forth in Section 1.3 hereof, that a meeting will be held at the place, time and date and in accordance with the record date determined by the Board of Directors or the Chairman of the Board.

If mailed, such notice shall be deemed given when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at his or her address as it appears on the records of the Corporation. 
 
Section 1.4. Advance Notice Requirements for Stockholder Proposals.  The following procedures shall govern all cases in which a stockholder seeks to propose business to be addressed at a meeting of stockholders or to nominate persons to stand for election as directors of the Corporation (a "Stockholder Proposal").  No business shall be transacted at a meeting of stockholders except in accordance with the following procedures.  Only persons who are
nominated in accordance with the following procedures shall be eligible for election as directors of the Corporation. Notwithstanding any language in these by-laws to the contrary, this section shall not apply to any right of holders of preferred shares of the Corporation to nominate and elect a specified number of directors in certain circumstances to the extent such procedures are set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation.
(a)
 
Annual Meetings of Stockholders.
 
(1)
 
A Stockholder Proposal may be brought before an annual meeting of
stockholders only (i) pursuant to the Corporation
s notice of meeting delivered pursuant to Section 1.3 hereof (or any supplement thereto), (ii) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors (or any duly authorized committee thereof) or the Chairman of the Board or (iii) by any stockholder of the Corporation who was a stockholder of record of the Corporation at the time the notice provided for in this Section 1.4 is delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in
subparagraphs (2) and (3) of this paragraph (a) in this Section 1.4.
 
(2)
 
For a Stockholder Proposal to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder pursuant to clause (iii) of paragraph (a)(1) of this Section 1.4, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation and the subject of the Stockholder Proposal must otherwise be a proper matter for stockholder action as determined by the Board of Directors. The stockholder
s notice shall contain, at a minimum, the information set forth in Section 1.4(c). To be timely, a stockholder
s notice shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not less than sixty (60) nor more than ninety (90) days prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of stockholders; provided, however, that in the event that the annual meeting is called for a date that is not within thirty (30) days before or after such anniversary date, the stockholder
s notice in order to be timely must be so received not later than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which such notice of the date of the annual meeting was mailed or public disclosure of the date of the annual meeting was made, whichever first occurs. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting of stockholders commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholder
s notice as described above.
(3)
 
Notwithstanding anything in paragraph (a)(2) of this Section 1.4 to the contrary, in the event that the Stockholder Proposal relates to the nomination of candidates for director and the number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors of the Corporation at an annual meeting is increased and there is no public announcement by the Corporation naming all of the nominees for director or specifying the size of the increased Board of Directors at least one hundred days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year
s annual meeting, a stockholder
s notice required by this Section 1.4 shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new positions created by such increase, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the Corporation.
 
(b)
Special Meetings of Stockholders. 
Only such business shall be conducted at a special meeting of stockholders as shall have been described in the Corporation
s notice of meeting given pursuant to Section 1.3 hereof. To the extent such business includes the election of directors, a Stockholder Proposal nominating persons to stand for election as directors may be made at a special meeting of stockholders only (i) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors (or any duly authorized committee thereof) or the Chairman of the Board, or (ii) by any stockholder of the Corporation who is a stockholder of record at the time the notice provided for in this Section 1.4(b) is delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation, who is entitled to vote at the special meeting and who gives timely notice in writing by the Secretary of the Corporation. The stockholder
s notice shall contain, at a minimum, the information set forth in Section 1.4(c). To be timely, a stockholder
s notice shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of a special meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholder
s notice as described above.
 
(c)
 
Contents of Stockholder
s Notice. Any stockholder
s notice required by this Section 1.4 shall set forth the following information: As to the stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the Stockholder Proposal is made, the stockholder
s notice shall set forth (i) the name and address of such stockholder and of such beneficial owner, as they appear on the Corporation
s books, (ii) the class and number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation which are owned beneficially and of record by such stockholder and such beneficial owner and (iii) a representation that such stockholder intends to appear in person or by proxy at the stockholder meeting. For any Stockholder Proposal that seeks to nominate persons to stand for election as directors of the Corporation, the stockholder
s notice also shall include (i) a description of all arrangements or understandings between such stockholder and each proposed nominee and any other person or persons (including their names) pursuant to which the nomination(s) are to be made, (ii) a representation whether the stockholders or the beneficial owners, if any, intend or are part of a group which intends to (1) deliver a proxy statement and/or form of proxy to holders of at least the percentage of the Corporation

and (iii) any other information relating to such stockholder that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings required to be made in connection with solicitations of proxies for election of directors pursuant to Section 14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
Exchange Act
), and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. For any Stockholder Proposal that seeks to nominate persons to stand for election as directors of the Corporation, the stockholder

s notice shall set forth for each item of business proposed for consideration (i) a description of the item of business, (ii) the text of the proposal or business (including the text of any resolutions proposed for consideration and in the event that such business includes a proposal to amend the by-laws of the Corporation, the language of the proposed amendment), (iii) the reasons for conducting such business at the stockholder meeting, (iv) and any material interest in such business of such stockholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the Stockholder Proposal is made

s representation as required by Section (c) of this Section 1.4, to declare that such Stockholder Proposal shall be disregarded.

Section 1.6.
 
Quorum. 
Except as otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these by-laws, at each meeting of stockholders the presence in person or by proxy of the holders of a majority in voting power of the outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote at the meeting shall be necessary and sufficient to constitute a quorum. In the absence of a quorum, the chair of the meeting may adjourn the meeting from time to time in the manner provided in Section 1.10 hereof until a quorum shall attend. Shares of the Corporation
s own stock belonging to the Corporation or to another corporation, if a majority of the shares entitled to vote in the election of directors of such other corporation is held, directly or indirectly, by the Corporation, shall neither be entitled to vote nor be counted for quorum purposes; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not limit the right of the Corporation or any subsidiary of the Corporation to vote stock, including but not limited to its own stock, held by it in a fiduciary capacity. The chair of the meeting shall have the power and the duty to determine whether a quorum is present at any meeting of stockholders.
Section 1.7.
 
Officers for Meeting of Stockholders. Meetings of stockholders shall be presided over by the Chairman of the Board, if any, or in his or her absence by the President, or in his or her absence by a Vice President, or in the absence of the foregoing persons by a chair designated by the Board of Directors, or in the absence of such designation by a chair chosen at the meeting by a plurality vote. The Secretary shall act as secretary of the meeting, but in his or her absence the chair of the meeting may appoint any person to act as secretary of the meeting.
Section 1.8.
 
Conduct of Meetings. Every meeting of stockholders shall be presided over by the chair of the meeting selected pursuant to Section 1.7, hereof. The date and time of the opening and the closing of the polls for each matter upon which the stockholders will vote at a meeting shall be determined by the chair of the meeting and announced at the meeting. The Board of Directors may adopt by resolution such rules and regulations for the conduct of the meeting of stockholders as it shall deem appropriate. Except to the extent inconsistent with such rules and regulations as adopted by the Board of Directors, the chair of the meeting shall have the exclusive right and authority to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and to do all such acts as, in the judgment of the chair, are appropriate for the proper conduct of the meeting. Such rules, regulations or procedures, whether adopted by the Board of Directors or prescribed by the chair of the meeting, may include, without limitation, the following: (i) the establishment of an agenda or order of business for the meeting; (ii) rules and procedures for maintaining order at the meeting and the safety of those present; (iii) limitations on attendance at or participation in the meeting to stockholders of record of the Corporation, their duly authorized and constituted proxies or such other persons as the chair of the meeting shall determine; (iv) restrictions on entry to the meeting after the time fixed for the commencement thereof; and (v) limitations on or the elimination of time allotted to questions or comments by participants.

Section 1.9 
Voting
; Elections.
 
1.9.1.
Voting Generally
; Proxies. Except as otherwise provided by or pursuant to the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation, each stockholder entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall be entitled to one vote for each share of stock held by such stockholder which has voting power upon the matter in question. Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders or to express consent or dissent to corporate action in writing without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder by proxy, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. A stockholder may revoke any proxy which is not irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting in person or by filing an instrument in writing revoking the proxy or by delivering a proxy in accordance with applicable law bearing a later date to the Secretary of the Corporation. Voting at meetings of stockholders need not be by written ballot.
All
elections and questions shall, unless otherwise provided by the Certificate of Incorporation, these by-laws, the rules or regulations of any stock exchange applicable to the Corporation, or applicable law or pursuant to any regulation applicable to the Corporation or its securities, be decided by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the shares of stock of the Corporation which are present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote thereon
.
 
1.9.2.
 
Elections of Directors. Each director shall be elected by the vote of the majority of the votes cast with respect to the director at any meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present, provided that the directors shall be elected by the vote of a plurality of the votes cast for the nominees at any meeting for the election of directors where the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected at the meeting (exclusive of nominees with respect to whom the Secretary of the Corporation has received a notice that such nomination has been withdrawn on or prior to the date next preceding the date that the Corporation first mails notice of the meeting to the stockholders). For purposes of this Section 1.9.2, a majority of the votes cast means that the number of shares voted for a director must exceed the number of votes cast against that director
.
Section 1.10.
 
Adjournment of Meeting. Any meeting of stockholders, annual or special, may be adjourned solely by the chair of the meeting from time to time to reconvene at the same or some other time, date and place. The stockholders present at a meeting shall not have authority to adjourn the meeting. Notice need not be given of any such adjourned meeting if the time, date and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. If the time, date and place of the adjourned meeting are not announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken, then the Secretary of the Corporation shall give written notice of the time, date and place of the adjourned meeting not less than ten (10) days prior to the date of the adjourned meeting. Notice of the adjourned meeting also shall be given if the meeting is
adjourned in a single adjournment to a date more than 30 days or in successive adjournments to a date more than 120 days after the original date fixed for the meeting.
 
At an adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present, the stockholders may transact any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting. Once a share is represented for any purpose at a meeting, it shall be present for quorum purposes for the remainder of the meeting and for any adjournment of that meeting unless a new record date is or must be set for the adjourned meeting. A new record date shall be set if the meeting is adjourned in a single or successive adjournments to a date more than 120 days after the original date fixed for the meeting. If after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting consistent with the new record date.
Section 1.11
 
Fixing Date for Determination of Stockholders of Record.
In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action other than stockholder action by written consent, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which record date: (i) in the case of determination of stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders or adjournment thereof, shall, unless otherwise required by law, not be more than sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) days before the original date of such meeting, and (ii) in the case of any other lawful action other than stockholder action by written consent, shall not be more than sixty days prior to such other action. If no record date is fixed by the Board of Directors: (i) the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held, and (ii) the record date for determining stockholders for any other purpose (other than stockholder action by written consent) shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting and shall fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting if the meeting is adjourned in a single or successive adjournments to a date more than 120 days after the original date fixed for the meeting.
Section 1.12.
 
Procedures for Stockholder Action by Consent.
1.12.1.
 
Request for Record Date. The record date for determining stockholders entitled to express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be as fixed by the Board of Directors or as otherwise established under this Section 1.12.1. Any person seeking to have the stockholders authorize or take corporate action by written consent without a meeting shall, by written notice addressed to the Secretary and delivered to the Corporation and signed by a
stockholder of record, request that a record date be fixed for such purpose. The written notice shall contain at a minimum the information required in Section 1.4(c) for a Stockholder Proposal and shall state the reasons for soliciting consents for such action. The Board of Directors hall have ten (10) days following the date of receipt of the notice to determine the validity of the request, including the sufficiency of the information provided. During the ten (10) day period, the Corporation may require the stockholder of record and/or beneficial owner requesting a record date for proposed stockholder action by consent to furnish such other information as it may reasonably require to determine the validity of the request for a record date. Following the determination of the validity of the request, and no later than ten (10) days after the date on which such request is received by the Corporation, the Board of Directors may fix a record date for such purpose which shall be no more than ten (10) days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors and shall not precede the date such resolution is adopted. If the Board of Directors fails within ten (10) days after the date the Corporation receives such notice to fix a record date for such purpose, the record date shall be the day on which the first written consent is delivered to the Corporation in the manner described in Section 1.12.3 below unless prior action by the Board of Directors is required by law, in which event the record date shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action.
 
1.12.2.
Form of Consent. Every written consent purporting to take or authorize the taking of corporate action and/or related revocations (each such written consent and related revocation is referred to in this Section 1.12 as a
Consent
) shall bear the date of signature of each stockholder who signs the Consent, and no Consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless, within 60 days of the earliest dated Consent delivered in the manner required by this Section 1.12, Consents signed by a sufficient number of stockholders to take such action are so delivered to the Corporation.
1.12.3.
 
Delivery of Consent. A Consent shall be delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware or to the Secretary of the Corporation at the Corporation
s principal place of business. Delivery to the Corporation
s registered office shall be made by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested.
In the event of the delivery to the Corporation of a Consent, the Secretary of the Corporation shall provide for the safe-keeping of such Consent and shall promptly conduct such ministerial review of the sufficiency of the Consents and of the validity of the action to be taken by stockholder consent as the Secretary deems necessary or appropriate, including, without limitation, whether the holders of a number of shares having the requisite voting power to authorize or take the action specified in the Consent have given consent; provided, however, that if the corporate action to which the Consent relates is the removal or replacement of one or more members of the Board of Directors, the Secretary of the Corporation shall promptly designate two persons, who shall not be members of the Board of Directors, to serve as Inspectors with respect to such Consent and such Inspectors shall discharge the functions of the Secretary of the Corporation under this Section 1.12.3. If after such investigation the Secretary or the Inspectors (as the case may be) shall determine that the Consent is valid and that the action therein specified has been validly authorized, that fact shall forthwith be certified on the records of the Corporation kept for the purpose of recording the proceedings of meetings of stockholders, and
the Consent shall be filed in such records, at which time the Consent shall become effective as stockholder action. In conducting the investigation required by this Section 1.12.3, the Secretary or the Inspectors (as the case may be) may, at the expense of the Corporation, retain special legal counsel and any other necessary or appropriate professional advisors, and such other personnel as they may deem necessary or appropriate to assist them, and shall be fully protected in relying in good faith upon the opinion of such counsel or advisors.
No action by written consent without a meeting shall be effective until such date as the Secretary or the Inspectors (as the case may be) certify to the Corporation that the Consents delivered to the Corporation in accordance with Section 1.12.3 represent at least the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to take the action.
Nothing contained in this Section 1.12.3 shall in any way be construed to suggest or imply that the Board of Directors or any stockholder shall not be entitled to contest the validity of any Consent or revocation thereof, whether before or after such certification by the Secretary or the Inspectors, or to take any other action (including, without limitation, the commencement, prosecution, or defense of any litigation with respect thereto, and the seeking of injunctive relief in such litigation).
 
Section 1.13.
 
Inspectors of Election. The Corporation may, and shall if required by law, in advance of any meeting of stockholders, appoint one or more inspectors of election, who may be employees of the Corporation, to act at the meeting or any adjournment thereof and to make a written report thereof. The Corporation may designate one or more persons as alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act. In the event that no inspector so appointed or designated is able to act at a meeting of stockholders, the person presiding at the meeting shall appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting. Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of his or her duties, shall take and sign an oath to execute faithfully the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her ability. The inspector or inspectors so appointed or designated shall (i) ascertain the number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation outstanding and the voting power of each such share, (ii) determine the shares of capital stock of the Corporation represented at the meeting and the validity of proxies and ballots, (iii) count all votes and ballots, (iv) determine and retain for a reasonable period a record of the disposition of any challenges made to any determination by the inspectors, and (v) certify their determination of the number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation represented at the meeting and such inspectors
count of all votes and ballots. Such certification and report shall specify such other information as may be required by law. In determining the validity and counting of proxies and ballots cast at any meeting of stockholders of the Corporation, the inspectors may consider such information as is permitted by applicable law. No person who is a candidate for an office at an election may serve as an inspector at such election.
Section 1.14.
 
List of Stockholders Entitled to Vote. The Secretary shall prepare and make, at least ten (10) days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least ten (10) days prior to the
meeting, either at a place within the city where the meeting is to be held, which place shall be specified in the notice of the meeting, or if not so specified, at the place where the meeting is to be held. The list shall also be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present.

s successor is elected and qualified. The stockholders shall not have the power to appoint directors to any newly created directorship or vacancy.
Section 2.3.

Section 2.8.
 
Independent Directors And Board Structure. A majority of the Board of Directors shall be comprised of independent directors. The Chief Executive Officer should be a member of the Board of Directors. In order to ensure the greatest number of independent directors on a board of manageable size, other direct management representation should be kept to a minimum and should in no event exceed two other management directors.

The Board shall have full and direct access to members of Senior Management and should be encouraged to request reports directly to the Board by any member of Senior Management. Board members should use judgment in dealings with management so that they do not distract management from the business operations of the Company.
Conflicts of Interest.
A director
s personal financial or family relationships may occasionally give rise to that director
s material personal interest in a particular issue. There will be times when a director
s material personal interest in an issue will limit that director
s ability to vote on that issue. The Governance Committee of the Board of Directors shall determine whether such a conflict of interest exists on a case-by-case basis, including the determination as to materiality under items (c) and (g) of this Section 7. The Governance Committee shall take appropriate steps to identify such potential conflicts and to ensure that a majority of the directors voting on an issue are both disinterested and independent with respect to that issue. A determination by the Governance Committee on any issue of independence or conflict of interest shall be final and not subject to review.

of this Section, an
independent director

News Release
 
 
The Board of Directors of Archer Daniels Midland Company (NYSE: ADM) announced today that Chief Executive Officer and President Patricia A. Woertz has been elected Chairman of the Companys Board of Directors. Ms. Woertz, who was named CEO and President in April 2006, succeeds G. Allen Andreas who resigned from the Board. Independent Director Patrick Moore continues in the role of Lead Director.
 
The Board declared a cash dividend of 11.5 cents per shre on the Company's stock payable March 9, 2007 to Shareholders of record February 16, 2007.  This is an increase of one and one-half cents a share.  This is ADM's 301st consecutive 
quarterly payment, a record of 75 years of uninterrupted dividends. As of December 31, 2006 there were 653,447,466 shares of ADM stock outstanding.
In addition, the Board adopted a majority voting policy for election of directors that will be implemented through amendments to the Companys Bylaws and Corporate Governance Guidelines.
Our leadership transition has progressed very successfully and faster than anticipated, said G. Allen Andreas. Under Patricias leadership, ADM continues to deliver outstanding results for shareholders, customers and employees. As I look forward, the time is right for me to step down and for Patricia to assume the role of Chairman.
Our decision to name Patricia as the Chairman reflects the Boards confidence in her strong leadership and strategic direction for the Company, said Patrick Moore.
ADM today is an industry leader that is positioned for continued growth, said Patricia Woertz. It is because of Allens leadership that we are in this position. I am honored to work with an outstanding team of colleagues; we will continue to appreciate Allens legacy as we embark on the next phase of ADMs global leadership in BioEnergy and agricultural processing.
Mr. Andreas joined Archer Daniels Midland Company in 1973. He served as Treasurer, Chief Financial Officer of European Operations, and Vice President and Counsel to the Executive Committee before being appointed a Member of the Office of the Chief Executive in 1996. He was named Chief Executive Officer in 1997, assumed the position of Chairman in 1999 and was elected President in 2005. In 2006, Mr. Andreas retired from the positions of Chief Executive and President while continuing his service as Chairman of the Board of Directors.
Ms. Woertz is Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President of Archer Daniels Midland Company. Patricia is focused on extending the Companys strong financial momentum and accelerating the growth of its BioEnergy business while expanding the Companys premier position in the agricultural processing value chain.
Prior to joining ADM in April 2006, Ms. Woertz spent 29 years in the energy industry, most recently as Executive Vice President of Chevron Corporation where she led its global refining, marketing, lubricant, supply and trading operations.
Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM) is the world leader in BioEnergy and has a premier position in the agricultural processing value chain. ADM is one of the worlds largest processors of soybeans, corn, wheat and cocoa. ADM is a leading manufacturer of biodiesel, ethanol, soybean oil and meal, corn sweeteners, flour and other value-added food and feed ingredients. Headquartered in Decatur, Illinois, ADM has over 26,000 employees, more than 240 processing plants and net sales for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 of $37 billion.

News Release
 
 
     Archer
Daniels
Midland Company (NYSE: ADM) today announced its intention to offer, subject to market and other conditions, $1 billion principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes due 2014 through offerings to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act). The notes will be convertible under certain circumstances. Upon conversion, holders will receive cash up to the principal amount, and any excess conversion value will be delivered, at our election, in cash, common stock or a combination of cash and common stock. ADM also expects to grant the initial purchasers an option to purchase additional notes to cover over-allotments.
     Subject to customary conditions, ADM expects to use a portion of the net proceeds from the offering and the proceeds of the warrant transactions referred to below to repurchase up to $400 million worth of shares of its common stock contemporaneously with the closing of the sale of the notes. In addition, proceeds from the transactions will be used to fund convertible note hedge transactions that ADM expects to enter into with one or more of the initial purchasers of the notes and/or their affiliates. Any remaining proceeds from the transactions will be added to ADMs working capital and will be used for general corporate purposes.
     The convertible note hedge transactions are intended to reduce
 
the dilution to ADM common stock upon potential future conversion of the notes. ADM also expects to enter into separate warrant transactions with one or more of the initial purchasers and/or their affiliates. These transactions will generally have the effect of increasing the conversion price of the notes.
 
     This notice does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy securities. Any offers of the securities will be made only by means of a private offering memorandum. The securities and the shares of ADM common stock issuable upon conversion or exercise of the securities have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements.

The Notes and the shares of the Company's common stock without par value (the "Common Stock"), issuable in certain circumstances upon conversion of the Notes, have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). The Company offered and sold the Notes to the Initial Purchasers in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act. The Initial Purchasers then sold the Notes to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The Company relied on these exemptions from registration based in part on representations made by the Initial Purchasers in the Purchase Agreement.
The Notes are governed by an indenture, dated as of February 22, 2007 (the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York, as trustee (the "Trustee"). A copy of the Indenture is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.1, is incorporated herein by reference, and is hereby filed; the descriptions of the Indenture and the Notes in this report are summaries and are qualified in their entirety by the terms of the Indenture and Notes, respectively.
The Notes will be convertible into cash and, if applicable, shares of Common Stock based on a conversion rate of 22.8343 shares of Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (which is equal to an initial conversion price of approximately $43.79 per share), subject to adjustment, only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter beginning after March 31, 2007 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the closing price of the Common Stock for at least 20 trading days in the 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is more than 140% of the applicable conversion price per share, which is $1,000 divided by the then applicable conversion rate; (2) during the five consecutive business days immediately after any five consecutive trading day period (the "Note Measurement Period") in which the average trading price per $1,000 principal amount of the notes was equal to or less than 98% of the average conversion value of the notes during the Note Measurement Period; (3) if specified distributions to holders of the Common Stock are made or specified corporate transactions occur, as set forth in the Indenture; and (4) at any time on or after January 15, 2014, through the business day preceding the stated maturity date. Upon conversion, a holder will receive for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes an amount in cash equal to the lesser of (i) $1,000 and (ii) the conversion value, determined in the manner set forth in the Indenture. If the
Table of Contents
conversion value exceeds $1,000 on the conversion date, the Company will also deliver, at its election, cash or Common Stock or a combination of cash and Common Stock for the conversion value in excess of $1,000.
The Notes will bear interest at a rate of 0.875% per year, payable semiannually in arrears in cash on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning on August 15, 2007. The Notes will mature on February 15, 2014.
The holders of the Notes who convert their Notes in connection with a change in control, as defined in the Indenture, may be entitled to a make-whole premium in the form of an increase in the conversion rate. Additionally, in the event of a change in control, the holders of the Notes may require the Company to purchase all or a portion of their Notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.
The Notes will rank equal in right of payment to all of the Company's other existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness. The Notes will rank senior in right of payment to all of the Company's existing and future subordinated indebtedness and effectively subordinated in right of payment to all of its subsidiaries' obligations (including secured and unsecured obligations) and effectively subordinated in right of payment to its secured obligations to the extent of the assets securing such obligation.
In connection with the sale of the Notes, the Company entered into a registration rights agreement, dated as of February 22, 2007, with the Initial Purchasers (the "Registration Rights Agreement"). Under the Registration Rights Agreement, the Company has agreed to use its reasonable efforts to cause to become effective within 220 days after the closing of the offering of the Notes, a shelf registration statement with respect to the resale of the Notes and the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes. The Company will use its reasonable efforts to keep the shelf registration statement effective for a period of two years after the closing of the offering of the Notes or until the earlier of (i) the sale or transfer pursuant to a shelf registration statement of all of the Notes and Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes, and (ii) the date when holders (other than holders that are the Company's "affiliates") of the Notes and Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes are able to sell all such securities immediately without restriction. The Company will be required to pay additional interest, subject to some limitations, to the holders of the Notes if it fails to comply with its obligations to register the Notes and the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes. A copy of the Registration Rights Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.2, is incorporated herein by reference, and is hereby filed; the description of the Registration Rights Agreement in this report is a summary and is qualified in its entirety by the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement.
In connection with the sale of the Notes, the Company entered into convertible note hedge transactions with respect to its Common Stock (the "Purchased Call Options") with Citibank, N.A., Deutsche Bank AG, JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, and Merrill Lynch International. The Purchased Call Options will cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, approximately 26.3 million shares of Common Stock at a strike price which corresponds to the initial conversion price of the Notes. The Company paid an aggregate amount of approximately $299 million of the proceeds from the sale of the Notes for the Purchased Call Options. Merrill Lynch International's performance under the convertible note hedge transactions is guaranteed by Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc.
Table of Contents
The Company also entered into separate warrant transactions whereby the Company has sold to the Dealers warrants to acquire, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, approximately 26.3 million shares of Common Stock (the "Sold Warrants") at a strike price of $62.56 per share of Common Stock. The Sold Warrants will be exercisable and will expire in May and June of 2014. The Company received aggregate proceeds of approximately $170 million from the sale of the Sold Warrants. Merrill Lynch International's performance under the warrant transactions is guaranteed by Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc.
The Purchased Call Options and Sold Warrants are separate contracts entered into by the Company with each of the Dealers, are not part of the terms of the Notes and will not affect the holders' rights under the Notes. The Purchased Call Options are expected to offset the potential dilution upon conversion of the Notes in the event that the market value per share of the Common Stock at the time of exercise is greater than the strike price of the Purchased Call Options, which corresponds to the initial conversion price of the Notes and is simultaneously subject to certain customary adjustments.
If the market value per share of the Common Stock at the time of conversion of the Notes is above the strike price of the Purchased Call Options, the Purchased Call Options entitle the Company to receive from the Dealers net shares of Common Stock, cash or a combination of shares of Common Stock and cash, depending on the consideration paid on the underlying Notes, based on the excess of the then current market price of the Common Stock over the strike price of the Purchased Call Options. Additionally, if the market price of the Common Stock at the time of exercise of the Sold Warrants exceeds the strike price of the Sold Warrants, the Company will owe the Dealers net shares of Common Stock or cash, not offset by the Purchased Call Options, in an amount based on the excess of the then current market price of the Common Stock over the strike price of the Sold Warrants.
These transactions will generally have the effect of increasing the conversion price of the Notes to $62.56 per share of Common Stock, representing a 75% premium based on the closing price of the Company's Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange of $35.75 per share on February 15, 2007.
The Sold Warrants and the underlying Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Sold Warrants have not been registered under the Securities Act, and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements. This report on Form 8-K does not constitute an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy, any security and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offering would be unlawful.
Item 2.03. Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
On February 22, 2007, the Company issued $1,150,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Notes. The Company offered and sold the Notes to the Initial Purchasers in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act. The Initial Purchasers then sold the Notes to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Rule 144A under the Securities Act.

The holders of the Notes who convert their Notes in connection with a change in control, as defined in the Indenture, may be entitled to a make-whole premium in the form of an increase in the conversion rate. Additionally, in the event of a change in control, the holders of the Notes may require the Company to purchase all or a portion of their Notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.

On February 15, 2007, the Company agreed to sell $1,150,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Notes to the Initial Purchasers in a private placement pursuant to exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. The net proceeds from the offering, after deducting the Initial Purchasers' discount and the estimated offering expenses payable by the Company, were approximately $1.134 billion. The Initial Purchasers received an aggregate commission of $15.5 million in connection with the offering of the Notes.
The Company offered and sold the Notes to the Initial Purchasers in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act.

The Company relied on these exemptions from registration based in part on representations made by the Initial Purchasers in the Purchase Agreement.

     If the Trustee fails to comply with Section 7.10, any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of Securities for at least six months may, on behalf of itself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor Trustee.
     The resignation or removal of a Trustee shall not diminish, impair or terminate its rights to indemnification pursuant to Section 7.07 as they relate to periods prior to such resignation or removal.

     SECTION 7.10. If the Trustee has or shall acquire any conflicting interest within the meaning of Section 310(b) of the TIA, the Trustee shall either eliminate such interest or resign, to the extent and in the manner provided by, and subject to the provisions of, the TIA and this Indenture.

If such corporation publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of federal, state, territorial or District of Columbia supervising or examining authority, then, for the purposes of this Section 7.11, the combined capital and surplus of such corporation shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published.

     SECTION 10.01. A Holder of a Security may convert such Security at any time during the applicable period stated in paragraph 6 of the Securities upon the occurrence of any of the events set forth in paragraph 6 of the Securities, subject to the provisions of this Article X. Subject to certain exceptions described in paragraph 6 of the Securities and Section 10.22, if a Holder surrenders its Securities for conversion, such Holder will receive, in respect of each $1,000 of Principal Amount, the Conversion Value which shall be paid as follows:
Conversion Privilege.
     (a) cash in an amount equal to the lesser of (1) $1,000 and (2) the Conversion Value (the ""); and
Required Cash Amount
 
     (b) if the Conversion Value is greater than $1,000, a number of shares of Common Stock (the ""), equal to the sum of the Daily Share Amounts for each of the fifteen consecutive Trading Days in the Conversion Reference Period, appropriately adjusted in accordance with this Article X to reflect stock splits, stock dividends, combinations or similar events occurring during the Conversion Reference Period, subject to the right of the Company to deliver cash in lieu of all or a portion of such Remaining Shares as described in this Section 10.01.
Remaining Shares
     On any day prior to the first Trading Day of the applicable Conversion Reference Period, the Company may specify a percentage of the Daily Share Amount that will be settled in cash (the "") and will promptly deliver, in accordance with Section 12.02, written notice thereof to the Trustee, who will promptly thereafter give a copy of such notice to the Conversion Agent and the Holders (the ""). If the Company elects to specify a Cash Percentage, the amount of cash that the Company will deliver in respect of each Trading Day in the applicable Conversion Reference Period will equal the product of: (1) the Cash Percentage, (2) the Daily Share Amount for such Trading Day, and (3) the Volume Weighted Average Price of the Common Stock for such Trading Day (that after the consummation of a Change in Control in which the consideration is comprised entirely of cash, the amount used in this clause (3) will be the cash price per share of Common Stock received by holders of Common Stock in such Change in Control). The number of shares deliverable in respect of each Trading Day in the applicable Conversion Reference Period will be a percentage of the Daily Share Amount equal to 100% minus the Cash Percentage. If the Company does not specify a Cash Percentage by the start of the applicable Conversion Reference Period, the Company shall settle 100% of the Daily Share Amount for each Trading Day in the applicable Conversion Reference Period with shares of Common Stock; , that the Company will pay cash in lieu of fractional shares otherwise issuable upon conversion of such Security, pursuant to Section 10.03 hereof. The Company may, at its option, revoke any Cash Percentage Notice through written notice to the Trustee prior to the start of the applicable Conversion Reference Period, who will promptly thereafter give a copy of such notice to the Conversion Agent and the Holders.
Cash Percentage
Cash Percentage Notice
provided
provided, however
     A Holder may convert a portion of the Principal Amount of a Security if the portion is $1,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000. Provisions of this Indenture that apply to conversion of all of a Security also apply to conversion of a portion of a Security.
     In the event of a stock split, combination, dividend or any other event resulting in an adjustment to the Conversion Rate pursuant to Sections 10.06, 10.07, 10.08, 10.09 or 10.10, during the applicable Conversion Reference Period, appropriate adjustment to the equation for calculating Conversion Value shall be made, as determined by the Board of Directors.
     Promptly after the Company has determined the amount of cash and the number of shares of Common Stock to be delivered with respect to each $1,000 Principal Amount of Securities that have been presented to the Conversion Agent for conversion, the Company shall give the Trustee and the Conversion Agent notice thereof.
 
     Whenever any event described in paragraph 6(a), paragraph 6(b) or paragraph 6(c) of the Securities shall occur such that the Securities become convertible as provided in this Article X, the Company shall (x) issue a press release and use its reasonable efforts to post such information on its website or otherwise publicly disclose this information or (y) promptly deliver, in accordance with Section 12.02, written notice of the convertibility of the Securities to the Holders, which press release, website posting, public disclosure or written notice, as the case may be, shall include:
     (a) a description of such event;
     (b) a description of the periods during which the Securities shall be convertible as provided in paragraph 6(a), paragraph 6(b) or paragraph 6(c) of the Securities as a result of such event;
     (c) a statement of whether an adjustment to the Conversion Rate shall take effect in respect of such event pursuant to Section 10.11; and
     (d) the procedures Holders must follow to convert their Securities in accordance with this Article X, including the name and address of the Conversion Agent.
     SECTION 10.02. To convert a Security, a Holder must satisfy the requirements in paragraph 6 of the Securities. The Conversion Agent shall, within one (1) Business Day of a Conversion Date, provide notice to the Company as set forth in Section 12.02(b) of the Principal Amount of Securities that have been converted with respect to such Conversion Date.
Conversion Procedure.
     As promptly as practicable following the last day of the Conversion Reference Period applicable to the Securities being converted, the Company shall deliver to the Holder of the Security being converted, through the Conversion Agent, the Required Cash Amount and Net Share Amount, if any (including cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 10.03 hereof). The person in whose name the certificate representing any shares is registered shall be treated as a stockholder of record on and after the Conversion Date; , that a Conversion Date on any date when the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed shall not be effective to constitute the person or persons entitled to receive the Net Share Amount upon such conversion as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on such date, but shall be effective to constitute the person or persons entitled to receive such shares of Common Stock as the record holder or holders thereof for all purposes at the Close of Business on the next succeeding day on which such stock transfer books are open; such conversion shall be at the Conversion Rate in effect on the Conversion Date, even if the stock transfer books of the Company are closed. Upon conversion of a Security, the Holder thereof shall no longer be a Holder of such Security.
provided, however
     No payment or adjustment will be made for dividends on, or other distributions with respect to, any Common Stock except as provided in this Article X. On conversion of a Security, accrued interest with respect to the converted Security shall not be cancelled, extinguished or forfeited, but rather shall be deemed to be paid in full to the Holder thereof through delivery of the Required Cash Amount and the Net Share Amount, if any (together with the cash payment, if
 
any, in lieu of fractional shares) in exchange for the Security being converted pursuant to the provisions hereof.
     If the Holder converts more than one Security at the same time, the Required Cash Amount and the Net Share Amount, if any (together with the cash payment, if any, in lieu of fractional shares) shall be based on the total Principal Amount of the Securities converted.
     If the last day on which a Security may be converted is a Legal Holiday, the Security may be surrendered on the next succeeding day that is not a Legal Holiday.
     Upon surrender of a Security that is converted in part, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder, a new Security in an authorized denomination equal in Principal Amount to the unconverted portion of the Security surrendered.
     SECTION 10.03. The Company will not issue a fractional share of Common Stock upon conversion of a Security. Instead, the Company will deliver cash for the current market value of the fractional share. The current market value of a fractional share shall equal the arithmetic average of the Volume Weighted Average Price of the Common Stock for each of the fifteen consecutive Trading Days of the Conversion Reference Period, rounded to the nearest whole cent.
Fractional Shares.
     SECTION 10.04. If a Holder converts a Security, the Company shall pay any documentary, stamp or similar issue or transfer tax due on the issue of any shares of Common Stock upon the conversion. However, the Holder shall pay any such tax which is due because the Holder requests the shares to be issued in a name other than the Holder's name. The Conversion Agent may refuse to deliver the certificates representing the Common Stock being issued in a name other than the Holder's name until the Conversion Agent receives a sum sufficient to pay any tax which will be due because the shares are to be delivered in a name other than the Holder's name. Nothing herein shall preclude any tax withholding required by law or regulations.
Taxes on Conversion.
     SECTION 10.05. The Company shall, prior to the Issue Date, and from time to time as may be necessary, reserve out of its authorized but unissued Common Stock a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock to permit the payment of the Remaining Shares, if applicable, upon conversion of the Securities.
Company to Provide Stock.
     All shares of Common Stock delivered upon payment of any Remaining Shares, if applicable, upon conversion of the Securities shall be newly issued shares or treasury shares, shall be duly and validly issued and fully paid and nonassessable and shall be free from preemptive rights and free of any lien or adverse claim.
     The Company will comply with all federal and state securities laws regulating the offer and delivery of shares of Common Stock upon payment of any Remaining Shares, if applicable, upon conversion of Securities, if any, and will list or cause to have quoted such shares of Common Stock on each national securities exchange or in the over-the-counter market or such other market on which the Common Stock is then listed or quoted.
 
     SECTION 10.06. If, after the Issue Date of the Securities, the Company:
Adjustment for Change in Capital Stock.
     (a) pays a dividend or makes a distribution on its Common Stock payable in shares of its Common Stock or shares of its Capital Stock;
     (b) subdivides or combines its shares of Common Stock; or
     (c) issues by reclassification of its Common Stock any shares of its Capital Stock (other than rights, warrants or options for its Capital Stock),
then the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to such action shall be adjusted so that the Holder of a Security thereafter converted may receive the number of shares of Capital Stock of the Company which such Holder would have owned immediately following such action if such Holder had converted the Security immediately prior to such action.
     The adjustment shall become effective immediately after the record date in the case of a dividend or distribution and immediately after the effective date in the case of a subdivision, combination or reclassification.
     If after an adjustment a Holder of a Security upon conversion of such Security may receive shares of two or more classes of Capital Stock of the Company, the Conversion Rate shall thereafter be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of an action taken with respect to any such class of Capital Stock as is contemplated by this Article X with respect to the Common Stock, on terms comparable to those applicable to Common Stock in this Article X.
     SECTION 10.07. If, after the Issue Date of the Securities, the Company distributes any rights, warrants or options to all holders of its Common Stock entitling them, for a period expiring within 60 days after the record date for such distribution, to purchase shares of Common Stock at a price per share less than the Average Closing Price, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted in accordance with the formula:
Adjustment for Rights Issue.
where,
R' = the adjusted Conversion Rate.
R = the current Conversion Rate.
O = the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on the record date for the distribution to which this Section 10.07 is being applied.
N = the number of additional shares of Common Stock offered pursuant to the distribution.
 
P = the offering price per share of the additional shares.
M = the Average Closing Price, minus, in the case of (i) a distribution to which Section 10.06(c) applies or (ii) a distribution to which Section 10.08 applies, for which, in each case, (x) the record date shall occur on or before the record date for the distribution to which this Section 10.07 applies and (y) the Ex-Dividend Time shall occur on or after the date of the first public announcement for the distribution to which this Section 10.07 applies, the fair market value (on the record date for the distribution to which this Section 10.07 applies) of the
     (a) Capital Stock of the Company distributed in respect of each share of Common Stock in such Section 10.06(c) distribution and
     (b) assets of the Company or debt securities or any rights, warrants or options to purchase securities of the Company distributed in respect of each share of Common Stock in such Section 10.08 distribution.
     The Board of Directors shall determine fair market values for the purposes of this Section 10.07.
     In the event the Company makes a distribution pursuant to this Section 10.07 the Company will be required to give notice to the holders of Securities at least 20 days prior to the Ex-Dividend Date, as defined below, for such distribution.
     The adjustment shall become effective immediately after the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive the rights, warrants or options to which this Section 10.07 applies. If all of the shares of Common Stock subject to such rights, warrants or options have not been issued when such rights, warrants or options expire, then the Conversion Rate shall promptly be readjusted to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect had the adjustment upon the issuance of such rights, warrants or options been made on the basis of the actual number of shares of Common Stock issued upon the exercise of such rights, warrants or options.
     No adjustment shall be made under this Section 10.07 if the application of the formula stated above in this Section 10.07 would result in a value of R' that is equal to or less than the value of R.
     SECTION 10.08. .
Adjustment for Other Distributions
     (a) If, after the Issue Date of the Securities, the Company distributes to all holders of its Common Stock any of its assets (excluding distributions of Capital Stock or equity interests referred to in Section 10.08(b)), or debt securities or any rights, warrants or options to purchase securities of the Company (including securities or cash, but excluding (x) distributions of Capital Stock referred to in Section 10.06 and distributions of rights, warrants or options referred to in Section 10.07 and (y) cash dividends or other cash distributions referred to in Section 10.09), the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted, subject to the provisions of Section 10.08(c), in accordance with the formula:
 
where,
R' = the adjusted Conversion Rate.
R = the current Conversion Rate.
M = the Average Closing Price, minus, in the case of a distribution to which Section 10.06(a) applies, for which (i) the record date shall occur on or before the record date for the distribution to which this Section 10.08(a) applies and (ii) the Ex-Dividend Time shall occur on or after the date of the Time of Determination for the distribution to which this Section 10.08(a) applies, the fair market value (on the record date for the distribution to which this Section 10.08(a) applies) of any Capital Stock of the Company distributed in respect of each share of Common Stock in such Section 10.06(a) distribution.
F = the fair market value (on the record date for the distribution to which this Section 10.08(a) applies) of the assets, securities, rights, warrants or options to be distributed in respect of each share of Common Stock in the distribution to which this Section 10.08(a) is being applied (including, in the case of cash dividends or other cash distributions giving rise to an adjustment under this Section 10.08(a), all such cash distributed concurrently).
     The Board of Directors shall determine fair market values for the purposes of this Section 10.08(a).
     The adjustment shall become effective immediately after the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive the distribution to which this Section 10.08(a) applies.
     (b) If, after the Issue Date of the Securities, the Company pays a dividend or makes a distribution to all holders of its Common Stock consisting of Capital Stock of any class or series, or similar equity interests, of or relating to a Subsidiary or other business unit of the Company, then the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted in accordance with the formula:
where,
R' = the adjusted Conversion Rate.
R = the current Conversion Rate.
M = the average of the Post-Distribution Prices of the Common Stock for the fifteen Trading Days commencing on and including the fifth Trading Day after the date on which "ex-dividend
 
trading" commences for such dividend or distribution on the principal United States exchange or market which such securities are then listed or quoted (the "").
Ex-Dividend Date
F = the fair market value of the securities distributed in respect of each share of Common Stock for which this Section 10.08(b) is being applied and shall mean the number of securities distributed in respect of each share of Common Stock multiplied by the average of the Post-Distribution Prices of those securities distributed for the fifteen Trading Days commencing on and including the fifth Trading Day after the Ex-Dividend Date.
     "" of Capital Stock or any similar equity interest on any date means the closing per unit price (or, if no closing price is reported, the average of the bid and ask prices or, if more than one in either case, the average of the average bid and the average ask prices) on such date for trading of such units on a "when issued" basis without due bills (or similar concept) as reported in the composite transactions for the principal United States securities exchange on which such Capital Stock or equity interest is traded or, if the Capital Stock or equity interest, as the case may be, is not listed on a United States national or regional securities exchange, as reported by the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System or by the National Quotation Bureau Incorporated; that if on any date such units have not traded on a "when issued" basis, the Post-Distribution Price shall be the closing per unit price (or, if no closing price is reported, the average of the bid and ask prices or, if more than one in either case, the average of the average bid and the average ask prices) on such date for trading of such units on a "regular way" basis without due bills (or similar concept) as reported in the composite transactions for the principal United States securities exchange on which such Capital Stock or equity interest is traded or, if the Capital Stock or equity interest, as the case may be, is not listed on a United States national or regional securities exchange, as reported by the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System or by the National Quotation Bureau Incorporated. In the absence of such quotation, the Company shall be entitled to determine the Post-Distribution Price on the basis of such quotations which reflect the post-distribution value of the Capital Stock or equity interests as it considers appropriate.
Post-Distribution Price
provided
     (c) In the event that, with respect to any distribution to which Section 10.08(a) would otherwise apply, the difference "M-F" as defined in the formula set forth in Section 10.08(a) is less than $1.00 or "F" is equal to or greater than "M", then the adjustment provided by Section 10.08(a) shall not be made and in lieu thereof the provisions of Section 10.16 shall apply to such distribution.
     (d) In the event the Company makes a distribution pursuant to this Section 10.08 which has a per share value equal to more than 15% of the Closing Price of shares of Common Stock on the day preceding the declaration date for such distribution, the Company will be required to give notice to the holders of Securities at least 20 days prior to the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution.
     SECTION 10.09. If, after the Issue Date of the Securities, the Company distributes to all or substantially all holders of its Common Stock any cash (excluding (a) any quarterly cash dividend on the Company's Common Stock to the extent

C = the amount in cash per share that the Company distributes to holders of the Common Stock.
     If the Company fails to pay a cash dividend or distribution for a period in which a regularly scheduled quarterly dividend has previously been paid in accordance with past practice, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted using the formula in this Section 10.09, with the Ex-Dividend Date being deemed to be the second to last Trading Day in the second month of the calendar quarter in question, and "C" being deemed to be zero.
     SECTION 10.10. If, after the Issue Date, the Company makes a payment of cash or other consideration by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to holders of Common Stock in respect of a tender offer or exchange offer, other than an odd-lot offer, for the Common Stock, and the value of the sum of (i) the aggregate cash and other consideration paid for such Common Stock, and (ii) the aggregate fair market value of any consideration paid for the purchase of Common Stock in respect of a tender offer or exchange

R' = the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the Expiration Time;
R = the Conversion Rate in effect on the Expiration Time;
F = the fair market value (as determined by the Board of Directors) of the aggregate value of all cash and any other consideration paid or payable for shares of Common Stock validly tendered or exchanged and not withdrawn as of the Expiration Time (the "");

O' = the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after the Expiration Time, including any Purchased Shares; and
P = the Closing Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day next succeeding the Expiration Time.
Such increase (if any) shall become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the Expiration Time. In the event that the Company is obligated to purchase shares pursuant to any such tender offer, but the Company is prevented by applicable law from effecting any such purchases or all such purchases are rescinded, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such tender or exchange offer had not been made. If the application of this Section 10.10 to any tender or exchange offer would result in a decrease in the Conversion Rate, no adjustment shall be made for such tender or exchange offer under this Section 10.10.
     SECTION 10.11. If, after the Issue Date, a Change in Control occurs and a Holder elects to convert its Securities in connection with such Change in Control, the Company will increase the Applicable Conversion Rate for the Securities surrendered for conversion by a number of additional shares of Common Stock (the ""), as described in this Section 10.11. A conversion of Securities will be deemed for the purposes of this Section 10.11 to be "in connection with" a
Adjustment to Conversion Rate Upon Change in Control Transactions.
Make-Whole Shares
 
Change in Control transaction if the notice of conversion of the Securities is received by the Conversion Agent from and including the effective date of the Change in Control, up to and including the Trading Day prior to the related Change in Control Purchase Date.
     The number of Make-Whole Shares will be determined by reference to the table below and is based on the date which such Change in Control transaction becomes effective (the "") and the price (the "") paid per share of Common Stock in such Change in Control transaction. If the holders of Common Stock receive only cash in the Change in Control transaction, the Stock Price shall be the cash amount paid per share of Common Stock. Otherwise, the Stock Price shall be the average of the Closing Prices of the Common Stock on the fifteen consecutive Trading Days up to but excluding the Change in Control Effective Date.
Change in Control Effective Date
Stock Price
     The Stock Prices set forth in the first column of the table below will be adjusted as of any date on which the Conversion Rate is adjusted. The adjusted Stock Prices will equal the Stock Prices applicable immediately prior to such adjustment, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Applicable Conversion Rate immediately prior to the adjustment giving rise to the Stock Price adjustment and the denominator of which is the Applicable Conversion Rate as so adjusted. The number of Make-Whole Shares set forth in the table below will be adjusted at the same time and in the same manner as the Conversion Rate.
     If the exact Stock Prices and Change in Control Effective Dates are not set forth in the table, then: (a) if the Stock Price is between two Stock Price amounts in the table or the Change in Control Effective Date is between two dates in the table, the Make-Whole Shares issued upon conversion of the Securities will be determined by a straight-line interpolation between the number of Make-Whole Shares set forth for the higher and lower Stock Price amounts and the two dates in the table, based on a 365-day year, (b) if the Stock Price exceeds $150.00 per share, subject to adjustment as set forth herein, no Make-Whole Shares will be issued upon conversion of the Securities; and (c) if the Stock Price is less than $35.75 per share, subject to adjustment as set forth herein, no Make-Whole Shares will be issued upon conversion of the Securities.
 
     SECTION 10.12. No adjustment in the Conversion Rate need be made unless the adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 1% of the Conversion Rate. Any adjustments that are less than 1% of the Conversion Rate shall be carried forward and taken into account in determining any subsequent adjustment. In addition, the Company shall make and pay any carry forward adjustments not otherwise effected upon conversion of a Security on the earlier of the Change in Control Purchase Date and the date five Business Days prior to the Stated Maturity Date.
When Adjustment May Be Deferred.
     SECTION 10.13. No adjustment need be made for a transaction referred to in Section 10.06, 10.07, 10.08, 10.09, 10.10 or 10.16 if Holders are to participate in the transaction on a basis and with notice that the Board of Directors determines to be fair and appropriate in light of the basis and notice on which holders of Common Stock participate in the transaction. Such participation by Holders may include participation upon conversion; that an adjustment shall be made at such time as the Holders are no longer entitled to participate.
When No Adjustment Required; Conversion Rate Cap.
provided
     No adjustment need be made for rights to purchase Common Stock pursuant to a Company plan for reinvestment of dividends or interest.
     No adjustment need be made for a change in the par value or no par value of the Common Stock.
     To the extent the Securities become convertible pursuant to this Article X into cash, no adjustment need be made thereafter as to the cash. Interest will not accrue on the cash.
     Further, notwithstanding anything in Article X, the Conversion Rate shall not exceed 27.9720 per $1,000 Principal Amount of the Securities other than as a result of proportional adjustments to the Conversion Rate described in Sections 10.06, 10.07 and 10.08.
     SECTION 10.14. Whenever the Conversion Rate is adjusted, the Company shall promptly mail to Holders a notice of the adjustment. The Company shall promptly file with the Trustee and the Conversion Agent such notice and an Officers' Certificate briefly stating the facts requiring the adjustment and the manner of computing it. The certificate shall be conclusive evidence that the adjustment is correct. Neither the Trustee nor any Conversion Agent shall be under any duty or responsibility with respect to any such certificate except to exhibit the same to any Holder desiring inspection thereof.
Notice of Adjustment.
     All calculations under this Article X shall be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest 1/1,000th of a share, as the case may be (with one-half cent and 5/10,000ths of a share being rounded upward).
     SECTION 10.15. . If:
Notice of Certain Transactions
     (a) the Company takes any action that would require an adjustment in the Conversion Rate pursuant to Section 10.06, 10.07, 10.08, 10.09, 10.10 or 10.11 (unless no adjustment is to occur pursuant to Section 10.13); or
 
     (b) the Company takes any action that would require a supplemental indenture pursuant to Section 10.16; or
     (c) there is a liquidation or dissolution of the Company;
then the Company shall mail to Holders and file with the Trustee and the Conversion Agent a notice stating the proposed record date for a dividend or distribution or the proposed effective date of a subdivision, combination, reclassification, consolidation, merger, binding share exchange, transfer, liquidation or dissolution. The Company shall file and mail the notice at least 15 days (10 days in the case of a cash dividend that would require an adjustment under Section 10.09) before such date. Failure to file or mail the notice or any defect in it shall not affect the validity of the transaction.
     SECTION 10.16. If the Company is a party to a transaction subject to Section 5.01 (other than a sale, transfer or lease of the assets of the Company substantially as an entirety in a transaction in which the holders of Common Stock immediately prior to such transaction do not receive securities, cash or other assets of the Company or any other person) or a merger or binding share exchange which reclassifies or changes the outstanding Common Stock of the Company, the person obligated to deliver securities, cash or other assets upon conversion of Securities shall enter into a supplemental indenture. If the issuer of securities deliverable upon conversion of Securities is an Affiliate of the successor Company, that issuer shall join in the supplemental indenture.
Reorganization of Company; Special Distributions.
     The supplemental indenture shall provide that after the effective time of the transaction, settlement of the Conversion Value will be based on the kind and amount of cash, securities or other assets of the Company or another Person that a holder of Common Stock received in such transaction; that, for the avoidance of doubt, the Conversion Value will be paid in cash and at the Company's election, cash, securities or a combination of cash and securities in accordance with the terms of this Article X. If the holders of Common Stock of the Company have the opportunity to elect the form of consideration to be received in such transaction, then from and after the effective date of such transaction, the Securities shall be convertible into the consideration that the majority of the holders of Common Stock of the Company who made such an election received in such transaction. The supplemental indenture shall provide for adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practical to the adjustments provided for in this Article X. The successor Company shall mail to Holders a notice briefly describing the supplemental indenture.
provided
     If this Section applies, neither Section 10.06 nor 10.07 applies. If the Company makes a distribution to all holders of its Common Stock of any of its assets, or debt securities or any rights, warrants or options to purchase securities of the Company that, but for the provisions of Section 10.08(c), would otherwise result in an adjustment in the Conversion Rate pursuant to the provisions of Section 10.08, then, from and after the record date for determining the holders of Common Stock entitled to receive the distribution, a Holder of a Security that converts such Security in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture shall upon such conversion be entitled to receive, in addition to the shares of Common Stock into which the Security is convertible, the kind and amount of securities, cash or other assets comprising the distribution
 
that such Holder would have received if such Holder had converted the Security immediately prior to the record date for determining the holders of Common Stock entitled to receive the distribution.
     SECTION 10.17. . Any determination that the Company or the Board of Directors must make pursuant to Section 10.01, 10.03, 10.06, 10.07, 10.08, 10.09, 10.10, 10.11, 10.12, 10.13, 10.16 or 10.19 is conclusive.
Company Determination Final
     SECTION 10.18. The Trustee has no duty to determine when an adjustment under this Article X should be made, how it should be made or what it should be. The Trustee has no duty to determine whether a supplemental indenture under Section 10.16 need be entered into or whether any provisions of any supplemental indenture are correct. The Trustee shall not be accountable for and makes no representation as to the validity or value (or the kind or amount) of any securities or assets issued upon conversion of Securities. The Trustee shall not be responsible for the Company's failure to comply with this Article X or paragraph 6 of the Securities. Neither the Trustee nor the Conversion Agent shall be responsible for determining whether any event contemplated by paragraph 6 of the Securities has occurred that makes the Securities eligible for conversion or no longer eligible therefor until the Company has delivered to the Trustee and the Conversion Agent the notices referred to in said paragraph 6 with respect to the commencement or termination of such conversion rights, on which notices the Trustee and the Conversion Agent may conclusively rely, and the Company agrees to deliver such notices to the Trustee and the Conversion Agent immediately after the occurrence of any such event or at such other times as shall be provided for in said paragraph. Each Conversion Agent shall have the same protection under this Section 10.18 as the Trustee.
Trustee's Adjustment Disclaimer.
     SECTION 10.19. In the event that this Article X requires adjustments to the Conversion Rate under more than one of Sections 10.06(c), 10.07, 10.08 or 10.09, and the record dates for the distributions giving rise to such adjustments shall occur on the same date, then such adjustments shall be made by applying, first, the provisions of Section 10.06(c), second, the provisions of Section 10.08, third, the provisions of Section 10.09 and, fourth, the provisions of 10.07.
Simultaneous Adjustments.
     SECTION 10.20. After an adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this Article X, any subsequent event requiring an adjustment under this Article X shall cause an adjustment to the Conversion Rate as so adjusted.
Successive Adjustments.
     SECTION 10.21. If the Company pays withholding taxes on behalf of a Holder as a result of an adjustment to the Conversion Rate, the Company may, at its option, set off such payments against payments of cash and Common Stock on the Securities.
Withholding Taxes for Adjustments in Conversion Rate.
     SECTION 10.22. .
Exchange in Lieu of Conversion
     (a) Notwithstanding anything in this Indenture to the contrary, when a Holder surrenders Securities for conversion, the Company may direct the Conversion Agent to surrender, on or prior to the commencement of the relevant Conversion Reference Period, such Securities to a financial institution designated by the Company (which may not be an Affiliate of
 
the Company; provided that, for purposes of this Section 10.22, an "Affiliate" shall include any Person with direct or indirect ownership of 10% or more of the equity of the Company or the power, direct or indirect, to vote more than 10% of the securities having ordinary voting power for the election of directors of the Company) (a "") for exchange in lieu of conversion. The Company may, but is not required to, pay customary and reasonable fees in connection with the exchange.
Financial Institution
     (b) In order to accept any such Securities surrendered for conversion, the Financial Institution must agree to deliver, in exchange for such Securities, all cash or a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Value, at the option of the Financial Institution, all in accordance with Section 10.01.
     (c) By the Close of Business on the Trading Day immediately preceding the start of the Conversion Reference Period, the Company must notify the Holder surrendering Securities for conversion that it has directed the Conversion Agent to surrender such Securities to a Financial Institution for exchange in lieu of conversion and such Financial Institution must notify the Conversion Agent whether it will deliver, upon exchange, cash or a specified combination of cash and shares of Common Stock.
     (d) If the Financial Institution accepts any such Securities, it will deliver the appropriate number of shares of Common Stock, cash or a combination thereof, to the Conversion Agent and the Conversion Agent will deliver those shares of Common Stock or cash or combination thereof, as the case may be, to the Holder. Any Securities exchanged by such Financial Institution will remain outstanding.
     (e) If such Financial Institution agrees to accept any Securities for exchange but does not timely deliver the related consideration, or if such Financial Institution does not accept the Securities for exchange, the Company will, as promptly as practical thereafter, but not later than the third Business Day following the determination of the Conversion Value, convert the Securities into cash and shares, if any, of Common Stock, pursuant to Section 10.02.
     (f) The Company will not provide to the Financial Institution, directly or indirectly, any of such consideration delivered by the Financial Institution in exchange for such Securities.
     In no event will the Company's designation of a Financial Institution pursuant to this Section 10.22 require such Financial Institution to accept any Securities for exchange. The Company shall not be obligated to pay any consideration to, or otherwise enter into any agreement or arrangement with, a Financial Institution for or with respect to such designation pursuant to this Section 10.22.
     SECTION 10.23. . Each share of Common Stock issued upon conversion of Securities pursuant to this Article X shall be entitled to receive the appropriate number of rights, if any, and the certificates representing the Common Stock issued upon such conversion shall bear such legends, if any, in each case as may be provided by the terms of any shareholder rights plan adopted by the Company, as the same may be amended from time to time. If at the time of conversion, however, the rights have separated from the shares of Common
Shareholder Rights Plans
 
Stock in accordance with the provisions of the applicable shareholder rights agreement so that the Holders of the Securities would not be entitled to receive any rights in respect of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Securities, the Conversion Rate will be adjusted pursuant to Section 10.08(a), subject to readjustment in the event of the expiration, termination or redemption of the rights.
     SECTION 11.01. Interest on any Security that is payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the person in whose name that Security is registered at the Close of Business on the Regular Record Date for such interest at the office or agency of the Company maintained for such purpose. Each installment of interest on any Security shall be paid in same-day funds by transfer to an account maintained by the payee located inside the United States, if the Trustee shall have received proper wire transfer instructions from such payee not later than the related Regular Record Date or, if no such instructions have been received, by check mailed to the payee at its address set forth on the Registrar's books. In the case of a Global Security, interest payable on any Interest Payment Date will be paid to the Depositary for the purpose of permitting such party to credit the payment received by it in respect of such Global Security to the accounts of the beneficial owners thereof.
Interest Payments.
     SECTION 11.02. Any interest on any Security that is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly provided for, within 30 days following any Interest Payment Date (herein called "", which term shall include any accrued and unpaid interest that has accrued on such defaulted amount in accordance with paragraph 1 of the Securities), shall forthwith cease to be payable to the registered Holder thereof on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder, and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company, at its election in each case, as provided in clause (a) or (b) below.
Defaulted Interest.
Defaulted Interest

The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each Security and the date of the proposed payment (which shall not be less than 20 days after such notice is received by the Trustee), and at the same time the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit on or prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this clause provided. Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a special record date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall be not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of such special record date
 
and, in the name and at the expense of the Company, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the special record date therefor to be mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder at such Holder's address as it appears on the Registrar's security register not less than 10 days prior to such special record date. Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the special record date therefor having been mailed as aforesaid, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the persons in whose names the Securities are registered at the Close of Business on such special record date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the following clause (b).
          (b) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest on the Securities in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which such Securities may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this clause, such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee.

1. Interest.
     This Security shall bear cash interest at the rate of 0.875% per annum. Interest on this Security shall accrue from February 22, 2007, or from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or provided for. Interest shall be payable semiannually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning on August 15, 2007 (each such day, an "Interest Payment Date"), to the holder of record hereof at the Close of Business on the February 1 or August 1, whether or not a Business Day, immediately preceding such Interest Payment Date. Each payment of cash interest on this Security shall include interest accrued for the period commencing on and including the immediately preceding Interest Payment Date (or, if none, February 22, 2007) through the day before the applicable Interest Payment Date or Stated Maturity Date or Change in Control Purchase Date, as the case may be. Any payment required to be made on any day that is not a Business Day shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and no interest shall accrue for the intervening period on the payment so deferred. Interest shall be calculated using a 360-day year composed of twelve 30-day months. Interest shall cease to accrue on this Security upon its Stated Maturity Date, conversion (except as otherwise provided herein) or purchase by the Company at the option of the Holder upon a Change in Control in accordance with paragraph 5 hereof.
     If the Principal Amount hereof or any portion of such Principal Amount is not paid when due (whether upon acceleration pursuant to Section 6.02 of the Indenture, upon the date set for payment of the Change in Control Purchase Price pursuant to paragraph 5 hereof or upon the Stated Maturity Date of this Security) or if interest (including Additional Interest, if any) due hereon or any portion of such interest is not paid when due in accordance with this paragraph or paragraph 5 or 7 hereof, then in each such case the overdue amount shall, to the extent permitted by law, bear interest at the rate of 0.875% per annum, compounded semiannually, which interest shall accrue from the date such overdue amount was originally due to the date payment of such amount, including interest thereon, has been made or duly provided for.
2. Method of Payment.
     Subject to the terms and conditions of the Indenture, the Company will make payments in respect of Change in Control Purchase Prices and at the Stated Maturity Date to Holders who surrender Securities to a Paying Agent to collect such payments in respect of the Securities. The Company will pay any cash amounts in money of the United States that at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts. The Company may make such cash payments by check payable in such money or, subject to the provisions of the Indenture, by wire transfer.
 
3. Paying Agent, Conversion Agent and Registrar.

     The Securities are senior unsecured obligations of the Company limited to $1,150,000,000 aggregate Principal Amount (subject to Section 2.07 of the Indenture). The Indenture does not limit other indebtedness of the Company, secured or unsecured.
5. Purchase by the Company at the Option of the Holder upon a Change in Control.
     At the option of the Holder and subject to the terms and conditions of the Indenture, the Company shall become obligated to purchase the Securities held by such Holder no later than 35 Business Days after the occurrence of a Change in Control of the Company for a change in control purchase price equal to the Principal Amount of the Securities to be purchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the Change in Control Purchase Date (the "Change in Control Purchase Price"), unless the Change in Control Purchase Date is after a Regular Record Date and on or prior to the Interest Payment Date to which it relates, in which case interest accrued to the Interest Payment Date will be paid to Holders of the Securities as of the preceding Regular Record Date, which Change in Control Purchase Price shall be paid in cash.
     Holders have the right to withdraw any Change in Control Purchase Notice by delivering to the Paying Agent a written notice of withdrawal in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture.
     If cash sufficient to pay the Change in Control Purchase Price of all Securities or portions thereof to be purchased as of the Change in Control Purchase Date is deposited with the Paying Agent on or prior to the third Business Day following the Change in Control Purchase Date, interest shall cease to accrue on such Securities (or portions thereof) immediately after such Change in Control Purchase Date whether or not the Security is delivered to the Paying Agent, and the Holder thereof shall have no other rights as such (other than the right to receive the Change in Control Purchase Price and accrued and unpaid interest upon surrender of such Security).
 
6. Conversion.
     A Holder of a Security may convert such Security into cash and, at the option of the Company, shares of Common Stock of the Company during the periods specified below, if at least one of the following conditions is satisfied:
     (a) . During any calendar quarter commencing at any time after March 31, 2007, and only during such calendar quarter, if the Closing Price of the Common Stock for at least 20 Trading Days in the period of 30 consecutive Trading Days ending on the last Trading Day of the preceding calendar quarter exceeds 140% of the Conversion Price per share on the last day of such preceding calendar quarter. The Company will determine at or prior to the beginning of each calendar quarter commencing at any time after March 31, 2007 whether the Securities are convertible as a result of the price of the Common Stock and shall promptly notify the Trustee and the Conversion Agent thereof. Upon determining that the Holders are entitled to convert their Securities in accordance with the provisions described in the Indenture on account of this subsection (a), the Company will promptly (1) issue a press release and use its reasonable efforts to post such information on its website or otherwise publicly disclose this information or (2) provide notice to the Holders in a manner contemplated by the Indenture, including through the facilities of DTC.
Conversion Based on Common Stock Price
     (b) . During the five (5) consecutive Business Days immediately after any five (5) consecutive Trading Day period (such five (5) consecutive Trading Day period, the "") in which the average Trading Price (calculated using the Trading Price for each of the Trading Days in the Note Measurement Period) per $1,000 Principal Amount of the Securities was equal to or less than ninety-eight percent (98%) of the average Conversion Value during the Note Measurement Period (the ""). The Bid Solicitation Agent shall not have any obligation to determine the Trading Price unless the Company has requested such determination, and the Company shall have no obligation to make such request unless a Holder of at least five million dollars ($5,000,000) in aggregate Principal Amount of the Securities provides the Company with reasonable evidence that the Trading Price per $1,000 Principal Amount of the Securities would be equal to or less than ninety-eight percent (98%) of the Conversion Value. Upon receipt of such evidence, the Company shall instruct the Bid Solicitation Agent to determine the Trading Price per $1,000 Principal Amount of the Securities for each of the five (5) successive Trading Days immediately after the Company receives such evidence and on each Trading Day thereafter until the first Trading Day on which the Trading Price Condition is no longer satisfied. For purposes of this paragraph, the "Conversion Value" per $1,000 Principal Amount of Securities, on a given Trading Day, means the product of the Closing Price on such Trading Day and the Conversion Rate in effect on such Trading Day. Promptly after the Securities become convertible into cash and, if applicable, Common Stock in accordance with this clause (b) and promptly after the Securities become no longer so convertible in accordance with this clause (b), the Company shall give the Conversion Agent and the Trustee notice thereof. Upon determining that the Holders are entitled to convert their Securities in accordance with the provisions described in the Indenture on account of this subsection (b), the Company will promptly (1) issue a press release and use its reasonable efforts to post such information on its website or otherwise
Conversion Based on Trading Price

publicly disclose this information or (2) provide notice to the Holders in a manner contemplated by the Indenture, including through the facilities of DTC.
     Except as described below, the "" as referred to in this subsection (b), of the Securities on any day means the average secondary market bid quotations obtained by the Bid Solicitation Agent for $5,000,000 Principal Amount of Securities at approximately 4:00 p.m., New York City time, on such day from three independent nationally recognized securities dealers to be selected by the Company. However, if the Bid Solicitation Agent can reasonably obtain only two such bids, then the average of the two bids will instead be used, and if the Bid Solicitation Agent can reasonably obtain only one such bid, then that one bid will be used. Even still, if on any given day: (a) the Bid Solicitation Agent cannot reasonably obtain at least one bid for $5,000,000 Principal Amount of Securities from an independent nationally recognized securities dealer; or (b) in the Company's reasonable, good faith judgment, the bid quotation or quotations that the Bid Solicitation Agent has obtained are not indicative of the secondary market value of the Securities, then the Trading Price per $1,000 Principal Amount of the Securities will be deemed to be equal to 98% of the average Conversion Value of the Securities in effect on that day.

     (c) .
Conversion Upon Occurrence of Specified Corporate Transactions
     (i) During the period specified below, if the Company elects to distribute to all holders of Common Stock (i) rights or warrants entitling them to subscribe for or purchase, for a period expiring within 60 days after the record date for such distribution, Common Stock at less than the Average Closing Prices of the Common Stock, or (ii) cash, debt securities (or other evidence of Indebtedness) or other assets (excluding dividends or distributions described in Sections 10.06(a), 10.06(b) and 10.06(c) of the Indenture), which distribution pursuant to clause (ii), together with all other distributions within the preceding 12 months, has a per share value exceeding 15% of the Average Closing Price of the Common Stock.
     (ii) If the Company is a party to a Change in Control or a consolidation, merger, binding share exchange, transfer or lease of all or substantially all of the Company's assets, pursuant to which the Common Stock would be converted into cash, securities or other assets, at any time from or after the date which is 15 days prior to the anticipated effective time of the transaction until 35 days after the actual date of such transaction (or, if the transaction is a Change in Control, until the Change in Control Purchase Date). After the effective time of the transaction, settlement of the Conversion Value will be based on the kind and amount of cash, securities or other assets of the Company or another Person that a holder of Common Stock received in such transaction; that, for the avoidance of doubt, the Conversion Value will be paid in cash and at the Company's election, cash, securities or a combination of cash and securities in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. In the event holders of Common Stock have the opportunity to elect the form of consideration to be received in such transaction, then from and after the effective date of such transaction, the Securities shall be convertible (during the period that the Securities are otherwise convertible) into the consideration that a majority of the holders of Common Stock who made such an election received in such
provided
 
transaction.
     The Company will notify Holders (in the manner set forth in Section 10.01 of the Indenture), the Trustee and the Conversion Agent as promptly as practicable following the date the Company publicly announces such transaction (but in no event less than 15 days prior to the anticipated effective date of such transaction).
     If the Company makes a distribution described in paragraph (c)(i), the Company must notify Holders (in the manner set forth in Section 10.01 of the Indenture), the Trustee and the Conversion Agent at least 20 days prior to the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution. Once the Company has given such notice, Holders may surrender their Securities for conversion at any time until the earlier of the Close of Business on the Business Day prior to the Ex-Dividend Date or the Company's announcement that such distribution will not take place, even if the Securities are not otherwise convertible at that time. No adjustment to the ability of Holders to convert will be made if Holders are entitled to participate in the distribution without conversion.
     Promptly after the Securities are no longer convertible in accordance with this clause (c), the Company shall give the Trustee and the Conversion Agent written notice thereof.
     In the case of a Change in Control, (i) the Conversion Rate will be adjusted as described in Section 10.11 of the Indenture and (ii) the Holder can require the Company to purchase all or a portion of its Securities described in paragraph 5.
     A Security in respect of which a Holder has delivered a Change in Control Purchase Notice exercising the option of such Holder to require the Company to purchase such Security may be converted only if such notice of exercise is withdrawn in accordance with the terms of the Indenture.
     The Initial Conversion Rate is 22.8343 shares of Common Stock per $1,000 Principal Amount, subject to adjustment in certain events described in the Indenture. The Company will deliver cash or a check in lieu of any fractional share of Common Stock.
     Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Holders may surrender the Securities for conversion at any time on or after January 15, 2014, until the Close of Business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Stated Maturity Date.
     Accrued and unpaid interest will not be paid in cash on Securities that are converted but will be paid in the manner provided in the following paragraph; , that Securities surrendered for conversion during the period from the Close of Business on any Regular Record Date next preceding any Interest Payment Date to the opening of business on such Interest Payment Date, shall be entitled to receive such semiannual interest payable on such Securities on the corresponding Interest Payment Date and Securities surrendered for conversion during such periods must be accompanied by payment of an amount equal to the interest with respect thereto that the registered Holder is to receive; that no such payment need be made (i) in connection with any conversion following the Regular Record Date immediately preceding the final Interest Payment Date; (ii) if the Company has specified a Change in Control
provided, however
provided
 
Purchase Date that is after a Regular Record Date and on or prior to the corresponding Interest Payment Date; or (iii) to the extent of Defaulted Interest, if any Defaulted Interest exists at the time of conversion with respect to such Security.
     A Holder may convert a portion of a Security if the Principal Amount of such portion is $1,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000. No payment or adjustment will be made for dividends on the Common Stock except as provided in the Indenture. On conversion of a Security, a Holder will not receive, except as described herein, any cash payment representing accrued interest. Instead, accrued interest will be deemed paid by the cash and/or shares of Common Stock received by the Holder on conversion. Delivery to the Holder of such cash and/or shares will be deemed to satisfy the Company's obligation to pay (i) the Principal Amount of the Security and (ii) accrued and unpaid interest, and accrued interest with respect to the converted Security shall not be cancelled, extinguished or forfeited, but rather shall be deemed to be paid in full.
     The Company will not adjust the Conversion Rate to account for accrued interest.
     To convert a Security that is represented by a Global Security, a Holder must convert by book-entry transfer to the Conversion Agent through the facilities of the DTC. To convert a Security that is represented by a Certificated Security, a Holder must (1) complete and manually sign the conversion notice below and deliver such notice to the Conversion Agent, (2) surrender the Security to the Conversion Agent, (3) furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents if required by the Conversion Agent, the Company or the Trustee and (4) pay all transfer or similar tax, if required.
     To the extent provided in the Indenture, the Conversion Rate will be adjusted for dividends or distributions on Common Stock payable in Common Stock or other Capital Stock; subdivisions, combinations or certain reclassifications of Common Stock; distributions to all holders of Common Stock of certain rights to purchase Common Stock for a period expiring within 60 days of the record date for such distribution at less than the Average Closing Price of the Common Stock; distributions to such holders of assets (including shares of Capital Stock of a Subsidiary) or debt securities of the Company or certain rights to purchase securities of the Company; cash dividends or cash distributions; and distributions in respect of a tender offer or exchange offer of the Common Stock. However, no adjustment need be made if Holders may participate in the transaction or in certain other cases.
7. Defaulted Interest.
     Any Defaulted Interest on any Security shall forthwith cease to be payable to the registered Holder thereof on the relevant Regular Record Date, by virtue of having been such Holder, and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company as provided for in Section 11.02 of the Indenture.
8. Denominations; Transfer; Exchange.
     The Securities are in fully registered form, without coupons, in denominations of $1,000 of Principal Amount and integral multiples of $1,000. A Holder may transfer or exchange
 
Securities in accordance with the Indenture. The Registrar may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents and to pay any taxes and fees required by law or permitted by the Indenture. The Registrar need not register the transfer or exchange of any Securities in respect of which a Change in Control Purchase Notice has been given and not withdrawn (except, in the case of a Security to be purchased in part, the portion of the Security not to be purchased).
9. Persons Deemed Owners.
     Subject to Section 11.01 of the Indenture, the registered Holder of this Security may be treated as the owner of this Security for all purposes.
10. Unclaimed Money or Securities.
     The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall return to the Company upon written request any money or securities held by them for the payment of any amount with respect to the Securities that remains unclaimed for two years, subject to applicable unclaimed property laws. After return to the Company, the Trustee and the Paying Agent shall have no further responsibility with respect to such money or securities and the Holders entitled to the money or securities must look to the Company for payment as general creditors unless an applicable abandoned property law designates another person.
11. Amendment; Waiver.
     Subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Indenture, (i) the Indenture or the Securities may be amended with the written consent of the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate Principal Amount of the Securities at the time outstanding and (ii) certain Defaults may be waived with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate Principal Amount of the Securities at the time outstanding. Subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Indenture, without the consent of any Holder, the Company and the Trustee may amend the Indenture or the Securities to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency, to evidence the succession of another Person to the Company pursuant to Article V of the Indenture, to comply with Section 10.16 of the Indenture, to add guarantees with respect to the Securities, to secure the Company's obligations under this Security or to add to the Company's covenants or Events of Default for the benefit of the Holders or to surrender any right or power conferred, or to comply with any requirement of the TIA or the SEC in connection with the qualification of the Indenture under the TIA, or as necessary in connection with the registration of the Securities under the Securities Act, to evidence and provide for the acceptance of appointment under the Indenture by a successor Trustee, to make any change that does not adversely affect the rights of any Holders in any material respect or to eliminate the Company's option to elect to pay cash to Holders of Securities surrendered for conversion in lieu of all or a portion of the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Securities pursuant to Section 10.02 of the Indenture.
12. Defaults and Remedies.
     Under the Indenture, Events of Default include: (1) the Company defaults in payment of
 
any interest due on the Securities, which default continues for 30 days; (2) the Company defaults in the payment of the Principal Amount or Change in Control Purchase Price, when the same becomes due and payable; (3) the Company fails to comply with any of its covenants or warranties in the Indenture (other than those referred to in clauses (1) and (2) above) and such failure continues for 90 days after the giving to the Company of a Notice of Default; (4) the Company defaults in respect of any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Company or any consolidated Subsidiary, or under any Mortgage, indenture or instrument under which such Indebtedness is issued or secured, which default results in the acceleration of Indebtedness with an aggregate outstanding principal amount in excess of $50,000,000, unless the acceleration is rescinded, or such debt is paid or waived within 10 days after the giving to the Company of a Notice of Default; and (5) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency. If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee, or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate Principal Amount of the Securities at the time outstanding, may declare the Principal Amount through the date of such declaration, and any accrued and unpaid interest through the date of such declaration, on all the Securities to be due and payable immediately. Certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency are Events of Default which will result in the Principal Amount on the Securities, and any accrued and unpaid interest through the occurrence of such event, becoming due and payable immediately upon the occurrence of such Events of Default.
     Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Securities except as provided in the Indenture. The Trustee may refuse to enforce the Indenture or the Securities unless it receives indemnity or security satisfactory to it. Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in aggregate Principal Amount of the Securities at the time outstanding may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The Trustee may withhold from Holders notice of any continuing Default (except a Default in payment of amounts specified in clause (1) or (2) above) if it determines that withholding notice is in their interests.
13. Trustee Dealings with the Company.
     Subject to certain limitations imposed by the TIA, the Trustee under the Indenture, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Securities and may otherwise deal with and collect obligations owed to it by the Company or its Affiliates and may otherwise deal with the Company or its Affiliates with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee.
14. No Recourse Against Others.
     A director, officer, employee or stockholder, as such, of the Company shall not have any liability for any obligations of the Company under the Securities or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such obligations or their creation. By accepting a Security, each Holder waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for the issue of the Securities.
15. Authentication.
     This Security shall not be valid until an authorized signatory of the Trustee manually
 
signs the Trustee's Certificate of Authentication on the other side of this Security.
16. Abbreviations.
     Customary abbreviations may be used in the name of a Holder or an assignee, such as TEN COM (=tenants in common), TEN ENT (=tenants by the entireties), JT TEN (=joint tenants with right of survivorship and not as tenants in common), CUST (=custodian), and U/G/M/A (=Uniform Gift to Minors Act).

     (c) Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, no Holder of Registrable Securities may include any of its Registrable Securities in the Shelf Registration Statement pursuant to this Agreement unless the Holder furnishes to the Company a fully completed notice and questionnaire in the form attached as Annex A to the Final Memorandum (the "Questionnaire") and such other information in writing as the Company may reasonably request in writing for use in connection with the Shelf Registration Statement or Prospectus included therein and in any application to be filed with or under state securities laws.

securityholder in the Shelf Registration Statement or Prospectus at the time of effectiveness of the Shelf Registration Statement or such Prospectus, as applicable, each Holder must no later than 20 days following notice by the Company of such filing, furnish the completed Questionnaire and such other information that the Company may reasonably request in writing, if any, to the Company in writing and the Company will include the information from the completed Questionnaire and such other information, if any, in the Shelf Registration Statement and the Prospectus, as necessary and in a manner, so that upon effectiveness of the Shelf Registration Statement the Holder will be permitted to deliver the Prospectus to purchasers of the Holder's Registrable Securities. From and after the date that the Shelf Registration Statement becomes effective, upon receipt of a completed Questionnaire and such other information that the Company may reasonably request in writing, if any, the Company will use its reasonable efforts to file any amendments or supplements to the Shelf Registration Statement necessary for such Holder to be named as a selling securityholder in the Prospectus contained therein to permit such Holder to deliver the Prospectus to purchasers of the Holder's Securities (subject to the Company's right to suspend the Shelf Registration Statement as described in Section 2.5 below); , , that the Company shall not be required to file any such amendment or supplement to the Shelf Registration Statement until such time as the Company has received completed Questionnaires with respect to at least $100 million aggregate principal amount of Registrable Securities and in no event more than once in any calendar quarter.

     (d) Each Holder agrees that if such Holder wishes to sell Registrable Securities pursuant to a Shelf Registration Statement and related Prospectus it will do so only in accordance with Section 2.1(c) and Section 2.5. Each Holder agrees not to sell any Registrable Securities pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement without delivering, or causing to be delivered, a Prospectus to the purchaser thereof and, following termination of the Effectiveness Period, to notify the Company, within ten days of a written request by the Company, of the amount of Registrable Securities sold pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement and, in the absence of a response, the Company may assume that all of such Holder's Registrable Securities have been so sold.
     (e) The Company represents and agrees that, unless it obtains the prior consent of a majority of the Registrable Securities that are registered under the Shelf Registration Statement at such time or the consent of the managing Underwriter in connection with any underwritten offering of Registrable Securities, and each Holder represents and agrees that, unless it obtains the prior consent of the Company and any such Underwriter, it will not make any offer relating to the Securities that would constitute an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or that would otherwise constitute a Free Writing Prospectus, required to be filed with the SEC. The Company represents that any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus will not include any information that conflicts with the information contained in the Shelf Registration Statement or the Prospectus; and that any Issuer
 
Free Writing Prospectus, when taken together with the information in the Shelf Registration Statement and the Prospectus, will not include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
     The Company agrees to supplement or amend the Shelf Registration Statement if required by the rules, regulations or instructions applicable to the registration form used by the Company, or to the extent the Company does not reasonably object, as reasonably requested by the Initial Purchasers with respect to information relating to such Initial Purchaser or by a Holder with respect to information relating to such Holder, and to furnish to the Holders of Registrable Securities copies of any such supplement or amendment promptly after its being used or filed with the SEC.
     2.2 . The Company shall pay all Registration Expenses in connection with the registration pursuant to Section 2.1. Each Holder shall pay all underwriting discounts and commissions and transfer taxes, if any, relating to the sale or disposition of such Holder's Registrable Securities pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement.

After a Shelf Registration Statement is effective, if the offering of Registrable Securities pursuant to a Shelf Registration Statement is interfered with by any stop order, injunction or other order or requirement of the SEC or any other governmental agency or court, such Shelf Registration Statement will be deemed not to have been effective during the period of such interference, until the offering of Registrable Securities pursuant to such Shelf Registration Statement may legally resume.

     2.4 . In the event that (a) a Shelf Registration Statement has not been filed with the SEC and become effective on or before the 220 calendar day following the first Closing Time, (b) after effectiveness, subject to Section 2.5, the Shelf Registration Statement fails to be effective or usable by the Holders without being succeeded within ten business days by a post-effective amendment or a report filed with the SEC pursuant to the 1934 Act that cures the failure to be effective or usable, or (c) the Shelf Registration Statement is unusable by the Holders for any reason, and the number of days for which the Shelf Registration Statement shall not be usable exceeds the Suspension Period (as defined in Section 2.5) (each such event being a "Registration Default"), additional interest, as liquidated damages ("Liquidated Damages"), will accrue at a rate per annum of 0.125% of the principal amount of the Registrable Securities then remaining for the first 90-day period from and including the day following the Registration Default, and thereafter at a rate per annum of 0.25% of the principal amount of the Registrable Securities; that in no event shall Liquidated Damages accrue at a rate per annum exceeding 0.25% of the principal amount of the Registrable Securities; and that no Liquidated Damages shall accrue after the second anniversary of the first Closing Time; and that Liquidated Damages shall not accrue under clause (b) or (c) above with respect to any Holder that (x) does not submit a properly completed Questionnaire and (y) is not named as a selling securityholder in the Shelf Registration Statement. Upon the cure of all Registration Defaults then continuing, the accrual of Liquidated Damages will automatically cease and the interest rate borne by the Registrable Securities will revert to the original interest rate at such time. Liquidated Damages shall be computed based on the actual number of days

Holders who have converted Registrable Securities into Common Stock will not be entitled to receive any Liquidated Damages with respect to such Common Stock or the issue price of the Registrable Securities converted.
     The parties agree that the sole monetary damages payable for a violation of the terms of this Agreement with respect to which Liquidated Damages are expressly provided shall be such Liquidated Damages. Nothing shall preclude a Holder of Registrable Securities from pursuing or obtaining specific performance or equitable relief with regard to this Agreement. Each obligation to pay Liquidated Damages shall be deemed to accrue from and including the day following the Registration Default to but excluding the day on which the Registration Default is cured.
     A Registration Default under clause (a) above shall be cured on the date that the Shelf Registration Statement is filed and has become effective. A Registration Default under clause (b) above shall be cured on the date an amended Shelf Registration Statement becomes effective or the Company otherwise declares the Shelf Registration Statement and the Prospectus useable. The Company will have no liabilities for monetary damages other than the Liquidated Damages with respect to any Registration Default.
     The parties agree that the Liquidated Damages provided for in this Section 2.4 constitute a reasonable estimate of the damages that may be incurred by Holders of Registrable Securities and do not constitute a penalty.
     2.5 . The Company may suspend the use of any Prospectus, without incurring or accruing any obligation to pay Liquidated Damages pursuant to Section 2.4, for a period not to exceed 90 consecutive calendar days or an aggregate of 180 calendar days in any twelve-month period (each, a "Suspension Period") if the Company shall have determined in good faith that because of valid business reasons (not including avoidance of the Company's obligations hereunder), including without limitation proposed or pending corporate developments and similar events or because of filings with the SEC, it is in the best interests of the Company to suspend such use, and prior to suspending such use the Company provides the Holders with notice of such suspension, which notice need not specify the nature of the event giving rise to such suspension. Each Holder shall keep confidential any communications received by it from the Company regarding the suspension of the use of the Prospectus, except as required by applicable law.

     (d) Each indemnified party shall give notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party of any action or proceeding commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability hereunder to the extent it is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of such action; , , that counsel to the indemnifying party shall not (except with the consent of the indemnified party) also be counsel to the indemnified party. In no event shall the indemnifying party or parties be liable for
provided
however
 
the fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 4 (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
     (e) If at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, such indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 4(a)(ii) effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 60 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 45 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed such indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement, that an indemnifying party shall not be liable for any such settlement effected without its consent if such indemnifying party (1) reimburses such indemnified party in accordance with such request to the extent it considers such request to be reasonable and (2) provides notice to the indemnified party describing any unpaid balance it believes is unreasonable and the reasons therefor, in each case prior to the date of such settlement.
provided
     (f) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 4 is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Holders and the Initial Purchasers on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
     The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Holders and the Initial Purchasers on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company, or by the Holders or the Initial Purchasers and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
     The Company, the Holders and the Initial Purchasers agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 4 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations
 
referred to above in this Section 4. The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 4 shall be deemed to include any reasonable out-of-pocket legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
     Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 4, no Initial Purchaser or Holder shall be required to indemnify or contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities sold by such Initial Purchaser or Holder exceeds the amount of any damages which such Initial Purchaser or Holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
     No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
     For purposes of this Section 4, each Person, if any, who controls any Initial Purchaser or Holder within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Initial Purchaser or Holder, and each director of the Company, and each Person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company.

     The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Initial Purchasers on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discount received by the Initial Purchasers, bear to the aggregate initial offering price of the Securities.
 
     The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Initial Purchasers on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Initial Purchasers and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
     The Company and the Initial Purchasers agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Initial Purchasers were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section. The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
     Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section, no Initial Purchaser shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities purchased and sold by it hereunder exceeds the amount of any damages which such Initial Purchaser has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
     No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
     For purposes of this Section, each person, if any, who controls an Initial Purchaser within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act and each Initial Purchaser's Affiliates and selling agents shall have the same rights to contribution as such Initial Purchaser, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company. The Initial Purchasers' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section are several in proportion to the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule A hereto and not joint.
     SECTION 9. . All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement or in certificates of officers of the Company or any of its subsidiaries submitted pursuant hereto shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of (i) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Initial Purchaser or its Affiliates or selling agents, any person controlling any Initial Purchaser, its officers or directors or any person controlling the Company and (ii) delivery of and payment for the Securities.

     (b) if the number of Defaulted Securities exceeds 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities to be purchased hereunder, this
 
Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Initial Purchaser.
     No action taken pursuant to this Section shall relieve any defaulting Initial Purchaser from liability in respect of its default.
     In the event of any such default which does not result in a termination of this Agreement, either the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone Closing Time for a period not exceeding seven days in order to effect any required changes in the Offering Memorandum or in any other documents or arrangements. As used herein, the term "Initial Purchaser" includes any person substituted for an Initial Purchaser under this Section.

News Release
ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND COMPANY ANNOUNCES TENDER OFFER FOR UP TO $400 MILLION OF ITS OUTSTANDING DEBT
Archer Daniels Midland Company (NYSE: ADM) today announced the commencement of cash tender offers for up to $400 million aggregate principal amount of its outstanding debentures listed below (the "Debentures"). The terms and conditions of the tender offers are described in the Offer to Purchase, dated May 30, 2007, and related Letter of Transmittal. Copies of these documents are available to holders from Global Bondholder Services Corporation, the depositary and information agent for the tender offers.
 
     The tender offer for each series of Debentures will expire at 12:00 midnight, New York City time, on June 26, 2007 unless extended.
     Holders must tender their Debentures by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on June 7, 2007, unless extended, to be eligible to receive the applicable total consideration (which includes the applicable early tender payment set out above). Holders who tender
 
their Debentures after such date and prior to the expiration date will be eligible to receive the applicable total consideration less the early tender payment.
     The applicable total consideration will be determined as described in the Offer to Purchase based on the present value of future payments on the applicable Debentures discounted to the settlement date at a rate equal to the sum of the yield to maturity for the applicable reference security, calculated by the lead dealer managers based on the bid -side price at 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on June 22, 2007, plus the applicable fixed spread, minus accrued interest up to, but not including, the settlement date.
     In addition, payments for Debentures purchased will include accrued interest up to, but not including, the settlement date.

     (e) Annual Cash Incentive Compensation Program. By resolution effective as of July 1, 2007, upon the recommendation of the Compensation/Succession Committee (the "Committee"), the Board of Directors of Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (the "Company") adopted a new annual cash incentive compensation program that replaces the portion of the long-term incentive compensation program described in the Company's proxy statement for its 2006 annual meeting of stockholders that was based on achievement of annual individual performance objectives. Under this new program, the executive officers and certain other officers and employees of the Company have the opportunity to receive annual cash incentive payments based upon the following criteria:
     The amount of these cash incentive payments will be based on the participant's base salary and is allocated 60% to annual RONA performance, 20% to the workplace safety objectives and 20% to the personnel development objectives. Executive officers, except for the Chief Executive Officer, participating in the program will have the opportunity to receive annual cash incentive payments ranging from 0% to 100% of their respective base salaries in fiscal year 2008; the Chief Executive Officer will have the opportunity to to receive annual cash incentive payments ranging from 0% to 260% of her respective base salary in fiscal year 2008.
     The Committee shall have the authority to adjust these payments up or down for any given year. The primary purpose of this adjustment mechanism is to minimize the possibility that participants would be rewarded or penalized for fluctuations in RONA attributable to external factors that are beyond the influence or control of the participants.
     The Company performance portion of the long-term compensation program described in the Company's proxy statement for its 2006 annual meeting of stockholders shall remain in effect with three (3) modifications:
Table of Contents
     In addition to participating in the above-described program, the Chief Executive Officer shall be eligible to receive an additional equity award with a value from 0% to 300% of her base salary in fiscal year 2008 based upon other specific objectives established by the Board of Directors and a year-end review to assess performance related to unanticipated events and circumstances confronted by the Company during the fiscal year.
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Discussion of Operations
Net earnings for the year ended June 30, 2007 were $ 2.162 billion, or $ 3.30 per share, compared to $1.312 billion, or $ 2.00 per share, last year. Net earnings for the quarter ended  June 30, 2007 were $ 955 million, or $ 1.47 per share, compared to $ 410 million, or $ .62 per share, last year.
 
Net earnings for the year ended June 30, 2007 include gains on asset sales of $ 1.043 billion ($ 665 million after tax), asset impairment charges of $ 21 million ($ 13 million after tax), LIFO charges of $ 207 million ($129 million after tax) and a charge on debt repurchase of $ 46 million ($ 29 million after tax). Net earnings for the year ended June 30, 2006 include gains on asset sales of $ 62 million ($ 39 million after tax), asset impairment and retirement obligation charges of $ 101 million ($ 81 million after tax), LIFO income of $ 12 million ($ 8 million after tax), Brazilian transactional tax credits of $ 46 million ($ 30 million after tax) and a $ 36 million tax credit related to adjustment of state and federal income taxes.
Net earnings for the quarter ended June 30, 2007 include gains on asset sales of $ 967 million ($ 616 million after tax), asset impairment charges of $ 19 million ($ 12 million after tax), LIFO inventory charges of $ 60 million ($38 million after tax) and a charge on debt repurchase of $ 46 million ($ 29 million after tax). Net earnings for the quarter ended June 30, 2006 include gains on asset sales of $ 28 million ($18 million after tax), asset impairment and retirement obligation charges of $ 59 million ($ 37 million after tax), LIFO charges of $ 1 million ($ 1 million after tax), and Brazilian transactional tax credits of $ 27 million ($ 17 million after tax).
Segment operating profit increased $ 515 million to $ 1.2 billion for the quarter and increased $ 1.1 billion to a record $ 3.2 billion for the year.
Oilseeds Processing operating profit of $ 587 million for the quarter and $ 1.1 billion for the year included a $440 million gain upon the exchange of the Companys interests in certain Chinese joint ventures for shares in Wilmar International, Ltd., the largest agriculture processing business in Asia. Excluding this gain, Oilseeds Processing operating profit for the quarter decreased $ 48 million to $ 147 million, from last years record quarter of $ 195 million. The decline was due principally to a decline in European rapeseed and biodiesel margins and the inclusion in 2006 results of $ 27 million in Brazilian transactional tax credits. Excluding the gain, Oilseeds Processing operating profits for the year increased $ 79 million to a record $ 677 million. The increase was primarily due to improved worldwide soybean crush margins, partially offset by lower softseed and biodiesel processing margins in Europe.
Corn Processing operating results declined $ 45 million to $ 241 million for the quarter from $ 286 million last year. The decline was due principally to higher net corn costs and lower ethanol sales volumes. For the year, operating results increased $ 242 million to a record $ 1.1 billion from $ 877 million last year. The increase was due principally to the higher average selling prices of sweetener and ethanol products partially offset by higher net corn costs.
Agricultural Services operating results of $ 241 million for the quarter included a gain of $ 153 million resulting from the sale of the Companys interest in Agricore United. Excluding this gain, Agricultural Services results increased $ 5 million to $ 88 million for the quarter. The increase is due primarily to improved global merchandising and handling results partially offset by lower transportation results. For the year, excluding the gain, Agricultural Services results increased $ 87 million to a record $ 362 million from $ 275 million last year. The increase reflects improved global merchandising, handling and transportation operating results.
Other segment operating results increased $ 10 million to $ 83 million for the quarter principally due to improved Financial operating results. For the year, Other segment operating profit increased $ 99 million to $ 409 million from $ 310 million last year. The increase was due principally to a gain of $ 53 million realized upon the sale of the Companys Arkady food ingredient business and to improved Financial operating results.

Net earnings for the quarter ended September 30, 2007 increased $ 38 million to $ 441 million - $ .68
       per 
share from $ 403 million - $ .61 per share last year.
 
 
ADM delivered record first quarter earnings, said Chairman and CEO Patricia A. Woertz. These exceptional results demonstrate the strength of ADMs diversified asset and product portfolio.  Where excellent first quarter earnings of a year ago reflected steep growth in the ethanol market, our record first quarter earnings this year demonstrate our strengths in sweeteners & starches, oilseed processing and our global capabilities in grain merchandising and handling.  With our unique business model, spanning diverse markets, we are capturing value from changing market conditions.
 
 
    
Segment operating profit for the quarter increased 23% to $ 797 million from $ 648 million last year.

Discussion of Operations
 
Net sales and other operating income increased 36 % to $ 12.8 billion.  Increased selling prices resulting from sharp rises in commodity prices accounted for approximately 75 % of the increase while higher sales volumes, principally vegetable oil and wheat, accounted for the remaining 25 % increase.
A summary of first quarter operating profit and net earnings is as follows:
Net earnings increased $ 38 million due principally to a $ 149 million increase in segment operating profits partially offset by increased corporate charges related principally to LIFO inventory valuations and costs associated with the realignment of our organizational structure. In addition, income taxes increased due primarily to the increased pretax earnings and to a higher effective tax rate resulting from changes in the geographic mix of earnings.

Oilseeds Processing
Operating profits consist of earnings from:
Oilseeds Processing operating profit increased $ 39 million to $ 209 million from $ 170 million last year due principally to strong global demand for protein meal and oil. Worldwide crush volumes increased 2.4% to 7.2 million metric tons. Crushing and origination results increased $ 27 million due principally to better crush margins in North America and improved origination results in South America partially offset by a reduction in crush margins in Europe. Value added refining, packaging and biodiesel results increased $ 13 million principally from improved refining volumes and margins. Fiscal year 2008 results include asset abandonment charges of $ 3 million.
 
Corn Processing
Operating profits consist of earnings from:
Corn Processing operating profit decreased $ 36 million to $ 253 million from $ 289 million last year due principally to lower ethanol sales prices and volumes and higher net corn costs which were partially offset by favorable risk management results. Sweeteners and Starches operating profit increased $ 45 million to $ 164 million on higher average sweetener and starch selling prices partially offset by higher net corn costs. Bioproducts results declined $ 81 million to $ 89 million due principally to higher net corn costs and lower ethanol selling prices and volumes.  Last years Bioproducts results reflect the positive impact on ethanol volumes and prices of the phase out of MTBE.

Agricultural Services
Operating profits consist of earnings from:
Agricultural Services results increased $ 114 million to $ 229 million due principally to improved global merchandising and handling results as volatile commodity market conditions, large North American crops and global wheat shortages provided profit opportunities. Transportation results declined due principally to lower barge freight volumes.
 
Other
Operating profits consist of earnings from:
Other operating profit increased $ 32 million due principally to improved results of private equity fund investments and gains on sales of securities. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in Wheat, Cocoa and Malt operating profits due principally to decreased cocoa processing results as higher cocoa bean and carrying costs negatively impacted press margins.
 
Corporate
Corporate results consist of the following:
First Quarter FY08 corporate costs include a $ 23 million charge resulting from an organizational realignment initiative.

THIS AGREEMENT
     , Camp is an employee and officer of the Company; and
WHEREAS
     , Camp, and the Company have reached an agreement in regard to Camp ceasing to be an active employee and an officer of the Company as set forth in this Agreement.
WHEREAS
     , in consideration of the premises, the covenants as set forth in this Agreement, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:
NOW, THEREFORE
     1. Camp shall resign as an officer of the Company and retire as an employee effective December 15, 2007. Camp shall be deemed to have taken all earned vacation as of the date of his retirement. Camp acknowledges that he will not be entitled to receive any form of unemployment compensation or benefits.

Camp hereby acknowledges the forty-five (45) day review period provided pursuant to the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act. Camp understands he may revoke this Agreement and the Release in writing addressed to the Company within seven (7) days after the execution of this Agreement and Release in which event this Agreement and Release will be of no force and effect and he will be entitled to no payments or benefits in consideration hereof.
     3. Without the prior written consent of the Company, which consent must be signed by the Chief Executive Officer or an Executive Vice President of the Company, for a period of twelve (12) months commencing on December 16, 2007, Camp shall not own any interest in, except the ownership of stock in a publicly-traded company, take any employment with, or act as a director, consultant, advisor or in any other capacity whatsoever, directly or indirectly, to any person, corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture or any other form of entity, anywhere in the world that is engaged in business that competes with any businesses of the Company that were within Camp's scope of responsibilities while employed by the Company. Camp acknowledges that, in view of his responsibilities while employed by the Company, the scope of this restrictive covenant is reasonable. Camp further acknowledges that a violation of this restrictive covenant would cause irreparable damage to the Company and that in the event of a breach or threatened breach the Company would be entitled to injuctive relief, without the posting of any bond, in addition to such other relief as may be appropriate at law or in equity.
     4. Camp recognizes and agrees that the Company has a legitimate business interest in restricting potential competitors from hiring Employees who possess or otherwise may have or had access to the Company's or any of its affiliates' confidential information. Therefore, Camp agrees that for a two (2) year period following the end of his employment, he shall not directly or
 
indirectly through any other person or entity that provides goods or services to the Company or any of its affiliates or offers goods or services in competition with the Company or any of its affiliates, hire, recruit, induce or attempt to induce any Employee to terminate his or her employment with the Company or any of its affiliates or otherwise interfere in any way with the employment relationship between the Company or any of its affiliates and their respective employees.

     5. The Non-Disclosure Agreement dated September 26, 1991, a copy of which is marked Exhibit B, attached hereto and by this reference incorporated herein, shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.
     6.a.

          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this instrument to be duly executed under its corporate seal.
TRUSTEE'S CERTIFICATE OF AUTHENTICATION This is one of the Securities of the series designated herein and referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
THE BANK OF NEW YORK as Trustee
 
          This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the "Securities"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under an Indenture, dated as September 20, 2006 (herein called the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York (successor to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.) (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the Securities of the series designated herein, limited in aggregate principal amount to $500,000,000; provided, however, that the Company, without notice to or the consent of the Holders, may issue additional Securities of this series and thereby increase such principal amount in the future, on the same terms and conditions (except for issue date, public offering price and, if applicable, the date from which interest accrues and the first Interest Payment Date) and with the same CUSIP number as the Securities of this series.
          The Securities of this series are redeemable at the option of the Company at any time, in whole or in part, at a Redemption Price equal to the greater of the following amounts, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the Redemption Date: (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Securities of this series to be redeemed, and (ii) the sum of the present values of the Remaining Scheduled Payments.
          In determining the present values of the Remaining Scheduled Payments, such payments will be discounted to the Redemption Date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) using a discount rate equal to the Treasury Rate plus thirty basis points. A partial redemption of the Securities of this series may be effected by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate and may provide for the selection for redemption of portions (equal to the minimum authorized denomination for the Securities of this series or any integral multiple thereof) of the principal amount of Securities of a denomination larger than the minimum authorized denomination for the Securities of this series.
          Notice of any redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the Redemption Date to each Holder of the Securities of this series to be redeemed.
          Unless the Company defaults in payment of the Redemption Price, on and after the Redemption Date interest will cease to accrue on the Securities of this series or portions thereof called for redemption.
          "Treasury Rate," with respect to any Redemption Date, means the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue. In determining this rate, it is assumed that a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) is equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such Redemption Date.
          "Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Quotation Agent as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term (as measured from the Redemption Date) of the Securities of this series to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Securities.
          "Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, (a) the average of four Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such Redemption Date, after excluding the highest and lowest such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (b) if the Quotation Agent obtains fewer than four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations, or (c) if only one reference Treasury Dealer Quotation is received, such quotation.
          "Quotation Agent" means any Reference Treasury Dealer appointed by the Company.
 
          "Reference Treasury Dealer" means (1) each of Barclays Capital Inc., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and Goldman Sachs & Co. (or their respective affiliates that are Primary Treasury Dealers) and their respective successors; provided, however, that if any of the foregoing shall cease to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer (a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), the Company will substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer, and (2) any other Primary Treasury Dealer appointed by the Company.
          "Reference Treasury Dealers Quotations" mean, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date, the average, as determined by the Quotation Agent, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Quotation Agent by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding such Redemption Date.
          "Remaining Scheduled Payments" means, with respect to any Security of this series, the remaining scheduled payments of the principal and interest thereon that would be due after the related Redemption Date but for such redemption; , that, if such Redemption Date is not an Interest Payment Date with respect to such Security, the amount of the next scheduled interest payment thereon will be reduced (solely for purposes of this definition) by the amount of interest accrued thereon to such Redemption Date.
provided, however
          Notwithstanding Section 1104 of the Indenture, the notice of such redemption need not set forth the Redemption Price but only the manner of calculation thereof. The Company shall give the Trustee notice of the Redemption Price promptly after the calculation thereof and the Trustee shall not be responsible for such calculation.
          This Security shall not be subject to any sinking fund.
          If a change of control triggering event occurs, the Company will be required to make an offer (the "change of control offer") to each Holder of the Securities of this series to repurchase all or any part (equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) of the Securities of this series held by such Holder on the terms set forth in this Security. In the change of control offer, the Company will be required to offer payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities of this series repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to the date of repurchase (the "change of control payment"). Within 30 days following any change of control triggering event or, at the Company's option, prior to any change of control, but after public announcement of the transaction that constitutes or may constitute the change of control, a notice will be mailed to the Holders of the Securities of this series describing the transaction that constitutes or may constitute the change of control triggering event and offering to repurchase such Securities on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (the "change of control payment date"). The notice will, if mailed prior to the date of consummation of the change of control, state that the offer to purchase is conditioned on the change of control triggering event occurring on or prior to the change of control payment date.
          On the change of control payment date, the Company will, to the extent lawful:
          The Company will not be required to make a change of control offer upon the occurrence of a change of control triggering event if a third party makes such an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for an offer made by the Company and the third party repurchases all Securities of this series properly tendered and not withdrawn under its offer. In addition, the Company will not repurchase any Securities of
 
this series if there has occurred and is continuing on the change of control payment date an Event of Default, other than a default in the payment of the change of control payment upon a change of control triggering event.
          The Company will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Securities of this series as a result of a change of control triggering event. To the extent that the provisions of any such securities laws or regulations conflict with the change of control offer provisions of the Securities of this series, the Company will comply with those securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the change of control offer provisions of the Securities of this series by virtue of any such conflict.
          For purposes of the change of control offer provisions of the Securities of this series, the following terms will be applicable:
          "Change of control" means the occurrence of any of the following:
          Notwithstanding the foregoing, a transaction will not be deemed to involve a change of control if (1) the Company becomes a direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of a holding company and (2) either (A) the direct or indirect holders of the voting stock of such holding company immediately following that transaction are substantially the same as the holders of the Company's voting stock immediately prior to that transaction or (B) immediately following that transaction no person (other than a holding company satisfying the requirements of this sentence) is the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the voting stock of such holding company.
          "Change of control triggering event" means the occurrence of both a change of control and a rating event.
          "Continuing directors" means, as of any date of determination, any member of the Board of Directors who (1) was a member of the Board of Directors on the date the Securities of this series were originally issued or (2) was nominated for election, elected or appointed to the Board of Directors with the approval of a majority of the continuing directors who were members of the Board of Directors at the time of such nomination, election or appointment (either by a specific vote or by approval of the Company's proxy statement in which such member was named as a nominee for election as a director, without objection to such nomination).
          "Fitch" means Fitch Ratings.
          "Investment grade rating" means a rating equal to or higher than BBB- (or the equivalent) by Fitch, Baa3 (or the equivalent) by Moody's and BBB- (or the equivalent) by S&P, and the equivalent investment grade credit rating from any additional rating agency or rating agencies selected by the Company.
          "Moody's" means Moody's Investors Service Inc.
          "Rating agencies" means (1) each of Fitch, Moody's and S&P; and (2) if any of Fitch, Moody's or S&P ceases to rate the Securities of this series or fails to make a rating of such Securities publicly available for reasons
 
outside of the Company's control, a "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" within the meaning of Rule 15c3-1(c)(2)(vi)(F) under the Exchange Act selected by the Company (as certified by a resolution of the Board of Directors) as a replacement agency for Fitch, Moody's or S&P, or all of them, as the case may be.
          "Rating event" means the rating on the Securities of this series is lowered by each of the rating agencies and such Securities are rated below an investment grade rating by each of the rating agencies on any day within the 60-day period (which 60-day period will be extended so long as the rating of the such Securities is under publicly announced consideration for a possible downgrade by any of the rating agencies) after the earlier of (1) the occurrence of a change of control and (2) public notice of the occurrence of a change of control or the Company's intention to effect a change of control; provided, however, that a rating event otherwise arising by virtue of a particular reduction in rating will not be deemed to have occurred in respect of a particular change of control (and thus will not be deemed a rating event for purposes of the definition of "change of control triggering event") if the rating agencies making the reduction in rating to which this definition would otherwise apply do not announce or publicly confirm or inform the Trustee in writing at the Company's request that the reduction was the result, in whole or in part, of any event or circumstance comprised of or arising as a result of, or in respect of, the applicable change of control (whether or not the applicable change of control has occurred at the time of the rating event).
          "S&P" means Standard & Poor's Rating Services, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.
          "Voting stock" means, with respect to any specified "person" (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) as of any date, the capital stock of such person that is at the time entitled to vote generally in the election of the board of directors of such person.
          As provided in the Indenture, defeasance may occur at any time of (a) the entire indebtedness of the Company on this Security and (b) certain restrictive covenants and the related defaults and Events of Default, upon compliance by the Company with certain conditions set forth therein, which provisions apply to this Security.
          If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of this series shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Securities of this series may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.

Discussion of Operations
 
Net sales and other operating income increased 50 % to $ 16.5 billion.  Increased selling prices resulting from sharp rises in commodity prices accounted for approximately 78 % of the increase while higher sales volumes, principally feed grains, ethanol and wheat, accounted for the remaining 22 % increase.
A summary of operating profit and net earnings is as follows:
Net earnings increased $ 32 million for the quarter and $ 69 million for the six months due principally to increased segment operating profit of $ 188 million for the quarter and $ 337 million for the six months partially offset by increased corporate charges related principally to LIFO inventory valuations. In addition, income taxes increased due primarily to increased pretax earnings and to a higher effective tax rate resulting from changes in the geographic mix of earnings.

Oilseeds Processing
Operating profits consist of earnings from:
Oilseeds Processing operating profit increased $ 27 million for the quarter and $ 66 million for the six months due principally to strong global demand for protein meal and oil. Worldwide crush volumes increased 2 % for the six months to 14.7 million metric tons. Crushing and origination results increased $ 12 million for the quarter and $ 39 million for the six months due principally to better crush margins in North America and improved origination results in South America partially offset by reduced results of European operations and increased manufacturing costs. Value added refining, packaging, biodiesel and other results for the quarter and six months include asset abandonment charges of $ 15 million and $ 18 million, respectively, compared to $ 2 million in the prior year quarter and six months. Excluding these charges, refining, packaging, biodiesel, and other operating profits increased $ 6 million for the quarter and $ 22 million for the six months principally from improved refining volumes and margins. Asia results increased $ 22 million for the quarter and $ 21 million for the six months reflecting the Companys share of improved operating earnings of Wilmar International Limited.
 
Corn Processing
Operating profits consist of earnings from:
Corn Processing operating profit decreased $ 61 million for the quarter and $ 97 million for the six months. Sweeteners and Starches operating profit decreased $ 5 million for the quarter on higher average sweetener and starch selling prices and favorable risk management results, offset by higher net corn and manufacturing costs. For the six months, Sweeteners and Starches operating profit increased $ 40 million due principally to favorable risk management results. Bioproducts results declined $ 56 million for the quarter and $ 137 million for the six months due principally to higher net corn costs and lower ethanol selling prices partially offset by increased ethanol sales volumes and favorable risk management results. In addition, specialty feed results improved on increased selling prices and volumes.

Agricultural Services
Operating profits consist of earnings from:
Agricultural Services results increased $ 184 million for the quarter and $ 298 million for the six months due principally to improved global merchandising and handling results as volatile commodity market conditions, large North American crops and global wheat shortages provided increased margin and volume opportunities. Transportation results declined due principally to lower barge freight rates and increased operating costs.
 
Other
Operating profits consist of earnings from:
Other operating profit increased $ 38 million for the quarter and $ 70 million for the six months. Wheat, Cocoa and Malt operations improved $ 28 million for the quarter and $ 23 million for the six months due principally to improved wheat and malt processing operating efficiencies and margins partially offset by lower cocoa press margins.  Financial earnings improved $ 10 million for the quarter and $ 47 million for the six months principally due to marketable security gains of the Companys brokerage services business, and income from private equity fund investments.

     Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Security set forth on the pages following the certificate of authentication hereon, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.
     Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee referred to below, directly or through an Authenticating Agent, by manual signature of an authorized signatory, this Security shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
 
     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this instrument to be duly executed under its corporate seal.
 
     This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the "Securities"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under an Indenture, dated as September 20, 2006 (herein called the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York (successor to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.) (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the Securities of the series designated herein, limited in aggregate principal amount to $700,000,000; provided, however, that the Company, without notice to or the consent of the Holders, may issue additional Securities of this series and thereby increase such principal amount in the future, on the same terms and conditions (except for issue date, public offering price and, if applicable, the date from which interest accrues and the first Interest Payment Date) and with the same CUSIP number as the Securities of this series.
     The Securities of this series are redeemable at the option of the Company at any time, in whole or in part, at a Redemption Price equal to the greater of the following amounts, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the Redemption Date: (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Securities of this series to be redeemed, and (ii) the sum of the present values of the Remaining Scheduled Payments.
     In determining the present values of the Remaining Scheduled Payments, such payments will be discounted to the Redemption Date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) using a discount rate equal to the Treasury Rate plus thirty basis points. A partial redemption of the Securities of this series may be effected by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate and may provide for the selection for redemption of portions (equal to the minimum authorized denomination for the Securities of this series or any integral multiple thereof) of the principal amount of Securities of a denomination larger than the minimum authorized denomination for the Securities of this series.
     Notice of any redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the Redemption Date to each Holder of the Securities of this series to be redeemed.
     Unless the Company defaults in payment of the Redemption Price, on and after the Redemption Date interest will cease to accrue on the Securities of this series or portions thereof called for redemption.
     "Treasury Rate," with respect to any Redemption Date, means the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue. In determining this rate, it is assumed that a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) is equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such Redemption Date.
     "Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Quotation Agent as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term (as measured from the Redemption Date) of the Securities of this series to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Securities.
     "Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, (a) the average of four Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such Redemption Date, after excluding the highest and lowest such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (b) if the Quotation Agent obtains fewer than four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations, or (c) if only one reference Treasury Dealer Quotation is received, such quotation.
 
     "Quotation Agent" means any Reference Treasury Dealer appointed by the Company.
     "Reference Treasury Dealer" means (1) each of Banc of America Securities LLC, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. (or their respective affiliates that are Primary Treasury Dealers) and their respective successors; provided, however, that if any of the foregoing shall cease to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer (a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), the Company will substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer, and (2) any other Primary Treasury Dealer appointed by the Company.
     "Reference Treasury Dealers Quotations" mean, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date, the average, as determined by the Quotation Agent, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Quotation Agent by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding such Redemption Date.
     "Remaining Scheduled Payments" means, with respect to any Security of this series, the remaining scheduled payments of the principal and interest thereon that would be due after the related Redemption Date but for such redemption; , that, if such Redemption Date is not an Interest Payment Date with respect to such Security, the amount of the next scheduled interest payment thereon will be reduced (solely for purposes of this definition) by the amount of interest accrued thereon to such Redemption Date.
provided, however
     Notwithstanding Section 1104 of the Indenture, the notice of such redemption need not set forth the Redemption Price but only the manner of calculation thereof. The Company shall give the Trustee notice of the Redemption Price promptly after the calculation thereof and the Trustee shall not be responsible for such calculation.
     This Security shall not be subject to any sinking fund.
     If a change of control triggering event occurs, the Company will be required to make an offer (the "change of control offer") to each Holder of the Securities of this series to repurchase all or any part (equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) of the Securities of this series held by such Holder on the terms set forth in this Security. In the change of control offer, the Company will be required to offer payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities of this series repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to the date of repurchase (the "change of control payment"). Within 30 days following any change of control triggering event or, at the Company's option, prior to any change of control, but after public announcement of the transaction that constitutes or may constitute the change of control, a notice will be mailed to the Holders of the Securities of this series describing the transaction that constitutes or may constitute the change of control triggering event and offering to repurchase such Securities on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (the "change of control payment date"). The notice will, if mailed prior to the date of consummation of the change of control, state that the offer to purchase is conditioned on the change of control triggering event occurring on or prior to the change of control payment date.
     On the change of control payment date, the Company will, to the extent lawful:
     The Company will not be required to make a change of control offer upon the occurrence of a change of control triggering event if a third party makes such an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance
 
with the requirements for an offer made by the Company and the third party repurchases all Securities of this series properly tendered and not withdrawn under its offer. In addition, the Company will not repurchase any Securities of this series if there has occurred and is continuing on the change of control payment date an Event of Default, other than a default in the payment of the change of control payment upon a change of control triggering event.
     The Company will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Securities of this series as a result of a change of control triggering event. To the extent that the provisions of any such securities laws or regulations conflict with the change of control offer provisions of the Securities of this series, the Company will comply with those securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the change of control offer provisions of the Securities of this series by virtue of any such conflict.
     For purposes of the change of control offer provisions of the Securities of this series, the following terms will be applicable:
     "Change of control" means the occurrence of any of the following:
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, a transaction will not be deemed to involve a change of control if (1) the Company becomes a direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of a holding company and (2) either (A) the direct or indirect holders of the voting stock of such holding company immediately following that transaction are substantially the same as the holders of the Company's voting stock immediately prior to that transaction or (B) immediately following that transaction no person (other than a holding company satisfying the requirements of this sentence) is the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the voting stock of such holding company.
     "Change of control triggering event" means the occurrence of both a change of control and a rating event.
     "Continuing directors" means, as of any date of determination, any member of the Board of Directors who (1) was a member of the Board of Directors on the date the Securities of this series were originally issued or (2) was nominated for election, elected or appointed to the Board of Directors with the approval of a majority of the continuing directors who were members of the Board of Directors at the time of such nomination, election or appointment (either by a specific vote or by approval of the Company's proxy statement in which such member was named as a nominee for election as a director, without objection to such nomination).
     "Fitch" means Fitch Ratings.
     "Investment grade rating" means a rating equal to or higher than BBB- (or the equivalent) by Fitch, Baa3 (or the equivalent) by Moody's and BBB- (or the equivalent) by S&P, and the equivalent investment grade credit rating from any additional rating agency or rating agencies selected by the Company.
     "Moody's" means Moody's Investors Service Inc.
 
     "Rating agencies" means (1) each of Fitch, Moody's and S&P; and (2) if any of Fitch, Moody's or S&P ceases to rate the Securities of this series or fails to make a rating of such Securities publicly available for reasons outside of the Company's control, a "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" within the meaning of Rule 15c3-1(c)(2)(vi)(F) under the Exchange Act selected by the Company (as certified by a resolution of the Board of Directors) as a replacement agency for Fitch, Moody's or S&P, or all of them, as the case may be.
     "Rating event" means the rating on the Securities of this series is lowered by each of the rating agencies and such Securities are rated below an investment grade rating by each of the rating agencies on any day within the 60-day period (which 60-day period will be extended so long as the rating of the such Securities is under publicly announced consideration for a possible downgrade by any of the rating agencies) after the earlier of (1) the occurrence of a change of control and (2) public notice of the occurrence of a change of control or the Company's intention to effect a change of control; provided, however, that a rating event otherwise arising by virtue of a particular reduction in rating will not be deemed to have occurred in respect of a particular change of control (and thus will not be deemed a rating event for purposes of the definition of "change of control triggering event") if the rating agencies making the reduction in rating to which this definition would otherwise apply do not announce or publicly confirm or inform the Trustee in writing at the Company's request that the reduction was the result, in whole or in part, of any event or circumstance comprised of or arising as a result of, or in respect of, the applicable change of control (whether or not the applicable change of control has occurred at the time of the rating event).
     "S&P" means Standard & Poor's Rating Services, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.

The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Securities of each or all series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
     As set forth in, and subject to, the provisions of the Indenture, no Holder of any Security of this series will have any right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for any remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have previously given to the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to this series, the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of this series shall have made written request, and offered reasonable indemnity, to the Trustee to institute such proceeding as trustee, and the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of this series a direction inconsistent with such request and shall have failed to institute such proceeding within 60 days; , , that such limitations do not apply to a suit instituted by the Holder hereof for the enforcement of payment of the principal of or premium, if any, or interest on this Security on or after the respective due dates expressed or provided for herein.

ARCHER DANIELS REPORTS THIRD QUARTER RESULTS
MIDLAND
 
 
ADMs third-quarter performance demonstrates the ability of our balanced operations, global network and solid balance sheet to deliver strong results amid fluid markets, said Patricia Woertz, Chairman and CEO. Volatility in commodity markets presented unprecedented opportunities. Once again, our team leveraged our financial flexibility and global asset base to capture those opportunities to deliver shareholder value.

Discussion of Operations
 
Net sales and other operating income increased 64 % to $ 18.7 for the quarter and 51 % or $ 16.2 billion for the nine months.  Increased selling prices resulting primarily from sharp rises in commodity prices accounted for approximately 85 % of the increase while higher sales volumes, principally vegetable oil and meal, feed grains and wheat, accounted for the remaining 15 % increase.
billion
A summary of segment operating profit and net earnings is as follows:
Net earnings increased $ 154 million for the quarter and $ 223 million for the nine months due principally to increased segment operating profit of $ 320 million for the quarter and $ 657 million for the nine months partially offset by increased corporate expenses for LIFO inventory valuations and minority interest elimination for both the quarter and nine months.  Income taxes increased $ 45 million for the quarter and $ 103 million for the nine months due principally to increased pretax earnings for both the quarter and nine months partially offset by a lower effective tax rate for the quarter due to changes in the geographic mix of earnings.

Oilseeds Processing Operating Profit
 
Oilseeds Processing operating profit increased $ 52 million for the quarter and $ 119 million for the nine months due principally to continuing strong global demand for protein meal and vegetable oil.  Crushing and origination results increased $ 78 million for the quarter and $ 117 million for the nine months due to improved processing margins in North and South America and increased worldwide crushing volumes.  Refining, packaging, biodiesel and other results decreased $ 16 million for the quarter and $ 9 million for the nine months due principally to weaker biodiesel margins in Europe.  Last years quarter and nine month results for refining, packaging, biodiesel and other include a $ 14 million gain from business disposals.
Corn Processing Operating Profit
Corn Processing operating profit decreased $ 79 million for the quarter and $ 177 million for the nine months due primarily to increased net corn and manufacturing costs, principally energy.  Partially offsetting these higher costs, sweeteners and starches selling prices increased for the quarter and nine months and sales quantities of ethanol increased for the quarter and nine months.  Increases in sales prices and volumes for the quarter and nine months of lysine also favorably impacted bioproducts earnings.
 
 
 
Archer Daniels Midland Company

Agricultural Services Operating Profit
Agricultural Services results increased $ 320 million for the quarter and $ 618 million for the nine months to record levels due principally to continuing enhanced merchandising and handling margins caused by the highly volatile global grain markets and favorable risk management results.  Transportation results decreased $ 16 million for the nine months due to higher operating costs, principally fuel.
Other Operating Profit
Other operating profit increased $ 27 million for the quarter and $ 97 million for the nine months. Wheat, cocoa and malt operations improved $ 8 million for the quarter and $ 30 million for the nine months due principally to favorable risk management results in wheat and malt partially offset by decreased cocoa processing margins.  Last years quarter and nine month wheat, cocoa and malt results include a $ 39 million gain from business disposals.  Financial earnings improved $ 19 million for the quarter and $ 67 million for the nine months principally due to higher brokerage services income, decreased insurance loss provisions, marketable securities gains and improved earnings from managed fund investments.

Item 8.01. Other Events.
     On May 27, 2008, Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (the "Company") made available to investors a prospectus supplement and a prospectus with respect to the issuance by ADM of 35,000,000 equity units (the "Equity Units"). The Equity Units were offered and sold pursuant to an underwriting agreement dated as of May 28, 2008 (the "Underwriting Agreement") among ADM and the underwriters named therein (the "Underwriters"). The Underwriters have a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 5,000,000 Equity Units, solely to cover over-allotments, if any.
     Each Equity Unit has a stated amount of $50 and is initially comprised of (i) a purchase contract that will obligate the holder to purchase from ADM no later than June 1, 2011, a certain number of shares of ADM's common stock, for $50 in cash; and (ii) a 1/20, or 5.0%, undivided beneficial interest in a $1,000 aggregate principal amount 4.70% debenture due 2041 (the "Debentures"). Holders of the Equity Units will be entitled to receive quarterly contract adjustment payments at a rate of 1.55% per year of the stated amount of $50 per unit.
     The Debentures were issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of September 20, 2006, between the Company and The Bank of New York (successor to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.), as Trustee (the "Base Indenture"), as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of June 3, 2008, between the Company and The Bank of New York, as Trustee (the "Supplemental Indenture") (the Base Indenture, as amended and supplemented by the Supplemental Indenture, the "Indenture"). ADM filed the Base Indenture on September 22, 2006 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") as Exhibit 4 to ADM's registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-137541).
     The purchase contracts are being issued pursuant to a Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, dated as of June 3, 2008 (the "Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement"), between ADM, The Bank of New York as purchase contract agent, and The Bank of New York as collateral agent, custodial agent and securities intermediary. Under the terms of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, the Debentures are being pledged as collateral to secure the holders' obligation to purchase the shares of common stock under the purchase contracts. The Debentures will be remarketed, subject to certain terms and conditions, prior to the purchase contract settlement date pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement and the Remarketing Agreement to be entered into by the Company and one or more nationally recognized investment banking firms.

Exhibit 1.1
May 28, 2008
To the Representatives named in Schedule I hereto of the Underwriters named in Schedule II hereto
Dear Sirs:
     Archer-Daniels-Midland Company, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), confirms its agreement with each of the Underwriters named in Schedule II hereto (collectively, the "Underwriters," which term shall also include any underwriter substituted as hereinafter provided in Section 9 hereof), for whom the representative or representatives, if any, named in Schedule I hereto are acting as representatives (in such capacity, the "Representatives"), with respect to: (1) the issue and sale by the Company and the purchase by the Underwriters, acting severally and not jointly, of the respective number of 35,000,000 Equity Units of the Company (the "Initial Securities") set forth in Schedule II, and (2) the grant by the Company to the Underwriters of the option described in Section 2(b) hereof, all or any part of an additional 5,000,000 Equity Units (the "Option Securities"), solely to cover over-allotments. The Initial Securities to be purchased by the Underwriters, all or any part of the Option Securities and the Component Securities (as defined below) that comprise the Initial Securities and the Option Securities are hereinafter called, collectively, the "Securities." Each Security has a stated amount of $50 (the "Stated Amount") and initially consists of (1) a stock purchase contract (each, a "Stock Purchase Contract") under which the holder will agree to purchase and the Company will agree to sell on June 1, 2011 (the "Purchase Contract Settlement Date"), subject to acceleration in connection with any early settlement of such Stock Purchase Contract pursuant to the provisions of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement (the "Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement"), to be dated as of the Firm Closing Date (as defined herein), among the Company, The Bank of New York, as collateral agent, custodial agent and securities intermediary, and The Bank of New York, as stock purchase contract agent (the "Stock Purchase Contract Agent"), for a price equal to the Stated Amount per Security, a number of shares of common stock (the "Issuable Common Stock") of the Company, without par value (the "Common Stock"), determined pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement and (2) a 1/20, or 5.0%, undivided beneficial ownership interest in a $1,000 principal amount of the Company's 4.70% debentures due 2041 (the "Debentures").
     The Debentures are to be issued pursuant to an indenture dated as of September 20, 2006, as amended and supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of June 3, 2008 (as amended and supplemented, the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York
 
(successor to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.), as trustee (the "Trustee"). If the firm or firms listed in Schedule II hereto include only the firm or firms listed in Schedule I hereto, then the terms "Underwriters" and "Representatives," as used herein, shall each be deemed to refer to such firm or firms. The term "Representatives" also refers to a single firm acting as sole representative of the Underwriters. Certain terms used herein are defined in Section 17 hereof.
     A holder's ownership interest in the Debentures initially will be pledged to secure such holder's obligation to purchase the Issuable Common Stock on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, such pledge to be on the terms and conditions set forth in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement.
     The Stock Purchase Contracts will be issued pursuant to the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement. The Stock Purchase Contracts together with the related Debentures (or, upon the occurrence of a special event redemption or a successful optional remarketing of the Debentures prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, as such Debentures are replaced by the Treasury portfolio) are herein referred to as the "Corporate Units."
     A holder of Corporate Units, at its option, may elect to create "Treasury Units" by substituting pledged U.S. treasury securities for any pledged ownership interests in the Debentures. Unless otherwise indicated, the term "Equity Units" includes both Corporate Units and Treasury Units.
     Pursuant to a remarketing agreement, the form of which is attached to the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement as Exhibit P thereto (the "Remarketing Agreement") to be entered into among the Company, the Stock Purchase Contract Agent and one or more nationally-recognized investment banking firms to be selected by the Company, as reset agent(s) and remarketing agent(s), the Debentures may be remarketed, subject to certain terms and conditions set forth in the Remarketing Agreement.
     The "Component Securities" means, collectively, the Stock Purchase Contracts, the Debentures and the Issuable Common Stock.
     The terms and rights of any particular issuance of Securities (including the Component Securities) shall be as specified in (i) the Indenture or (ii) the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement (each document listed in clauses (i) through (ii), together with the Remarketing Agreement, each, a "Securities Agreement" and collectively, the "Securities Agreements").
     The Company understands that the Underwriters propose to make a public offering of the Securities as soon as the Representative(s) deem(s) advisable after this Agreement has been executed and delivered.
     The Company has filed with the Commission an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-137541), as amended by post-effective amendment thereto, including the
 
related preliminary prospectus or prospectuses, which registration statement and post-effective amendment became effective upon filing under Rule 462(e). Such registration statement, as amended, covers the registration of the Securities under the Act. Promptly after execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Company will prepare and file a prospectus in accordance with the provisions of Rule 430B and Rule 424 under the Act. Such registration statement, at any given time, including the amendments thereto to such time, the exhibits and any schedules thereto at such time, the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 under the Act at such time and the documents otherwise deemed to be a part thereof or included therein by the Regulations, is herein called the "Registration Statement." The Registration Statement at the time it originally became effective is herein called the "Original Registration Statement." The Prospectus in the form first furnished to the Underwriters for use in connection with the offering of the Securities and filed pursuant to Rule 424(b), including the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 under the Act at the time of the execution of this Agreement and any preliminary prospectuses filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) that form a part thereof, is herein called the "Prospectus." For purposes of this Agreement, all references to the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement to any of the foregoing shall be deemed to mean the copy filed with the Commission pursuant to its Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval system ("EDGAR").
     All references in this Agreement to financial statements and schedules and other information which is "contained," "included" or "stated" in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or other references of like import) shall be deemed to mean and include all such financial statements and schedules and other information which is incorporated by reference in or otherwise deemed by the Regulations to be a part of or included in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus, as the case may be; and all references in this Agreement to amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to mean and include the filing of any document under the Exchange Act which is incorporated by reference in or otherwise deemed by the Regulations to be a part of or included in the Registration Statement, such preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus, as the case may be.

Purchase and Sale
     (b) In addition, on the basis of the representations, warranties and agreements herein contained and subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, the Company hereby grants an option to the several Underwriters to purchase, severally and not jointly, the Option Securities. The option hereby granted will be solely to cover over-allotments, will expire 30 days after the date hereof and may be exercised in whole or in part from time to time upon notice (each, an "Option Exercise Notice") by the Representatives to the Company setting forth the number of Option Securities as to which the several Underwriters are then exercising the option and the time and date of payment and delivery for such Option Securities (each, an "Option Closing Date"). The number of Option Securities to be purchased by each Underwriter on an Option Closing Date shall be the same percentage of the total number of the Option Securities to be purchased by the several Underwriters as such Underwriter is purchasing of the Initial Securities. Any Option Closing Date shall be determined by the Representatives, but shall not be later than five full Business Days after the Date of the Option Exercise Notice unless otherwise agreed in writing by the parties hereto, nor in any event prior to the Firm Closing Date (as defined below).
     3. Delivery of and payment for the Securities shall be made on the date and at the time specified in Schedule I hereto or the Option Exercise Notice, as applicable, or at such time on such later date not more than three Business Days after the foregoing date as the Representatives shall designate, which date and time may be postponed by agreement between the Representatives and the Company or as provided in Section 9 hereof
Delivery and Payment.
 
(such date and time of delivery and payment for the Securities specified in Schedule I being herein called the "Firm Closing Date," and, together with an Option Closing Date, each a "Closing Date"). Delivery of the Securities shall be made to the Representatives for the respective accounts of the several Underwriters against payment by the several Underwriters through the Representatives of the purchase price thereof to or upon the order of the Company by wire transfer payable in same-day funds to an account specified by the Company. Delivery of the Securities shall be made through the facilities of The Depository Trust Company unless the Representatives shall otherwise instruct.
     4. . It is understood that the several Underwriters propose to offer the Securities for sale to the public as set forth in the Disclosure Package.
Offering by Underwriters
     5. The Company agrees with the several Underwriters that:
Agreements.
     (a) Prior to the termination of the offering of the Securities, the Company will not file any amendment of the Registration Statement or any supplement or amendment to either any preliminary prospectus or to the Prospectus, whether pursuant to the Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise unless the Company has furnished you a copy for your review prior to filing and will not file any such proposed amendment or supplement to which you reasonably object. The Company will prepare a final term sheet (the "Final Term Sheet"), in substantially the form of Exhibit A hereto, reflecting the final terms of the Securities, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, and shall file such Final Term Sheet as an "issuer free writing prospectus" pursuant to Rule 433 prior to the close of business two Business Days after the date hereof; provided that the Company shall furnish the Representatives with copies of any such Final Term Sheet a reasonable amount of time prior to such proposed filing and will not use or file any such document to which the Representatives or counsel to the Underwriters shall object. Subject to the second preceding sentence, the Company will comply with the requirements of Rule 430B and cause the Prospectus, properly completed, and any supplement thereto to be filed in a form approved by the Representatives with the Commission pursuant to the applicable paragraph of Rule 424(b) within the time period prescribed (without reliance on Rule 424(b)(8)), and will provide evidence satisfactory to the Representatives of such timely filing. The Company will promptly advise the Representatives (1) when any post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement or new registration statement relating to the Securities shall become effective, (2) when the Prospectus, and any supplement thereto, shall have been filed (if required) with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b), (3) of the receipt of any comments from the Commission, (4) of any request by the Commission or its staff for any amendment of the Registration Statement, or for any supplement to the Prospectus or any document incorporated by reference therein or otherwise deemed to be a part thereof, or for any additional information, (5) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for that purpose or any notice pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) of the Regulations or any order preventing or suspending the use of any preliminary prospectus, or of the initiation or threatening of any proceedings for any of such purposes or of any examination pursuant to Section 8(e) of the Act concerning the Registration Statement, (6) if the Company becomes the subject of a proceeding under Section 8A of the Act
 
in connection with the offering of the Securities and (7) of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Securities for sale in any jurisdiction or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose. The Company will use its best efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order or the suspension of any such qualification and, if issued, to obtain as soon as possible the withdrawal thereof. The Company shall pay the required Commission filing fees relating to the Securities within the time required by Rule 456(b)(1) (i) of the Regulations without regard to the proviso therein and otherwise in accordance with Rules 456(b) and 457(r) of the Regulations (including, if applicable, by updating the "Calculation of Registration Fee" table in accordance with Rule 456(b)(1)(ii) either in a post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement or on the cover page of a prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b)).
     (b) If, at any time when a prospectus relating to the Securities is required to be delivered under the Act (including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172), any event occurs as a result of which the Prospectus as then supplemented would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading, or if it shall be necessary to amend the Registration Statement or supplement the Prospectus to comply with the Act or the Exchange Act or the respective rules thereunder, the Company promptly will (1) notify the Representatives of such event, (2) prepare and file with the Commission, subject to the first sentence of paragraph (a) of this Section 5, an amendment or supplement which will correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance and (3) supply any supplemented Prospectus to you in such quantities as you may reasonably request. If at any time following issuance of an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus there occurred or occurs an event or development as a result of which such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus conflicted or would conflict with the information contained in the Registration Statement (or any other registration statement relating to the Securities) or the Statutory Prospectus or any preliminary prospectus or included or would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or would omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances prevailing at that subsequent time, not misleading, the Company will promptly notify the Representatives and will promptly amend or supplement, at its own expense, such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus to eliminate or correct such conflict, untrue statement or omission.
     (c) As soon as practicable, the Company will make generally available to its security holders and to the Representatives an earnings statement or statements of the Company and its subsidiaries which will satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Act and Rule 158 under the Act.
     (d) The Company will furnish to the Representatives and counsel for the Underwriters, without charge, copies of the Registration Statement (including exhibits thereto) and each amendment thereto which shall become effective on or prior to the relevant Closing Date and, so long as delivery of a prospectus by an Underwriter or dealer may be required by the Act (including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172),

     8. (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and its respective directors, officers, employees, agents, affiliates (as such term is defined in Rule 501(b)) and selling agents and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue

statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (including any amendment thereof)(including the Rule 430B Information), or in the Statutory Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act or the Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for use therein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
     (b) Each Underwriter severally agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for use in the preparation of the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have. The Company acknowledges that the following statements set forth under the heading "Underwriting" in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in any preliminary prospectus, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus: (i) the list of Underwriters and their respective participation in the sale of the Securities, (ii) the sentences related to concessions and reallowances and (iii) the paragraph related to stabilization and over-allotment transactions.

In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it may elect by written notice delivered to the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party; provided, however, that if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or

          (ii) Transfer the Debentures to the Holder; and
          (iii) deliver Treasury Units in book-entry form, or if applicable, authenticate, execute on behalf of such Holder and deliver Treasury Units in the form of a Treasury Units Certificate executed by the Company in accordance with Section 3.03 evidencing the same number of Purchase Contracts as were evidenced by the cancelled Corporate Units.

In case the Company shall pay or make a dividend or other distribution on the Common Stock in Common Stock, each Fixed Settlement Rate, as in effect at the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for the determination of stockholders of the Company entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution shall be increased by dividing each Fixed Settlement Rate by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination and the denominator shall be the sum of such number of shares and the total number of shares constituting such dividend or other distribution, each such increase to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for such determination.
Stock Dividends
          (ii) . In case the Company shall issue to all holders of its Common Stock rights, options, warrants or other securities, entitling them to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock for a period expiring within 45 days from the date of issuance of such rights, options, warrants or other securities at a price per share of Common Stock less than the Current Market Price on the date fixed for the determination of stockholders of the Company entitled to receive such rights, options, warrants or securities (other than pursuant to a dividend reinvestment, share purchase or similar plan), each Fixed Settlement Rate in effect at the
Stock Purchase Rights
 
opening of business on the day following the date fixed for such determination shall be increased by dividing each Fixed Settlement Rate by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination plus the number of shares of Common Stock which the aggregate consideration expected to be received by the Company upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of such rights, options, warrants or securities (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and described in a Board Resolution) would purchase at such Current Market Price and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination plus the number of shares of Common Stock so offered for subscription or purchase, either directly or indirectly, each such increase to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for such determination.

In case outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided, split or reclassified into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, each Fixed Settlement Rate in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision, split or reclassification becomes effective shall be proportionately increased, and, conversely, in case outstanding shares of Common Stock shall each be combined or reclassified into a smaller number of shares of Common Stock, each Fixed Settlement Rate in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such combination or reclassification becomes effective shall be proportionately reduced, such increase or reduction, as the case may be, to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision, split, combination or reclassification becomes effective.

          (iv) . (1) In case the Company shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all holders of its Common Stock evidences of its indebtedness, assets or securities (but excluding any rights, options, warrants or other securities referred to in paragraph (a)(ii) of this Section 5.05, any dividend or distribution paid exclusively in cash referred to in paragraph (a)(v) of this Section 5.05, any dividend, shares of capital stock of any class or series, or similar equity interests, of or relating to a subsidiary or other business unit in the case of a Spin-Off referred to in the next subparagraph, and any dividend or distribution referred to in paragraph (a)(i) of this Section 5.05), each Fixed Settlement Rate shall be increased by dividing each Fixed Settlement Rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the date fixed for the determination of stockholders of the Company entitled to receive such distribution by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Current Market Price on the date fixed for such determination less the then fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and described in a Board Resolution) of the portion of the assets or evidences of indebtedness so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock and the denominator of which shall be such Current Market Price, such adjustment to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for the determination of stockholders of the Company entitled to receive such distribution. In any case in which this paragraph (a)(iv)(1) is applicable, paragraph (a)(iv)(2) of this Section 5.05 shall not be applicable.
Debt, Asset or Security Distributions
          (2) In the case of a Spin-Off, each Fixed Settlement Rate in effect immediately before the close of business on the record date fixed for determination of stockholders of the Company entitled to receive that distribution will be increased by dividing each Fixed Settlement Rate by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Current Market Price and the denominator of which is the Current Market Price plus the Fair Market Value of the portion of those shares of capital stock or similar equity interests so
 
distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock. Any adjustment to the Fixed Settlement Rate under this paragraph (a)(iv)(2) will occur on the date that is the earlier of (A) the 10th Trading Day from, and including, the effective date of the Spin-Off and (B) the date of the securities being offered in the Initial Public Offering of the Spin-Off, if that Initial Public Offering is effected simultaneously with the Spin-Off.
          (v) . In case the Company shall, by dividend or otherwise, make distributions to all holders of the Common Stock exclusively in cash during any quarterly period (excluding any cash that is distributed in a Reorganization Event to which Section 5.05(b) applies or as part of a distribution referred to in paragraph (a)(iv) of this Section 5.05) in an amount in excess of $0.13 per share of Common Stock (the ""), immediately after the close of business on such date for determination, each Fixed Settlement Rate shall be increased by dividing each Fixed Settlement Rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the date fixed for determination of the stockholders of the Company entitled to receive such distribution by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be equal to the Current Market Price on the date fixed for such determination less the per share amount of the distribution and the denominator of which shall be equal to the Current Market Price on the date fixed for such determination minus the Reference Dividend.

Reference Dividend
          (vi) . In the case that a tender or exchange offer made by the Company or any subsidiary of the Company for all or any portion of the Common Stock shall expire and such tender or exchange offer (as amended through the expiration thereof) shall require the payment to stockholders of the Company (based on the acceptance (up to any maximum specified in the terms of the tender or exchange offer) of Purchased Shares) of an aggregate consideration having a fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and described in a Board Resolution) per share of the Common Stock that exceeds the closing price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day next succeeding the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer, then, immediately prior to the opening of business on the day after the date of the last time (the "") tenders could have been made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (as amended through the Expiration Time), each Fixed Settlement Rate shall be increased by dividing each Fixed Settlement Rate immediately prior to the close of business on the date of the Expiration Time by a fraction (A) the numerator of which shall be equal to (x) the product of (I) the Current Market Price on the date of the Expiration Time and (II) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (including any tendered or exchanged shares) on the date of the Expiration Time less (y) the amount of Cash plus the fair market value (determined as aforesaid) of the aggregate consideration payable to stockholders of the Company pursuant to the tender or exchange offer (assuming the acceptance, up to any maximum specified in the terms of the tender or exchange offer, of Purchased Shares), and (B) the denominator of which shall be equal to the product of (x) the Current Market Price on the date of the Expiration Time and (y) the result of (I) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (including any tendered or exchanged shares) on the date of the Expiration Time less (II) the number of all shares validly tendered, not withdrawn and accepted for payment on the date of the Expiration Time (such validly tendered shares, up to any such maximum, being referred to as the "").
Tender Offers and Exchange Offers

Purchased Shares
          (vii) If any adjustments are made to each Fixed Settlement Rate pursuant to this Section 5.05(a), an adjustment shall also be made to the Applicable Market Value solely to determine which of clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) of the definition of Settlement Rate in Section 5.01(a) will apply on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date or any Fundamental Change Early Settlement Date. Such adjustment shall be made by multiplying the Applicable Market Value by
 
the Adjustment Factor. The "" means, initially, a fraction the numerator of which shall be the Maximum Settlement Rate immediately after the first adjustment to each Fixed Settlement Rate pursuant to this Section 5.05(a) and the denominator of which shall be the Maximum Settlement Rate immediately prior to such adjustment. Each time an adjustment is required to be made to each Fixed Settlement Rate pursuant to this Section 5.05(a), the Adjustment Factor shall be multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which shall be the Maximum Settlement Rate immediately after such adjustment to each Fixed Settlement Rate pursuant to this Section 5.05(a) and the denominator of which shall be the Maximum Settlement Rate immediately prior to such adjustment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any adjustment to each Fixed Settlement Rate is required to be made pursuant to the occurrence of any of the events contemplated by this Section 5.05(a) during the Observation Period, the 20 individual Closing Prices used to determine the Applicable Market Value shall be adjusted rather than the Applicable Market Value and the Applicable Market Value shall be determined by (A) multiplying the Closing Prices for Trading Days prior to such adjustment to each Fixed Settlement Rate by the Adjustment Factor in effect prior to such adjustment, (B) multiplying the Closing Prices for Trading Days following such adjustment by the Adjustment Factor reflecting such adjustment, and (C) dividing the sum of all such adjusted Closing Prices by 20.
Adjustment Factor
          (viii) . All adjustments to the Fixed Settlement Rate shall be calculated to the nearest 1/10,000th of a share of Common Stock (or if there is not a nearest 1/10,000th of a share to the next lower 1/10,000th of a share). No adjustment in the Fixed Settlement Rate shall be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least one percent therein; , that any adjustments which by reason of this subparagraph are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment; and that effect shall be given to all adjustments not later than the applicable Settlement Date for a Unit.
Calculation of Adjustments
provided
provided further
          (ix) . The Company may make such increases in the Settlement Rate, in addition to those required by this Section 5.05(a), as the Board of Directors considers advisable in order to avoid or diminish any income tax to any holders of             shares of Common Stock resulting from any dividend or distribution of stock or issuance of rights or warrants to purchase or subscribe for stock or from any event treated as such for income tax purposes or for any other reasons.
Increase of Settlement Rate
          (x) If the Company hereafter adopts any stockholder rights plan involving the issuance of preference share purchase rights or other similar rights (the "") to all holders of the Common Stock, a Holder shall be entitled to receive upon settlement of any Purchase Contract, in addition to the shares of Common Stock issuable upon settlement of such Purchase Contract, the related Rights for the Common Stock, unless such Rights under the future stockholder rights plan have separated from the Common Stock at the time of conversion, in which case each Settlement Rate shall be adjusted as provided in Section 5.05(a)(iv) on the date such Rights separate from the Common Stock.
Rights
          (b) . (i) Subject to the provisions of Section 5.05(b)(ii), upon a Reorganization Event, each Unit shall thereafter, in lieu of a variable number of shares of Common Stock, be settled by delivery of a variable number of Exchange Property Units. An "" represents the right to receive the kind and amount of securities, cash and other property receivable in such Reorganization Event (without any interest thereon, and without any right to dividends or distributions thereon that have a record date that is prior to the applicable Settlement Date) per share of Common Stock by a holder of Common Stock that is not a Person with which the Company consolidated or into which the Company merged or which merged

into the Company or to which such sale or transfer was made, as the case may be (any such Person, a ""), or an Affiliate of a Constituent Person to the extent such Reorganization Event provides for different treatment of Common Stock held by Affiliates of the Company and non-Affiliates. In the event holders of Common Stock have the opportunity to elect the form of consideration to be received in such transaction, the Exchange Property Unit that Holders of the Corporate Units or Treasury Units would have been entitled to receive will be deemed to be the weighted average of the types and amounts of consideration received by the holders of Common Stock that affirmatively make an election. The number of Exchange Property Units to be delivered upon settlement of a Purchase Contract following the effective date of a Reorganization Event shall equal the Settlement Rate, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 5.05, determined as if the references to "shares of Common Stock" in Section 5.01(a)(i), (ii) and (iii) were to "Exchange Property Units."
Constituent Person
     In the event of such a Reorganization Event, the Person formed by such consolidation, or merger or the Person which acquires the assets of the Company shall execute and deliver to the Purchase Contract Agent an agreement supplemental hereto providing that the Holder of each Unit that remains Outstanding after the Reorganization Event (if any) shall have the rights provided by this Section 5.05(b). Such supplemental agreement shall provide for adjustments to the amount of any securities constituting all or a portion of an Exchange Property Unit which, for events subsequent to the effective date of such Reorganization Event, shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Section 5.05. The above provisions of this Section 5.05(b) shall similarly apply to successive Reorganization Events.
          (ii) Prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, if a Fundamental Change occurs, then following such Fundamental Change a Holder of a Unit will have the right to accelerate and settle ("") its Purchase Contract, upon the conditions set forth below, at the Settlement Rate (determined as if the Applicable Market Value equaled the Stock Price), plus an additional make-whole amount of shares (the ""); that no Fundamental Change Early Settlement will be permitted pursuant to this Section 5.05(b)(ii) unless, at the time such Fundamental Change Early Settlement is effected, there is an effective Registration Statement with respect to any securities to be issued and delivered in connection with such Fundamental Change Early Settlement, if such a Registration Statement is required (in the view of counsel, which need not be in the form of a written opinion, for the Company) under the Securities Act. If such a Registration Statement is so required, the Company covenants and agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to (x) have in effect a Registration Statement covering any securities to be delivered in respect of the Purchase Contracts being settled and (y) provide a Prospectus in connection therewith, in each case in a form that may be used in connection with such Fundamental Change Early Settlement. In the event that a Holder seeks to exercise its Fundamental Change Early Settlement right and a Registration Statement is required to be effective in connection with the exercise of such right but no such Registration Statement is then effective, the Holder's exercise of such right shall be void unless and until such a Registration Statement shall be effective and the Company shall have no further obligation with respect to any such Registration Statement if, notwithstanding using its commercially reasonable efforts, no Registration Statement is then effective.
Fundamental Change Early Settlement
Make-Whole Share Amount
provided
     If a Holder elects a Fundamental Change Early Settlement of some or all of its Purchase Contracts, such Holder shall be entitled to receive, on the Fundamental Change Early Settlement Date, the aggregate amount of any accrued and unpaid Contract Adjustment Payments, with respect to such Purchase Contracts. The Company shall pay such amount as a credit against the amount otherwise payable by such Holder to effect such Fundamental Change Early Settlement.
 
     Within five Business Days of the Effective Date (as hereinafter defined) of a Fundamental Change, the Company shall provide written notice to Holders of Units of such completion of a Fundamental Change, which shall specify (1) the deadline for submitting the notice to settle early in cash pursuant to this Section 5.05(b)(ii) and how and where such notice to settle early should be delivered, (2) the date on which such Fundamental Change Early Settlement shall occur (which date shall be at least ten days after the date of the notice but not later than the earlier of 20 days after the date of such notice or two Business Days prior to the first day of the Final Remarketing Period) (the ""), (3) the amount of cash payable in respect of the exercise of such Fundamental Change Early Settlement (giving effect to the credit for any accrued and unpaid Contract Adjustment Payments as provided in the preceding paragraph), (4) the applicable Settlement Rate, (5) the Make-Whole Share Amount and (6) the amount (per share of Common Stock) of cash, securities and other consideration receivable by the Holder, including any amount of Contract Adjustment Payments receivable, upon settlement.
Fundamental Change Early Settlement Date
     Corporate Units Holders (unless Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio have replaced Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures as a component of the Corporate Units) and Treasury Units Holders may only effect Fundamental Change Early Settlement pursuant to this Section 5.05(b)(ii) in integral multiples of 20 Corporate Units or Treasury Units, as the case may be. If Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio have replaced Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures as a component of the Corporate Units, Corporate Units Holders may only effect Fundamental Change Early Settlement pursuant to this Section 5.05(b)(ii) in multiples of 80,000 Corporate Units; provided that the Company shall attempt to allow Holders of fewer than 80,000 Corporate Units to exercise the right to effect Fundamental Change Early Settlement by aggregating the total number of Corporate Units in respect of which the Holders have elected to exercise such right. Any such aggregation will be made on a Pro Rata basis to the extent that any such aggregation does not allow each Holder to exercise such right in full. Other than the provisions relating to timing of notice and settlement, which shall be as set forth above, the provisions of Section 5.01 shall apply with respect to a Fundamental Change Early Settlement pursuant to this Section 5.05(b)(ii).
     In order to exercise the right to effect Fundamental Change Early Settlement with respect to any Purchase Contracts, the Holder of the Certificate evidencing Units shall deliver to the Purchase Contract Agent, no later than 4:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day immediately preceding the Fundamental Change Early Settlement Date, such Certificate to the Purchase Contract Agent at the Corporate Trust Office duly endorsed for transfer to the Company or in blank with the form of Election to Settle Early on the reverse thereof duly completed and accompanied by payment (payable to the Company in immediately available funds) in an amount equal to the excess of:
          (A) product of (1) the Stated Amount times (2) the number of Purchase Contracts with respect to which the Holder has elected to effect Fundamental Change Early Settlement,
over
          (B) the amount of any accrued and unpaid Contract Adjustment Payments (excluding, if the Fundamental Change Early Settlement occurs after the Record Date for such Contract Adjustment Payments, the amount of such payments to be made on the Payment Date immediately succeeding such Record Date).
In the event that Units are held by or through DTC or another Depositary, the exercise of the right to effect Fundamental Change Early Settlement shall occur in conformity with the procedures established by DTC or such Depositary.
 
     Upon receipt of any such Certificate and payment of such funds, the Purchase Contract Agent shall pay the Company from such funds the related Purchase Price pursuant to the terms of the related Purchase Contracts, and notify the Collateral Agent that all the conditions necessary for a Fundamental Change Early Settlement by a Holder of Units have been satisfied pursuant to which the Purchase Contract Agent has received from such Holder, and paid to the Company as confirmed in writing by the Company, the related Purchase Price.
     Upon receipt by the Collateral Agent of the notice from the Purchase Contract Agent set forth in the preceding paragraph, the Collateral Agent shall release from the Pledge, (1) the Debentures underlying the Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures or the Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio, in the case of a Holder of Corporate Units or (2) the Pledged Treasury Securities, in the case of a Holder of Treasury Units, in each case with a Value equal to the product of (x) the Stated Amount times (y) the number of Purchase Contracts as to which such Holder has elected to effect Fundamental Change Early Settlement, and shall instruct the Securities Intermediary to Transfer all such Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio or Debentures underlying Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures or Pledged Treasury Securities, as the case may be, to the Purchase Contract Agent for distribution to such Holder, in each case free and clear of the Pledge created hereby.
     If a Holder properly effects an effective Fundamental Change Early Settlement in accordance with the provisions of this Section 5.05(b)(ii), the Company will deliver (or will cause the Collateral Agent to deliver) to the Holder on the Fundamental Change Early Settlement Date:
          (A) the kind and amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such Fundamental Change by a Holder of the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on account of each Purchase Contract if the Purchase Contract Settlement Date had occurred immediately prior to such Fundamental Change (based on the Settlement Rate in effect at such time plus the Make-Whole Share Amount), assuming such Holder of Common Stock is not a Constituent Person or an Affiliate of a Constituent Person to the extent such Fundamental Change provides for different treatment of Common Stock held by Affiliates of the Company and non-Affiliates. In the event holders of Common Stock have the opportunity to elect the form of consideration to be received in the Fundamental Change, the kind and amount of securities, cash and other property receivable by Holders of the Corporate Units or Treasury Units exercising their right to effect a Fundamental Change Early Settlement will be deemed to be the weighted average of the types and amounts of consideration received by the holders of Common Stock that affirmatively make an election. For the avoidance of doubt, for the purposes of determining the Applicable Market Value (in connection with determining the appropriate Settlement Rate to be applied in the foregoing sentence), the date of the closing of the Fundamental Change shall be deemed to be the Purchase Contract Settlement Date;
          (B) the Debentures, the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio or Treasury Securities, as the case may be, related to the Purchase Contracts with respect to which the Holder is effecting a Fundamental Change Early Settlement;
          (C) any accrued and unpaid Contract Adjustment Payments (to the extent such payments are not offset to settle the Purchase Contracts); and
 
          (D) if so required under the Securities Act, a Prospectus as contemplated by this Section 5.05(b)(ii).
The Corporate Units or the Treasury Units of the Holders who do not elect Fundamental Change Early Settlement in accordance with the foregoing will continue to remain outstanding and be subject to settlement on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date in accordance with the terms hereof.
          (iii) The Make-Whole Share Amounts applicable to a Fundamental Change Early Settlement will be determined by reference to the table below, based on the date on which the Fundamental Change becomes effective (the "") and the price (the "") paid per share for Common Stock in such Fundamental Change. If holders of Common Stock receive only cash in such transaction, the Stock Price paid per share will be the cash amount paid per share. Otherwise, the Stock Price paid per share will be the average of the Closing Prices of the Common Stock on the five Trading Days prior to, but not including, the Effective Date of such Fundamental Change.
Effective Date
Stock Price
     The Stock Prices set forth in the second row of the table (., the column headers) will be adjusted upon the occurrence of certain events requiring adjustments to each Fixed Settlement Rate pursuant to Section 5.05(a).
i.e
     Each of the Make-Whole Share Amounts set forth in the table will be subject to adjustment in the same manner as the Fixed Settlement Rates as set forth in Section 5.05(a).
     If the Stock Price or Effective Date applicable to a Fundamental Change is not expressly set forth on the table, then the Make-Whole Share Amount will be determined as follows:
          (1) if the Stock Price is between two Stock Price amounts on the table or the Effective Date is between two dates on the table, the Make-Whole Share Amount will be determined by straight-line interpolation between the Make-Whole Share Amounts set forth for the higher and lower Stock Price amounts and the two dates, as applicable, based on a 365-day year;
          (2) if the Stock Price is in excess of $150.00 per share (subject to adjustment as set forth in Section 5.05(a)), then the Make-Whole Share Amount shall be zero; and
          (3) if the Stock Price is less than $10.00 per share (subject to adjustment as set forth in Section 5.05(a)) (the ""), then the Make-Whole Share Amount shall be determined as if the Stock Price equaled the Minimum Stock Price, using straight-line interpolation, as described in clause (1) above, if the Effective Date is between two dates on the table.
Minimum Stock Price
 
          (c) No adjustment to the Settlement Rate need be made if Holders may participate in the transaction that would otherwise give rise to an adjustment, so long as the distributed assets or securities the Holders would receive upon settlement of Units, if convertible, exchangeable, or exercisable, are convertible, exchangeable or exercisable, as applicable, without any loss of rights or privileges for a period of at least 45 days following settlement of the Units.
          (d) The Fixed Settlement Rate shall not be adjusted:
          (1) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any present or future plan providing for the reinvestment of dividends or interest payable on the Company's securities and the investment of additional optional amounts in shares of Common Stock under any plan;
          (2) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock or options or rights to purchase those shares pursuant to any present or future employee, director or consultant benefit plan or program of or assumed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries;
          (3) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any option, warrant, right or exercisable, exchangeable or convertible security outstanding as of the date the Units were first issued;
          (4) for a change in the par value or no par value of the Common Stock; or
          (5) for accumulated and unpaid dividends, other than to the extent contemplated by Section 5.05(a) hereof.
          (e) All calculations and determinations pursuant to this Section 5.05 shall be made by the Company or its agent and the Purchase Contract Agent shall have no responsibility with respect to this Agreement.
     Section 5.06 . (a) Whenever the Fixed Settlement Rates are adjusted as herein provided, the Company shall, as soon as practicable following the occurrence of an event that requires an adjustment pursuant to Section 5.05 (or if the Company is not aware of such occurrence, as soon as practicable after becoming so aware):
Notice of Adjustments and Certain Other Events
          (i) compute each adjusted Fixed Settlement Rate in accordance with Section 5.05 and prepare and transmit to the Purchase Contract Agent an Officers' Certificate setting forth each adjusted Fixed Settlement Rate, the method of calculation thereof in reasonable detail, and the facts requiring such adjustment and upon which such adjustment is based; and
          (ii) provide a written notice to the Holders of the Units of the occurrence of such event and a statement in reasonable detail setting forth the method by which the adjustment to each Fixed Settlement Rate was determined and setting forth each adjusted Fixed Settlement Rate.
          (b) The Purchase Contract Agent shall not at any time be under any duty or responsibility to any Holder to determine whether any facts exist which may require any adjustment of each Fixed Settlement Rate, or with respect to the nature or extent or calculation of any such adjustment when made, or with respect to the method employed in making the same. The Purchase Contract Agent
 
shall be fully authorized and protected in relying on any Officers' Certificate delivered pursuant to Section 5.06(a)(i) and any adjustment contained therein and the Purchase Contract Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any adjustment unless and until it has received such certificate. The Purchase Contract Agent shall not be accountable with respect to the validity or value (or the kind or amount) of any shares of Common Stock, or of any securities or property, which may at the time be issued or delivered with respect to any Purchase Contract; and the Purchase Contract Agent makes no representation with respect thereto. The Purchase Contract Agent shall not be responsible for any failure of the Company to issue, transfer or deliver any shares of Common Stock pursuant to a Purchase Contract or to comply with any of the duties, responsibilities or covenants of the Company contained in this Article 5.

     Upon and after the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Units shall thereafter represent the right to receive the Debentures underlying the Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures, the Treasury Securities or the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, forming part of such Units, in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.15 hereof. Upon the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Company shall promptly but in no event later than two Business Days thereafter give written notice to the Purchase Contract Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Holders, at their addresses as they appear in the Security Register.

     Holders of Corporate Units and Treasury Units may only effect Early Settlement pursuant to this Section 5.08 in integral multiples of 20 Treasury Units. If Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio have replaced Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures as a component of the Corporate Units, Corporate Units Holders may only effect Early Settlement pursuant to this Section 5.08 in integral multiples of 80,000 Corporate Units.

The Company shall provide the Purchase Contract Agent from time to time with sufficient funds to permit the Purchase Contract Agent to make all cash payments required by this Section 5.09 in a timely manner.

          (g) For purposes of Section 5.11(e) through (q), the words "cash, property or securities" shall not be deemed to include shares of stock of the Company as reorganized or readjusted, or securities of the Company or any other Person provided for by a plan of reorganization or readjustment, the payment of which is subordinated at least to the extent provided in Section 5.11(e) through (q) with respect to such Contract Adjustment Payments on the Units to the payment of all Senior Indebtedness which may at the time be outstanding; that (i) the indebtedness or guarantee of indebtedness, as the case may be, that constitutes Senior Indebtedness is assumed by the Person, if any, resulting from any such reorganization or readjustment, and (ii) the rights of the holders of the Senior Indebtedness are not, without the consent of each such holder adversely affected thereby, altered by such reorganization or readjustment;

          (i) Subject to the irrevocable payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness, the Holders of the Units shall be subrogated (equally and ratably with the holders of all obligations of the Company which by their express terms are subordinated to Senior Indebtedness of the Company to the same extent as payment of the Contract Adjustment Payments in respect of the Purchase Contracts underlying the Units is subordinated and which are entitled to like rights of subrogation) to the rights of the holders of Senior Indebtedness to receive payments or distributions of cash, property or securities of the Company applicable to the Senior Indebtedness until all such Contract Adjustment Payments owing on the Units shall be paid in full, and as between the Company, its creditors other than holders of such Senior
 
Indebtedness and the Holders, no such payment or distribution made to the holders of Senior Indebtedness by virtue of Section 5.11(e) through (q) that otherwise would have been made to the Holders shall be deemed to be a payment by the Company on account of such Senior Indebtedness, it being understood that the provisions of Section 5.11(e) through (q) are and are intended solely for the purpose of defining the relative rights of the Holders, on the one hand, and the holders of Senior Indebtedness, on the other hand.

In the event that the Purchase Contract Agent determines in good faith that further evidence is required with respect to the right of any Person as a holder of Senior Indebtedness to participate in any payment or distribution pursuant to Section 5.11(e) through (q), the Purchase Contract Agent may request such Person to furnish evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of the Purchase Contract Agent as to the amount of Senior Indebtedness held by such Person, the extent to which such Person is entitled to participate in such payment or distribution and any other facts pertinent to the rights of such Person under Section 5.11(e) through (q), and, if such evidence is not furnished, the Purchase Contract Agent may defer payment to such Person pending judicial determination as to the right of such Person to receive such payment.

          (o) The Company shall give prompt written notice to the Purchase Contract Agent of any fact known to the Company that would prohibit the making of any payment of moneys to or by the Purchase Contract Agent in respect of the Units pursuant to the provisions of this Section. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5.11(e) through (q) or any other provisions of this Agreement, the Purchase Contract Agent shall not be charged with knowledge of the existence of any facts that would prohibit the making of any payment of moneys to or by the Purchase Contract Agent, or the taking of any other action by the Purchase Contract Agent, unless and until the Purchase Contract Agent shall have received written notice thereof mailed or delivered to the Purchase Contract Agent at its Corporate Trust Office from the Company, any Holder, or the holder or representative of any Senior Indebtedness; that if at least two Business Days prior to the date upon which by the terms hereof any such moneys may become payable for any purpose, the Purchase Contract Agent shall not have received with respect to such moneys the notice provided for in this Section, then, anything herein contained to the contrary notwithstanding, the Purchase Contract Agent shall have full power and authority to receive such moneys and to apply the same to the purpose for which they were received and shall not be affected by any notice to the contrary that may be received by it within two Business Days prior to or on or after such date.

     Section 15.10 . (a) Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary as provided below:
Resignation of Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary
          (i) the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary may resign at any time by giving notice thereof to the Company and the Purchase Contract Agent as attorney-in-fact for the Holders;
          (ii) the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary may be removed at any time by the Company; and
          (iii) if the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary fails to perform any of its material obligations hereunder in any material respect for a period of not less than 20 days after receiving written notice of such failure by the Purchase Contract Agent and such failure shall be continuing, the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary may be removed by the Purchase Contract Agent, acting at the direction of the Holders.
     The Purchase Contract Agent shall promptly notify the Company upon the transmission of notice as contemplated by clause (iii) of Section 15.10(a) and any removal of the Collateral Agent, the Custodial
 
Agent or the Securities Intermediary pursuant to clause (iii) of this Section 15.10(a). Upon any such resignation or removal, the Company shall have the right to appoint a successor Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, which shall not be an Affiliate of the Purchase Contract Agent. If no successor Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary shall have been so appointed and shall have accepted such appointment within 45 days after the retiring Collateral Agent's, Custodial Agent's or Securities Intermediary's giving of notice of resignation or the Company's or the Purchase Contract Agent's giving notice of such removal, then the retiring or removed Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary may petition any court of competent jurisdiction, at the expense of the Company, for the appointment of a successor Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary.

The retiring Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary shall, upon such succession, be discharged from its duties and obligations as Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary hereunder. After any retiring Collateral Agent's, Custodial Agent's or Securities Intermediary's resignation hereunder as Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary, the provisions of this Article 15 shall continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary. Any resignation or removal of the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary hereunder, at a time when such Person is also acting as the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, shall be deemed for all purposes of this Agreement as the simultaneous resignation or removal of the Collateral Agent, the Securities Intermediary or the Custodial Agent, as the case may be.
          (b) Because The Bank of New York is serving as the Collateral Agent hereunder and also as the Purchase Contract Agent hereunder, if an event of default or a collateral event of default occurs hereunder The Bank of New York will resign as the Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary, but continue to act as the Purchase Contract Agent.

Right to Appoint Agent or Advisor

Survival
     Section 15.13 . Anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in no event shall the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities
Exculpation
 
Intermediary or their officers, directors, employees or agents be liable under this Agreement for indirect, special, punitive, or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever, including, but not limited to, lost profits, whether or not the likelihood of such loss or damage was known to the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary, or any of them and regardless of the form of action.
     Section 15.14 . The Company agrees to reimburse the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary for:
Expenses, Etc
          (a) all reasonable costs, fees and expenses of the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary (including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary), in connection with (i) the negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery or performance of this Agreement and (ii) any modification, supplement or waiver of any of the terms of this Agreement;

          (d) all reasonable fees and expenses of any agent or advisor appointed by the Collateral Agent and consented to by the Company under Section 15.11 of this Agreement; and
          (e) any other out-of-pocket costs and expenses reasonably incurred by the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary in connection with the performance of their duties hereunder.
     Section 15.15 . In no event shall any of the Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent and Securities Intermediary be responsible or liable for any failure or delay in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement arising out of or caused directly or indirectly, by acts of God; earthquake; fires; floods; wars; civil or military disturbances; terrorist acts; sabotage; epidemics; riots; interruptions, loss or malfunctions of utilities; accidents; labor disputes; or acts of civil or military authority or governmental actions; it being understood that the Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent and Securities Intermediary shall use reasonable efforts which are consistent with accepted practices in the banking industry to resume performance as soon as practicable under such circumstances.
Force Majeure
     Section 16.01 . All rights of the Collateral Agent and security interests hereunder, and all obligations of the Holders from time to time hereunder pursuant to the Pledge, shall be absolute and unconditional irrespective of:
Security Interest Absolute
          (a) any lack of validity or enforceability of any provision of the Purchase Contracts or the Units or any other agreement or instrument relating thereto;
 
          (b) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or any other term of, or any increase in the amount of, all or any of the obligations of Holders of the Units under the related Purchase Contracts, or any other amendment or waiver of any term of, or any consent to any departure from any requirement of, the Purchase Contract Agreement or any Purchase Contract or any other agreement or instrument relating thereto; or
          (c) any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or discharge of, a borrower, a guarantor or a pledgor.
     Section 16.02 . Upon the occurrence of a Special Event, a Special Event Redemption or a Termination Event, the Company shall deliver written notice to the Purchase Contract Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Securities Intermediary.

     Each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby is governed by a Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, dated as of June 3, 2008 (as may be supplemented from time to time, the ""), between the Company and The Bank of New York, as Collateral Agent, as Custodial Agent, as Securities Intermediary, as Purchase Contract Agent and as attorney-in-fact for the holders of Corporate Units and Treasury Units from time to time, to which Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement and supplemental agreements thereto reference is hereby made for a description of the respective rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Purchase Contract Agent, the Company, and the Holders and of the terms upon which the Corporate Units Certificates are, and are to be, executed and delivered.
Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement
     Each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby obligates the Holder of this Corporate Units Certificate to purchase, and the Company to sell, on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date at a price equal to the Stated Amount, a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Settlement Rate, unless an Early Settlement, a Fundamental Change Early Settlement or a Termination Event with respect to the Units of which such Purchase Contract is a part shall have occurred. The Settlement Rate is subject to adjustment as described in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement.
     No fractional shares of Common Stock will be issued upon settlement of Purchase Contracts, as provided in Section 5.09 of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement.
     Each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby that is settled through Early Settlement or Fundamental Change Early Settlement shall obligate the Holder of the related Corporate Units to purchase at the Purchase Price, and the Company to sell, a number of newly issued shares of Common Stock equal to the Minimum Settlement Rate (in the case of an Early Settlement) or applicable Settlement Rate plus the Make-Whole Share Amount (in the case of a Fundamental Change Early Settlement).
     In accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, unless a Termination Event shall have occurred, the Holder of this Corporate Units Certificate shall pay the Purchase Price for the shares of Common Stock purchased pursuant to each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby by effecting a Cash Settlement, an Early Settlement or, if applicable, a Fundamental Change Early Settlement or from the proceeds of the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) or a Final Remarketing of the Debentures underlying the Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures. A Holder of Corporate Units who (1) does not, on or prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the first Business Day immediately preceding the first day of the Final Remarketing Period make an effective Cash Settlement in the manner provided in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement or (2) on or prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the second Business Day immediately preceding the first day of the Final Remarketing Period (in the case of Corporate Units, unless a Special Event Redemption or Successful Optional Remarketing has occurred) or the second Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date (in the case of Corporate Units after the occurrence of a Special Event Redemption or Successful Optional Remarketing), does not make an effective Early Settlement, shall pay the Purchase Price for the shares of Common Stock to be delivered under the related Purchase Contract from the proceeds of the sale of the Debentures underlying the Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures held by the Collateral Agent in the Remarketing unless the Holder has previously made a Fundamental Change Early Settlement. If the Treasury Portfolio has replaced the Debentures as a component of Corporate Units, a Holder of Corporate Units shall pay the Purchase Price for the shares of Common Stock to be delivered under the related Purchase Contract from the proceeds at maturity of the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term).
 
     As provided in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, upon the occurrence of a Failed Final Remarketing, as of the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, each Holder of any Pledged Applicable Interests in Debentures, unless such Holder has elected Cash Settlement and delivered cash in accordance with Section 5.03(a) of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, shall be deemed to have exercised such Holder's Put Right with respect to the Debentures underlying such Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures and to have elected to have the Proceeds of the Put Right set-off against such Holder's obligation to pay the aggregate Purchase Price for the shares of Common Stock to be issued under the related Purchase Contracts in full satisfaction of such Holders' obligations under such Purchase Contracts.
     The Company shall not be obligated to issue any shares of Common Stock in respect of a Purchase Contract or deliver any certificates therefor to the Holder unless it shall have received payment of the aggregate Purchase Price for the shares of Common Stock to be purchased thereunder in the manner set forth in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement.
     The Purchase Contracts and all obligations and rights of the Company and the Holders thereunder, including, without limitation, the rights of the Holders to receive and the obligation of the Company to pay any Contract Adjustment Payments, shall immediately and automatically terminate, without the necessity of any notice or action by any Holder, the Purchase Contract Agent or the Company, if, on or prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, a Termination Event shall have occurred. Upon the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Company shall give written notice to the Purchase Contract Agent and to the Holders, at their addresses as they appear in the Security Register. Upon and after the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Collateral Agent shall release the Debentures underlying the Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures or the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) forming a part of each Corporate Unit from the Pledge. A Corporate Unit shall thereafter represent the right to receive the Debenture underlying the Applicable Ownership Interest in the Debentures or the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio forming a part of such Corporate Units in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement.
     Under the terms of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, the Purchase Contract Agent will be entitled to exercise the voting and any other consensual rights pertaining to the Debentures underlying the Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures, but only to the extent instructed in writing by the Holders. Upon receipt of notice of any meeting at which holders of Debentures are entitled to vote or upon any solicitation of consents, waivers or proxies of holders of Debentures, the Purchase Contract Agent shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, mail, first class, postage pre-paid, to the Corporate Units Holders the notice required by the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement.
     Upon the occurrence of a Special Event Redemption, the Collateral Agent shall surrender the Debentures underlying the Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures against delivery of an amount equal to the aggregate Redemption Price of such Debentures and shall deposit the funds in the Collateral Account in exchange for such Debentures. Thereafter, the Collateral Agent shall cause the Securities Intermediary to apply an amount equal to the aggregate Redemption Amount of such funds to purchase, on behalf of the Holders of Corporate Units, the Treasury Portfolio.
     Following the occurrence of a Special Event Redemption prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, the Collateral Agent shall have such security interest rights with respect to the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) as the Collateral Agent had in respect of Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures and the underlying Debentures, as provided in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement and any reference herein to the Debentures or Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures shall be deemed to be a
 
reference to the Treasury Portfolio or the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be.
     Upon the occurrence of a Successful Optional Remarketing and receipt in the Collateral Account of the proceeds thereof, the Collateral Agent shall cause the Securities Intermediary to apply an amount equal to the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price to purchase, on behalf of the Holders of Corporate Units, the Treasury Portfolio.
     Following the occurrence of a Successful Optional Remarketing, the Collateral Agent shall have such security interest rights with respect to the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) as the Collateral Agent had in respect of Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures and the underlying Debentures, as provided in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement and any reference herein to the Debentures or Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures shall be deemed to be a reference to the Treasury Portfolio or the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be.
     The Corporate Units Certificates are issuable only in registered form and only in denominations of a single Corporate Unit and any integral multiple thereof. The transfer of any Corporate Units Certificate will be registered and Corporate Units Certificates may be exchanged as provided in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement. A Holder who elects to substitute a Treasury Security for the Debenture underlying the Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures or Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, thereby creating Treasury Units, shall be responsible for any fees or expenses payable in connection therewith. Except as provided in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, such Corporate Unit shall not be separable into its constituent parts, and the rights and obligations of the Holder of such Corporate Unit in respect of the Applicable Ownership Interest in Debentures, or Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, and Purchase Contract constituting such Corporate Units may be transferred and exchanged only as a Corporate Unit.
     Subject to, and in compliance with, the conditions and terms set forth in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, the Holder of Corporate Units may effect a Collateral Substitution. From and after such Collateral Substitution, each Unit for which Pledged Treasury Securities secure the Holder's obligation under the Purchase Contract shall be referred to as a "Treasury Unit". A Holder may make such Collateral Substitution only in integral multiples of 20 Corporate Units for 20 Treasury Units. If Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio have replaced the Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures as a component of the Corporate Units as a result of a Special Event Redemption, a Holder may substitute Treasury Securities for the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio only in integral multiples of 80,000 Corporate Units. No Collateral Substitution is permitted following a Successful Optional Remarketing.
     Subject to and upon compliance with the provisions of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, at the option of the Holder thereof, Purchase Contracts underlying Units may be settled early by effecting an Early Settlement as provided in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement in integral multiples of 20 Corporate Units, or if Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio have replaced the Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures as a component of the Corporate Units, in integral multiples of 80,000 Corporate Units.
     Upon Early Settlement of Purchase Contracts by a Holder of the related Units, the Debentures underlying the Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures or the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) underlying such Units shall be released from the Pledge as provided in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement
 
and the Holder shall be entitled to receive a number of shares of Common Stock on account of each Purchase Contract forming part of a Corporate Unit as to which Early Settlement is effected equal to the Minimum Settlement Rate.
     Upon the occurrence of a Fundamental Change, a Holder of Corporate Units may effect Fundamental Change Early Settlement of the Purchase Contracts underlying such Corporate Units pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement in integral multiples of 20 Corporate Units, or if the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio have replaced the Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures as a component of the Corporate Units, in integral multiples of 80,000 Corporate Units. Upon Fundamental Change Early Settlement of Purchase Contracts by a Holder of the related Corporate Units, the Debentures underlying the Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures or the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) underlying such Corporate Units shall be released from the Pledge as provided in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement and the Holder shall be entitled to receive a number of shares of Common Stock on account of each Purchase Contract forming part of a Corporate Unit as to which Fundamental Change Early Settlement is effected equal to the applicable Settlement Rate.
     Upon registration of transfer of this Corporate Units Certificate, the transferee shall be bound (without the necessity of any other action on the part of such transferee, except as may be required by the Purchase Contract Agent pursuant to the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement), under the terms of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement and the Purchase Contracts evidenced hereby and the transferor shall be released from the obligations under the Purchase Contracts evidenced by this Corporate Units Certificate. The Company covenants and agrees, and the Holder, by its acceptance hereof, likewise covenants and agrees, to be bound by the provisions of this paragraph.
     The Holder of this Corporate Units Certificate, by its acceptance hereof, authorizes the Purchase Contract Agent to enter into and perform the related Purchase Contracts forming part of the Corporate Units evidenced hereby on its behalf as its attorney-in-fact, expressly withholds any consent to the assumption (i.e., affirmance) of the Purchase Contracts by the Company or its trustee in the event that the Company becomes the subject of a case under the Bankruptcy Code, agrees to be bound by the terms and provisions thereof, covenants and agrees to perform its obligations under such Purchase Contracts, consents to the provisions of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, authorizes the Purchase Contract Agent to enter into and perform the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement on its behalf as its attorney-in-fact, and consents to the Pledge of the Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures and the underlying Debentures or the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term), as the case may be, underlying this Corporate Units Certificate pursuant to the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement. The Holder further covenants and agrees that, to the extent and in the manner provided in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, but subject to the terms thereof, any payments with respect the Debentures underlying the Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures (other than interest payments thereon) or the Proceeds of the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term), as the case may be, on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date equal to the aggregate Purchase Price for the related Purchase Contracts shall be paid by the Collateral Agent to the Company in satisfaction of such Holder's obligations under the related Purchase Contracts and such Holder shall acquire no right, title or interest in such payments.
     Subject to certain exceptions, the provisions of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement may be amended with the consent of the Holders of a majority of the Purchase Contracts.
 
     The Purchase Contracts shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, applicable to agreements made and to be performed wholly within such state.
     The Purchase Contracts shall not, prior to the settlement thereof, entitle the Holder to any of the rights of a holder of shares of Common Stock.
     Prior to due presentment of this Certificate for registration of transfer, the Company, the Purchase Contract Agent and its Affiliates and any agent of the Company or the Purchase Contract Agent may treat the Person in whose name this Corporate Units Certificate is registered as the owner of the Corporate Units evidenced hereby for the purpose of receiving payments of interest payable on the Debentures underlying the Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures, receiving payments of Contract Adjustment Payments (subject to any applicable record date), performance of the Purchase Contracts and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not any payments in respect thereof be overdue and notwithstanding any notice to the contrary, and neither the Company, the Purchase Contract Agent nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

The transfer of any Treasury Units Certificate will be registered and Treasury Units Certificates may be exchanged as provided in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement. A Holder who elects to substitute Debentures or Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, for Treasury Securities, thereby recreating Corporate Units, shall be responsible for any fees or expenses payable in connection therewith. Except as provided in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, such Treasury Unit shall not be separable into its constituent parts, and the rights and obligations of the Holder of such Treasury Unit in respect of the Treasury Security and the Purchase Contract constituting such Treasury Unit may be transferred and exchanged only as a Treasury Unit.
     Subject to, and in compliance with, the conditions and terms set forth in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, the Holder of Treasury Units may effect a Collateral Substitution. From and after such substitution, each Unit for which Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures, or Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, secure the Holder's obligation under the Purchase Contract shall be referred to as a "Corporate Unit". A Holder may make such Collateral substitution only in multiples of 20 Treasury Units for 20 Corporate Units. If Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio have replaced the Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures as a component of the Corporate Units as a result of a Special Event Redemption, a Holder may substitute Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio for Treasury Securities only in integral multiples of 80,000 Treasury Units. No Collateral Substitution is permitted following a Successful Optional Remarketing.
     Subject to and upon compliance with the provisions of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, at the option of the Holder thereof, Purchase Contracts underlying Units may be settled early by effecting an Early Settlement as provided in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement in integral multiples of 20 Treasury Units.
     Upon Early Settlement of Purchase Contracts by a Holder of the related Units, the Pledged Treasury Securities underlying such Units shall be released from the Pledge as provided in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement and the Holder shall be entitled to receive a number of shares of Common Stock on account of each Purchase Contract forming part of a Treasury Unit as to which Early Settlement is effected equal to the Minimum Settlement Rate.
     Upon the occurrence of a Fundamental Change, a Holder of Treasury Units may effect Fundamental Change Early Settlement of the Purchase Contracts underlying such Treasury Units pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement in integral multiples of 20 Treasury Units. Upon Fundamental Change Early Settlement of Purchase Contracts by a Holder of the related Treasury Units, the Pledged Treasury Securities underlying such Treasury Units shall be released from the Pledge as provided in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement and the Holder shall be entitled to receive a number of shares of Common Stock on account of each Purchase Contract forming part of a Treasury Unit as to which Fundamental Change Early Settlement is effected equal to the applicable Settlement Rate.
     Upon registration of transfer of this Treasury Units Certificate, the transferee shall be bound (without the necessity of any other action on the part of such transferee, except as may be required by the Purchase Contract Agent pursuant to the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement), under the terms of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement and the Purchase Contracts evidenced hereby and the transferor shall be released from the obligations under the Purchase Contracts evidenced by this Treasury Units Certificate. The Company covenants and agrees, and the Holder, by its acceptance hereof, likewise covenants and agrees, to be bound by the provisions of this paragraph.
 
     The Holder of this Treasury Units Certificate, by its acceptance hereof, authorizes the Purchase Contract Agent to enter into and perform the related Purchase Contracts forming part of the Treasury Units evidenced hereby on its behalf as its attorney-in-fact, expressly withholds any consent to the assumption (i.e., affirmance) of the Purchase Contracts by the Company or its trustee in the event that the Company becomes the subject of a case under the Bankruptcy Code, agrees to be bound by the terms and provisions thereof, covenants and agrees to perform its obligations under such Purchase Contracts, consents to the provisions of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, authorizes the Purchase Contract Agent to enter into and perform the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement on its behalf as its attorney-in-fact, and consents to the Pledge of the Treasury Securities underlying this Treasury Units Certificate pursuant to the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement. The Holder further covenants and agrees, that, to the extent and in the manner provided in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, but subject to the terms thereof, payments in respect to the aggregate principal amount at maturity of the Pledged Treasury Securities on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date equal to the aggregate Purchase Price for the related Purchase Contracts shall be paid by the Collateral Agent to the Company in satisfaction of such Holder's obligations under such Purchase Contracts and such Holder shall acquire no right, title or interest in such payments.
     Subject to certain exceptions, the provisions of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement may be amended with the consent of the Holders of a majority of the Purchase Contracts.
     The Purchase Contracts shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, applicable to agreements made and to be performed wholly within such state.
     The Purchase Contracts shall not, prior to the settlement thereof, entitle the Holder to any of the rights of a holder of shares of Common Stock.
     Prior to due presentment of this Certificate for registration of transfer, the Company, the Purchase Contract Agent and its Affiliates and any agent of the Company or the Purchase Contract Agent may treat the Person in whose name this Treasury Units Certificate is registered as the owner of the Treasury Units evidenced hereby for the purpose of receiving payments of Contract Adjustment Payments (subject to any applicable record date), performance of the Purchase Contracts and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not any payments in respect thereof be overdue and notwithstanding any notice to the contrary, and neither the Company, the Purchase Contract Agent nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

The Remarketing Agent's agreement to indemnify the Company and any other indemnified person as aforesaid is expressly conditioned upon the Remarketing Agent being notified of the action in connection therewith brought against the Company or any other indemnified person by letter, telegram, or facsimile transmission addressed to it at its address furnished to the Company for the purpose, with reasonable
 
promptness after the first legal process which discloses the nature of the liability or claim shall have been served upon the Company or any other indemnified person (or after the Company or any such person shall have received notice of such service on any agent designated by the Company or any such person), but failure so to notify the Remarketing Agent shall not relieve the Remarketing Agent from any liability which it may have to the Company or any other indemnified person otherwise than on account of the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 7.

The Remarketing Agent shall not be liable for any settlement of any such action effected without its consent (which will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of the Remarketing Agent from all liability arising out of such loss, expense, liability or claim.
     (a) If the indemnification provided for in this Agreement is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under Sections 7(a) and 7(b) above for any reason other than as specified therein in respect of any losses, expenses, liabilities or claims referred to therein, then each applicable indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, expenses, liabilities or claims (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Remarketing Agent on the other hand from the remarketing of the Remarketed Debentures; or (ii) if the allocation provided in clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Remarketing Agent on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, expenses, liabilities or claims, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by
 
the Company on the one hand and the Remarketing Agent on the other hand shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds (before deducting expenses) to the Company from the Remarketing of the Remarketed Debentures bears to the total fees received by the Remarketing Agent. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Remarketing Agent on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Remarketing Agent and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to above shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating or defending any claim or action.
     (b) The Company and the Remarketing Agent agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8 were determined by allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 8(a). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, the Remarketing Agent shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the Remarketing Fee exceeds the amount of any damages that the Remarketing Agent have otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in Section 7 and Section 8 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.

The provisions of Sections 7 and 8 shall survive the termination and cancellation of this Agreement.

If a Special Event shall occur and be continuing prior to the earlier of the date of a Successful Remarketing and the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, the Company may, at its option, redeem the Debentures in whole, but not in part, on any Interest Payment Date, at a price per Debenture equal to the Redemption Price, payable on the date of redemption (the "").
Special Event Redemption
Special Event Redemption Date
     In connection with any Special Event Redemption, in exchange for any Debentures surrendered for redemption on or after the relevant Special Event Redemption Date, the Trustee shall pay the Redemption Price (a) to the Collateral Agent, in the case of Debentures that underlie the Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures
 
included in Corporate Units, which amount shall be applied by the Collateral Agent in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, and (b) to the Holders of the Separate Debentures, in the case of Separate Debentures.
     Section 3.02 . The Company may redeem the Debentures, in whole but not in part, on a date not earlier than June 1, 2013, at a price per Debenture equal to the Redemption Price, payable on the date of redemption (the "") to the Holder presenting such Debenture for redemption.
Optional Redemption
Optional Redemption Date
     The Company may at any time irrevocably waive its right to redeem the Debentures for any specified period (including the remaining term of the Debentures). The Company may not redeem the Debentures under this Section 3.02 if the Debentures have been accelerated and such acceleration has not been rescinded or unless all accrued and unpaid interest has been paid in full on all outstanding Debentures for all Interest Periods terminating on or prior to the Redemption Date.
     Section 3.03 . Solely with respect to the Debentures, Section 1104 of the Base Indenture is hereby amended and supplemented by adding the following:
Notice of Redemption
     In addition, the Company shall notify the Collateral Agent in writing that the Company intends to redeem the Debentures on the Redemption Date and, in the case of a Special Event Redemption, that a Special Event has occurred. If the Company elects to redeem the Debentures in connection with a Special Event Redemption, the Company shall appoint the Quotation Agent to assist the Company in determining the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price.
     Section 3.04 . Notice of redemption having been given as provided for in Section 1104 of the Base Indenture, as amended and supplemented by this Supplemental Indenture, the Debentures shall become due and payable on the Redemption Date at the Redemption Price. Unless the Company defaults in the payment of the Redemption Price, on and after the Redemption Date, (a) interest shall cease to accrue on the Debentures immediately prior to the close of business on the Redemption Date and (b) the Debentures shall no longer be outstanding and all rights of the Holders in respect of the Debentures shall terminate and lapse (other than the right to receive the Redemption Price upon surrender of such Debentures but without interest on such Redemption Price). The redemption provisions of Sections 1105 and 1106 of the Base Indenture shall not apply to the Debentures.
Effect of Redemption
     Section 3.05 . On or prior to the Redemption Date, the Company shall deposit with the Trustee immediately available funds in an amount sufficient to pay, on the Redemption Date, the aggregate Redemption Price for Debentures being redeemed. If the Company gives a notice of redemption with respect to the Debentures pursuant to Section 3.03 in connection with an Optional Redemption, and the Company has paid to the Trustee the Redemption Price of the Debentures to be redeemed, then, on the Redemption Date, the Trustee will irrevocably deposit such funds with the Depositary. The Company will also give the Depositary irrevocable instructions and authority to pay the Redemption Price in immediately available funds to the Holders of beneficial interests in the Global Debentures. If any Redemption Date is not a Business Day, then the Redemption Price will be payable on the next Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay). Interest to be paid on or before the Redemption Date for any Debentures called for Redemption shall be payable to the Persons in whose names the Debentures are registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Dates for the related Interest Payment Dates. If any Debentures called for redemption are not so paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, the Redemption Price will, until paid, bear interest from the Redemption Date at the Coupon Rate or Reset Rate, as the case may be. In exchange for the unredeemed portion of such surrendered Debentures, new Debentures in an aggregate principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion will be issued.

The Company will, not later than 15 days prior to the first day of the Applicable Remarketing Period, request that the Depositary or its nominee notify the Beneficial Owners or Depositary Participants holding Separate Debentures, Corporate Units and Treasury Units, and shall provide a copy of such request to the Collateral Agent and the Purchase Contract Agent, in the case of an Optional Remarketing, of the Company's intent to attempt an Optional Remarketing in the Applicable Remarketing Period, and in all cases, of the proposed Remarketing Date or Dates and the procedures to be followed in each Remarketing, including the procedures to be followed by Holders of Separate Debentures to participate in a Remarketing, the applicable procedures for holders of Corporate Units to create Treasury Units or holders of Treasury Units to recreate Corporate Units, the applicable procedures for holders of Corporate Units to effect an Early Settlement and, in the case of a Final Remarketing, applicable procedures to effect a Cash Settlement and the applicable procedures that must be followed by a Holder of Separate Debentures if such Holder wishes to exercise its Put Right or by a Holder if such Holder elects not to exercise its Put Right.
          (b) Each Holder of Separate Debentures may elect to have Separate Debentures held by such Holder remarketed in any Remarketing. A Holder making such an election must, pursuant to the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, notify the Custodial Agent and deliver such Separate Debentures to the Custodial Agent prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the second Business Day immediately preceding the first day of the Applicable Remarketing Period (but no earlier than the Interest Payment Date immediately preceding such first day). Any such notice and delivery may not be conditioned upon the level at which the Reset Rate is established in the Remarketing. Any such notice and delivery may be withdrawn prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the second Business Day immediately preceding the first day of the Applicable Remarketing Period in accordance with the provisions set forth in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement. Any such notice and delivery not withdrawn by such time will be irrevocable with respect to each Remarketing to occur during the Applicable Remarketing Period. Pursuant to Sections 5.02 and 5.03 of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, by 11:00 a.m., New York City time, in the case of an Optional Remarketing, or promptly after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, in the case of a Final Remarketing, on the Business Day immediately preceding the first day of the Applicable Remarketing Period, the Custodial Agent, based on the notices and deliveries received by it prior to such time, shall notify the Remarketing Agent of the aggregate principal amount of Separate Debentures tendered for Remarketing.

          (c) The right of each Holder of Remarketed Debentures to have such Debentures remarketed and sold on any Remarketing Date shall be subject to the conditions that (i)(A) the Remarketing Agent conducts any Optional Remarketing or (B) in the case of a Final Remarketing, that no Successful Optional Remarketing has occurred pursuant to the terms of the Remarketing Agreement, (ii) neither a Special Event Redemption nor a Termination Event has occurred prior to such Remarketing Date, (iii) the Remarketing Agent(s) are able to find a purchaser or purchasers for Remarketed Debentures at the Remarketing Price based on the Reset Rate and (iv) the purchaser or purchasers of the Remarketed Debentures deliver the purchase price therefor to the Remarketing Agent as and when required.

     Section 8.02 .
Remarketing
          (a) Unless a Special Event Redemption, a Termination Event or a Successful Optional Remarketing has occurred prior to the first day of any Optional Remarketing Period, on any Remarketing Date, if any, selected by the Company in accordance with the Remarketing Agreement for such Optional Remarketing Period, the Remarketing Agent shall, pursuant and subject to the terms of the Remarketing Agreement, use its reasonable efforts to remarket the Remarketed Debentures at the Remarketing Price. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company shall determine in its sole discretion if and when to attempt an Optional Remarketing.
          (b) If the Company does not elect to conduct an Optional Remarketing, or if the Company elects to conduct an Optional Remarketing, but a Failed Optional Remarketing occurs, during the Final Remarketing Period, the Remarketing Agent shall use its reasonable efforts to remarket the Remarketed Debentures at the Remarketing Price. It is understood and agreed that Remarketing on any Remarketing Date will be considered successful and no further attempts will be made if the resulting proceeds are at least equal to the Remarketing Price.
     Section 8.03 .
Reset Rate
          (a) In connection with each Remarketing, the Remarketing Agent shall determine the Reset Rate (rounded to the nearest one-thousandth (0.001) of one percent per annum).
          (b) Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the Reset Rate shall in no event exceed the maximum rate permitted by applicable law.
          (c) In the event of a Failed Final Remarketing or if no Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures are included in Corporate Units and none of the Holders of the Separate Debentures elect to have their Debentures remarketed in any Remarketing, the applicable interest rate on the Debentures will not be reset and will continue to be the Coupon Rate.
          (d) In the event of a Successful Remarketing, the Coupon Rate shall be reset on the Remarketing Settlement Date to the Reset Rate as determined by the Remarketing Agent under the Remarketing Agreement, and the Company shall issue a press release promptly after such Successful Remarketing containing such Reset Rate and publish such information on its website.
          (e) In the event of a Failed Optional Remarketing or a Failed Final Remarketing the Company shall issue a press release and cause a notice of any Failed Remarketing to be published on its website (with a copy of such notice to be provided to the Purchase Contract Agent) before 9:00 a.m. New York City time on the Business Day immediately following such Failed Optional Remarketing, or in the case of the Final Remarketing, 9:00 a.m. New York City time on May 27, 2011.

Failed Remarketing
 
condition precedent to the Remarketing has not been fulfilled, a Failed Remarketing shall be deemed to have occurred.
     Section 8.05 .
Put Right
          (a) Subject to paragraph (b) hereof, if there has not been a Successful Remarketing prior to the end of the Final Remarketing Period, Holders of Debentures will, subject to this Section 8.05, have the right (the ") to require the Company to purchase such Debentures on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, at a price per Debenture to be purchased equal to the principal amount of the applicable Debenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the Purchase Contract Settlement Date (the "").

Put Price
          (b) The Put Right of Holders of Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures that are part of Corporate Units will be deemed to be automatically exercised unless such Holders (1) prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the second Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, provide written notice to the Purchase Contract Agent of their intention to settle the related Purchase Contract with separate cash, and (2) on or prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, deliver to the Collateral Agent $50 in cash per Purchase Contract, in each case pursuant to the terms and conditions of Section 5.03(b)(iii) of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement with respect to such settlement, and such Holders shall be deemed to have elected to have a portion of the proceeds of the Put Right of the Debentures underlying such Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures equal to the Purchase Price set-off against such Holders' obligations to pay the aggregate Purchase Price for the shares of Common Stock to be issued under the Purchase Contracts in full satisfaction of such Holders' obligations under the Purchase Contracts, and any remaining amount of the Put Price following satisfaction of the related Purchase Contracts will be paid to such Holders.
          (c) The Put Right of a Holder of a Separate Debenture shall only be exercisable upon delivery of a notice substantially in the form attached as Exhibit B hereto, together with such Holder's separate Debenture, to the Trustee by such Holder on or prior to the second Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date. On or prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, the Company shall deposit with the Trustee immediately available funds in an amount sufficient to pay, on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, the aggregate Put Price of all Separate Debentures with respect to which a Holder has exercised a Put Right. In exchange for any Separate Debentures surrendered pursuant to the Put Right, the Trustee shall then distribute such amount to the Holders of such Separate Debentures.
          (d) Debentures purchased pursuant to the Put Right shall be cancelled by the Trustee.
     Section 9.01 . Solely with respect to the Debentures, in addition to the events listed as Events of Default in Section 501 of the Base Indenture, a default in the payment on the date payment is due of the Put Price of any Debentures following the exercise of the Put Right by any Holder of Debentures, unless the Debentures are a component of Corporate Units, in which case the Company's obligation to pay the portion of the Put Price owing in respect of the principal of the Debentures so put will be netted against such Holder's obligations to pay the purchase price under the related Purchase Contract on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date in full satisfaction of such Holder's obligations under the Purchase Contracts, shall be an additional Event of Default with respect to the Debentures.
Additional Events of Default
     Section 10.01 . The Company agrees, and by acceptance of a Corporate Unit or a Separate Debenture, each Holder will be deemed to have agreed (1) to treat each beneficial owner of a Corporate Unit as the owner of the Applicable Ownership Interest in Debentures constituting a part of such Corporate Unit for U.S. federal income tax purposes and (2) to treat the Debentures as indebtedness for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which is not subject to the contingent payment debt regulations.

Archer-Daniels-Midland Company 4666 Faries Parkway Decatur, Illinois 62526
Ladies and Gentlemen:
     We have acted as counsel to Archer-Daniels-Midland Company, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the purchase and sale of an aggregate of 35,000,000 equity units (40,000,000 equity units if the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full) (the "Equity Units") pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement, dated May 28, 2008 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), among the Company and the underwriters named therein. The Equity Units will initially consist of 35,000,000 corporate units (the "Corporate Units") with a stated amount, per Corporate Unit, of $50 (the "Stated Amount"). Each Corporate Unit will initially consist of (a) a stock purchase contract (each a "Stock Purchase Contract") under which (i) the holder will agree to purchase on June 1, 2011 (the "Purchase Contract Settlement Date"), subject to acceleration in connection with any early settlement of such Stock Purchase Contract pursuant to the provisions of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement (as defined below), for an amount of cash equal to the Stated Amount, a number of shares (the "Issuable Common Stock") of common stock of the Company, no par value (the "Common Stock"), determined pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement and (ii) the Company will pay to the holder contract adjustment payments at a rate of 1.55% per annum and (b) a 1/20, or 5%, undivided beneficial ownership interest in a $1,000 principal amount of debentures due 2041 (the "Debentures") issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of September 20, 2006 (the "Base Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York (successor to JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A.), as Trustee, as amended and supplemented by a supplemental indenture dated as of June 3, 2008 (the "First Supplemental Indenture") between the Company and The Bank of New York, as Trustee. The Base Indenture, as so amended and supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, is hereinafter referred to as the "Indenture."
     The Equity Units are to be issued pursuant to the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement (the "Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement"), dated as of June 3, 2008, among the Company, The Bank of New York, as purchase contract agent (the "Purchase Contract Agent"), and The Bank of New York as collateral agent, custodial agent and securities intermediary. In accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, a holder's ownership interest in the Debentures initially will be pledged to secure such holder's obligation to purchase the Issuable Common Stock on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, such pledge to be on the terms and conditions set forth in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement.
     In that connection, we have reviewed originals or copies of the following documents:
     (a) The Underwriting Agreement.
     (b) The Indenture.
     (c) The form of Debenture.
     (d) The Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement.
     (e) The form of Corporate Units certificate.
 
     (f) The certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Company, as amended through September 22, 2005 and February 3, 2007, respectively.
     (g) The automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-137541) filed by the Company under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") on September 22, 2006 and a post-effective amendment no. 1 thereto ("Post-Effective Amendment No. 1") filed by the Company under the Securities Act with the Commission on May 27, 2008 (such automatic shelf registration statement, as so amended, including information deemed to be part thereof at the time of effectiveness pursuant to Rule 430B under the Securities Act, and including the documents incorporated by reference therein, being hereinafter referred to as the "Registration Statement").
     (h) The prospectus, dated May 27, 2008, forming a part of the Registration Statement, with respect to the offering from time to time of the Company's securities (the "Base Prospectus"), as supplemented by the final prospectus supplement, dated May 28, 2008, relating to the Equity Units (the "Final Prospectus Supplement") (the Base Prospectus, as supplemented by the Final Prospectus Supplement, in the form filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act, including the documents incorporated by reference therein, being hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Prospectus").
     (i) Originals or copies of such other corporate records of the Company, certificates of public officials and of officers of the Company and agreements and other documents as we have deemed necessary as a basis for the opinions expressed below.
     In our review, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of the originals of the documents submitted to us and the conformity to authentic originals of any documents submitted to us as copies. We have further assumed, as to matters of fact, the truthfulness of the representations made in certificates of public officials and officers of the Company; that each of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement and the Indenture is the legal, valid and binding obligation of each party thereto, other than the Company, enforceable against each such party in accordance with its terms. We also have assumed that the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement or the Indenture will not (a) contravene the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company, (b) violate any law, rule or regulation applicable to the Company or (c) result in any conflict with or breach of any agreement or document binding on the Company.
     Our opinions set forth below are limited to the law of the State of Minnesota and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and, with respect to the opinions expressed in paragraphs 1-3 only, the law of the State of New York, and we do not express any opinion herein concerning any other law.
     Based upon the foregoing, and upon such other investigation as we have deemed necessary and subject to the qualifications set forth below, we are of the opinion that:
1. Each of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement and the Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms.
2. The Debentures have been duly authorized by the Company, and when the Debentures have been duly executed by the Company and authenticated by the Trustee in accordance with the Indenture and delivered against payment for the Corporate Units of which they are a part in accordance with the terms of Underwriting Agreement and the Purchase Contract and Pledge
 
Agreement, the Debentures will constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms and entitled to the benefits of the Indenture.
3. The Corporate Units have been duly executed by the Company and, when authenticated in accordance with the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement and delivered to and paid for as provided in the Underwriting Agreement, assuming that the certificates evidencing the Corporate Units have been duly executed by the Purchase Contract Agent, as attorney-in-fact of the holders thereof, the Corporate Units will constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms.
4. The shares of Issuable Common Stock have been duly authorized by the Company and reserved for issuance and, when issued and delivered in accordance with the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, will be duly and validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable, and the issuance of the Issuable Common Stock will not be subject to preemptive rights pursuant to the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, or the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company.
     The opinions set forth above are subject to (i) the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally (including without limitation all laws relating to fraudulent transfers) and (ii) the effect of general principles of equity, including without limitation concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).
     We understand that this opinion is to be used in connection with the Registration Statement. We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Registration Statement and to the use of our name in the Prospectus under the caption "Legal Matters." In giving this consent, we do not hereby admit that we are in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act or the rules and regulations of the Commission promulgated thereunder.

ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND REPORTS ANNUAL RESULTS
 
 
 
 
 
ADMs 2008 results demonstrate the ability of our people to leverage our global assets against an exceptional set of opportunities said Patricia Woertz, Chairman and CEO.  We had an outstanding year, highlighted by record segment operating profit.  ADM met the needs of food, feed, fuel and industrial customers even as strong demand for crops and commodities challenged the global supply chain.

Discussion of Operations
 
Net sales and other operating income increased 78 % to $ 21.8 billion for the quarter and 59 % to $ 69.8 billion for the twelve months.  For both the quarter and year, higher selling prices resulting primarily from sharp rises in underlying commodity costs accounted for approximately 90 % of the increase while higher sales volumes, principally ethanol and merchandised oilseeds and grains, accounted for the remaining 10 % increase.
 
A summary of segment operating profit and net earnings is as follows:
 
 
Net earnings decreased $ 583 million for the quarter and $ 360 million for the twelve months due principally to the impact on Earnings before income taxes of $ 967 million and $ 1.042 billion of gains related to asset disposals recognized in the fourth quarter and twelve months of 2007, respectively.  In addition, Corporate results decreased due to charges related to LIFO inventory valuations which increased from $ 60 million to $ 198 million for the quarter and from $ 207 million to $ 569 million for the year.  Income taxes decreased $ 272 million for the quarter and $ 170 million for the twelve months due principally to decreased income before tax.

Oilseeds Processing Operating Profit
 
 
Oilseeds Processing operating profit decreased $ 217 million for the quarter and $ 99 million for the twelve months due principally to the $ 440 million gain in last years quarter related to the exchange of the Companys interests in certain Chinese joint ventures for shares in Wilmar International Ltd., partially offset by improved global processing margins.  Crushing and origination results increased $ 196 million for the quarter and $ 313 million for the twelve months due to increased operating margins from continuing strong global demand for protein meal and vegetable oil and to higher volumes and margins related to origination and fertilizer operations.  Refining, packaging, biodiesel and other results decreased $ 11 million for the quarter and $ 21 million for the twelve months due principally to asset impairment charges of   $ 9 million for the quarter and $ 27 million for the year.  Last years twelve months refining, packaging, biodiesel and other results include a $ 14 million gain from business disposals.
 
 
 
Corn Processing Operating Profit
 
 
Corn Processing operating profit increased $ 33 million for the quarter and decreased $ 144 million for the twelve months.  Average selling prices for sweeteners and starches increased for both the quarter and twelve months while average ethanol selling prices decreased slightly.  Ethanol sales volumes increased for both the quarter and the twelve months due to good demand and improved gasoline blending economics.  Ethanol sales volumes also increased due to additional sales of merchandised product.  Net corn costs were relatively unchanged for the quarter but were higher for the year.  Manufacturing costs increased for both the quarter and twelve months due principally to higher energy-related costs.

Agricultural Services Operating Profit
 
 
Agricultural Services results decreased $ 140 million for the quarter due primarily to last years $ 153 million gain resulting from the sale of the Companys interest in Agricore United.  Agricultural Services results increased $ 479 million for the twelve months due principally to enhanced merchandising and handling margins caused by the highly volatile grain markets and favorable risk management results partially offset by higher operating costs and last years $ 153 million gain from the Agricore United disposal.
 
 
 
 
Other Operating Profit
 
 
Other operating profit decreased $ 51 million for the quarter and increased $ 44 million for the twelve months.  Wheat, cocoa and malt operations declined $ 21 million for the quarter and increased $ 8 million for the twelve months due principally to lower equity earnings of affiliates and decreased cocoa processing margins, partially offset by improved malt operating margins.  Last years twelve month results include a   $ 39 million gain from business disposals.  Financial earnings declined $ 30 million for the quarter due primarily to lower valuations of the Companys managed fund investments.  Financial earnings increased $ 36 million for the twelve months due principally to higher brokerage services income.

Corporate Results
 
 
Corporate results decreased $ 480 million for the quarter and $ 810 million for the year due principally to increases in LIFO charges of $ 138 million for the quarter and $ 362 million for the year and to securities gains recorded in the prior year of  $ 363 million and $ 374 million for the fourth quarter and year respectively.  Corporate costs increased $ 13 million for the quarter and $ 51 million for the year due principally to increased reorganization and realignment costs.  Other principally represents the elimination of after-tax earnings of minority interests.

    Financial Highlights
Discussion of Operations
 
Net sales and other operating income increased 65 % to $ 21.16 billion due principally to higher selling prices resulting primarily from sharp rises in underlying commodity costs and, to a lesser extent, foreign exchange translation impacts.  Sales volumes were comparable.
A summary of first quarter segment operating profit and net earnings is as follows:
Net earnings increased $ 609 million due principally to a $ 379 million increase in segment operating profit and from the positive impact on Corporate results of the change in LIFO inventory valuations.  In addition, income taxes increased due principally to increased pretax earnings, partially offset by a decreased effective tax rate resulting from changes in the geographic mix of pretax earnings.

Oilseeds Processing Operating Profit
Oilseeds Processing operating profit increased $ 301 million to $ 510 million from $ 209 million last year. Crushing and origination results increased $ 208 million due principally to improved global crush margins primarily related to favorable raw material positioning.  Origination margins increased in Europe and South America and fertilizer results improved in South America due principally to increased sales volumes. Refining, packaging, biodiesel and other results increased $ 44 million due principally to improved refining margins and improved biodiesel margins in Europe and South America.  In addition, biodiesel sales volumes in South America increased due to the recently-opened plant in Rondonopolis, Brazil.  Asia results increased $ 49 million due principally to increased equity earnings related to our investment in Wilmar International Ltd.
 
Corn Processing Operating Profit
Corn Processing operating profit decreased $ 135 million to $ 118 million from $ 253 million last year.  Sweeteners and Starches operating profit decreased $ 102 million to $ 65 million due principally to sharply higher net corn and energy costs, partially offset by increased sales volumes and higher average selling prices. Bioproducts operating profit decreased $ 33 million to $ 53 million due principally to higher net corn and energy costs partially offset by higher average selling prices and increased sales volumes for ethanol and lysine.  Net corn costs were negatively impacted this quarter by mark-to-market losses on corn futures and options used to economically hedge sales obligations.
 
 
 
Archer Daniels Midland Company
Page 4
Agricultural Services Operating Profit
Agricultural Services results increased $ 199 million to $ 428 million due principally to improved global merchandising and handling margins resulting from opportunities created by volatile commodity and freight market conditions, global shifts in the sources of grain supplies and the delayed U.S. harvest.  Transportation results were similar as lower barge freight volumes and increased operating costs were partially offset by increased barge freight rates.
 
Other Operating Profit
Other operating profit increased $ 14 million due principally to improved operating margins in wheat and cocoa, higher equity earnings of affiliates and increased sales volumes of cocoa and chocolate products partially offset by decreased interest income from the Companys brokerage services business and reduced income from the Companys managed fund investments.  Wheat, cocoa and malt includes one-time gains of $ 9 million related to the disposal of the Companys Malt business.
 
Corporate Results
Corporate results increased $ 468 million due principally to a LIFO credit of $ 453 million compared to a LIFO charge of $ 83 million last year.  Investment income/(expense) decreased $ 65 million primarily due to increased interest expense.

Discussion of Operations
 
Net sales and other operating income increased 1 % to $ 16.7 billion for the quarter and increased 29 % to $ 37.8 billion for the six months.

A summary of segment operating profit and net earnings is as follows:
Net earnings increased $ 112 million for the quarter and $ 722 million for the six months due principally to the positive impact on corporate results of the changes in LIFO inventory valuations.

Two significant, negative items related to equity investments impacted results
 
Archer Daniels Midland Company (NYSE: ADM) today announced net earnings of $ 8 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2009, including a $ 132 million non-cash after-tax charge related to currency derivative losses of the Companys equity investee, Gruma S.A.B. de C.V., and a $ 97 million income tax charge related to the Companys investment in Wilmar International Limited.  Net earnings for the quarter ended March 31, 2008 were $ 517 million.  Net sales and other operating income decreased 21 % to $ 14.8 billion.
 
While the quarterly results were adversely impacted by two significant, unusual items, our underlying performance was solid in view of the global economic conditions and the associated challenges faced by our industry, said Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer Patricia Woertz.  Our financial condition is strong and we remain focused on managing risks and costs as we execute our long-term growth strategy.

 Financial Highlights
(Amounts in millions, except per share data and percentages)
 
Discussion of Operations
 
Net sales and other operating income decreased 21 % to $ 14.8 billion for the quarter and increased 10 % to $ 52.7 billion for the nine months.  For the quarter, decreased average selling prices, resulting principally from price moderation of underlying commodity costs and foreign exchange translation impacts, accounted for approximately 85 % of the decline, the remainder attributable to decreased sales volumes.  Year-to-date net sales and other operating income increased 10 % due principally to increased average selling prices resulting primarily from higher underlying commodity costs partially offset by decreased sales volumes.
A summary of segment operating profit and net earnings is as follows:
Segment operating profit decreased $ 659 million for the quarter and decreased $ 420 million for the nine months.  Corporate results increased $ 56 million and $ 806 million for the quarter and nine months, respectively.  Income taxes decreased $ 94 million for the quarter and increased $ 173 million for the nine months.  Income taxes for the quarter and nine months include a $ 97 million income tax charge resulting from the restructuring of the holding company structure in which the Company holds a portion of its equity investment in Wilmar International Limited.  Excluding this $ 97 million income tax charge, income tax rates were broadly comparable and income tax expense changed in line with changes in pre-tax income.

Oilseeds Processing Operating Profit
Oilseeds Processing operating profit decreased $ 13 million for the quarter and increased $ 387 million for the nine months. Crushing and origination results decreased $ 79 million for the quarter due principally toweaker North American crushing margins and weaker fertilizer margins in South America, as the economic slowdown reduced product demand.  Crushing and origination results increased $ 175 million for the nine months due principally to improved global crushing and origination margins partially offset by lower fertilizer sales volumes and margins.  Refining, packaging, biodiesel and other results increased $ 13 million for the quarter primarily due to improved margins for edible soy proteins.  In addition, refining, packaging, biodiesel and other results for the nine months improved due to increased biodiesel sales volumes and margins in South America and the absence of asset abandonment charges of $ 18 million included in the nine months ended March 31, 2008.  Asia results increased $ 53 million for the quarter and $ 116 million for the nine months due principally to improved earnings related to equity investments, principally Wilmar International Limited, and a gain of $ 18 million from the disposal of an equity investment.
 
Corn Processing Operating Profit
Corn Processing operating profit decreased $ 123 million for the quarter and $ 503 million for the nine months. Sweeteners and starches operating profit increased $ 44 million for the quarter primarily due to higher average selling prices partially offset by higher net corn costs and lower sales volumes.  Sweeteners and starches operating profit decreased $ 67 million for the nine months due principally to higher net corn costs partially offset by higher average selling prices.  Bioproducts operating profit decreased $ 167 million for the quarter and $ 436 million for the nine months due principally to a significant decline in ethanol margins resulting from higher net corn costs, lower average selling prices and inventory write-downs.

Agricultural Services Operating Profit
Agricultural Services operating profit decreased $ 245 million for the quarter as global supplies of agricultural commodities increased, while demand slowed resulting in a contraction in merchandising and handling opportunities this quarter.

Transportation results increased for the quarter due principally to reduced operating costs partially offset by lower barge freight rates.  Transportation results for the nine months increased primarily due to higher barge freight rates.
 
Other Operating Profit
Other operating profit decreased $ 278 million for the quarter and $ 405 million for the nine months.  Wheat, cocoa, malt and sugar operating profit decreased $ 213 million for the quarter and $ 174 million for the nine months due principally to lower equity earnings from the Companys investment in Gruma S.A.B. de C.V. primarily related to foreign currency derivative losses.  Financial operating profit decreased $ 65 million for the quarter and $ 231 million for the nine months due principally to losses on managed fund investments, increased captive insurance loss provisions and decreased interest income of the Companys brokerage services business.

Archer Daniels Midland Company (NYSE: ADM) today announced net earnings of $ 1.7 billion for the year ended June 30, 2009, compared to year-prior net earnings of $ 1.8 billion. Fiscal year 2009 net sales and other operating income was $ 69 billion, just under the $ 70 billion reported the prior year.
 
Net earnings for the fourth quarter decreased 83 % to $ 64 million. Net sales and other operating income for the quarter decreased 24 % to $ 16.5 billion.
 
In the fourth quarter, we felt the impact of the global economic downturn, as we concluded a year of good performance overall. In this downturn, we used our strong balance sheet and cash flow to make strategic investments to build long-term value, said Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer Patricia Woertz. As we look ahead, we see signs of improving demand in the various food, feed and fuel markets we serve. We remain financially strong and well positioned to capture value as global markets recover.

2009 Strategic Investment Activities
In Fiscal 2009, the Company advanced its strategy to expand the size and global reach of its core model:
 
 
Discussion of Operations
 
Net sales and other operating income decreased 24 % to $ 16.5 billion for the quarter and decreased 1 % to $ 69.2 billion for the year. For the quarter, decreased average selling prices reduced net sales and other operating income by approximately $ 5.8 billion and were partially offset by higher sales volumes. Average selling prices decreased in line with year-over-year declines in underlying commodity costs and foreign exchange translation impacts. For the year, a decrease in net sales and other operating income of approximately 3 % resulted from lower sales volumes and was partially offset by an increase related to higher average selling prices of approximately 2 %.
A summary of segment operating profit and net earnings is as follows:
 
 
 
 
Archer Daniels Midland Company

Discussion of Operations (Continued)
Segment operating profit decreased $ 569 million for the quarter and $ 988 million for the year. Corporate results increased $ 92 million for the quarter and $ 898 million for the year. Income taxes decreased $ 169 million for the quarter and increased $ 5 million for the year. Income taxes include charges resulting from a holding company restructuring related to a portion of the Companys equity investment in Wilmar International Limited of $ 61 million and $ 158 million for the quarter and year, respectively. In addition, income taxes for the quarter and year were positively impacted by geographic mix of earnings, currency translation impacts in South America, and return to provision adjustments.
 
Oilseeds Processing Operating Profit
Oilseeds Processing operating profit decreased $ 148 million for the quarter and increased $ 240 million for the year. Crushing and origination results declined $ 135 million for the quarter on lower North American crush volumes and cash margins, and decreased soy crush and grain origination volumes and margins in Europe. Crushing and origination results increased $ 40 million for the year as global crushing margins improved. Year-over-year fertilizer sales volumes and margins decreased and North American crush volumes declined due to lower demand.
Refining, packaging, biodiesel and other operating profit decreased $ 13 million for the quarter. Decreased European biodiesel margins and restructuring charges related to the Stratas JV negatively impacted results. Refining, packaging, biodiesel and other results increased $ 84 million for the year due to increased biodiesel sales volumes in South America, increased average margins for value-added products and asset abandonment charges of $ 27 million included in the prior year.
Oilseeds results in Asia were unchanged for the quarter and increased $ 116 million for the year as the Companys investments, principally the equity interest in Wilmar International Limited, continued to perform well.

Corn Processing Operating Profit
Corn Processing operating profit decreased $ 273 million for the quarter and $ 776 million for the year. Sweeteners and starches operating profit increased $ 10 million for the quarter on higher average sweetener selling prices and lower manufacturing costs partially offset by higher net corn costs and reduced sales volumes.

Bioproducts operating profit decreased $ 283 million for the quarter and decreased $ 719 million for the year. Ethanol and lysine margins declined significantly due to higher net corn costs and lower average selling prices for the quarter and year, while manufacturing costs decreased for the quarter.
Agricultural Services Operating Profit
Agricultural Services operating profit decreased $ 123 million for the quarter and $ 23 million from last years record level. Merchandising margins were weaker as demand for commodities slowed with the downturn in the global economy. Results were also negatively impacted by less favorable risk management results. For the year, merchandising and handling operating profit decreased $ 41 million, primarily due to the decline in fourth-quarter results.
Transportation results increased $ 18 million for the year mainly due to higher barge freight rates.

Other Operating Profit
Other operating profit decreased $ 25 million for the quarter and $ 429 million for the year. Other processing operating profit increased $ 8 million for the quarter. Improved global wheat milling margins and a gain related to the disposal of the Companys malting business were partially offset by a decline in cocoa processing sales volumes and Gruma S.A.B. de C.V. equity losses. Other processing operating profit decreased $ 166 million for the year primarily due to equity losses from the Companys investment in Gruma, partially offset by improved cocoa processing and wheat processing margins.
Financial operating profit decreased $ 33 million for the quarter and $ 263 million for the year due to losses on managed fund investments, increased captive insurance loss provisions and decreased interest income of the Companys brokerage services business.
 
Corporate Results
 
Corporate results increased $ 92 million for the quarter and $ 898 million for the year. LIFO charges were $ 54 million for the quarter and LIFO credits were $ 517 million for the year ended June 30, 2009.

Unless otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-laws, the written notice of any meeting shall be given not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting. If mailed, such notice shall be deemed given when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at his or her address as it appears on the records of the Corporation.
     Section 1.4. Advance Notice Requirements for Stockholder Proposals. The following procedures shall govern all cases in which a stockholder seeks to propose business to be addressed at a meeting of stockholders or to nominate persons to stand for election as directors of the Corporation (a "Stockholder Proposal"). No business shall be transacted at a meeting of stockholders except in accordance with the following procedures. Only persons who are
 
nominated in accordance with the following procedures shall be eligible for election as directors of the Corporation. Notwithstanding any language in these by-laws to the contrary, this section shall not apply to any right of holders of preferred shares of the Corporation to nominate and elect a specified number of directors in certain circumstances to the extent such procedures are set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation.
     (a) Annual Meetings of Stockholders.
          (1) A Stockholder Proposal may be brought before an annual meeting of stockholders only (i) pursuant to the Corporation's notice of meeting delivered pursuant to Section 1.3 hereof (or any supplement thereto), (ii) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors (or any duly authorized committee thereof) or the Chairman of the Board or (iii) by any stockholder of the Corporation who was a stockholder of record of the Corporation at the time the notice provided for in this Section 1.4 is delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in subparagraphs (2) and (3) of this paragraph (a) in this Section 1.4.
          (2) For a Stockholder Proposal to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder pursuant to clause (iii) of paragraph (a)(1) of this Section 1.4, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation and the subject of the Stockholder Proposal must otherwise be a proper matter for stockholder action as determined by the Board of Directors. The stockholder's notice shall contain, at a minimum, the information set forth in Section 1.4(c). To be timely, a stockholder's notice shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not less than sixty (60) nor more than ninety (90) days prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of stockholders; provided, however, that in the event that the annual meeting is called for a date that is not within thirty (30) days before or after such anniversary date, the stockholder's notice in order to be timely must be so received not later than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which such notice of the date of the annual meeting was mailed or public disclosure of the date of the annual meeting was made, whichever first occurs. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting of stockholders commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described above.
          (3) Notwithstanding anything in paragraph (a)(2) of this Section 1.4 to the contrary, in the event that the Stockholder Proposal relates to the nomination of candidates for director and the number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors of the Corporation at an annual meeting is increased and there is no public announcement by the Corporation naming all of the nominees for director or specifying the size of the increased Board of Directors at least one hundred days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, a stockholder's notice required by this Section 1.4 shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new positions created by such increase, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the Corporation.
 
     (b) Special Meetings of Stockholders. Only such business shall be conducted at a special meeting of stockholders as shall have been described in the Corporation's notice of meeting given pursuant to Section 1.3 hereof. To the extent such business includes the election of directors, a Stockholder Proposal nominating persons to stand for election as directors may be made at a special meeting of stockholders only (i) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors (or any duly authorized committee thereof) or the Chairman of the Board, or (ii) by any stockholder of the Corporation who is a stockholder of record at the time the notice provided for in this Section 1.4(b) is delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation, who is entitled to vote at the special meeting and who gives timely notice in writing by the Secretary of the Corporation. The stockholder's notice shall contain, at a minimum, the information set forth in Section 1.4(c). To be timely, a stockholder's notice shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of a special meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described above.
     (c) Contents of Stockholder's Notice. Any stockholder's notice required by this Section 1.4 shall set forth the following information: As to the stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the Stockholder Proposal is made, the stockholder's notice shall set forth (i) the name and address of such stockholder and of such beneficial owner, as they appear on the Corporation's books, (ii) (A) the class and number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation which are owned beneficially and of record by such stockholder or such beneficial owner, (B) any option, warrant, convertible security, stock appreciation right, or similar right with an exercise or conversion privilege or a settlement payment or mechanism at a price related to any class of shares of the Corporation or with a value derived in whole or in part from the value of any class of shares of the Corporation, whether or not such instrument or right shall be subject to settlement in the underlying class of capital stock of the Corporation or otherwise (a "Derivative Instrument") directly or indirectly owned beneficially by such stockholder or such beneficial owner and any other direct or indirect opportunity to profit or share in any profit derived from any increase or decrease in the value of shares of the Corporation, (C) any proxy, contract, arrangement, understanding, or relationship pursuant to which such stockholder or such beneficial owner has a right to vote any shares of any security of the Company, (D) any short interest of such stockholder or such beneficial owner in any security of the Corporation (for purposes of this provision, a person shall be deemed to have a short interest in a security if such person directly or indirectly, through any contract, arrangement, understanding, relationship or otherwise, has the opportunity to profit or share in any profit derived from any decrease in the value of the subject security), (E) any rights to dividends on the shares of the Corporation owned beneficially by such stockholder or such beneficial owner that are separated or separable from the underlying shares of the Corporation, (F) any proportionate interest in shares of the Corporation or Derivative Instruments held, directly or indirectly, by a general or limited partnership in which such stockholder or such beneficial owner is a general partner or, directly or indirectly, beneficially owns an interest in a general partner and (G) any performance-related fees (other than an asset-based fee) that such stockholder or such beneficial owner is entitled to based on any increase or decrease in the value
 
of shares of the Corporation or Derivative Instruments, if any, as of the date of such notice, including without limitation any such interests held by members of such stockholder's or such beneficial owner's immediate family sharing the same household (which information shall be supplemented by such stockholder and beneficial owner, if any, not later than 10 days after the record date for the meeting to disclose such ownership as of the record date), and (iii) a representation that such stockholder intends to appear in person or by proxy at the stockholder meeting.
     For any Stockholder Proposal that seeks to nominate persons to stand for election as directors of the Corporation, the stockholder's notice also shall include (i) a description of all arrangements or understandings between such stockholder and each proposed nominee and any other person or persons (including their names) pursuant to which the nomination(s) are to be made, (ii) a representation whether the stockholders or the beneficial owners, if any, intend or are part of a group which intends to (1) deliver a proxy statement and/or form of proxy to holders of at least the percentage of the Corporation's outstanding capital stock required to elect the nominee and/or (2) otherwise solicit proxies from stockholders in support of such nomination and (iii) any other information relating to such stockholder that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings required to be made in connection with solicitations of proxies for election of directors pursuant to Section 14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. For any Stockholder Proposal that seeks to nominate persons to stand for election as directors of the Corporation, the stockholder's notice also shall include, as to each person whom the stockholders propose to nominate for election or reelection as a director, (i) the name, age, business address and residence address of the person, (ii) the principal occupation and employment of the person, (iii) the written consent of each proposed nominee to being named as a nominee and to serve as a director if elected, (iv) a written statement from each proposed nominee as to whether such proposed nominee, if elected, intends to tender, promptly following such proposed nominee's election or re-election, an irrevocable resignation effective upon such proposed nominee's failure to receive the required vote for re-election at the next meeting at which such proposed nominee would stand for re-election and upon acceptance of such resignation by the Board of Directors, in accordance with the Corporation's Policy of the Board of Directors on Director Elections, (v) the class or series and number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation which are owned beneficially or of record by the person and (vi) any other information relating to the person that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings required to be made in connection with solicitations of proxies for election of directors pursuant to Section 14 of the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. The Corporation may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as it may reasonably require to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as a director of the Corporation.
     For any Stockholder Proposal that seeks to propose matters to be considered at a stockholder meeting other than the nomination of persons to stand for election as directors of the Corporation, the stockholder's notice shall also set forth for each item of business proposed for consideration (i) a description of the item of business, (ii) the text of the proposal or business (including the text of any resolutions proposed for consideration and in the event that such business includes a proposal to amend the by-laws of the Corporation, the language of the proposed amendment), (iii) the reasons for conducting such business at the stockholder meeting,

     (d) Only Stockholder Proposals made in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 1.4 shall be considered at an annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation. Except as otherwise provided by law, the chair of the meeting shall have the power and duty to (i) determine whether a Stockholder Proposal was made in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 1.4 and (ii) if any Stockholder Proposal is not in compliance with this Section 1.4, including whether the stockholder or beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the Stockholder Proposal is made solicits (or is part of a group which solicits) or fails to so solicit (as the case may be) proxies in support of the Stockholder Proposal in compliance with such stockholder's representation as required by Section (c) of this Section 1.4, to declare that such Stockholder Proposal shall be disregarded.
     (e) For purposes of this Section 1.4, "public announcement" shall mean disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press or comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed by the Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.
     (f) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 1.4, a stockholder also shall comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in this Section 1.4. Nothing in this Section 1.4 shall be deemed to affect any rights of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the Corporation's proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act.
     Section 1.5. Postponement and Cancellation of Meeting. Any previously scheduled annual or special meeting of the stockholders may be postponed and any previously scheduled annual or special meeting of the stockholders called by the Chairman of the Board, the President, a majority of the Board of Directors, or a majority of the Executive Committee may be canceled by resolution of the Board of Directors upon public notice given prior to the time previously scheduled for such meeting of stockholders.
     Section 1.6. Quorum. Except as otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these by-laws, at each meeting of stockholders the presence in person or by proxy of the holders of a majority in voting power of the outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote at the meeting shall be necessary and sufficient to constitute a quorum. In the absence of a quorum, the chair of the meeting may adjourn the meeting from time to time in the manner provided in Section 1.10 hereof until a quorum shall attend. Shares of the Corporation's own stock belonging to the Corporation or to another corporation, if a majority of the shares entitled to vote in the election of directors of such other corporation is held, directly or indirectly, by the Corporation, shall neither be entitled to vote nor be counted for quorum purposes; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not limit the right of the Corporation or any subsidiary of the
 
Corporation to vote stock, including but not limited to its own stock, held by it in a fiduciary capacity. The chair of the meeting shall have the power and the duty to determine whether a quorum is present at any meeting of stockholders.
     Section 1.7. Officers for Meeting of Stockholders. Meetings of stockholders shall be presided over by the Chairman of the Board, if any, or in his or her absence by the President, or in his or her absence by a Vice President, or in the absence of the foregoing persons by a chair designated by the Board of Directors, or in the absence of such designation by a chair chosen at the meeting by a plurality vote. The Secretary shall act as secretary of the meeting, but in his or her absence the chair of the meeting may appoint any person to act as secretary of the meeting.
     Section 1.8. Conduct of Meetings. Every meeting of stockholders shall be presided over by the chair of the meeting selected pursuant to Section 1.7, hereof. The date and time of the opening and the closing of the polls for each matter upon which the stockholders will vote at a meeting shall be determined by the chair of the meeting and announced at the meeting. The Board of Directors may adopt by resolution such rules and regulations for the conduct of the meeting of stockholders as it shall deem appropriate. Except to the extent inconsistent with such rules and regulations as adopted by the Board of Directors, the chair of the meeting shall have the exclusive right and authority to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and to do all such acts as, in the judgment of the chair, are appropriate for the proper conduct of the meeting. Such rules, regulations or procedures, whether adopted by the Board of Directors or prescribed by the chair of the meeting, may include, without limitation, the following: (i) the establishment of an agenda or order of business for the meeting; (ii) rules and procedures for maintaining order at the meeting and the safety of those present; (iii) limitations on attendance at or participation in the meeting to stockholders of record of the Corporation, their duly authorized and constituted proxies or such other persons as the chair of the meeting shall determine; (iv) restrictions on entry to the meeting after the time fixed for the commencement thereof; and (v) limitations on or the elimination of time allotted to questions or comments by participants. Unless and to the extent determined by the Board of Directors or the chair of the meeting, meetings of stockholders shall not be required to be held in accordance with the rules of parliamentary procedure.
     Section 1.9. Voting; Elections.
     1.9.1. Voting Generally; Proxies. Except as otherwise provided by or pursuant to the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation, each stockholder entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall be entitled to one vote for each share of stock held by such stockholder which has voting power upon the matter in question. Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders or to express consent or dissent to corporate action in writing without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder by proxy, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. A stockholder may revoke any proxy which is not irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting in person or by filing an instrument in writing revoking the proxy or by delivering a proxy in accordance with applicable law bearing a later date to the Secretary of the Corporation. Voting at meetings of stockholders need not be by written ballot. All elections and questions shall, unless otherwise
 
provided by the Certificate of Incorporation, these by-laws, the rules or regulations of any stock exchange applicable to the Corporation, or applicable law or pursuant to any regulation applicable to the Corporation or its securities, be decided by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the shares of stock of the Corporation which are present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote thereon.
     1.9.2. Elections of Directors. Each director shall be elected by the vote of the majority of the votes cast with respect to the director at any meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present, provided that the directors shall be elected by the vote of a plurality of the votes cast for the nominees at any meeting for the election of directors where the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected at the meeting (exclusive of nominees with respect to whom the Secretary of the Corporation has received a notice that such nomination has been withdrawn on or prior to the date next preceding the date that the Corporation first mails notice of the meeting to the stockholders). For purposes of this Section 1.9.2, a majority of the votes cast means that the number of shares voted "for" a director must exceed the number of votes cast "against" that director.
     Section 1.10. Adjournment of Meeting. Any meeting of stockholders, annual or special, may be adjourned solely by the chair of the meeting from time to time to reconvene at the same or some other time, date and place. The stockholders present at a meeting shall not have authority to adjourn the meeting. Notice need not be given of any such adjourned meeting if the time, date and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. If the time, date and place of the adjourned meeting are not announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken, then the Secretary of the Corporation shall give written notice of the time, date and place of the adjourned meeting not less than ten (10) days prior to the date of the adjourned meeting. Notice of the adjourned meeting also shall be given if the meeting is adjourned in a single adjournment to a date more than 30 days or in successive adjournments to a date more than 120 days after the original date fixed for the meeting.
     At an adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present, the stockholders may transact any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting. Once a share is represented for any purpose at a meeting, it shall be present for quorum purposes for the remainder of the meeting and for any adjournment of that meeting unless a new record date is or must be set for the adjourned meeting. A new record date shall be set if the meeting is adjourned in a single or successive adjournments to a date more than 120 days after the original date fixed for the meeting. If after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting consistent with the new record date.
     Section 1.11 Fixing Date for Determination of Stockholders of Record.
     In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action other than stockholder action by written consent, the Board of Directors may fix a record
 
date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which record date: (i) in the case of determination of stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders or adjournment thereof, shall, unless otherwise required by law, not be more than sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) days before the original date of such meeting, and (ii) in the case of any other lawful action other than stockholder action by written consent, shall not be more than sixty days prior to such other action. If no record date is fixed by the Board of Directors: (i) the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held, and (ii) the record date for determining stockholders for any other purpose (other than stockholder action by written consent) shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting and shall fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting if the meeting is adjourned in a single or successive adjournments to a date more than 120 days after the original date fixed for the meeting.
     Section 1.12. Procedures for Stockholder Action by Consent.
     1.12.1. Request for Record Date. The record date for determining stockholders entitled to express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be as fixed by the Board of Directors or as otherwise established under this Section 1.12.1. Any person seeking to have the stockholders authorize or take corporate action by written consent without a meeting shall, by written notice addressed to the Secretary and delivered to the Corporation and signed by a stockholder of record, request that a record date be fixed for such purpose. The written notice shall contain at a minimum a description of the action that such stockholder proposes to take by written consent, including the text of any proposal to be submitted to stockholders. The Board of Directors shall have ten (10) days following the date of receipt of the notice to determine the validity of the request. During the ten (10) day period, the Corporation may require the stockholder of record and/or beneficial owner requesting a record date for proposed stockholder action by consent to furnish such other information as it may reasonably require to determine the validity of the request for a record date. Following the determination of the validity of the request, and no later than ten (10) days after the date on which such request is received by the Corporation, the Board of Directors may fix a record date for such purpose which shall be no more than ten (10) days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors and shall not precede the date such resolution is adopted. If the Board of Directors fails within ten (10) days after the date the Corporation receives such notice to fix a record date for such purpose, the record date shall be the day on which the first written consent is delivered to the Corporation in the manner described in Section 1.12.3 below unless prior action by the Board of Directors is required by law, in which event the record date shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action.
 
     1.12.2. Form of Consent. Every written consent purporting to take or authorize the taking of corporate action and/or related revocations (each such written consent and related revocation is referred to in this Section 1.12 as a "Consent") shall bear the date of signature of each stockholder who signs the Consent, and no Consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless, within 60 days of the earliest dated Consent delivered in the manner required by this Section 1.12, Consents signed by a sufficient number of stockholders to take such action are so delivered to the Corporation.
     1.12.3. Delivery of Consent. A Consent shall be delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware or to the Secretary of the Corporation at the Corporation's principal place of business. Delivery to the Corporation's registered office shall be made by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested.
     In the event of the delivery to the Corporation of a Consent, the Secretary of the Corporation shall provide for the safe-keeping of such Consent and shall promptly conduct such ministerial review of the sufficiency of the Consents and of the validity of the action to be taken by stockholder consent as the Secretary deems necessary or appropriate, including, without limitation, whether the holders of a number of shares having the requisite voting power to authorize or take the action specified in the Consent have given consent; provided, however, that if the corporate action to which the Consent relates is the removal or replacement of one or more members of the Board of Directors, the Secretary of the Corporation shall promptly designate two persons, who shall not be members of the Board of Directors, to serve as Inspectors with respect to such Consent and such Inspectors shall discharge the functions of the Secretary of the Corporation under this Section 1.12.3. If after such investigation the Secretary or the Inspectors (as the case may be) shall determine that the Consent is valid and that the action therein specified has been validly authorized, that fact shall forthwith be certified on the records of the Corporation kept for the purpose of recording the proceedings of meetings of stockholders, and the Consent shall be filed in such records, at which time the Consent shall become effective as stockholder action. In conducting the investigation required by this Section 1.12.3, the Secretary or the Inspectors (as the case may be) may, at the expense of the Corporation, retain special legal counsel and any other necessary or appropriate professional advisors, and such other personnel as they may deem necessary or appropriate to assist them, and shall be fully protected in relying in good faith upon the opinion of such counsel or advisors.
     No action by written consent without a meeting shall be effective until such date as the Secretary or the Inspectors (as the case may be) certify to the Corporation that the Consents delivered to the Corporation in accordance with Section 1.12.3 represent at least the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to take the action.
     Nothing contained in this Section 1.12.3 shall in any way be construed to suggest or imply that the Board of Directors or any stockholder shall not be entitled to contest the validity of any Consent or revocation thereof, whether before or after such certification by the Secretary or the Inspectors, or to take any other action (including, without limitation, the commencement, prosecution, or defense of any litigation with respect thereto, and the seeking of injunctive relief in such litigation).
 
     Section 1.13. Inspectors of Election. The Corporation may, and shall if required by law, in advance of any meeting of stockholders, appoint one or more inspectors of election, who may be employees of the Corporation, to act at the meeting or any adjournment thereof and to make a written report thereof. The Corporation may designate one or more persons as alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act. In the event that no inspector so appointed or designated is able to act at a meeting of stockholders, the person presiding at the meeting shall appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting. Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of his or her duties, shall take and sign an oath to execute faithfully the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her ability. The inspector or inspectors so appointed or designated shall (i) ascertain the number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation outstanding and the voting power of each such share, (ii) determine the shares of capital stock of the Corporation represented at the meeting and the validity of proxies and ballots, (iii) count all votes and ballots, (iv) determine and retain for a reasonable period a record of the disposition of any challenges made to any determination by the inspectors, and (v) certify their determination of the number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation represented at the meeting and such inspectors' count of all votes and ballots. Such certification and report shall specify such other information as may be required by law. In determining the validity and counting of proxies and ballots cast at any meeting of stockholders of the Corporation, the inspectors may consider such information as is permitted by applicable law. No person who is a candidate for an office at an election may serve as an inspector at such election.
     Section 1.14. List of Stockholders Entitled to Vote. The Secretary shall prepare and make, at least ten (10) days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting, either at a place within the city where the meeting is to be held, which place shall be specified in the notice of the meeting, or if not so specified, at the place where the meeting is to be held. The list shall also be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present. Upon the willful neglect or refusal of the directors to produce such a list at any meeting for the election of directors, they shall be ineligible for election to any office at such meeting. Except as otherwise provided by law, the stock ledger shall be the only evidence as to who are the stockholders entitled to examine the stock ledger, the list of stockholders or the books of the Corporation, or to vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of stockholders.
     Section 2.1. Number; Qualifications. The Board of Directors shall consist of one or more members, the number thereof to be determined from time to time by resolution of the Board of Directors. Directors need not be stockholders.
     Section 2.2. Election; Resignation; Vacancies. At each annual meeting, the stockholders shall elect directors each of whom shall hold office until the next annual meeting of
 
stockholders and until his or her successor is duly elected and qualified, subject to such director's earlier death, resignation, disqualification or removal. Any director may resign at any time upon written notice to the Corporation. Such resignation need not be accepted to be effective. Unless otherwise provided by law or the Certificate of Incorporation, any newly created directorship or any vacancy occurring on the Board of Directors for any cause may be filled solely by a majority of the remaining members of the Board of Directors, although such majority is less than a quorum, or by the sole remaining director, and each director so elected shall hold office until the expiration of the term of office of the director so replaced or until the director's successor is elected and qualified. The stockholders shall not have the power to appoint directors to any newly created directorship or vacancy.
     Section 2.3. Regular Meetings. Regular meetings of the Board of Directors may be held at such places within or without the State of Delaware and at such times as the Board of Directors may from time to time determine. It shall not be necessary to give notice of regular meetings of the Board of Directors.
     Section 2.4. Special Meetings. Special meetings of the Board of Directors may be called by the Chairman of the Board, the President, the Executive Committee, or by three (3) or more directors. Notice of a special meeting of the Board of Directors shall be given by the person or persons calling the meeting at least twenty-four hours before the special meeting if such notice is given personally or by telephone or sent by telegram, telecopier or other electronic means. Notice of a special meeting of the Board of Directors shall be given by the person or persons calling the meeting at least three days before the special meeting if given by regular mail. No notice of a special meeting shall be necessary if the time and place of the special meeting was set by resolution at a validly convened meeting of the Board of Directors. The notice of a special meeting need not state the purpose or purposes of the meeting.
     Section 2.5. Telephonic Meetings Permitted. Members of the Board of Directors, or any committee designated by the Board of Directors, may participate in a meeting thereof by means of conference telephone or similar communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and participation in a meeting pursuant to this by-law shall constitute presence in person at such meeting.
     Section 2.6. Quorum; Vote Required for Action. At all meetings of the Board of Directors a majority of the whole Board of Directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. Except in cases in which the certificate of incorporation, these by-laws or applicable law otherwise provides, the vote of a majority of the directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the Board of Directors.
     Section 2.7. Officers for Board Meetings. Meetings of the Board of Directors shall be presided over by the Chairman of the Board, if any, or in his or her absence by the Vice Chairman of the Board, if any, or in his or her absence by the President, or in their absence by a chairman chosen at the meeting. The Secretary shall act as secretary of the meeting, but in his or her absence the chair of the meeting may appoint any person to act as secretary of the meeting.
 
     Section 2.8. Independent Directors And Board Structure. A majority of the Board of Directors shall be comprised of independent directors. The Chief Executive Officer should be a member of the Board of Directors. In order to ensure the greatest number of independent directors on a board of manageable size, other direct management representation should be kept to a minimum and should in no event exceed two other management directors.
     The Board of Directors shall make clear to Senior Management of the Company that board membership is neither necessary to their present positions nor a prerequisite to a higher management position in the Company. Attendance of management staff at Board Meetings should be at the discretion of the Chairman of the Board but should be encouraged by the Board. The Board shall have full and direct access to members of Senior Management and should be encouraged to request reports directly to the Board by any member of Senior Management. Board members should use judgment in dealings with management so that they do not distract management from the business operations of the Company.
     Conflicts of Interest. A director's personal financial or family relationships may occasionally give rise to that director's material personal interest in a particular issue. There will be times when a director's material personal interest in an issue will limit that director's ability to vote on that issue. The Governance Committee of the Board of Directors shall determine whether such a conflict of interest exists on a case-by-case basis, including any related determination as to materiality. The Governance Committee shall take appropriate steps to identify such potential conflicts and to ensure that a majority of the directors voting on an issue are both disinterested and independent with respect to that issue. A determination by the Governance Committee on any issue of independence or conflict of interest shall be final and not subject to review.
     For purposes of this Section, an "independent director" means a director who: (a) is neither a current employee nor a former member of Senior Management of the Company or an Affiliate; (b) is not employed by a provider of professional services to the Company; (c) does not have any business relationship with the Company, either personally or through a company of which the director is an officer or a controlling shareholder, that is material to the Company or to the director; (d) does not have a close family relationship, by blood, marriage or otherwise with any member of Senior Management of the Company or one of the Company's Affiliates; (e) is not an officer of a company of which the Company's chairman or chief executive officer is also a board member; (f) is not personally receiving compensation from the Company in any capacity other than as a director; (g) does not personally receive or is not an employee of a foundation, university, or other institution that receives grants or endowments from the Company, that are material to the Company or to either the recipient and/or the foundation, university, or institution; and (h) meets the independence requirements of the New York Stock Exchange.
     "Senior Management" includes the chief executive, chief operating, chief financial, chief legal and chief accounting officers, president, vice president(s), treasurer, secretary and the controller of the Company.
     "Affiliate" includes any person or entity which, alone or by contractual obligation, owns or has the power to vote more than twenty-five (25) percent of the equity interest in another, unless some other person or entity acting alone or with another by contractual obligation owns or
 
has the power to vote a greater percentage of the equity interest. A subsidiary is considered an affiliate if it is at least eighty (80) percent owned by the Company and accounts for at least twenty-five (25) percent of the Company's consolidated sales or assets.
     Section 2.9. Action by Written Consent of Directors. Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation or these by-laws, any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors, or of any committee thereof, may be taken without a meeting if all members of the Board of Directors or such committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing, and the writing or writings are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the Board of Directors or such committee.

     Section 2.11. Committee Rules. Unless the Board of Directors otherwise provides, each committee designated by the Board of Directors may make, alter and repeal rules for the conduct of its business.

     Section 2.12. Executive Committee. There shall be an Executive Committee to consist of such number of directors of the Board of Directors (the "Executive Committee") to consist of that number of directors as the Board of Directors may from time to time determine.

Discussion of Operations
 
Net sales decreased 29 % to $ 14.9 billion primarily due to decreased average selling prices and, to a lesser extent, foreign exchange translation impacts. Average selling prices decreased in line with year-over-year declines in underlying commodity costs. There were no material changes in overall sales quantities.
A summary of segment operating profit and net earnings is as follows:
Net earnings attributable to ADM decreased $ 549 million, due principally to the $ 402 million decrease in segment operating profit and the reduced impact on Corporate results of the change in LIFO inventory valuations. Income taxes decreased due principally to decreased pretax earnings, partially offset by an increased effective tax rate resulting from changes in the geographic mix of pretax earnings.
Oilseeds Processing Operating Profit
Oilseeds Processing operating profit decreased $ 226 million. Crushing and origination results declined $ 204 million due to lower production volumes resulting from a short global soybean supply.  Crushing margins and fertilizer results decreased from high prior-year levels as demand was weaker.
Refining, packaging, biodiesel and other operating profit decreased $ 36 million, due principally to lower sales volumes in North America and reduced biodiesel margins in Europe and South America.
Oilseeds results in Asia increased $ 14 million as the Companys investments, principally the equity interest in Wilmar International Limited, continued to perform well.

Corn Processing Operating Profit
Corn Processing operating profit increased $ 70 million. Sweeteners and starches operating profit increased $ 129 million due to lower net corn and manufacturing costs and higher year-over-year average sweetener selling prices.
Bioproducts operating profit decreased $ 59 million. Ethanol selling prices decreased due to lower gasoline prices and decreased gasoline demand. Bioproducts results were also negatively impacted by low lysine selling prices and by increased startup costs related to the Companys industrial chemicals and sugar businesses.
Agricultural Services Operating Profit
Agricultural Services operating profit decreased $ 253 million. Merchandising and handling results were lower than the year-ago quarter due to reduced demand resulting from the weaker global economy and less volatile commodity market conditions. Transportation results declined due to lower barge freight rates and reduced northbound barge activity.
Other Operating Profit
Other operating profit increased $ 7 million. Other processing operating profit increased $ 4 million as improved global wheat milling margins and Gruma S.A.B. de C.V. equity earnings were partially offset by a decline in cocoa processing margins and sales volumes.  Results for the quarter ended September 30, 2008, included $12 million of profit related to the Companys malting business which was disposed of on July 31, 2008.
Other financial operating profit increased $ 3 million for the quarter, due to improved captive insurance results partially offset by weaker results of the Companys brokerage services business caused by the low short-term interest rate environment.

Corporate Results
Corporate results decreased $ 367 million. Market prices for LIFO-based inventories were generally lower resulting in a decrease in LIFO inventory reserves of $76 million compared to a $453 million decrease in last years quarter. Investment expense - net increased $ 36 million reflecting a decrease in interest income caused by lower short-term rates and lower working capital requirements of the operating segments. Corporate costs were down $ 25 million as employee-related costs and provisions for doubtful accounts decreased.

EARNINGS OF $ .88 PER SHARE
 
Archer Daniels Midland Company (NYSE: ADM) today announced earnings of $ 567 million and net sales of $ 15.9 billion for the quarter ended December 31, 2009.
 
Im very pleased with the performance of our people and with our results this quarter, said Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer Patricia Woertz.  While our earnings, in total, were comparable to last years strong second quarter, the market conditions and the mix of earnings were markedly different. This, once again, demonstrates the ability of the ADM team to utilize the geographic scope and diversity of our asset base to create value for our stockholders.

Discussion of Operations
 
Net sales decreased 5 % to $ 15.9 billion for the quarter and decreased 18 % to $ 30.8 billion for the six months.  For the quarter, decreased average selling prices were offset by increased sales volumes and the impact of foreign exchange translation.  Year-to-date net sales decreased due principally to lower average selling prices.  Average selling prices decreased in line with year-over-year declines in underlying commodity costs. Year-to-date total sales volumes were comparable.
A summary of segment operating profit and net earnings is as follows:
Net earnings attributable to ADM decreased $ 11 million for the quarter primarily due to a $ 177 million pre-tax decline in Corporate results related to the change in LIFO inventory valuations partially offset by increased segment operating profit. Net earnings attributable to ADM decreased $ 560 million for the six months due to lower segment operating profit and lower Corporate results arising from a $ 554 million pre-tax change in LIFO inventory valuations. Income taxes decreased $ 15 million for the quarter and $ 235 million for the six months due principally to lower pre-tax earnings.

Oilseeds Processing Operating Profit
Oilseeds Processing operating profit increased $ 33 million for the quarter and decreased $ 193 million for the six months. Crushing and origination results increased $ 6 million for the quarter as stronger crush margins in North America and the absence of fertilizer inventory write-downs recognized last year were partially offset by weaker year-over-year European results.  Year-to-date crushing and origination results decreased $ 198 million as margins declined from high prior-year levels due to lower demand for vegetable oil and protein meal.  Global soybean supply shortages resulted in lower production volumes in the early part of this fiscal year.
Refining, packaging, biodiesel and other operating profit decreased $ 10 million for the quarter and $ 46 million for the six months.  Lower European biodiesel margins for the quarter and six months were only partially offset by improved South American refining and biodiesel results.  North American sales volumes and margins decreased for the quarter and six months.
Oilseeds results in Asia increased $ 37 million for the quarter and $ 51 million for the six months as the Companys investments, principally its equity interest in Wilmar International Limited, continued to perform well.
Corn Processing Operating Profit
Corn Processing operating profit increased $ 261 million for the quarter and $ 331 million for the six months. Sweeteners and starches operating profit increased $31 million for the quarter and $ 160 million for the six months due to lower net corn and manufacturing costs partially offset by lower sales volumes.
Bioproducts operating profit increased $ 230 million for the quarter and $ 171 million for the six months due to improved ethanol margins and higher sales volumes resulting from lower net corn costs, decreased manufacturing costs, and favorable gasoline blending economics.  Bioproducts operating profit for the quarter also reflected increased sales volumes and margins for lysine, increased citric acid margins, and increased startup costs related to the Companys new industrial chemicals plants, ethanol dry mills, sugarcane processing plant, and new co-generation facilities.

Agricultural Services Operating Profit
Agricultural Services operating profit decreased $ 312 million for the quarter and $ 565 million for the six months.  Merchandising and handling results decreased $282 million for the quarter and $ 510 million for the six months. Demand for exports of U.S. soybeans was strong during the quarter. Enhanced volume and margin opportunities created by last years volatile commodity markets and tight credit markets did not recur during the quarter and six months ended December 31, 2009.
Transportation results decreased $ 30 million for the quarter and $ 55 million for the six months due to lower barge freight rates and decreased utilization levels resulting from the late, extended North American harvest.
Other Operating Profit
Other operating profit increased $ 173 million for the quarter and $ 180 million for the six months. Other processing operating profit increased $ 108 million for the quarter and $ 112 million for the six months due to increased equity earnings from the Companys investment in Gruma S.A.B de C.V., improved global wheat milling margins, and increased cocoa processing earnings.  Other processing earnings for the quarter and six months ended December 31, 2009 include mark-to-market gains of $ 46 million and $ 69 million, respectively related to certain forward sales commitments accounted for as derivatives.
 
 
Other financial operating profit increased $ 65 million for the quarter and $ 68 million for the six months due to the absence of losses experienced last year by the Companys captive insurance business and improved results of the Companys brokerage services business.

Corporate Results
Corporate results decreased $ 188 million for the quarter and $ 555 million for the six months.  Market prices for LIFO-based inventories were generally higher for the quarter resulting in a $ 54 million increase in LIFO inventory reserves compared to a $ 123 million decrease in last years quarter. LIFO inventory reserves decreased $ 22 million for the six months ended December 31, 2009, compared to a $ 576 million decrease in the same period last year.  Interest expense - net increased $ 29 million for the quarter and $ 66 million for the six months reflecting a reduction in corporate interest income caused by lower short-term interest rates and lower working capital requirements of the operating segments.  Corporate costs for the quarter increased $ 35 million due to higher employee-related costs and commercial services expenses.  Year-to-date corporate costs increased primarily due to higher commercial services expenses. Other principally represents the elimination of after-tax earnings of minority interests.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
     Archer Daniels Midland Company (NYSE: ADM) today announced the commencement of cash tender offers for up to $400 million aggregate principal amount of its outstanding debentures listed below (the "Debentures"). The terms and conditions of the tender offers are described in the Offer to Purchase, dated February 11, 2010, and related Letter of Transmittal. Copies of these documents are available to holders from D.F. King & Co., Inc., the depositary and information agent for the tender offers.
 
 
     The tender offer for each series of Debentures will expire at 12:00 midnight, New York City time, on March 11, 2010, unless extended.
     Holders must tender their Debentures by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on February 22, 2010, unless extended, to be eligible to receive the applicable total consideration (which includes the applicable early tender payment set out above). Holders who tender their Debentures after such date and prior to the expiration date will be eligible to receive the applicable total consideration less the early tender payment.
     The applicable total consideration will be determined as described in the Offer to Purchase based on the present value of future payments on the applicable Debentures discounted to the settlement date at a rate equal to the sum of the yield to maturity for the applicable reference security, calculated by the lead dealer managers based on the bid-side price at 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on March 9, 2010, plus the applicable fixed spread, minus accrued interest up to, but not including, the settlement date.
     In addition, payments for Debentures purchased will include accrued interest up to, but not including, the settlement date.
     The amount of each series of Debentures that will be purchased will be determined in accordance with the Acceptance Priority Level set forth above and may be prorated as described in the Offer to Purchase. All Debentures with the Acceptance Priority Level 1 will be accepted before any Debentures with the Acceptance Priority Level 2 and so forth through succeeding levels. If the aggregate principal amount of Debentures tendered in any series exceeds the remaining amount available for such series, such Debentures will be accepted on a pro rata basis. In that event, Debentures with an Acceptance Priority Level following the prorated series of Debentures will not be accepted for payment.
     Withdrawal rights for all tender offers will expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on February 22, 2010, unless extended or otherwise required by law.
     The settlement date is expected to be one business day following the expiration of the tender offers.
     The consummation of the tender offers is conditioned upon the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase.
     ADM has retained Barclays Capital Inc., BNP Paribas Securities Corp., and HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. as lead dealer managers, Mitsubishi UFJ Securities (USA), Inc. as co-dealer manager, and D.F. King & Co., Inc. as the depositary and information agent for the tender offers.

99.1 Press Release of Archer-Daniels-Midland Company dated March 12, 2010.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1

Exhibit 99.1
Significant items affecting the comparability of the financial data shown above are as follows.
 
 
 
Company Overview
The Company is principally engaged in procuring, transporting, storing, processing, and merchandising agricultural commodities and products.  The Companys operations are classified into three reportable business segments: Oilseeds Processing, Corn Processing and Agricultural Services.  Each of these segments is organized based upon the nature of products and services offered.  The Companys remaining operations are aggregated and classified as Other.
The Oilseeds Processing segment includes activities related to the origination and crushing of oilseeds such as soybeans, cottonseed, sunflower seeds, canola, rapeseed, peanuts, and flaxseed into vegetable oils and protein meals principally for the food and feed industries.  In addition, oilseeds and oilseed products may be processed internally or resold into the marketplace as raw materials for other processing.  Crude vegetable oil is sold "as is" or is further processed by refining, bleaching, and deodorizing into salad oils.  Salad oils can be further processed by hydrogenating and/or interesterifying into margarine, shortening, and other food products. Partially refined oil is sold for use in chemicals, paints, and other industrial products.  Refined oil can be further processed for use in t he production of biodiesel.  Oilseed protein meals are primary ingredients used in the manufacture of commercial livestock and poultry feeds.  Oilseeds Processing includes activities related to the production of natural health and nutrition products and the production of other specialty food and feed ingredients.  This segment also includes activities related to the Companys unconsolidated affiliate in Asia, Wilmar International Limited.
The Corn Processing segment includes activities related to the production of sweeteners, starches, dextrose, and syrups primarily for the food and beverage industry as well as activities related to the production, by fermentation, of bioproducts such as ethanol, amino acids, and other food, feed and industrial products.
The Agricultural Services segment utilizes the Companys extensive grain elevator and transportation network to buy, store, clean, and transport agricultural commodities, such as oilseeds, corn, wheat, milo, oats, rice, and barley, and resells these commodities primarily as food and feed ingredients for the agricultural processing industry.  In addition, the Agricultural Services segment includes activities related to edible bean procurement, rice milling, formula feed, and animal health and nutrition.  Agricultural Services grain sourcing and transportation network also provides reliable and efficient services to the Companys agricultural processing operations. Also included in Agricultural Services are the activities of A.C. Toepfer International, a global merchant of agricultural commodities a nd processed products.
Other includes the Companys remaining processing operations, consisting of activities related to processing agricultural commodities into food ingredient products such as wheat into wheat flour, cocoa into chocolate and cocoa products, barley into malt, and sugarcane into sugar and ethanol. Other also includes financial activities related to banking, captive insurance, private equity fund investments, and futures commission merchant activities.
Operating Performance Indicators
The Companys Oilseeds Processing, Agricultural Services, and wheat processing operations are principally agricultural commodity-based businesses where changes in selling prices move in relationship to changes in prices of the commodity-based agricultural raw materials.  Therefore, changes in agricultural commodity prices have relatively equal impacts on both net sales and other operating income and cost of products sold and minimal impact on the gross profit of underlying transactions. As a result, changes in gross profit of these businesses do not necessarily correspond to the changes in net sales and other operating income amounts.
 
 
 
 
The Companys Corn Processing operations and certain other food and animal feed processing operations also utilize agricultural commodities (or products derived from agricultural commodities) as raw materials.  In these operations, agricultural commodity market price changes can result in significant fluctuations in cost of products sold, and such price changes cannot necessarily be passed directly through to the selling price of the finished products.
The Company conducts its business in many countries.  For the majority of the Companys subsidiaries located outside the United States, the local currency is the functional currency.  Revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at the weighted average exchange rates for the applicable periods.  Fluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, British pound, and Canadian dollar, as compared to the U.S. dollar will result in corresponding fluctuations in the U.S. dollar value of revenues and expenses reported by the Company.  The impact of these currency exchange rate changes, where significant, is discussed below.
The Company measures the performance of its business segments using key operating statistics such as segment operating profit, return on fixed capital investment, return on net assets, and return on equity.  The Companys operating results can vary significantly due to changes in factors such as fluctuations in energy prices, weather conditions, crop plantings,  government programs and policies, changes in global demand resulting from population growth and changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops.  Due to these unpredictable factors, the Company does not provide forward-looking information in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
2009 Compared to 2008
As an agricultural commodity-based business, the Company is subject to a variety of market factors which affect the Companys operating results.  Net corn costs increased significantly in 2009 compared to 2008, negatively impacting ethanol margins, and, to a lesser extent, sweeteners and starches margins as the higher net corn costs were only partially offset by increased selling prices for sweeteners and starches.  Additionally, lower demand for gasoline, decreased gasoline prices and excess ethanol industry capacity negatively impacted ethanol margins.  Demand for agricultural commodities, freight, and other products was weaker during 2009 in line with the downturn in the global economy.  Results were negatively impacted by decreased equity earnings in unconsolidated affiliates including significant non-cash charges related to currency derivative losses incurred by the Companys equity investee, Gruma S.A.B. de C.V., and losses from the Companys managed fund investments.
Earnings before income taxes for 2009 include a credit of $517 million from the effect of changing commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuation reserves, compared to a charge of $569 million in 2008.
Income taxes for 2009 include charges of $158 million resulting from the restructuring of a holding company in which the Company holds a portion of its equity investment in Wilmar International Limited.
 
 
 
Analysis of Statements of Earnings
Net sales and other operating income decreased 1% to $69.2 billion due to foreign exchange translation impacts and decreased sales volumes partially offset by higher average selling prices.  Net sales and other operating income increased $3.0 billion due to higher average selling prices primarily related to higher underlying commodity costs, decreased $2.0 billion due to foreign exchange translation impacts, and decreased $1.6 billion due to lower sales volumes and other.
Net sales and other operating income by segment are as follows:
Oilseeds Processing sales increased 5% to $24.5 billion due principally to increased sales volumes of merchandised oilseeds and biodiesel partially offset by lower sales volumes of vegetable oil and protein meal.  Corn Processing sales increased 8% to $7.7 billion due principally to higher sales volumes of ethanol and higher average selling prices of sweeteners and starches, partially offset by lower average selling prices of ethanol.  Agricultural Services sales decreased 7% to $31.6 billion due principally to lower sales volumes of grain.  Other sales decreased 1% to $5.4 billion primarily due to the sale of the Companys malting business during the first quarter of fiscal year 2009 and lower average selling prices of wheat flour.  Partially offsetting these decreases were higher average selling prices of cocoa products and increased chocolate sales volumes.
Cost of products sold decreased 1% to $65.1 billion, in line with the decrease in net sales and other operating income.  Cost of products sold decreased $856 million due principally to decreased sales volumes, decreased LIFO inventory valuations and approximately $1.9 billion from the impact of foreign currency translation, partially offset by increased agricultural commodity costs.  Manufacturing expenses decreased $215 million primarily due to decreased energy and fuel costs.
 
 
 
Selling, general and administrative expenses of $1.4 billion were comparable to 2008.  Decreased employee-related costs and favorable impacts from foreign currency translation were offset by increases in provisions for doubtful accounts.
Other (income) expense  net decreased $348 million primarily due to decreased results from equity earnings of unconsolidated affiliates of $270 million, and decreased investment income.  Equity earnings in unconsolidated affiliates included $275 million of foreign exchange derivative losses incurred by the Companys equity investee, Gruma S.A.B. de C.V.
Operating profit by segment is as follows:
Oilseeds Processing operating profit increased 23% to $1.3 billion.  Crushing and origination results increased $40 million. Improved global crushing margins were partially offset by lower fertilizer sales volumes and margins and lower North American crushing volumes due to decreased demand for vegetable oil and protein meal.  Refining, packaging, biodiesel and other results increased $84 million due principally to higher biodiesel sales volumes in South America and increased average margins for value-added products.  2008 results for refining, packaging, biodiesel and other included asset abandonment charges of $27 million.  Asia results increased $116 million due principally to the Companys share in improved operating results of Wilmar International Limited.
Corn Processing operating profits decreased 81% to $185 million.  Sweeteners and starches decreased $57 million due to the impact of higher net corn costs partially offset by higher average sweetener and starches selling prices.  Bioproducts operating profit decreased $719 million for the year as ethanol and lysine margins declined significantly due to higher corn costs and lower average selling prices.  Ethanol margins were also impacted by lower demand for gasoline, decreased gasoline prices, and excess ethanol industry capacity.
 
 
 
 
Agricultural Services operating profits decreased 2% to $994 million.  Merchandising and handling profit decreased $41 million.  Merchandising margins moderated as demand for commodities slowed following the downturn in the global economy.  Transportation results increased $18 million due to higher barge freight rates.
 
 
Other operating profits decreased 101% to a loss of $6 million.  Wheat, cocoa, malt, and sugar processing operating profit decreased $166 million for the year primarily due to equity losses from the Companys investment in Gruma, partially offset by improved cocoa and wheat processing margins.  Financial operating profit decreased $263 million due to losses on managed fund investments compared to gains for the year ended June 30, 2008, increased captive insurance loss provisions and decreased interest income and lower marketable security gains of the Companys brokerage service business.
Corporate results increased $894 million to $47 million, primarily due to the effects of changing commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuations which resulted in credits of $517 million for the year ended June 30, 2009, compared to $569 million of LIFO charges for the year ended June 30, 2008.  Unallocated interest expense increased $240 million primarily due to higher long-term debt interest expense and decreased interest income.  Corporate interest income decreased due to lower short-term interest rates and lower working capital requirements of the operating segments.
The Companys effective tax rate during 2009 was 32.5% compared to 31.1% during 2008.  Income taxes increased $4 million.  Lower pre-tax earnings and positive impacts from favorable changes in geographic mix of earnings, currency translation impacts in South America, lower tax rates in certain foreign jurisdictions, and return to provision adjustments, were offset by charges of $158 million resulting from the restructuring of a holding company in which the Company holds a portion of its equity investment in Wilmar International Limited.
2008 Compared to 2007
As an agricultural commodity-based business, the Company is subject to a variety of market factors which affect the Companys operating results.   Strong demand for agricultural commodities and processed products challenged the global supply chain and provided exceptional margin opportunities in 2008.  Strong global demand for protein meal and vegetable oil and strong fertilizer demand in South America positively impacted Oilseeds Processing results.  The market price of corn rose due to increased demand, resulting in higher raw material costs for Corn Processing which were only partially passed on in the form of increased selling prices for sweeteners and starches.  Average ethanol selling prices decreased due to additional supply entering the market.  Large North American c rops combined with global wheat shortages created favorable conditions in agricultural merchandising and handling operations.  Increased commodity costs resulted in larger LIFO inventory valuation reserves.
Earnings before income taxes decreased due principally to gains totaling $1.0 billion before income tax on business disposals recorded in 2007 including $440 million related to the exchange of the Companys interest in certain Asian joint ventures for shares of Wilmar International Limited (the Wilmar gain), a $357 million realized securities gain from sales of the Companys equity securities of Tyson Foods, Inc. and Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc., a gain of $153 million from the sale of the Companys interest in Agricore United, and a $53 million gain from the sale of the Companys Arkady food ingredient business.
Earnings before income taxes for 2008 include a charge of $569 million from the effect of changing commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuations, compared to a charge of $207 million in 2007. Earnings before income taxes for 2008 also include a $32 million charge related to abandonment and write-down of long-lived assets, a $38 million gain on sales of securities, and a $21 million gain on the disposal of long-lived assets.  Earnings before income taxes for 2007 include charges of $46 million related to the repurchase of $400 million of the Companys outstanding debentures and $21 million related to abandonment and write-down of long-lived assets.
 
 
 
Analysis of Statements of Earnings
Net sales and other operating income increased 59% to $69.8 billion.  Increased selling prices of agricultural commodities and oilseed processing products and, to a lesser extent, corn processing products and wheat flour accounted for 85% of the increase and higher sales volumes, principally of agricultural commodities, ethanol, and biodiesel, also contributed to the increase in net sales.  In addition, net sales and other operating income increased $1.83 billion, or 4%, due to currency rate fluctuations.
Net sales and other operating income by segment are as follows:
Oilseeds Processing sales increased 67% to $23.3 billion due principally to increased average selling prices resulting primarily from increases in underlying commodity costs and from continuing strong demand for vegetable oil, biodiesel and protein meal.  Sales volumes of vegetable oil, protein meal and biodiesel also increased.  Corn Processing sales increased 23% to $7.1 billion.  Good demand for sweeteners and starches resulted in higher average selling prices.  Bioproducts sales increased primarily as a result of increased ethanol sales volumes partially offset by lower average ethanol selling prices.  Increased ethanol sales volumes reflect higher gasoline prices, improved gasoline blending economics and additional demand, principally from newly-opened markets in the southeastern U nited States.  Agricultural Services sales increased 66% to $34.0 billion primarily due to increased underlying commodity costs, and to a lesser extent, increased sales volumes.  Sales in the Other segment increased 42% to $5.4 billion primarily due to higher average selling prices of wheat flour and, to a lesser extent, higher sales volumes and higher average selling prices of cocoa products.
Cost of products sold increased 62% to $66.0 billion primarily due to higher agricultural commodity costs, and, to a lesser extent, higher sales volumes.  Manufacturing expenses increased $549 million primarily due to higher energy and transportation fuel costs, increased employee-related costs, higher storage and handling costs, increased production capacity, and the impact of foreign currency translation.  In addition, cost of products sold increased $1.75 billion, or 4%, due to currency rate fluctuations.
 
 
 
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $224 million to $1.4 billion primarily due to higher employee-related costs and higher outside service costs, including $44 million related to an organizational realignment and reorganization of the companys European headquarters, and $37 million due to the impact of currency rate fluctuations.
Other (income) expense  net decreased $931 million primarily due to gains totaling $1.0 billion on business disposals recorded in 2007 including $440 million related to the Wilmar gain, a $357 million realized securities gain from sales of the Companys equity securities of Tyson Foods, Inc. and Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc., a gain of $153 million from the sale of the Companys interest in Agricore United, and a $53 million gain from the sale of the Companys Arkady food ingredient business.  Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased $121 million in 2008, primarily related to improved operating results of the Companys investments in U.S. grain export, Asian oilseeds and peanut processing ventures.  Other (income) expense - net also reflects $38 million in gains on sales of securities in 2008, $21 million in gains on disposals of long-lived assets in 2008, an increase from 2007 to 2008 of $11 million in charges related to abandonment and write-down of long-lived assets, a charge of $46 million related to the repurchase of $400 million of the Companys outstanding debentures in 2007, and $23 million in additional interest expense on the Companys convertible debt that was issued in February 2007.
Operating profit by segment is as follows:
Oilseeds Processing operating profit decreased 9% to $1.0 billion. Excluding the $440 million Wilmar gain reflected in Asia results in 2007, Oilseeds Processing operating profit increased 49%, primarily due to strong global demand for protein meal, vegetable oil, and fertilizer.  Crushing and Origination operating profits increased 76% to $727 million due principally to improved crushing margins in North and South America and improved fertilizer results in South America.  Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel and Other operating profits decreased 10% to $181 million due principally to decreased biodiesel margins in Europe and asset impairment charges of $28 million in 2008, partially offset by improved global refining margins.  2007 operating profit for Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel and Other includes a $14 mill ion gain on a business disposal.  Excluding the Wilmar gain, Asia operating
profits increased 59% to $132 million, principally reflecting the Companys share of improved operating profits of Wilmar International Limited.
 
 
 
 
 
Corn Processing operating profits decreased 13% to $961 million, primarily due to higher net corn costs.  Sweeteners and Starches operating profits increased 9% to $557 million due principally to higher average selling prices partially offset by higher net corn costs and increased manufacturing costs.  Manufacturing cost increases reflect higher energy costs, higher repair and maintenance expenses, and higher costs for chemicals used in the manufacturing process.   Bioproducts operating profits decreased 32% to $404 million primarily due to higher net corn costs, higher manufacturing expenses, and decreased average ethanol selling prices, partially offset by higher sales volumes for ethanol and, to a lesser extent, higher average lysine selling prices and higher lysine sales volumes.
Agricultural Services operating profits increased 89% to $1.0 billion. 2007 operating profits in Merchandising and Handling include a $153 million gain on the sale of the Companys interest in Agricore United.  Excluding this gain, Merchandising and Handling operating profits increased 281% to $873 million.  This increase was primarily due to enhanced merchandising and handling margins caused by volatile global grain and freight markets, favorable risk management results, and to a lesser extent, increased sales volumes. Transportation operating profits decreased 8% to $144 million primarily due to increased fuel costs.
Other operating profits increased 12% to $423 million.  Wheat, Cocoa and Malt operating profits increased 4% to $217 million. 2007 operating profits for Wheat included a gain of $39 million from the sale of the Companys Arkady food ingredient business.  Excluding the Arkady gain, Wheat, Cocoa and Malt operating profits improved 28%, primarily due to improved wheat and malt margins reflecting increased demand, partially offset by decreased cocoa processing margins reflecting higher raw material and operating costs and competitive pressures experienced in the North American chocolate market.  Financial operating profits improved 21% to $206 million primarily due to improvements in the Companys futures commission merchant business.
Corporate expense increased $830 million to $847 million, primarily due to a $362 million increase in the charge  related to the effects of changing commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuations, a $371 million decrease in realized securities gains primarily reflecting the $357 million gain recorded in 2007 from sales of the Companys equity securities of Tyson Foods, Inc. and Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc., an $84 million increase in corporate expenses due principally to reorganization and realignment costs and additional interest expense primarily related to the convertible debt issued in February 2007 partially offset by a charge of $46 million recorded in 2007 related to the repurchase of $400 million of the Companys outstanding debentures.
Income taxes decreased primarily due to lower pretax earnings.  The Companys effective tax rate during 2008 of 31.1% was comparable to the 2007 rate of 31.4%.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
A Company objective is to have sufficient liquidity, balance sheet strength, and financial flexibility to fund the operating and capital requirements of a capital intensive agricultural commodity-based business.
At June 30, 2009, the Company had $1.6 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term marketable securities and a current ratio, defined as current assets divided by current liabilities, of 2.2 to 1.  Included in working capital is $5.5 billion of readily marketable commodity inventories.  Cash generated from operations totaled $5.3 billion for the year compared to $3.2 billion cash used in operating activities last year.  This change was primarily due to a decrease in working capital requirements related to lower agricultural commodity market prices.  Cash used in investing activities of $1.9 billion was comparable to last year.  Cash used in financing activities was $3.2 billion compared to cash generated by financing activities of $5.2 billion last year.  As a result of decreased working capital requirements, payments under line of credit agreements were $2.9 billion in 2009.  In 2008, the Company increased its borrowings under line of credit agreements by $2.6 billion.
In 2008, the Company issued $3.1 billion of long-term debt compared to $101 million in total net long-term borrowings in 2009.  
 
 
 
 
Capital resources remained strong as reflected in the Companys net worth of $13.7 billion.  The Companys ratio of long-term debt to total capital (the sum of the Companys long-term debt and shareholders equity) was 36% at June 30, 2009 and 35% at June 30, 2008.  This ratio is a measure of the Companys long-term liquidity and is an indicator of financial flexibility.  At June 30, 2009, the Company had lines of credit totaling $6.6 billion, of which $6.5 billion was unused.  Of the Companys total lines of credit, $4.2 billion support a commercial paper borrowing facility, against which there were no borrowings at June 30, 2009.  Standard & Poors, Moodys, and Fitch rate the Companys commercial paper as A-1, P-1, and F1, res pectively, and rate the Companys long-term debt as A, A2, and A, respectively.  In addition to the cash flow generated from operations, the Company has access to equity and debt capital from public and private sources in both domestic and international markets.
The Company has outstanding $1.15 billion principal amount of convertible senior notes.  As of June 30, 2009, none of the conditions permitting conversion of the notes had been satisfied.  The Company has purchased call options and warrants intended to reduce the potential shareholder dilution upon future conversion of the notes.  As of June 30, 2009, the market price of the Companys common stock was not greater than the exercise price of the purchased call options or warrants related to the convertible senior notes.
In June 2008, the Company issued $1.75 billion of debentures as a component of Equity Units (see Note 8 in Item 8).  The Equity Units are a combination of debt and forward contracts for the holder to purchase the Companys common stock.  Each purchase contract obligates the holder to purchase from the Company, no later than June 1, 2011, for a price of $50 in cash, a certain number of shares, ranging from 1.0453 shares to 1.2544 shares, of the Companys common stock, based on a formula established in the contract.
Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
In the normal course of business, the Company enters into contracts and commitments which obligate the Company to make payments in the future.  The following table sets forth the Companys significant future obligations by time period.  Purchases include commodity-based contracts entered into in the normal course of business, which are further described in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, energy-related purchase contracts entered into in the normal course of business, and other purchase obligations related to the Companys normal business activities.  The following table does not include unrecognized income tax benefits of $54 million as at June 30, 2009, due to uncertainty of the timing of deductibility.  Where applicable, information included in the Companys consolidated financial statements and notes is cross-referenced in this table.
 
Represents expected future benefit payments up to and including fiscal year 2019.  The projected payments beyond fiscal year 2019 are not currently determinable.

At June 30, 2009, the Company estimates it will spend approximately $1.7 billion over the next five years to complete currently approved capital projects and acquisitions which is not included in the table above.  The Company is a limited partner in various private equity funds which invest primarily in emerging markets.  At June 30, 2009, the Companys carrying value of these limited partnership investments was $83 million.  The Company has potential future capital commitments related to these partnerships of $114 million and expects the majority of these additional capital commitments, if called for, to be funded by cash flows generated by the partnerships.  The Company also has outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds of $398 million at June 30, 2009.
In addition, the Company has entered into agreements, primarily debt guarantee agreements related to equity-method investees, which could obligate the Company to make future payments.  The Companys liability under these agreements arises only if the primary entity fails to perform its contractual obligation.  The Company has collateral for a portion of these contingent obligations.  At June 30, 2009, these contingent obligations totaled approximately $137 million.  Amounts outstanding for the primary entity under these contingent obligations were $82 million at June 30, 2009.
Critical Accounting Policies
The process of preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the carrying values of the Companys assets and liabilities as well as the recognition of revenues and expenses.  These estimates and judgments are based on the Companys historical experience and managements knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances.  Certain of the Companys accounting policies are considered critical, as these policies are important to the depiction of the Companys financial statements and require significant or complex judgment by management.  Management has discussed with the Companys Audit Committee the development, selection, disclosure, and application of these critical accounting policies.  Following are the accounting policies management considers critical to the Companys financial statements.
Inventories and Derivatives
Certain of the Companys merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories, forward fixed-price purchase and sale contracts, and exchange-traded futures and exchange-traded and over-the-counter options contracts are valued at estimated market values.  These merchandisable agricultural commodities are freely traded, have quoted market prices, and may be sold without significant additional processing.  Management estimates market value based on exchange-quoted prices, adjusted for differences in local markets.  Changes in the market values of these inventories and contracts are recognized in the statement of earnings as a component of cost of products sold.  If management used different methods or factors to estimate market value, amounts reported as inventories and cost of products sold coul d differ materially.  Additionally, if market conditions change subsequent to year-end, amounts reported in future periods as inventories and cost of products sold could differ materially.
The Company, from time to time, uses derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges to fix the purchase price of anticipated volumes of commodities to be purchased and processed in a future month, to fix the purchase price of the Companys anticipated natural gas requirements for certain production facilities, and to fix the sales price of anticipated volumes of ethanol.  The change in the market value of such derivative contracts has historically been, and is expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item.  Gains and losses arising from open and closed hedging transactions are deferred in other comprehensive income, net of applicable income taxes, and recognized as a component of cost of products sold and net sales and other operating income in th e statement of earnings when the hedged item is recognized.  If it is determined that the derivative instruments used are no longer effective at offsetting changes in the price of the hedged item, then the changes in the market value of these exchange-traded futures and exchange-traded and over-the-counter option contracts would be recorded in the statement of earnings as a component of cost of products sold.
 
 
 
Employee Benefit Plans
The Company provides substantially all domestic employees and employees at certain international subsidiaries with pension benefits.    In order to measure the expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans, management makes several estimates and assumptions, including interest rates used to discount certain liabilities, rates of return on assets set aside to fund these plans, rates of compensation increases, employee turnover rates, anticipated mortality rates, and anticipated future health care costs.  These estimates and assumptions are based on the Companys historical experience combined with managements knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances.  Management also uses third-party actuaries to assist in measuring the expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans.  If management used different estimates and assumptions regarding these plans, the funded status of the plans could vary significantly, and the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods.
Eligible domestic employees with five or more years of service prior to January 1, 2009 participate in a defined benefit pension plan.  Eligible domestic employees hired on or after January 1, 2009 (and eligible salaried employees with less than five years of service prior to January 1, 2009) participate in a cash balance pension formula.
The Company provides eligible domestic employees who retire under qualifying conditions with access to postretirement health care, at full cost to the retiree (certain employees are grandfather ed into subsidized coverage).  
Income Taxes
The Company frequently faces challenges from domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due.  These challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions.  In evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions, the Company records reserves for estimates of potential additional tax owed by the Company.  Deferred tax assets represent items to be used as tax deductions or credits in future tax returns, and the related tax benefit has already been recognized in the Companys income statement.  Realization of certain deferred tax assets reflects the Companys tax planning strategies.  Valuation allowances related to these deferred tax assets have been establ ished to the extent the realization of the tax benefit is not probable.  Based on managements evaluation of the Companys tax position, it is believed the amounts related to these tax exposures are appropriately accrued.  To the extent the Company were to favorably resolve matters for which accruals have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of the aforementioned reserves, the Companys effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be impacted.
Undistributed earnings of  the Companys foreign subsidiaries and affiliated corporate joint ventures accounted for on the equity method are considered to be permanently reinvested, and accordingly, no provision for U.S. income taxes has been provided thereon.  If the Company were to receive distributions from any of these foreign subsidiaries or affiliates or determine the undistributed earnings of these foreign subsidiaries or affiliates to not be permanently reinvested, the Company could be subject to U.S. tax liabilities which have not been provided for in the consolidated financial statements.
 
 
 
Asset Abandonments and Write-Downs
The Company is principally engaged in the business of procuring, transporting, storing, processing, and merchandising agricultural commodities and products.  This business is global in nature and is highly capital-intensive.  Both the availability of the Companys raw materials and the demand for the Companys finished products are driven by factors such as weather, plantings, government programs and policies, changes in global demand resulting from population growth and changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops.  These aforementioned factors may cause a shift in the supply/demand dynamics for the Companys raw materials and finished products.  Any such shift will cause management to evaluate the efficiency and cash flows of the Compa nys assets in terms of geographic location, size, and age of its factories.  The Company, from time to time, will also invest in equipment, technology, and companies related to new, value-added products produced from agricultural commodities and products.  These new products are not always successful from either a commercial production or marketing perspective.  Management evaluates the Companys property, plant, and equipment for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist.  The Company evaluates goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually.  Assets are written down after consideration of the ability to utilize the assets for their intended purpose or to employ the assets in alternative uses or sell the assets to recover the carrying value.  If management used different estimates and assumptions in its evaluation of these assets, then the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods.
Valuation of Marketable Securities and Investments in Affiliates
The Company classifies the majority of its marketable securities as available-for-sale and carries these securities at fair value.  The Company applies the equity method for investments in investees over which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence.  These investments in affiliates are carried at cost plus equity in undistributed earnings and are adjusted, where appropriate, for amortizable basis differences between the investment balance and the underlying net assets of the investee.  For publicly traded securities, the fair value of the Companys investments is readily available based on quoted market prices.  For non-publicly traded securities, managements assessment of fair value is based on valuation methodologies including discounted cash flows and estima tes of sales proceeds.  In the event of a decline in fair value of an investment below carrying value, management is required to determine if the decline in fair value is other than temporary.  In evaluating the nature of a decline in the fair value of an investment, management considers the market conditions, trends of earnings, discounted cash flows, trading volumes, and other key measures of the investment as well as the Companys ability and intent to hold the investment.  When such a decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary, an impairment loss is recognized in the current period operating results to the extent of the decline. See Notes 5 and 6 to the Companys consolidated financial statements for information regarding the Companys marketable securities and investments in affiliates. If management used different estimates and assumptions in its evaluation of these marketable securities, then the Company could recognize different amounts of ex pense over future periods.
The market risk inherent in the Companys market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in: commodity market prices as they relate to the Companys net commodity position, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates as described below.
Commodities
The availability and price of agricultural commodities are subject to wide fluctuations due to factors such as weather, plantings, government programs and policies, changes in global demand resulting from population growth and changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops.
 
 
 
To reduce price risk caused by market fluctuations, the Company generally follows a policy of using exchange-traded futures and exchange-traded and over-the-counter options contracts to minimize its net position of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories and forward cash purchase and sales contracts.  The Company will also use exchange-traded futures and exchange-traded and over-the-counter options contracts as components of merchandising strategies designed to enhance margins.  The results of these strategies can be significantly impacted by factors such as the volatility of the relationship between the value of exchange-traded commodities futures contracts and the cash prices of the underlying commodities, counterparty contracts defaults, and volatility of freight markets. In addition, the Company from t ime-to-time enters into derivative contracts which are designated as hedges of specific volumes of commodities that will be purchased and processed, or sold, in a future month. The changes in the market value of such futures contracts have historically been, and are expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item. Gains and losses arising from open and closed hedging transactions are deferred in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes, and recognized as a component of cost of products sold or net sales and other operating income in the statement of earnings when the hedged item is recognized.
A sensitivity analysis has been prepared to estimate the Companys exposure to market risk of its daily net commodity position. The Companys daily net commodity position consists of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories, related purchase and sale contracts, and exchange-traded futures and exchange-traded and over-the-counter option contracts, including those contracts used to hedge portions of production requirements. The fair value of such daily net commodity position is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing each net position at quoted futures prices. Market risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in such prices.  Actual results may differ.
The change in fair value of the average position for 2009 compared to 2008 was principally a result of decreases in quantities underlying the daily net commodity position.
Currencies
The Company conducts its business in many countries.  For the majority of the Companys subsidiaries located outside the United States, the local currency is the functional currency.  In order to reduce the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, except for amounts permanently invested as described below, the Company follows a policy of entering into currency exchange contracts to mitigate its foreign currency risk related to transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currencies applicable to each of its various entities, primarily the Euro, British Pound, and Canadian Dollar.  The instruments used are forward contracts, swaps with banks, exchange-traded futures contracts, and over-the-counter options.  The changes in market value of such con tracts have a high correlation to the price changes in the currency of the related transactions. The potential loss in fair value for such net currency position resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates is not material.
 
 
 
The amount the Company considers permanently invested in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates and translated into dollars using the year-end exchange rates is $6.6 billion at June 30, 2009, and $7.0 billion at June 30, 2008.  This decrease is due to the depreciation of foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar partially offset by an increase in retained earnings of the foreign subsidiaries and affiliates.  The potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates is $664 million and $695 million for 2009 and 2008, respectively.  Actual results may differ.
Interest
The fair value of the Companys long-term debt is estimated using quoted market prices, where available, and discounted future cash flows based on the Companys current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements. Such fair value exceeded the long-term debt carrying value. Market risk is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical .5% decrease in interest rates.  Actual results may differ.
The increase in fair value of long-term debt in 2009 resulted principally from decreased interest rates.

Nature of Business
The Company is principally engaged in procuring, transporting, storing, processing, and merchandising agricultural commodities and products.
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements as of June 30, 2009, and for the three years then ended include the accounts of the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries.  All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.  Investments in affiliates are carried at cost plus equity in undistributed earnings since acquisition and are adjusted, where appropriate, for amortizable basis differences between the investment balance and the underlying net assets of the investee.  Certain majority-owned subsidiaries whose fiscal periods differ from the Companys are consolidated using the most recent available financial statements which in each case are within 93 days of the Companys year end and are consistent from period to period.  
The Company evaluates and consolidates, where appropriate, its less than majority-owned investments pursuant to Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 46,
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51
(FIN 46).
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Reclassifications
Certain items in prior years consolidated statements of cash flows have been reclassified to conform to the current years presentation with no impact to total cash provided by (used in) operating, investing, or financing activities.
Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all non-segregated, highly-liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.
Segregated Cash and Investments
The Company segregates certain cash and investment balances in accordance with certain regulatory requirements, commodity exchange requirements, and insurance arrangements.  These segregated balances represent deposits received from customers trading in exchange-traded commodity instruments, securities pledged to commodity exchange clearinghouses, and cash and securities pledged as security under certain insurance arrangements.  Segregated cash and investments primarily consist of cash, United States government securities, and money-market funds.
 
 
 
Receivables
The Company records trade accounts receivable at net realizable value.  This value includes an appropriate allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts, $103 million and $89 million at June 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively, to reflect any loss anticipated on the trade accounts receivable balances.  The Company calculates this allowance based on its history of write-offs, level of past-due accounts, and its relationships with, and the economic status of, its customers.
Credit risk on trade receivables is minimized as a result of the large and diversified nature of the Companys worldwide customer base.  The Company controls its exposure to counter party credit risk through credit analysis and approvals, credit limits, and monitoring procedures.  Collateral is generally not required for the Companys trade receivables.  Trade accounts receivable due from unconsolidated affiliates as of June 30, 2009 and 2008 was $301 million and $199 million, respectively.
Inventories
Inventories of certain merchandisable agricultural commodities, which include inventories acquired under deferred pricing contracts, are stated at market value.  In addition, the Company values certain inventories using the lower of cost, determined by either the first-in, first-out (FIFO) or last-in, first-out (LIFO) methods, or market.
Marketable Securities
The Company classifies its marketable securities as available-for-sale, except for certain designated securities which are classified as trading securities. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of income taxes, reported as a component of other comprehensive income.  Unrealized gains and losses related to trading securities are included in income on a current basis.  The Company uses the specific identification method when securities are sold or reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings.  The Company considers marketable securities maturing in less than one year as short-term.  All other marketable securities are classified as long-term.
Property, Plant, and Equipment
Property, plant, and equipment is recorded at cost.  Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. The Company generally uses the straight-line method in computing depreciation for financial reporting purposes and generally uses accelerated methods for income tax purposes. The annual provisions for depreciation have been computed principally in accordance with the following ranges of asset lives: buildings - 10 to 40 years; machinery and equipment - 3 to 30 years.
Asset Abandonments and Write-Downs
The Company recorded a $13 million, a $32 million, and a $21 million charge in cost of products sold during 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively, principally related to the abandonment and write-down of certain long-lived assets.  The majority of these assets were idle or related to underperforming product lines, and the decision to abandon or write-down was finalized after consideration of the ability to utilize the assets for their intended purpose, employ the assets in alternative uses, or sell the assets to recover the carrying value.  After the write-downs, the carrying value of these assets is immaterial.

Net Sales
The Company follows a policy of recognizing sales revenue at the time of delivery of the product and when all of the following have occurred: a sales agreement is in place, pricing is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured.  Freight costs and handling charges related to sales are recorded as a component of cost of products sold.  Net sales to unconsolidated affiliates during 2009, 2008, and 2007 were $7.3 billion, $8.5 billion, and $3.7 billion, respectively.
Stock Compensation
The Company recognizes expense for its share-based compensation based on the fair value of the awards that are granted.  The Companys share-based compensation plans provide for the granting of restricted stock and restricted stock units (Restricted Stock Awards), and stock options.  The fair value of stock options is estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions.  Measured compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, is recognized ratably over the vesting period of the related share-based compensation award.
Research and Development
Costs associated with research and development are expensed as incurred.  Such costs incurred were $50 million, $49 million, and $45 million for the years ended June 30, 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively.
Per Share Data
Basic earnings per common share are determined by dividing net earnings attributable to controlling interests by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.  In computing diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of common shares outstanding is increased by common stock options outstanding with exercise prices lower than the average market price of common shares.  During 2009, 2008, and 2007, diluted average shares outstanding included incremental shares related to outstanding common stock options of 1 million, 2 million, and 5 million, respectively.
New Accounting Standards
During December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 160, (SFAS 160).  SFAS 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary.  It also amends the consolidation procedures of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, (ARB 51) for consistency with the requirements of SFAS 141(R).  The Company is required to adopt SFAS 160 on July 1, 2009 and will apply it prospectively, except for the presentation and disclosure requirem ents, which will apply retrospectively.  The Company applied the presentation and disclosure provisions of SFAS 160 on a retrospective basis for all periods presented increasing stockholders equity by $26 million and $25 million as of June 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively.  In addition, the Company consolidates certain noncontrolling interests which are associated with mandatorily redeemable instruments outside of the Companys control.  In accordance with guidance contained in SEC Accounting Series Release 268, and EITF D-98, , noncontrolling interests which are associated with mandatorily redeemable instruments outside of the Companys control have not been reclassified as a separate component of shareholders equity.  The income or loss attributable to the mandatorily redeemable interests in consolidated subsidiaries adjusts the redeemable value of the redeemable instruments and is included in Other (income) expense  net.

During May 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion 14-1, (FSP APB 14-1). FSP APB 14-1 addresses the accounting for convertible debt securities that, upon conversion, may be settled by the issuer fully or partially in cash. Previously, most forms of convertible debt securities were treated solely as debt. Under this FSP, issuers of convertible debt securities within its scope must separate these securities into two accounting components; a debt component, representing the issuers contractual obligation to pay principal and interest; and an equity component, representing the holders option to conv ert the debt security into equity of the issuer or, if the issuer so elects, an equivalent amount of cash. The Company is required to adopt FSP APB 14-1 on July 1, 2009, in connection with its outstanding convertible debt.  The Company has adjusted prior period balances to apply the provisions of FSP APB 14-1 on a retrospective basis as though the provisions of FSP APB 14-1 had been in effect since the issuance of the Companys convertible senior notes in February 2007.
Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement)
The following tables illustrate the significant effects of FSP APB 14-1 on the Companys consolidated balance sheets as of June 30, 2009 and 2008 and consolidated statements of earnings for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007:
The decrease in long-term debt represents the unamortized debt discount amortized over the seven year term of the convertible debt using the effective interest rate of 5.42%.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Archer Daniels Midland Company
During April 2009, the FASB issued three FSPs that are intended to provide additional application guidance and enhance disclosures about fair value measurements and impairments of securities. FSP FAS 157-4, (FSP FAS 157-4), clarifies the objective and method of fair value measurement even when there has been a significant decrease in market activity for the asset being measured. FSP FAS 115-2 and FAS 124-2, (FSP FAS 115-2 and FAS 124-2), establishes a new model for measuring other-than-temporary impairments for debt securities, including establishing criteria for when to recognize a write-down on debt securities through earnings versus other comprehensive income. FSP FAS 107-1 and APB 28-1, (FSP  FAS 107-1 and APB 28-1), expands the fair value disclosures required for all financial instruments within the scope of SFAS No. 107, to interim periods in addition to annual periods. The proposal also amends APB Opinion No. 28, to require those disclosures in all interim financial statements.  FSP FAS 107-1 and APB 28-1 requires the Company to expand disclosure in the notes to the Companys interim consolidated financial statements but will not impact financial results. The Company adopted these FSPs as of June 30, 2009.

During May 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 165, (SFAS 165).  SFAS 165 establishes evaluation principles and disclosure requirements for subsequent events.  Upon implementation of SFAS 165, an entity is required to disclose the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated, as well as whether that date is the date the financial statements were issued or the date the financial statements were available to be issued.  The Company has evaluated events occurring between the end of its most recent fiscal year and the date the financial statements were originally issued and subsequently updated this evaluation through March 19, 2010.
Subsequent Events
During December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 141(R), (SFAS 141(R)). SFAS 141(R) replaces SFAS 141, and will change the financial accounting and reporting of business combination transactions.  SFAS 141(R) requires recognizing, with certain exceptions, 100 percent of the fair values of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and noncontrolling interests in acquisitions of less than a 100 percent controlling interest when the acquisition constitutes a change in control of the acquired entity; measuring acquirer shares issued and contingent consideration arrangements in connection with a bu siness combination at fair value on the acquisition date with subsequent changes in fair value reflected in earnings; and expensing as incurred acquisition-related transaction costs. In April 2009, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) FAS 141(R)-1 which amends SFAS 141(R) by establishing a model to account for certain pre-acquisition contingencies. Under the FSP, an acquirer is required to recognize at fair value an asset acquired or a liability assumed in a business combination that arises from a contingency if the acquisition-date fair value of that asset or liability can be determined during the measurement period. If the acquisition-date fair value cannot be determined, then the acquirer should follow the recognition criteria in SFAS No. 5,  and FASB Interpretation No. 14,  The Company is required to adopt SFAS 141(R) and FSP FAS 141(R)-1 on July 1, 2009, and will apply them prospectively to business combinations completed on or after that date. The impact of the adoption of SFAS 141(R) and FSP FAS 141(R)-1 will depend on the nature of acquisitions completed after the date of adoption.

During June 2008, the FASB issued FSP Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 03-6-1.  FSP EITF 03-6-1 addresses whether instruments granted in share-based payment transactions are participating securities prior to vesting and, therefore, need to be included in the earnings allocation in computing earnings per share (EPS) under the two-class method. The FSP clarifies that all outstanding unvested share-based payment awards that contain rights to nonforfeitable dividends participate in undistributed earnings with common shareholders and are considered to be participating securities. As such, the issuing entity is required to apply the two-class method of computing basic and diluted EPS. The Company is required to adopt FSP EITF 03-6-1 on July 1, 2009.  The adoption of FSP EITF 03-6-1 will not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.
, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP EITF 03-6-1)
During December 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS 132(R)-1, (FSP FAS 132(R)-1).  FSP FAS 132(R)-1 expands the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 132(R), (SFAS 132(R)).  FSP FAS 132(R)-1 requires entities to disclose investment policies and strategies, major categories of plan assets, fair value measurements for each major category of plan assets segregated by fair value hierarchy level as defined in SFAS No. 157, (SFAS 157), the effe ct of fair value measurements using Level 3 inputs on changes in plan assets for the period, and significant concentrations of risk within plan assets.  The Company will be required to adopt FSP FAS 132(R)-1 on June 30, 2010.  The adoption of this standard will require expanded disclosure in the notes to the Companys consolidated financial statements but will not impact financial results.

During June 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 167, (SFAS 167). SFAS 167 changes how a reporting entity determines when an entity that is insufficiently capitalized or is not controlled through voting (or similar rights) should be consolidated. The determination of whether a reporting entity is required to consolidate another entity is based on, among other things, the other entitys purpose and design and the reporting entitys ability to direct the activities of the other entity that most significantly impact the other entitys economic performance. SFAS 167 will require a number of new disclosures including disclosures about the reporting entitys involvement with variable interest entities and any significant changes in risk exposure due to that involvement. A reporting entity will be required to disclose how its involvement with a variable interest entity affects the reporting entitys financial statements. The Company will be required to adopt SFAS 167 on July 1, 2010, and has not yet assessed the impact of the adoption of this standard on the Companys financial statements.
Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. FIN 46(R)
The Companys 2009, 2008, and 2007 acquisitions were accounted for as purchases in accordance with SFAS No. 141,   Accordingly, the tangible assets and liabilities have been adjusted to fair values with the remainder of the purchase price, if any, recorded as goodwill.  The identifiable intangible assets acquired as part of these acquisitions are not material.
Business Combinations.
2009 Acquisitions
During 2009, the Company acquired ten businesses for a total cost of $198 million and recorded a preliminary allocation of the purchase price related to these acquisitions.  The purchase price allocations resulted in goodwill of $31 million.  The purchase price of $198 million was allocated to current assets, property, plant and equipment, other long-term assets, and liabilities for $176 million, $82 million, $111 million, and $171 million, respectively.
 
 
 
2008 Acquisitions
During 2008, the Company acquired six businesses for a total cost of $15 million, paid for with $2 million in Company stock and $13 million in cash.  The final purchase price allocations resulted in goodwill of $5 million.  The purchase price of $15 million was allocated to current assets, property, plant and equipment, other long-term assets, and liabilities for $14 million, $10 million, $5 million, and $14 million, respectively.
2007 Acquisitions
During 2007, the Company acquired seven businesses for a total cost of $103 million.  One of the acquisitions resulted in obtaining the remaining outstanding shares of an unconsolidated affiliate where the Company held a 50% interest.
The Company recorded goodwill of $5 million related to these acquisitions.  The cash purchase price of $103 million plus the $100 million carrying value of the previously unconsolidated affiliate was allocated to current assets, property, plant, and equipment, current liabilities, and debt for $82 million, $206 million, $33 million, and $52 million, respectively.
Effective July 1, 2008, the Company adopted SFAS 157, which establishes a framework for measuring fair value and clarifies the definition of fair value within that framework.  SFAS 157 defines fair value as an exit price, which is the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the Companys principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.  The fair value hierarchy established in SFAS 157 generally requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Observable inputs reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability and are developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity.  Unobservable inputs reflect the entitys own assumptions based on market data and the entitys judgments about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, and are to be developed based on the best information available in the circumstances.  In October 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS 157-3, , which clarifies that when an active market does not exist it may be appropriate to use unobservable inputs to determine fair value.  The Company determines the fair market value of certain of its inventories of agricultural commodities, derivative contracts, and marketable securities based on the fair value definition and hierarchy levels established in SFAS 157.  SFAS 157 establishes three levels within its hierarchy that may be used to measure fair v alue:
Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset in a Market That Is Not Active
Level 1:  Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  Level 1 assets and liabilities include exchange-traded derivative contracts, U.S. treasury securities and certain publicly traded equity securities.
 
 
 
Level 2:  Observable inputs, including Level 1 prices that have been adjusted; quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are less active than traded exchanges; and other inputs that are observable or can be substantially corroborated by observable market data.
Level 3:  Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are a significant component of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.  In evaluating the significance of fair value inputs, the Company generally classifies assets or liabilities as Level 3 when their fair value is determined using unobservable inputs that individually, or when aggregated with other unobservable inputs, represent more than 10% of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.  Judgment is required in evaluating both quantitative and qualitative factors in the determination of significance for purposes of fair value level classification.  Level 3 amounts can include assets and liabilities whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techni ques, as well as assets and liabilities for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation.
The following table sets forth, by level, the Companys assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as of June 30, 2009.  Pursuant to FSP FAS 157-2, , the Company has delayed the adoption of SFAS 157 for its nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized on a nonrecurring basis, including goodwill, other intangible assets, and asset retirement obligations to July 1, 2009.  In many cases, a valuation technique used to measure fair value includes inputs from multiple levels of the fair value hierarchy. The lowest level of input that is a significant component of the fair value measurement determines the placement of the entire fair value measurement in the hierarchy. 0; The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment, and may affect the classification of assets and liabilities within the fair value hierarchy levels.
Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157
 
 
 
The Company uses the market approach valuation technique to measure the majority of its assets and liabilities carried at fair value.  Estimated fair market values for inventories carried at market are based on exchange-quoted prices, adjusted for differences in local markets, broker or dealer quotations, or market transactions in either listed or over-the-counter (OTC) markets.  In such cases, the inventory is classified in Level 2.  Certain inventories may require management judgment or estimation for a significant component of the fair value amount.  In such cases, the inventory is classified as Level 3. Changes in the fair market value of inventories are recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings as a component of cost of products sold.
The Companys derivative contracts that are measured at fair value include forward commodity purchase and sale contracts, exchange-traded commodity futures and option contracts, and OTC instruments related primarily to agricultural commodities, energy, and foreign currencies.  Exchange-traded futures and options contracts are valued based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified in Level 1.  The majority of the Companys exchange-traded futures and options contracts are cash settled on a daily basis and, therefore, are not included in this table.  Fair value for forward commodity purchase and sale contracts is estimated based on exchange-quoted prices adjusted for differences in local markets.  These differences are generally determined using inputs from broker or dealer quotations or market transactions in either the listed or OTC markets.  When observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, the derivative contracts are classified in Level 2.  When unobservable inputs have a significant impact on the measurement of fair value, the contracts fair value is classified in Level 3. Based on historical experience with the Companys suppliers and customers, the Companys own credit risk, and the Companys knowledge of current market conditions, the Company does not view nonperformance risk to be a significant input to fair value for the majority of its forward commodity purchase and sale contracts.  However, in situations when the Company believes the nonperformance risk to be a significant input, the Company records estimated fair value adjustments, and classifies the contracts in Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Changes in the fair market value of commodity-related d erivatives are recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings as a component of cost of products sold.  Changes in the fair market value of foreign currency-related derivatives are recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings as a component of net sales and other operating income, cost of products sold, and other (income) expensenet. The effective portions of changes in the fair market value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recognized in the consolidated balance sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income until the hedged items are recorded in earnings.
The Companys available-for-sale securities are comprised of U.S. Treasury securities, obligations of U.S. government agencies, corporate and municipal debt securities, and equity investments.  U.S. Treasury securities and certain publicly traded equity investments are valued using quoted market prices and are classified in Level 1.  U.S. government agency obligations, corporate and municipal debt securities and certain equity investments are valued using third-party pricing services and substantially all are classified as Level 2.  Security values that are determined using pricing models are classified in Level 3.  Unrealized changes in the fair market value of available-for-sale marketable securities are recognized in the consolidated balance sheets as a component of accumulated other com prehensive income unless a decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary at which point the decline is recorded in earnings.
The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to a fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the classification of assets and liabilities within the fair value hierarchy.
 
 
 
 
The following table presents a reconciliation of all assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) during the year ended June 30, 2009.
*Includes unrealized losses of $35 million attributable to the change in Level 3 derivative assets still held at June 30, 2009 and unrealized losses of $76 million attributable to the change in Level 3 inventories carried at market still held at June 30, 2009.
The Company values certain inventories using the lower of cost, determined by either the LIFO or FIFO method, or market.  During 2009, reductions in certain LIFO inventory quantities resulted in liquidations of a previously established LIFO cost layer, thereby decreasing the impact of the LIFO valuation reserve adjustment on earnings by $13 million after income tax.
 
 
 
 
SFAS No. 133, (SFAS 133) requires the Company to recognize all of its derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in its consolidated balance sheet at fair value.  The accounting for changes in the fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and further, on the type of hedging relationship.  For those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, a company must designate the hedging instrument, based upon the exposure being hedged, as a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge, or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation.  The Company does not cur rently have any derivatives designated as fair value hedges or derivatives designated as hedges of net investment in foreign operations.  The Company has certain derivatives designated as cash flow hedges; however, the majority of the Companys derivatives have not been designated as hedging instruments.
Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activities
Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments under SFAS 133
To reduce price risk caused by market fluctuations in agricultural commodities and foreign currencies, the Company generally follows a policy of using exchange-traded futures and exchange-traded and over-the-counter (OTC) options contracts to minimize its net position of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories and forward cash purchase and sales contracts and foreign exchange risk.  The Company also uses exchange-traded futures and exchange-traded and OTC options contracts as components of merchandising strategies designed to enhance margins.  The results of these strategies can be significantly impacted by factors such as the volatility of the relationship between the value of exchange-traded commodities futures contracts and the cash prices of the underlying commodities, counterparty contract defaults, a nd volatility of freight markets.  Exchange-traded futures and exchange-traded and OTC options contracts, and forward cash purchase and sales contracts of certain merchandisable agricultural commodities are valued at fair value.  Inventories of certain merchandisable agricultural commodities which include amounts acquired under deferred pricing contracts are stated at market value.  Inventory is not a derivative and therefore is not included in the tables below.  Changes in the market value of inventories of merchandisable agricultural commodities, forward cash purchase and sales contracts, and exchange-traded futures and exchange-traded and OTC options contracts are recognized in earnings immediately, resulting in cost of products sold approximating FIFO cost.  Unrealized gains and unrealized losses on forward cash purchase contracts, forward foreign currency exchange (FX) contracts, forward cash sales contracts, and exchange-traded and OTC options contracts represent the fair value of such instruments and are classified on the Companys consolidated balance sheet as receivables and accrued expenses, respectively.
The following table sets forth the fair value of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments under SFAS 133 as of June 30, 2009.
 
 
 
The following table sets forth the pre-tax gains (losses) on derivatives not designated as hedging instruments under SFAS 133 that have been included in the consolidated statement of earnings for the six months ended June 30, 2009, following adoption of SFAS No. 161, (SFAS 161) on January 1, 2009.

Derivatives Designated as Cash Flow Hedging Strategies
For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges (i.e., hedging the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk), the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of other comprehensive income (OCI) and reclassified into earnings in the same line item affected by the hedged transaction and in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.  The remaining gain or loss on the derivative instrument that is in excess of the cumulative change in the cash flows of the hedged item, if any (i.e., the ineffective portion), hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness, and gains and losses related to discontinued hedges are recognized in the consolidated st atement of earnings during the current period.
For each of the hedging programs described below, the derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges.  The changes in the market value of such derivative contracts have historically been, and are expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item.  Once the hedged item is recognized in earnings, the gains/losses arising from the hedge will be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) to either net sales and other operating income, or cost of products sold.  As of June 30, 2009, the Company has $25 million of after-tax losses in AOCI related to gains and losses from commodity cash flow hedge transactions.  The Company expects to recognize all of these after-tax losses in the statement of earnings during the next 18 months.   During the current period the Company had no amounts recognized in earnings from cash flow hedges that were discontinued.
 
 
 
The Company, from time to time, uses futures or options contracts to fix the purchase price of anticipated volumes of corn to be purchased and processed in a future month.  The objective of this hedging program is to reduce the variability of cash flows associated with the Companys forecasted purchases of corn.  The Companys corn processing plants grind approximately 60 million bushels of corn per month.  Most of the finished goods produced from this corn grind are sold at fixed prices and many of these finished goods are unable to be hedged.  The Company will fix the purchase price of the corn that will be used, thereby economically protecting the margin on these finished goods sales.  During the past 12 months, the Company hedged between 25% and 95% of its monthly antici pated grind.  At June 30, 2009, the Company has hedged portions of its anticipated monthly purchases of corn over the next 18 months, ranging from 1% to 50% of its anticipated monthly grind.
The Company, from time to time, also uses futures, options, and swaps to fix the purchase price of the Companys anticipated natural gas requirements for certain production facilities.  The objective of this hedging program is to reduce the variability of cash flows associated with the Companys forecasted purchases of natural gas.  These production facilities use approximately 3.5 million MMbtus of natural gas per month.    During the past 12 months, the Company hedged between 18% and 65% of the quantity of its anticipated monthly natural gas purchases.  At June 30, 2009, the Company has hedged portions of its anticipated monthly purchases of natural gas over the next 12 months, ranging from 4% to 60% of its anticipated monthly natural gas purchases.
To protect against fluctuations in cash flows due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company from time to time will use forward foreign exchange contracts with banks as foreign currency cash flow hedge programs.  Certain production facilities have manufacturing expenses and some sales contracts denominated in non-functional currency.  To reduce the risk of fluctuations in cash flows due to changes in the exchange rate between functional versus non-functional currency, the Company will hedge some portion of the forecasted foreign currency expenditures and/or receipts.  The fair value of foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedging instruments as of June 30, 2009 was immaterial.
At June 30, 2009, AOCI included $12 million of after-tax gains related to treasury-lock agreements and interest rate swaps.  The instruments were executed in order to lock in the Companys interest rate prior to the issuance or remarketing of debentures.  Both the treasury-lock agreements and interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges of the risk of changes in the future interest payments attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate.  The objective of the hedges is to protect the Company from changes in the benchmark from the date the Company decided to issue the debt to the date when the debt will actually be issued.  The Company will recognize the $12 million of gains in its consolidated statement of earnings over the terms of the hedged items.

Of the $33 million in unrealized losses at June 30, 2009, $7 million arose within the last 12 months.  The market value of the investments that have been in an unrealized loss position for less than 12 months and for 12 months and longer is $215 million and $34 million, respectively.  The market value of United States government obligations, government-sponsored enterprise obligations, and other debt securities with unrealized losses as of June 30, 2009, is $210 million.  The $4 million of unrealized losses associated with United States government obligations, government sponsored enterprise obligations and other debt securities are not considered to be other-than-temporary because the present value of expected cash flows to be collected is equivalent to or exceeds the amortized cost basis of the securitie s.  The market value of available-for-sale equity securities with unrealized losses as of June 30, 2009, is $39 million.  Of the $29 million in unrealized losses associated with available-for-sale equity securities, $25 million is related to the Companys investment in one security.  In June 2009, the Company recognized an $18 million other-than-temporary impairment related to an investment in an available-for-sale equity security, based on the Companys assessment of underlying market conditions.  The Company does not intend to sell any of its impaired debt and equity securities, and, based upon its evaluation, the Company does not believe it is likely that the Company will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost bases.
The Company applies the equity method for investments in investees over which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence.  The Company had 72 and 80 unconsolidated affiliates as of June 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively, located in North and South America, Africa, Europe, and Asia.  The following table summarizes the combined balance sheets as of June 30, 2009 and 2008, and the combined statements of earnings of the Companys unconsolidated affiliates for each of the three years ended June 30, 2009, 2008, and 2007.
Undistributed earnings of the Companys unconsolidated affiliates as of June 30, 2009, are $938 million.  The company is a limited partner in various private equity funds which have a carrying value at June 30, 2009 of $83 million.  The Company has future capital commitments related to these partnerships of $114 million as of      June 30, 2009.  The Company has a direct investment in two foreign affiliates which have a carrying value of $963 million as of June 30, 2009, and a market value of $3.1 billion based on quoted market prices and exchange rates at August 26, 2009.
 
 
 
Archer Daniels Midland Company
The Company provides credit facilities totaling $175 million to three unconsolidated affiliates.  One facility is due on demand and bears interest equal to the monthly average commercial paper rate applicable to the Companys commercial paper borrowing facility.  The second facility matures December 31, 2011 and bears interest at the one month LIBOR rate.  The third facility has no fixed maturity date, is repayable within 90 days of the advance, and bears interest at LIBOR plus one percent.  Outstanding advances under these credit facilities are $50 million as of June 30, 2009, and are included in receivables in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.
During 2007, the Company sold its 28% ownership interest in Agricore United for cash of $321 million and recognized a gain of $153 million.
During June 2007, the Company exchanged its ownership interests in eleven Asian joint venture companies for shares of Wilmar International Limited (WIL), a Singapore publicly listed company.  In exchange for its ownership interests in the joint ventures, the Company received 366 million WIL shares with a fair value of $756 million.  Immediately prior to the exchange, the carrying value of the Companys interests in the joint ventures exchanged for WIL shares was $231 million.  The Company recognized a $286 million after-tax gain in 2007 related to the exchange transaction.  The gain represents the difference between the fair value of the WIL shares received and the carrying value of the Companys interests in the joint ventures exchanged for WIL shares, less the elimination of the por tion of the gain representing the Companys retained direct and indirect ownership interests in WIL.  During 2008, the Company finalized its accounting for this exchange using the purchase method of accounting.  As a result, the Company reduced its investment in WIL and recorded goodwill of $176 million.  The Company accounts for its direct and indirect interests in WIL using the equity method of accounting due to its ability to exercise significant influence over WIL.
The Company accounts for its goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with SFAS No. 142, .  Under this standard, goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests.  The Company recorded a $6 million goodwill impairment charge during 2009 and no goodwill impairment during 2008.  The other changes in goodwill during 2009 are related to acquisitions, investment in a joint venture and foreign currency translation adjustments.  The carrying value of the Companys other intangible assets is not material.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Goodwill balances attributable to consolidated businesses and investments in affiliates, by segment, are set forth in the following table.
 
 
 
 
 
 
In fiscal year 2008, the Company issued $3.10 billion of additional long-term debt, including $500 million of debentures issued in December 2007, $700 million of notes issued in March 2008, and $1.75 billion of debentures issued in June 2008 (the Debentures).
In connection with the issuance of the Debentures in June 2008, the Company issued $1.75 billion of Equity Units.  Equity Units are a combination of debt and forward purchase contract for the holder to purchase the Companys common stock.  The debt and equity instruments are deemed to be separate instruments as the investor may transfer or settle the equity instrument separately from the debt instrument.
The forward purchase contract will obligate the buyer to purchase from the Company, no later than June 1, 2011, for a price of $50 in cash, the following number of shares of the Companys common stock, subject to anti-dilution adjustments:
 
The Debentures bear interest at a rate of 4.70% per year, payable quarterly and are due June 1, 2041. The Debentures will be remarketed in 2011.  If this remarketing is successful, the interest rate on the Debentures will be reset, and thereafter interest will be payable semi-annually at the reset rate.  In addition, following a successful remarketing, the Company may modify certain terms of the Debentures including adjusting the frequency of interest payments, adjusting the ranking of the Debentures or changing the stated maturity.  If there has been no successful remarketing, the interest rate on the Debentures will not be reset, and the holder of each Equity Unit will have the right to put its interest in the Debentures to the Company on June 1, 2011 at a put price equal to 100% of its principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. The proceeds of the put right will be deemed to have been applied against the holders obligations under the forward purchase contracts.
The Company will also pay the Equity Unit holder quarterly contract adjustment payments at a rate of 1.55% per year of the stated amount of $50 per Equity Unit, or $0.775 per year.  The present value of the future contract adjustment payments of $75 million, which is being paid over the three years from the date of issuance, is recorded as a reduction to shareholders equity.  The Company also recorded a $35 million decrease in shareholders equity for issuance costs related to the equity portion of the Equity Units.  The remaining issuance costs have been allocated to the debt and will be recognized in earnings over the life of the debt.
The forward purchase contracts issued in connection with the issuance of the debentures in June 2008, will be settled for the Companys common stock on June 1, 2011.  Until settlement of the forward purchase contract, the shares of stock underlying each forward purchase contract are not outstanding.  The forward purchase contracts will only be included in the computation of diluted earnings per share to the extent they are dilutive.  As of June 30, 2009, the forward purchase contracts were not considered dilutive and therefore not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share.  Basic earnings per share will not be affected until the forward purchase contracts are settled and the holders thereof become stockholders.
 
 
 
In February 2007, the Company issued $1.15 billion principal amount of convertible senior notes due in 2014 (the Notes) in a private placement.  The Notes were issued at par and bear interest at a rate of 0.875% per year, payable semiannually.  The Notes are convertible based on a conversion rate of 22.8423 shares per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (which is equal to a conversion price of approximately $43.78 per share).  The Notes may be converted, subject to adjustment, only under the following circumstances: 1) during any calendar quarter beginning after March 31, 2007, if the closing price of the Companys common stock for at least 20 trading days in the 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding quarter is more than 140% of the applicable conversion price per share, which is $1,000 divided by the then applicable conversion rate, 2) during the five consecutive business day period immediately after any five consecutive trading day period (the note measurement period) in which the average of the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of Notes was equal to or less than 98% of the average of the product of the closing price of the Companys common stock and the conversion rate at each date during the note measurement period, 3) if the Company makes specified distributions to its common stockholders or specified corporate transactions occur, or 4) at any time on or after January 15, 2014, through the business day preceding the maturity date.  Upon conversion, a holder would receive an amount in cash equal to the lesser of 1) $1,000 and 2) the conversion value, as defined.  If the conversion value exceeds $1,000, the Company will deliver, at the Companys election, cash or common stock or a combination of cash and common sto ck for the conversion value in excess of $1,000.  If the Notes are converted in connection with a change in control, as defined, the Company may be required to provide a make-whole premium in the form of an increase in the conversion rate, subject to a stated maximum amount.  In addition, in the event of a change in control, the holders may require the Company to purchase all or a portion of their Notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.
Concurrent with the issuance of the Notes, the Company purchased call options in private transactions at a cost of $299 million.  The purchased call options allow the Company to receive shares of its common stock and/or cash from the counterparties equal to the amounts of common stock and/or cash related to the excess of the current market price of the Companys common stock over the exercise price of the purchased call options.  In addition, the Company sold warrants in private transactions to acquire, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, 26.3 million shares of its common stock at an exercise price of $62.56 per share and received proceeds of $170 million.  If the average price of the Companys common stock during a defined period ending on or about the respective settlement dates e xceeds the exercise price of the warrants, the warrants will be settled, at the Companys option, in cash or shares of common stock.  The purchased call options and warrants are intended to reduce the potential dilution upon future conversions of the Notes by effectively increasing the initial conversion price to $62.56 per share.  The net cost of the purchased call options and warrant transactions of $130 million was recorded as a reduction of shareholders equity.
Upon closing of the sale of the Notes, $370 million of the net proceeds from the Note issuance and the proceeds from the warrant transactions were used to repurchase 10.3 million shares of the Companys common stock under the Companys stock repurchase program.
As of June 30, 2009, none of the conditions permitting conversion of the Notes had been satisfied.  In addition, as of June 30, 2009, the market price of the Companys common stock was not greater than the exercise price of the purchased call options or warrants.  As of June 30, 2009, no share amounts related to the conversion of the Notes or exercise of the warrants are included in diluted average shares outstanding.
As discussed in Note 1, the Notes have been accounted for in accordance with the provisions of FSP APB 14-1 on a retrospective basis.
 
 
 
At June 30, 2009, the fair value of the Companys long-term debt exceeded the carrying value by $511 million, as estimated by using quoted market prices or discounted future cash flows based on the Companys current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements.
The aggregate maturities of long-term debt for the five years after June 30, 2009, are $48 million, $328 million, $151 million, $268 million, and $1,215 million, respectively.
At June 30, 2009, the Company had pledged certain property, plant, and equipment with a carrying value of $340 million as security for certain long-term debt obligations.
At June 30, 2009, the Company had lines of credit totaling $6.6 billion, of which $6.5 billion was unused.  The weighted average interest rates on short-term borrowings outstanding at June 30, 2009 and 2008, were 2.86% and 2.83%, respectively.  Of the Companys total lines of credit, $4.2 billion support a commercial paper borrowing facility, against which there were no borrowings at June 30, 2009.
The Company has outstanding standby letters of credit and surety bonds at June 30, 2009 and 2008, totaling $398 million and $500 million, respectively.
 
In February 2010, the Company announced cash tender offers to repurchase a portion of its outstanding debentures with varying terms and maturities.  In March 2010, the Company repurchased the aggregate principal amount of $500 million of its outstanding debentures in accordance with the announced tender offers.
 
The Company has authorized one billion shares of common stock and 500,000 shares of preferred stock, each without par value.  No preferred stock has been issued.  At June 30, 2009 and 2008, the Company had approximately 30.0 million and 27.8 million shares, respectively, in treasury.  Treasury stock of $765 million at June 30, 2009, and $719 million at June 30, 2008, is recorded at cost as a reduction of common stock.
The Companys employee stock compensation plans provide for the granting of options to employees to purchase common stock of the Company pursuant to the Companys 1999 Incentive Compensation Plan and 2002 Incentive Compensation Plan.  These options are issued at market value on the date of grant, vest incrementally over five to nine years, and expire ten years after the date of grant.
The Companys 1999 and 2002 Incentive Compensation Plans provide for the granting of restricted stock and restricted stock units (Restricted Stock Awards) at no cost to certain officers and key employees.  The awards are made in common stock or stock units with equivalent rights and vest at the end of a three-year restriction period.  During 2009, 2008, and 2007, 1.1 million, 1.3 million, and 1.1 million common shares or units, respectively, were granted as Restricted Stock Awards.  At June 30, 2009, there were 1.5 million and 3.5 million shares available for future grants pursuant to the 1999 and 2002 plans, respectively.
Compensation expense for option grants and Restricted Stock Awards granted to employees is generally recognized on a straight-line basis during the service period of the respective grant.  Certain of the Companys option grants and Restricted Stock Awards continue to vest upon the recipients retirement from the Company and compensation expense related to option grants and Restricted Stock Awards granted to retirement eligible employees is recognized in earnings on the date of grant.  Total compensation expense for option grants and Restricted Stock Awards recognized during 2009, 2008, and 2007 was $65 million, $70 million, and $70 million, respectively.
 
 
 
The fair value of each option grant is estimated as of the date of grant using the Black-Scholes single option pricing model.  The volatility assumption used in the Black-Scholes single option pricing model is based on the historical volatility of the Companys stock.  The volatility of the Companys stock was calculated based upon the monthly closing price of the Companys stock for the period immediately prior to the date of grant corresponding to the average expected life of the grant.  The average expected life represents the period of time that option grants are expected to be outstanding.  The risk-free rate is based on the rate of U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of option grants.  The assumptions used in the Blac k-Scholes single option pricing model are as follows.
A summary of option activity during 2009 is presented below:
The weighted-average remaining contractual term of options outstanding and exercisable at June 30, 2009, is 7 years and 6 years, respectively.  The aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding and exercisable at June 30, 2009, is $8 million and $10 million, respectively.  The weighted-average grant-date fair values of options granted during 2009, 2008, and 2007, were $7.81, $12.60, and $16.42 respectively.  The total intrinsic values of options exercised during 2009, 2008, and 2007, were $17 million, $34 million, and $41 million, respectively.  Cash proceeds received from options exercised during 2009, 2008, and 2007, were $11 million, $20 million, and $20 million, respectively.
At June 30, 2009, there was $33 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to option grants.  Amounts to be recognized as compensation expense during the next five fiscal years are $14 million, $10 million, $6 million, $2 million, and $1 million, respectively.
 
 
 
 
The fair value of Restricted Stock Awards is determined based on the market value of the Companys shares on the grant date.  The weighted-average grant-date fair values of awards granted during 2009 and 2008, were $26.03 and $34.45, respectively.
A summary of Restricted Stock Awards activity during 2009 is presented below:
At June 30, 2009 there was $19 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to Restricted Stock Awards.  Amounts to be recognized as compensation expense during the next three fiscal years are $13 million, $5 million, and $1 million, respectively.  The total fair value of Restricted Stock Awards vested during 2009 was $49 million.
 
 
 
The following table sets forth information with respect to accumulated other comprehensive income:
 
 
 
Interest expense is net of interest capitalized of $95 million, $52 million, and $24 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively.  The Company made interest payments of $522 million, $485 million, and $425 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively.  Realized gains on sales of available-for-sale marketable securities totaled $17 million, $39 million, and $394 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively.  Annual realized losses on sales of available-for-sale marketable securities were $1 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007.  Impairment losses on securities totaled $22 million in 2009.
For financial reporting purposes, earnings before income taxes include the following components.
 
 
 
Reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate to the Companys effective tax rate on earnings is as follows:
The Company made income tax payments of $1.0 billion, $859 million and $794 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively.
 
 
 
Archer Daniels Midland Company
The Company has $55 million and $69 million of tax assets for net operating loss carry-forwards related to certain international subsidiaries at June 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively.  As of June 30, 2009, approximately $48 million of these assets have no expiration date, and the remaining $7 million expire at various times through fiscal 2018.  The annual usage of certain of these assets is limited to a percentage of taxable income of the respective international subsidiary for the year. The Company has recorded a valuation allowance of $51 million and $60 million against these tax assets at June 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively, due to the uncertainty of their realization.
The Company also has $38 million of tax assets related to excess foreign tax credits which begin to expire in fiscal 2013 and $12 million of tax assets related to state income tax attributes (incentive credits and net operating loss carryforwards) net of federal benefit which will expire at various times through fiscal 2015. The Company has recorded a valuation allowance of $11 million against the excess foreign tax credits at June 30, 2009, due to the uncertainty of realization.  The Company has recorded a valuation allowance against the state income tax assets of $2 million as of June 30, 2009.  As of June 30, 2008, the Company had a $24 million valuation allowance recorded related to the excess foreign tax credits and a $1 million valuation allowance related to state income tax incentive credits, due to the uncer tainty of realization.
The Company remains subject to examination in the U.S. for the calendar tax years 2007, 2008 and 2009.
Undistributed earnings of the Companys foreign subsidiaries and affiliated corporate joint venture companies accounted for on the equity method amounting to approximately $6 billion at June 30, 2009, are considered to be permanently reinvested, and accordingly, no provision for U.S. income taxes has been provided thereon.  It is not practicable to determine the deferred tax liability for temporary differences related to these undistributed earnings.
During 2009, approximately $158 million of income tax expense was incurred related to the Companys investment in Wilmar International Holdings, Limited (WIHL), a subsidiary of ADM Asia Pacific, Limited (ADMAP), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.  Through WIHL, ADMAP holds an indirect ownership interest in Wilmar International Ltd. (WIL).
Historically, the Company considered the retained earnings of its investment in ADMAP to be permanently reinvested outside the U.S.  Therefore, the Company provided no deferred tax liability associated with the undistributed earnings of this investment prior to the third quarter of 2009.   On February 3, 2009, the shareholders of WIHL approved a plan of voluntary liquidation which was followed by a partial liquidating distribution on April 1, 2009. Pursuant to this distribution, ADMAP received publicly traded shares of WIL that represented approximately 40% of the WIL shares indirectly held by WIHL.  The liquidation caused the difference between the market value of  the WIL shares received and the tax basis of ADMAPs investment in WIHL to be subject to U.S. income tax as a deemed dist ribution from ADMAP to the Company.  Consequently, as of March 31, 2009, the Company concluded that a portion of its investment in ADMAP related to its investment in WIHL was not permanently reinvested.  Accordingly, the Company recorded approximately $97 million of income tax expense and deferred income tax liability in the third quarter of 2009 to reflect the book-tax basis difference of its investment in WIHL as of March 31, 2009.  On April 1, 2009, the income tax gain generated by the partial liquidating distribution of WIHL triggered additional U.S. income tax expense of approximately $61 million which was recorded in the Companys fourth quarter 2009 and established a new tax basis in the U.S. for the Companys WIHL investment.
The finalization of the liquidation process is expected to occur during calendar year 2010 and is contingent on certain regulatory approvals.  While the ultimate impact of the transaction is uncertain, based on the March 19, 2010 market value of WIL shares and certain other assumptions, including the applicable foreign currency exchange rate and the U.S. income tax rate, the finalization of the liquidation could result in additional income tax expense for the Company of approximately $590 million in the period(s) that it occurs.
 
 
 
The Company adopted the provisions of FIN 48 effective July 1, 2007.  FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for income tax positions by prescribing a minimum threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the consolidated financial statements.  This interpretation requires the Company to recognize in the consolidated financial statements tax positions determined more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position.  Upon adoption of FIN 48, no material changes were required to be taken into account in the income statement or balance sheet of the Company.  The total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits at June 30, 2008 and 2009 are as follows:
The additions and reductions in unrecognized tax benefits shown in the table include effects related to net income and shareholders equity, and timing differences for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility.  The 2009 changes in unrecognized tax benefits did not have a material effect on the Companys net income or cash flow.
The Company is subject to income taxation in many jurisdictions around the world.  Resolution of the related tax positions through negotiations with relevant tax authorities or through litigation may take years to complete.  Therefore, it is difficult to predict the timing for resolution of tax positions.  However, the Company does not anticipate that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will increase or decrease significantly in the next twelve months.  Given the long periods of time involved in resolving tax positions, the Company does not expect that the recognition of unrecognized tax benefits will have a material impact on the Companys effective income tax rate in any given period.  If the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits were required to be recognized by t he Company at one time, there would be a positive impact of $33 million on the tax expense for that period.
The Company classifies interest on income tax related balances as interest expense or interest income and classifies tax-related penalties as selling, general and administrative expenses.  At June 30, 2009 and 2008, the Company had accrued interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits of $22 million and $17.5 million, respectively.
 
 
 
The Company leases manufacturing and warehouse facilities, real estate, transportation assets, and other equipment under non-cancelable operating leases the majority of which expire at various dates through the year 2026. Rent expense for 2009, 2008, and 2007 was $217 million, $201 million, and $166 million, respectively. Future minimum rental payments for non-cancelable operating leases with initial or remaining terms in excess of one year are as follows:
The Company provides substantially all domestic employees and employees at certain international subsidiaries with pension benefits.  Eligible domestic employees with five or more years of service prior to January 1, 2009 participate in a defined benefit pension plan.  Eligible domestic employees hired on or after January 1, 2009 (and eligible salaried employees with less than five years of service prior to January 1, 2009) participate in a cash balance pension formula.  The Company provides eligible domestic employees who retire under qualifying conditions with access to postretirement health care, at full cost to the retiree (certain employees are grandfathered into subsidized coverage).
The Company also maintains 401(k) plans covering substantially all domestic employees.  The Company contributes cash to the plans to match qualifying employee contributions, and also provides a non-matching employer contribution of 1% of pay to eligible participants.  Under an employee stock ownership component of the 401(k) plans, employees may choose to invest in ADM stock as part of their own investment elections.  The employer contributions are expensed when paid.  Assets of the Companys 401(k) plans consist primarily of listed common stocks and pooled funds.  The Companys 401(k) plans held 17.3 million shares of Company common stock at June 30, 2009, with a market value of $462 million.  Cash dividends received on shares of Company common stock by these plan s during the year ended June 30, 2009 were $9 million.
 
 
 
The Company historically has used March 31 as its measurement date.  On July 1, 2008, the Company adopted the measurement date provisions of SFAS No. 158, (SFAS 158).SFAS 158 requires companies to measure the funded status of defined benefit postretirement plans as of the end of the fiscal year instead of a date up to three months prior to the end of the fiscal year.  As a result, the Company recorded a decrease in retained earnings of $21 million, net of tax, and an increase to accumulated other comprehensive income of $2 million, net of tax, re presenting the periodic benefit cost for the period from April 1, 2008 through June 30, 2008.
Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans  an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)
 
The Company uses a June 30 measurement date for substantially all defined benefit plans.  The following tables set forth changes in the defined benefit obligation and the fair value of defined benefit plan assets:
 
 
 
 
 
 
Included in accumulated other comprehensive income for pension benefits at June 30, 2009, are the following amounts that have not yet been recognized in net periodic pension cost: unrecognized transition obligation of $4 million, unrecognized prior service costs of $32 million and unrecognized actuarial losses of $753 million.  The prior service cost and actuarial loss included in accumulated other comprehensive income and expected to be recognized in net periodic pension cost during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, is $5 million and $31 million, respectively.
Included in accumulated other comprehensive income for postretirement benefits at June 30, 2009, are the following amounts that have not yet been recognized in net periodic pension cost: unrecognized prior service credit of $7 million and unrecognized actuarial losses of $77 million.  The prior service credit and actuarial loss included in accumulated other comprehensive income and expected to be recognized in net periodic benefit costs during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, is $1 million, and $5 million, respectively.
The following table sets forth the principal assumptions used in developing net periodic pension cost:
The following table sets forth the principal assumptions used in developing the year-end actuarial present value of the projected benefit obligations:
The projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation, and fair value of plan assets for the pension plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were $1.9 billion, $1.7 billion, and $1.3 billion, respectively, as of June 30, 2009, and $1.2 billion, $1.2 billion, and $1.0 billion, respectively, as of June 30, 2008.  The projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation, and fair value of plan assets for the pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were  $1.6 billion, $1.5 billion, and $1.1 billion, respectively, as of June 30, 2009, and $484 million, $474 million, and $282 million, respectively, as of June 30, 2008.  The accumulated benefit obligation for all pension plans as of June 30, 2009 and 2008, was $1.8 billion and $ 1.7 billion, respectively.
For postretirement benefit measurement purposes, an 8.5% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed for 2009.  The rate was assumed to decrease gradually to 5.0% for 2016 and remain at that level thereafter.
Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant impact on the amounts reported for the health care plans.  A 1% change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effect:
 
 
 
Plan Assets
The following table sets forth the actual asset allocation for the Companys global pension plan assets as of the measurement date:
Investment objectives for the Companys plan assets are to:
Asset allocation targets promote optimal expected return and volatility characteristics given the long-term time horizon for fulfilling the obligations of the pension plans.  Selection of the targeted asset allocation for plan assets was based upon a review of the expected return and risk characteristics of each asset class, as well as the correlation of returns among asset classes.  The U.S. pension plans target asset allocation is also based on an asset and liability study that is updated periodically.
Investment guidelines are established with each investment manager.  These guidelines provide the parameters within which the investment managers agree to operate, including criteria that determine eligible and ineligible securities, diversification requirements, and credit quality standards, where applicable.  In some countries, derivatives may be used to gain market exposure in an efficient and timely manner; however, derivatives may not be used to leverage the portfolio beyond the market value of underlying investments.
 
 
 
 
External consultants monitor the investment strategy and asset mix for the Companys plan assets.  To develop the Companys expected long-term rate of return assumption on plan assets, the Company generally uses long-term historical return information for the targeted asset mix identified in asset and liability studies.  Adjustments are made to the expected long-term rate of return assumption when deemed necessary based upon revised expectations of future investment performance of the overall investment markets.  The expected long-term rate of return assumption used in computing 2009 net periodic pension cost for the pension plans was 7.2%.

The Company expects to contribute $38 million to the pension plans and $8 million to the postretirement benefit plan during 2010.
The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, are expected to be paid:
The Company is principally engaged in procuring, transporting, storing, processing, and merchandising agricultural commodities and products.  The Companys operations are classified into three reportable business segments:  Oilseeds Processing, Corn Processing and Agricultural Services.  Each of these segments is organized based upon the nature of products and services offered.  The Companys remaining operations are aggregated and classified as Other.
 
 
 
The Oilseeds Processing segment includes activities related to the crushing and origination of oilseeds such as soybeans, cottonseed, sunflower seeds, canola, rapeseed, peanuts, and flaxseed into vegetable oils and protein meals principally for the food and feed industries.  In addition, oilseeds and oilseed products may be processed internally or resold into the marketplace as raw materials for other processing.  Crude vegetable oil is sold "as is" or is further processed by refining, bleaching, and deodorizing into salad oils.  Salad oils can be further processed by hydrogenating and/or interesterifying into margarine, shortening, and other food products. Partially refined oil is sold for use in paints and other industrial products.  Refined oil can be further processed for use in the productio n of biodiesel.  Oilseed meals are primary ingredients used in the manufacture of commercial livestock and poultry feeds.  Oilseeds Processing includes activities related to the production of natural health and nutrition products and the production of other specialty food and feed ingredients.  This segment also includes activities related to the Companys interests in its unconsolidated affiliate in Asia, Wilmar International Limited.
The Corn Processing segment includes activities related to the production of sweeteners, starches, dextrose, and syrups primarily for the food and beverage industry as well as activities related to the production, by fermentation, of bioproducts such as ethanol, amino acids, and other food, feed and industrial products.
The Agricultural Services segment utilizes the Companys extensive grain elevator and transportation network to buy, store, clean, and transport agricultural commodities, such as oilseeds, corn, wheat, milo, oats, rice, and barley, and resells these commodities primarily as food and feed ingredients for the agricultural processing industry.  In addition, the Agricultural Services segment includes activities related to edible bean procurement, rice milling, formula feed, and animal health and nutrition.  Agricultural Services grain sourcing and transportation network also provides reliable and efficient services to the Companys agricultural processing operations. Also included in Agricultural Services are the activities of A.C. Toepfer International, a global merchant of agricultural commod ities and processed products.
Other includes the Companys remaining processing operations, consisting of activities related to processing agricultural commodities into food ingredient products such as wheat into wheat flour, cocoa into chocolate and cocoa products, barley into malt, and sugarcane into sugar and ethanol.  Other also includes financial activities related to banking, captive insurance, private equity fund investments, and futures commission merchant activities.
Intersegment sales have been recorded at amounts approximating market.  Operating profit for each segment is based on net sales less identifiable operating expenses, including an interest charge related to working capital usage.  Also included in segment operating profit are equity in earnings of affiliates based on the equity method of accounting.  Unallocated corporate expenses, investment income, unallocated interest expense, marketable securities transactions, FIFO to LIFO inventory adjustments and minority interest eliminations have been excluded from segment operations and classified as Corporate.

The Board of Directors and Shareholders
Archer Daniels Midland Company
Decatur, Illinois
We have audited Archer Daniels Midland Companys internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2009, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Archer Daniels Midland Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations o f management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, Archer Daniels Midland Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2009, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Archer Daniels Midland Company as of June 30, 2009 and 2008, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2009, of Archer Daniels Midland Company and our report dated August 26, 2009, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Archer Daniels Midland Company (NYSE: ADM) today reported net earnings of $ 421 million and segment operating profit of $ 696 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2010increases of $ 418 million and $ 442 million, respectively, from the Companys totals for the same period one year earlier.
In the third quarter, the ADM team did a good job managing our large, flexible origination and processing network to meet global demands, said Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer Patricia Woertz. We also completed startup of our Columbus ethanol dry mill and began shipments from our renewable plastics plant in Clinton, and we are commissioning our propylene glycol plant in Decatur.
Financial Highlights
 
(Amounts in millions, except per share data)
 
 
 
 
Archer Daniels Midland Company  Page 2
A summary of segment operating profit and net earnings is as follows:
Discussion of Operations
Net earnings for the third quarter increased $ 418 million due to a $ 442 million pretax increase in segment operating profit, a $ 30 million after-tax favorable impact from changing LIFO inventory valuations, and lower income tax expense, partially offset by debt-buyback costs of $ 47 million, after tax. Segment operating profit for the year-ago quarter included $ 132 million of after-tax currency-derivative losses from the Companys equity investee, Gruma S.A.B. de C.V. Last years third-quarter income tax expense included $ 97 million of deferred tax charges related to the restructuring of ADMs investment in Wilmar International, Ltd.
Net earnings decreased 9 percent to $ 1.5 billion for the nine months ended March 31, 2010, due to a $ 315 million after-tax negative impact from changing LIFO inventory valuations, and debt-buyback charges of $ 47 million, after tax, partially offset by a $ 195 million pretax increase in segment operating profit. The Companys effective income tax rate for the nine months declined to 27.6 percent, compared to 33.4 percent for the comparable period last year, due to changes in the geographic mix of pretax earnings and the absence of last years $ 97 million charge related to the restructuring of ADMs investment in Wilmar International, Ltd.
 
 
 
 
Archer Daniels Midland Company  Page 3
Oilseeds Processing Operating Profit
Profit in ADMs Oilseeds Processing segment increased $ 181 million for the quarter and decreased $ 12 million for the nine months.
Crushing and origination results increased to $ 272 million for the quarter. With last years short South American soybean crop, ADMs North American operations were able to run at higher utilization rates and realize improved margins and volumes.
Refining, packaging, biodiesel and other results increased $ 14 million to $ 66 million for the quarter. Improved demand for biodiesel in Europe and South America helped drive these results.
Oilseeds results in Asia were $ 67 million for the quarter, as results of ADMs equity investee, Wilmar International, Ltd., continued to be strong. Last years third quarter reflected a gain of
$ 18 million related to the sale of an equity investment.
Corn Processing Operating Profit
Corn Processing results increased $ 55 million for the quarter and $ 386 million for the
nine months.
Sweeteners and starches operating profit decreased $ 101 million from the prior year to
$ 45 million. This decrease reflects lower average selling prices that were only partially offset by lower net corn costs. These net corn costs were significantly impacted by mark-to-market losses and hedge accounting ineffectiveness related to corn futures.
Bioproducts profit in the quarter was up significantly from last years loss due to lower net corn costs and improved ethanol margins resulting from good ethanol demand driven by favorable gasoline blending economics. Results also reflected stronger lysine sales volumes and margins.
During the third quarter, ADM shipped the first commercial product from its joint-venture Mirel bioplastics plant and began commissioning its propylene glycol plant. Startup was completed at ADMs Columbus ethanol dry mill, and work on the Cedar Rapids ethanol dry mill is going well, with the plant on-track to start up this summer.
Agricultural Services Operating Profit
Agricultural Services results increased $ 44 million for the quarter and decreased $ 521 million for the nine months.
In the quarter, ADM saw a good global supply of grains and oilseeds and modestly
improving demand.
Merchandising and handling profit improved as global soybean demand was met primarily with U.S. supplies, due to last years short South American crop, giving ADM good asset utilization and margins. Earnings from transportation operations declined on lower barge-freight rates and reduced capacity utilization caused by weak demand.
 
 
 
 
Archer Daniels Midland Company  Page 4
Other Operating Profit
Results from ADMs Other business units increased $ 162 million for the quarter and
$ 342 million for the nine months.
Other processing businesses had higher results. Last years third quarter reflected a loss of
$ 212 million for ADMs share of foreign-currency-derivative losses of equity investee, Gruma S.A.B. de C.V. This quarters other processing earnings reflected improved results from ADMs flour milling operations. Other processing earnings for the quarter include mark-to-market losses of $ 63 million related to certain forward sales commitments accounted for as derivatives, offsetting gains recorded in the preceding two quarters.
 
 
Other financial results in the quarter increased $ 30 million due primarily to the absence of losses experienced last year in managed fund investments and captive insurance operations.
Corporate Results
Corporate results decreased $ 51 million for the quarterincluding $ 75 million in pretax costs related to debt buybackand $ 606 million for the nine months. Declining commodity prices generated a $ 43 million decrease in ADMs LIFO inventory valuation reserves this quarter, compared to a $ 5 million increase a year ago. For the nine months, the change in LIFO inventory valuation reserves resulted in a credit of $ 65 million this year, compared to a $ 571 million credit last year.
New Accounting Standards
Certain amounts in the prior years Consolidated Statement of Earnings, Segment Operating Analysis, Summary of Financial Condition, and Summary of Cash Flows have been restated and presentation formats have been modified to apply the requirements of new accounting standards ASC Topic 810, Consolidation and ASC Topic 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options. Effective July 1, 2009, the Company adopted this amended guidance which requires retrospective application to all periods presented.

A summary of segment operating profit and net earnings is as follows:
Discussion of Operations
Net earnings for the fourth quarter increased $ 388 million due to a $ 591 million pretax increase in segment operating profit, partially offset by higher corporate expense and a $ 111 million increase in income tax expense. Income tax expense increased due primarily to higher pretax earnings. Last years fourth quarter income tax expense included favorable currency-translation impacts, partially offset by charges related to the restructuring of ADMs investment in Wilmar International, Ltd.
 
 
For the full fiscal year, net earnings increased $ 246 million due to a $ 786 million pretax increase in segment operating profit, partially offset by higher corporate expense which included a $ 296 million after-tax negative impact from changing LIFO inventory valuations. The Companys effective income tax rate for the year declined to 25.8 percent, compared to 32.5 percent for the year prior, mostly due to the absence of last years $ 158 million charge related to the restructuring of ADMs investment in Wilmar International, Ltd.
 
 
 
Archer Daniels Midland Company  Page 3
 
Oilseeds Processing Operating Profit
Profit in ADMs Oilseeds Processing segment increased $ 132 million for the quarter and $ 120 million for the 12 months.
Crushing and origination results increased $ 77 million to $ 218 million for the quarter. Year-over-year crushing volumes increased in the quarter, with decreased North American volumes more than offset by increases in South America and Europe. Good positioning favorably impacted North American and European soybean and softseed crushing margins.
Refining, packaging, biodiesel and other results increased $ 58 million to $ 79 million for the quarter. Recently expanded biodiesel production capacity at Rondonopolis, Brazil, allowed ADM to capture good margins and volumes amidst strong demand. Last years quarter also included charges related to the formation of the Stratas Foods packaged-oil joint venture.
Asia results of $ 62 million for the quarter reflect ADMs share of Wilmar International, Ltd. earnings.
Corn Processing Operating Profit
Corn Processing results increased $ 151 million for the quarter and $ 537 million for the
12 months. 
 
Sweeteners and starches operating profit decreased $ 30 million from the prior year to
$ 119 million. This decrease reflects lower average selling prices that were only partially offset by lower net corn costs. Sales volumes increased due to strong export demand.
Bioproducts profit in the quarter was up significantly from last years loss due to better ethanol and lysine margins.
At present, ADM has begun production at its Cedar Rapids, Iowa, ethanol dry mill, which should be fully operational by the end of August. And, in Decatur, Ill., the Company is working through startup issues at its propylene glycol plant, which should be fully operational by end of the calendar year.
Agricultural Services Operating Profit
Agricultural Services results increased $ 195 million for the quarter and decreased $ 326 million for the 12 months.
In the quarter, ADM saw a good global supply of grains and oilseeds and modestly
improving demand, especially from Asia.
Merchandising and handling profit improved significantly due principally to more favorable risk management results. Earnings from transportation operations declined on lower barge-freight rates and higher fuel costs.
 
 
 
Archer Daniels Midland Company  Page 4
 
Other Operating Profit
Results from ADMs Other business units increased $ 113 million for the quarter and
$ 455 million for the 12 months.
Other processing businesses were up $ 108 million for the quarter, reflecting improved results of ADMs cocoa and flour milling operations and from equity investee Gruma S.A.B. de C.V. Other processing earnings for the quarter include mark-to-market gains of $ 63 million related to certain forward sales commitments accounted for as derivatives.
 
 
Other financial results in the quarter increased $ 5 million due primarily to the absence of losses experienced last year in managed fund investments.
Corporate Results
Corporate results decreased $ 95 million for the quarter and $ 701 million for the 12 months. Rising commodity prices generated a $ 23 million increase in ADMs LIFO inventory valuation reserves this quarter, compared to a $ 54 million increase a year ago. For the year, LIFO inventory valuation reserves decreased $ 42 million, compared to a $ 517 million decrease last year.  The quarter and 12 months include $ 59 million of unrealized loss on interest rate swaps. The 12 months include higher net interest expense of $ 91 million and debt buyback costs of $ 75 million.
New Accounting Standards
Certain amounts in the prior years Consolidated Statement of Earnings, Segment Operating Analysis, Summary of Financial Condition, and Summary of Cash Flows have been restated, and presentation formats have been modified to apply the requirements of new accounting standards ASC Topic 810, Consolidation and ASC Topic 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options.

Archer Daniels Midland Company (NYSE: ADM) today reported net earnings of $ 345 million and segment operating profit of $ 765 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2010, down $ 151 million and $ 9 million, respectively, from the same period one year earlier.
The ADM team performed solidly in both corn and oilseeds with both businesses well positioned to meet demand. Agricultural Services results were impacted by crop supply shifts early in the quarter, said Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer Patricia Woertz. As we look at markets today, global demand is generally strong. This presents ADM with the opportunity to grow shareholder value by doing what we do best: use our assets and our acumen to connect crops from regions where theyre available to markets where theyre needed.

A summary of segment operating profit and net earnings follows:
Discussion of Operations
Net earnings for the first quarter decreased $ 151 million due primarily to a $ 9 million pretax decrease in segment operating profit and a $ 124 million after-tax negative variance from changing LIFO inventory valuations. The companys effective income tax rate for the quarter was 26 percent, compared to 31 percent for the prior first quarter, mostly due to changes in the geographic mix of earnings.

Oilseeds Processing Operating Profit
Oilseeds operating profit increased $ 24 million for the quarter, to a profit of $ 308 million.
Crushing and origination results increased $ 41 million to $ 176 million for the quarter. Crushing volumes increased more than 6 percent over the year-ago quarter, though volumes decreased sequentially. Margins improved overall. North American margins benefitted from good raw-material positioning; South America gained from better origination margins and strong fertilizer results in advance of the planting season; and Europe saw strong softseed margins.
Refining, packaging, biodiesel and other results increased $ 6 million to $ 76 million for the quarter. South American biodiesel continued to improve, driving good margins and volumes in that business.
Oilseeds results in Asia were $ 56 million for the quarter, principally reflecting ADMs share of the results of its equity investee, Wilmar International Limited.
Corn Processing Operating Profit
For the quarter, corn processing results increased $ 153 million to a profit of $ 341 million. Corn processing volumes were up, reflecting the capacity of the companys new dry mills.
Sweeteners and starches operating profit decreased $ 48 million from the prior year to $ 146 million. This decrease reflects lower average selling prices that were only partially offset by lower net corn costs. Sales volumes were up due to strong export shipments and improved domestic demand for industrial starches.
Bioproducts profit in the quarter was up significantly from last years loss on improved ethanol and lysine margins, a favorable corn ownership position and increased ethanol sales volumes. In the quarter, bioproducts recorded $ 32 million in costs related to the start up of new plants.
Agricultural Services Operating Profit
Agricultural Services results were $ 132 million, $ 43 million below the year-ago quarter.
Merchandising and Handling profit decreased over last year, due primarily to negative impacts from supply shifts early in the quarter as a result of drought conditions and government actions in the Black Sea region. These negative impacts were only partially offset by a $ 67 million insurance settlement related to ADMs Destrehan, La., export elevator and by increased volumes driven by the early U.S. harvest. Earnings from transportation operations improved on higher barge-freight rates and volumes which were also driven by the early U.S. harvest.

Other Operating Profit
In the first quarter, ADMs Other business units showed a loss of $ 16 million, compared to the year-ago profit of $ 127 million.
Other processing results decreased $ 81 million, with improved results in wheat milling more than offset by lower results in ADMs cocoa operations and lower results from equity investee, Gruma S.A.B. de C.V. Other processing earnings for the quarter included mark-to-market losses of $ 59 millioncompared to gains of $ 17 million in last years first quarterrelated to certain forward purchase and sales commitments accounted for as derivatives.
Other financial results fell $ 62 million, primarily due to higher captive insurance loss provisions, principally related to ADMs Destrehan, La., settlement. The company is in the process of working with its reinsurers and expects to recover a significant part of these losses over the next 12 months.
Corporate Results
Corporate results decreased $ 246 million for the quarter. Rising commodity prices generated a $ 123 million increase in ADMs LIFO inventory valuation reserves this quarter, compared to a $ 76 million decrease a year ago. Corporate unallocated interest expense increased $ 55 million, including  $ 31 million of unrealized losses on interest rate swaps and the impact of lower capitalized interest on construction projects.

Non-Solicitation.
          . . Nothing in this Agreement or the Award shall confer upon the Grantee any right to continue as an Employee or consultant of the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate, or to interfere in any way with the right of the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate to terminate the Grantee's service at any time.
Section 12
No Rights as Employee or Consultant

Section 15
Construction
 
          . . This Agreement shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Illinois, without giving effect to the choice of law principles thereof.
Section 16
Governing Law
 
          For purposes of this Agreement, a "Change in Control" of the Company shall mean:
          (i) an acquisition subsequent to the Date of Grant by any individual, entity or group (within the meaning of section 13(d)(3) or 14(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")) (a "Person") of beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of thirty percent (30%) or more of either (A) the then outstanding shares of Common Stock or (B) the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors (the "Outstanding Company Voting Securities"); excluding, however, the following: (1) any acquisition directly from the Company, other than an acquisition by virtue of the exercise of a conversion privilege unless the security being so converted was itself acquired directly from the Company, (2) any acquisition by the Company and (3) any acquisition by an employee benefit plan (or related trust) sponsored or maintained by the Company or any Subsidiary;

     On May 27, 2008, Archer-Daniels-Midland Company ("ADM") made available to investors a prospectus supplement and a prospectus with respect to the issuance by ADM of 35,000,000 equity units (the "Equity Units"). Each Equity Unit has a stated amount of $50 and is initially comprised of (i) a purchase contract that will obligate the holder to purchase from ADM no later than June 1, 2011, a certain number of shares of ADM's common stock, for $50 in cash; and (ii) a 1/20, or 5.0%, undivided beneficial interest in a $1,000 aggregate principal amount 4.70% debentures due 2041 (the "Debentures").
     The Debentures were issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of September 20, 2006, between ADM and The Bank of New York Mellon (successor to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.), as Trustee (the "Base Indenture"), as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of June 3, 2008, between ADM and The Bank of New York Mellon (formerly known as The Bank of New York), as Trustee (the "First Supplemental Indenture") (the Base Indenture, as amended and supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, the "Indenture").

Definition of Terms
          (a) a term not defined herein that is defined in the Indenture has the same meaning when used in this Second Supplemental Indenture;
          (b) the definition of any term in this Second Supplemental Indenture that is also defined in the Indenture shall supersede the definition of such term in the Indenture;

          (d) a term defined anywhere in this Second Supplemental Indenture has the same meaning throughout;
          (e) the singular includes the plural and vice versa; and

     Section 2.01 . Section 8.01 of the First Supplemental Indenture is hereby deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following:
Amendment to Section 8.01 of the First Supplemental Indenture
               Section 8.01 .
Remarketing Procedures
          (a) Unless a Special Event Redemption, a Successful Optional Remarketing or a Termination Event has occurred prior to the Applicable Remarketing Period, the Company shall engage the Remarketing Agent(s) pursuant to the Remarketing Agreement for the Remarketing of the Debentures. The Company will, not later than 15 days prior to the first day of the Applicable Remarketing Period, request that the Depositary or its nominee notify the Beneficial Owners or Depositary Participants holding Separate Debentures, Corporate Units and Treasury Units, and shall provide a copy of such request to the Collateral Agent and the Purchase Contract Agent, in the case of an Optional Remarketing, of the Company's intent to attempt an Optional Remarketing in the Applicable Remarketing Period, and in all cases, of the proposed Remarketing Date or Dates, of the Company's option to remarket the Debentures in two or more tranches and the procedures to be followed in each Remarketing, including the procedures to be followed by Holders of Separate Debentures to participate in a Remarketing, the applicable procedures for holders of Corporate Units to create Treasury Units or holders of Treasury Units to recreate Corporate Units, the applicable procedures for holders of Corporate Units to effect an Early Settlement and, in the case of a Final Remarketing, applicable procedures to effect a Cash Settlement and the applicable procedures that must be followed by a Holder of Separate Debentures if such Holder wishes to exercise its Put Right or by a Holder if such Holder elects not to exercise its Put Right.
          (b) Upon a Successful Remarketing, the Debentures shall be substantially identical except that the Debentures may, at the Company's option, consist of two or more tranches with each tranche (i) maturing at a different date, as determined in accordance with clause (y) of Section 6.02 of this First Supplemental Indenture, (ii) having a different Reset Rate, as determined in accordance with Section 8.03 of this First Supplemental Indenture, and (iii) having different authorized denominations. If, in the reasonable judgment of the Remarketing Agent, a Remarketing of the Debentures will likely fail to be made at the Remarketing Price because the Debentures have been divided into two or more tranches, the Remarketing Agent shall be obligated to modify the Remarketing, in consultation with the Company, so that all Debentures have the same terms. For avoidance of doubt, the Remarketing Date shall be the same for each tranche of Debentures and the settlements of each tranche shall be conditioned on each other.
          (c) Each Holder of Separate Debentures may elect to have Separate Debentures held by such Holder remarketed in any Remarketing. A Holder making such an election must, pursuant to the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, notify the Custodial Agent and deliver such Separate Debentures to the Custodial Agent prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the second Business Day immediately preceding the first day of the Applicable Remarketing Period (but no earlier than the Interest Payment Date immediately preceding such first day). Any such notice and delivery may not be conditioned upon the level at which the Reset Rate is established in the Remarketing. Any such notice and delivery may be withdrawn prior to 5:00 p.m., New York
 
City time, on the second Business Day immediately preceding the first day of the Applicable Remarketing Period in accordance with the provisions set forth in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement. Any such notice and delivery not withdrawn by such time will be irrevocable with respect to each Remarketing to occur during the Applicable Remarketing Period. Pursuant to Sections 5.02 and 5.03 of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, by 11:00 a.m., New York City time, in the case of an Optional Remarketing, or promptly after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, in the case of a Final Remarketing, on the Business Day immediately preceding the first day of the Applicable Remarketing Period, the Custodial Agent, based on the notices and deliveries received by it prior to such time, shall notify the Remarketing Agent of the aggregate principal amount of Separate Debentures tendered for Remarketing. If any Holder of Separate Debentures does not elect to have Separate Debentures held by such Holder remarketed in a Remarketing that is to be conducted with two or more tranches, such Remarketing shall be modified so that all Debentures have the same terms unless such Holder consents in writing to the Remarketing being conducted in two or more tranches and to the allocation to such Holder (without any further consent of such Holder) in exchange for its Separate Debenture or Debentures of such tranche or tranches as shall be determined by the Remarketing Agent in consultation with the Company. Subject to the foregoing consent, on the Business Day following the applicable Remarketing Date, the Company shall notify Holders of Separate Debentures who decided not to participate in the Remarketing how the Remarketing Agent, in consultation with the Company, allocated the Debentures of such Holders among the tranches. The Remarketing Agent shall not make any such allocation, except in consultation with the Company. Pursuant and subject to Section 5.02 or 5.03 of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, Debentures that underlie Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures included in Corporate Units will be deemed tendered for Remarketing and will be remarketed in accordance with the terms of the Remarketing Agreement and the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement.
          (d) The right of each Holder of Remarketed Debentures to have such Debentures remarketed and sold on any Remarketing Date shall be subject to the conditions that (i)(A) the Remarketing Agent conducts any Optional Remarketing or (B) in the case of a Final Remarketing, that no Successful Optional Remarketing has occurred pursuant to the terms of the Remarketing Agreement, (ii) neither a Special Event Redemption nor a Termination Event has occurred prior to such Remarketing Date, (iii) the Remarketing Agent(s) are able to find a purchaser or purchasers for Remarketed Debentures at the Remarketing Price based on the Reset Rate and (iv) the purchaser or purchasers of the Remarketed Debentures deliver the purchase price therefor to the Remarketing Agent as and when required.
          (e) Neither the Trustee, the Company nor the Remarketing Agent(s) shall be obligated in any case to provide funds to make payment upon tender of Debentures for remarketing.
     Section 2.02 . Section 8.03(d) of the First Supplemental Indenture is hereby deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following:
Amendment to Section 8.03(d) of the First Supplemental Indenture
          (d) In the event of a Successful Remarketing, the Coupon Rate shall be reset on the Remarketing Settlement Date to the Reset Rate or (as provided in Section 8.01(b) of this First Supplemental Indenture) the Reset Rates as determined by the Remarketing Agent under the Remarketing Agreement, and the Company shall issue a press release promptly after such Successful Remarketing containing such Reset Rate and publish such information on its website.
     Section 2.03 . The following Section 8.06 is hereby added immediately after Section 8.05 of the First Supplemental Indenture:

          (b) Upon a Successful Remarketing, any reference in the Indenture to "series" and "Securities" and "Debentures" shall, unless otherwise required by the context, be deemed to be a reference to each separate tranche of Debentures if applicable such that each separate tranche of Debentures shall constitute a separate series of Securities for all purposes of the Indenture.
     Section 3.01 . The Indenture, as supplemented by this Second Supplemental Indenture, is in all respects ratified and confirmed, and this Second Supplemental Indenture shall be deemed part of the Indenture in the manner and to the extent herein and therein provided.

SIGNATURES
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 
 

Archer Daniels Midland Company (NYSE: ADM) today reported second-quarter net earnings of $ 732 million and record quarterly segment operating profit of $ 1.4 billion for the quarter ended December 31, 2010, up $ 165 million and $ 392 million, respectively, from the same period one year earlier.
 
 
The ADM team delivered outstanding performance across the board, resulting in record operating profit. Amid strong demand and regional dislocations, we used our vast global network to deliver for our customers and shareholders, said Patricia Woertz, ADM chairman and CEO. Looking ahead, global markets remain dynamic. In this environment, we use ADMs exceptional capabilities, our unique global asset base and the insights of our team to drive value and to serve vital needs.
Financial Highlights
 
(Amounts in millions, except per share data)
 
 
 
 
A summary of segment operating profit and net earnings follows:
Discussion of Operations
Net earnings for the second quarter of $ 732 million increased $ 165 million due to a $ 392 million increase in segment operating profit. This increase was partially offset by changes in LIFO inventory valuations, included in corporate, caused by higher agricultural commodity prices. Earnings before income taxes include a LIFO charge of $ 254 million this quarter, or $ 0.25 per share, compared to a LIFO charge of $ 54 million last year, or $ 0.05 per share. The companys effective income tax rate for the quarter was 27 percent, comparable to the prior years second quarter rate of 28 percent.
 
 
 
 
 
Oilseeds Processing
Oilseeds operating profit in the second quarter declined $ 27 million to $ 325 million.
Crushing and origination operating profit increased $ 7 million to $ 200 million for the quarter. Globally, ADMs crushing volumes were essentially flat compared to the year-ago quarter. ADMs acquisition of the controlling interest in Golden Peanut, and the resulting revaluation, generated a pretax gain of $ 71 million. South American results strengthened on improved fertilizer and grain origination income. European results were lower due to mark-to-market timing effects related to substantial increases in commodity prices, effects that were partially offset by improved margins, including the impact of favorable softseed positioning.
Refining, packaging, biodiesel and other generated a profit of $ 78 million for the quarter, similar to prior year results.
Oilseeds results in Asia declined $ 36 million to $ 47 million for the quarter, reflecting ADMs share of the weaker results from its equity investee, Wilmar International Limited.
Corn Processing
For the quarter, corn processing operating profit increased $ 109 million to a profit of $ 399 million, enhanced by favorable corn ownership positions. Corn processing volumes were up 24 percent, reflecting the ramp-up of the companys two new dry mills.
Sweeteners and starches operating profit decreased $ 52 million from the prior year to $ 119 million, due to lower average selling prices and higher net corn costs. Sales volumes were up due to improved export sweetener shipments and stronger U.S. demand for industrial starches.
Bioproducts profit in the quarter rose $ 161 million to $ 280 million, driven by improved ethanol margins and volumes, and by stronger lysine margins.
Agricultural Services
Agricultural Services operating profit increased $ 276 million to $ 426 million for the second quarter.
Merchandising and handling profit increased $ 273 million to $ 376 million on strong results from global merchandising operations and on record ADM export volumes from the United States.
Earnings from transportation operations improved on higher barge-freight rates and volumes.
 
 
 
 
 
Other
In the second quarter, profits from ADMs Other business units increased $ 34 million to $ 212 million.
In Other processing, profits in wheat milling and cocoa operations were similar to last years strong results.
Other financial results increased $ 33 million mainly due to reduced provisions in the companys captive insurance subsidiary.
Corporate Results
Corporate results decreased $ 178 million principally due to a $ 200 million change in LIFO reserves, higher expense for the elimination of minority interests, and higher corporate interest. Partially offsetting these items were $ 55 million of unrealized gains on interest rate swaps.
Current Market Conditions
Global supplies of corn, soybeans, canola and rapeseed remain dynamic. The global supply of wheat is ample, though there are some regional dislocations and quality issues. South American farmers have begun harvesting their crops. In North America, farmers are considering planting decisions.
Globally, demand for crops and processed products remains strong. Global demand for protein meal is being led by good demand from Asia. The one-year extensions of the blenders credits and the U.S. EPAs recent decisions on enhanced ethanol blending are supportive of biofuels. U.S. corn-based ethanol remains the most competitive ethanol in the global market. Mexican demand for corn sweetener continues to be strong.

          ARCHER-DANIELS-MIDLAND COMPANY, a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of Delaware (herein called the "Company," which term includes any successor Person under the Indenture referred to herein), for value received, hereby promises to pay to CEDE & Co., or registered assigns, the principal sum of [ ] ($[ ]) on August 13, 2012 ("Maturity"). Interest on this Security will accrue at a floating rate of three-month LIBOR (determined as provided on the reverse hereof) reset quarterly plus 0.16% from February 11, 2011 until the principal hereof is paid or made available for payment. and will be paid quarterly on February 13, May 13, August 13, and November 13 of each year (each an "Interest Payment Date"), beginning on May 13, 2011. The interest rate for the initial Interest Period (from February 11, 2011, to but excluding the first Interest Payment Date) will be 0.472% per annum. The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in such Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest, which shall be the 15th calendar day (whether or not a Business Day) next preceding such Interest Payment Date; , , that interest payable at Maturity will be payable to the Person to whom principal shall be payable. Except as otherwise provided in the Indenture, any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof shall be given to Holders of Securities of this series not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Securities of this series may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in said Indenture. Payment of the principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on this Security will be made at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, which, subject to the right of the Company to vary or terminate the appointment of such agency, shall initially be the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts; , , that, at the option of the Company, payment of interest may be made by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the Security Register.

          Interest on this Security will accrue from and including February 11, 2011, to but excluding the first Interest Payment Date and then from and including the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for to but excluding the next Interest Payment Date or at Maturity, as the case may be (each such period an "Interest Period"). The amount of accrued interest on this Security that the Company will pay for any Interest Period will be calculated by multiplying the face amount of this Security by an accrued interest factor. This accrued interest factor is computed by adding the interest factor calculated for each day from February 11, 2011, or
 
from the last date interest was paid or duly provided for, to the date for which accrued interest is being calculated. The interest factor for each day is computed by dividing the interest rate applicable to that day by 360.
          In the event that any Interest Payment Date (other than Maturity) and Interest Reset Date would otherwise fall on a day that is not a Business Day, that Interest Payment Date and Interest Reset Date will be postponed to the next day that is a Business Day. If the postponement would cause the day to fall in the next calendar month, the Interest Payment Date and Interest Reset Date will be the immediately preceding Business Day. If an Interest Payment Date that falls on Maturity falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the payment will be made on the next Business Day (whether or not the postponement would cause the day to fall in the next calendar month) as if it were made on the date the payment was due, and no interest will accrue on the amount so payable for the period from and after Maturity to the date the payment is made.
          The interest rate on the Securities of this Series will be reset by the Calculation Agent appointed by the Company, initially The Bank of New York Mellon, on each Interest Payment Date (each an "Interest Reset Date") and will be equal to LIBOR plus 0.16%. The second London business day preceding an Interest Reset Date will be the "Interest Determination Date" for that Interest Reset Date. The interest rate in effect on each day that is not an Interest Reset Date will be the interest rate determined as of the Interest Determination Date pertaining to the immediately preceding Interest Reset Date. The interest rate in effect on any day that is an Interest Reset Date will be the interest rate determined as of the Interest Determination Date pertaining to that Interest Reset Date.
          Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Security set forth on the pages following the certificate of authentication hereon, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.
          Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee referred to below, directly or through an Authenticating Agent, by manual signature of an authorized signatory, this Security shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
 
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this instrument to be duly executed under its corporate seal.
TRUSTEE'S CERTIFICATE OF AUTHENTICATION This is one of the Securities of the series designated herein and referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
THE BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON as Trustee
 
          This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the "Securities"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under an Indenture, dated as of September 20, 2006 (herein called the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon (as successor to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.) (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the Securities of the series designated herein, limited in aggregate principal amount to $1,500,000,000; provided, however, that the Company, without notice to or the consent of the Holders, may issue additional Securities of this series and thereby increase such principal amount in the future, on the same terms and conditions (except for issue date, public offering price and, if applicable, the date from which interest accrues and the first Interest Payment Date) and with the same CUSIP number as the Securities of this series.
          "LIBOR" will be determined by the Calculation Agent in accordance with the following provisions:
          (a)With respect to any Interest Determination Date, LIBOR will be the rate for deposits in United States dollars having a maturity of the Index Maturity (as defined below) commencing on the first day of the applicable Interest Period that appears on Reuters Screen LIBOR01 Page as of 11:00 a.m., London time, on that Interest Determination Date. If no rate appears, LIBOR for that Interest Determination Date will be determined in accordance with the provisions described in paragraph (b) below.
          (b)With respect to an Interest Determination Date on which no rate appears on Reuters Screen LIBOR01 Page, as specified in paragraph (a) above, the Calculation Agent will request the principal London offices of each of four major reference banks in the London interbank market, as selected by the Calculation Agent (after consultation with the Company), to provide the Calculation Agent with its offered quotation for deposits in United States dollars for the Index Maturity, commencing on the first day of the applicable Interest Period, to prime banks in the London interbank market at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on that Interest Determination Date and in a principal amount that is representative for a single transaction in United States dollars in that market at that time. If at least two quotations are provided, then LIBOR on that Interest Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean of those quotations. If fewer than two quotations are provided, then LIBOR on the Interest Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean of the rates quoted at approximately 11:00 a.m., in the City of New York, on the Interest Determination Date by three major banks in the City of New York selected by the Calculation Agent (after consultation with the Company) for loans in United States dollars to leading European banks, having the Index Maturity and in a principal amount that is representative for a single transaction in United States dollars in that market at that time. If, however, the banks so selected by the Calculation Agent are not providing quotations in the manner described by the previous sentence, LIBOR determined as of that Interest Determination Date will be LIBOR in effect on that Interest Determination Date.
          "Reuters Screen LIBOR01 Page" means the display designated as the Reuters Screen LIBOR01 Page, or such other screen as may replace the Reuters Screen LIBOR01 Page on the service or any successor service as may be nominated by the British Bankers' Association for the purpose of displaying London interbank offered rates for United States dollar deposits.
          The "Index Maturity" will be three months.
          A "London business day" is any day on which dealings in United States dollars are transacted in the London interbank market.
          A "Business Day" is any day, other than a Saturday or Sunday, that is neither a legal holiday nor a day on which banking institutions are authorized or required by law or regulation to close in the City of New York.
          All percentages resulting from any calculation of the interest rate on the Securities of this series will be rounded to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage point with five one millionths of a percentage point rounded upwards (e.g., 9.876545% (or .09876545) would be rounded to 9.87655% (or .0987655)), and all dollar amounts used in or resulting from such calculation on the Securities of this series will be rounded to the nearest cent (with one-half cent being rounded upward). Each calculation of the interest rate on the Securities of this series by the Calculation Agent will (in the absence of manifest error) be final and binding on the Holders of the Securities of this series and the Company.
 
          This Security may not be redeemed prior to Maturity.
          This Security shall not be subject to any sinking fund.
          If a change of control triggering event occurs, the Company will be required to make an offer (the "change of control offer") to each Holder of the Securities of this series to repurchase all or any part (equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof (provided, that the unrepurchased portion of a Security must be in a minimum principal amount of $2,000)) of the Securities of this series held by such Holder on the terms set forth in this Security. In the change of control offer, the Company will be required to offer payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities of this series repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to the date of repurchase (the "change of control payment"). Within 30 days following any change of control triggering event or, at the Company's option, prior to any change of control, but after public announcement of the transaction that constitutes or may constitute the change of control, a notice will be mailed to the Holders of the Securities of this series describing the transaction that constitutes or may constitute the change of control triggering event and offering to repurchase such Securities on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (the "change of control payment date"). The notice will, if mailed prior to the date of consummation of the change of control, state that the offer to purchase is conditioned on the change of control triggering event occurring on or prior to the change of control payment date.
          On the change of control payment date, the Company will, to the extent lawful:
          The Company will not be required to make a change of control offer upon the occurrence of a change of control triggering event if a third party makes such an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for an offer made by the Company and the third party repurchases all Securities of this series properly tendered and not withdrawn under its offer. In addition, the Company will not repurchase any Securities of this series if there has occurred and is continuing on the change of control payment date an Event of Default, other than a default in the payment of the change of control payment upon a change of control triggering event.
          The Company will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Securities of this series as a result of a change of control triggering event. To the extent that the provisions of any such securities laws or regulations conflict with the change of control offer provisions of the Securities of this series, the Company will comply with those securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the change of control offer provisions of the Securities of this series by virtue of any such conflict.
          For purposes of the change of control offer provisions of the Securities of this series, the following terms will be applicable:
          "Change of control" means the occurrence of any of the following:
 
          Notwithstanding the foregoing, a transaction will not be deemed to involve a change of control under the first bullet above if (1) the Company becomes a direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of a holding company and (2) either (A) the direct or indirect holders of the voting stock of such holding company immediately following that transaction are substantially the same as the holders of the Company's voting stock immediately prior to that transaction or (B) immediately following that transaction no "person" (as that terms is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) (other than a holding company satisfying the requirements of this sentence) is the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the voting stock of such holding company.
          "Change of control triggering event" means the occurrence of both a change of control and a rating event.
          "Continuing director" means, as of any date of determination, any member of the Board of Directors who (1) was a member of the Board of Directors on the date the Securities of this series were originally issued or (2) was nominated for election, elected or appointed to the Board of Directors with the approval of a majority of the continuing directors who were members of the Board of Directors at the time of such nomination, election or appointment (either by a specific vote or by approval of the Company's proxy statement in which such member was named as a nominee for election as a director, without objection to such nomination).
          "Fitch" means Fitch Ratings.
          "Investment grade rating" means a rating equal to or higher than BBB- (or the equivalent) by Fitch, Baa3 (or the equivalent) by Moody's and BBB- (or the equivalent) by S&P, and the equivalent investment grade credit rating from any additional rating agency or rating agencies selected by the Company.
          "Moody's" means Moody's Investors Service Inc.
          "Rating agencies" means (1) each of Fitch, Moody's and S&P; and (2) if any of Fitch, Moody's or S&P ceases to rate the Securities of this series or fails to make a rating of such Securities publicly available for reasons outside of the Company's control, a "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" within the meaning of Rule 15c3-1(c)(2)(vi)(F) under the Exchange Act selected by the Company (as certified by a resolution of the Board of Directors) as a replacement agency for Fitch, Moody's or S&P, or all of them, as the case may be.
          "Rating event" means the rating on the Securities of this series is lowered by each of the rating agencies and such Securities are rated below an investment grade rating by each of the rating agencies on any day within the 60-day period (which 60-day period will be extended so long as the rating of the such Securities is under publicly announced consideration for a possible downgrade by any of the rating agencies) after the earlier of (1) the occurrence of a change of control and (2) public notice of the occurrence of a change of control or the Company's intention to effect a change of control; provided, however, that a rating event otherwise arising by virtue of a particular reduction in rating will not be deemed to have occurred in respect of a particular change of control (and thus will not be deemed a rating event for purposes of the definition of "change of control triggering event") if the rating agencies making the reduction in rating to which this definition would otherwise apply do not announce or publicly confirm or inform the Trustee in writing at the Company's request that the reduction was the result, in whole or in part, of any event or circumstance comprised of or arising as a result of, or in respect of, the applicable change of control (whether or not the applicable change of control has occurred at the time of the rating event). If any rating agency is not providing a rating of the Securities of this series on any day during the relevant period for any reason and the Company has not selected a replacement rating agency pursuant to the terms of this Security, the rating of such rating agency shall be deemed to be below an investment grade rating on such day and such rating agency will be deemed to have lowered its rating of the Securities of this series during the relevant period.
          "S&P" means Standard & Poor's Rating Services, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.
          "Voting stock" means, with respect to any specified "person" (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) as of any date, the capital stock of such person that is at the time entitled to vote generally in the election of the board of directors of such person.

          If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of this series shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Securities of this series may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
 
          The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of all series to be affected. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Securities of each or all series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
          As set forth in, and subject to, the provisions of the Indenture, no Holder of any Security of this series will have any right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for any remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have previously given to the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to this series, the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of this series shall have made written request, and offered reasonable indemnity, to the Trustee to institute such proceeding as trustee, and the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of this series a direction inconsistent with such request and shall have failed to institute such proceeding within 60 days; , , that such limitations do not apply to a suit instituted by the Holder hereof for the enforcement of payment of the principal of or premium, if any, or interest on this Security on or after the respective due dates expressed or provided for herein.

          As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Security is registrable in the Security Register, upon surrender for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Securities of this series and of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
          The Securities of this series are issuable only in global or definitive registered form, without coupons, in denominations of $2,000 or any whole multiple of $1,000 above that amount. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth and to the limitations described below, if applicable, Securities of this series are exchangeable at said office or agency of the Company for a like aggregate principal amount of Securities of this series and of like tenor of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.

Except as provided above, owners of beneficial interests in this permanent global Security will not be entitled to receive physical delivery of Securities in definitive registered form and will not be considered the Holders thereof for any purpose under the Indenture.
          Any Security in global form that is exchangeable pursuant to the preceding paragraph shall be exchangeable for Securities of this series in definitive registered form registered in such names as the Depository shall direct.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 10.1
     This Performance Share Unit Award Agreement (the "Agreement"), is made and entered into as of *[grant date] (the "Date of Grant"), by and between Archer-Daniels-Midland Company, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and First_Name Last_Name, an employee of the Company (the "Grantee"). This Agreement is pursuant to the terms of the Company's 2009 Incentive Compensation Plan (the "Plan"). The applicable terms of the Plan are incorporated herein by reference, including the definitions of capitalized terms contained in the Plan.
     . . The Company hereby grants to the Grantee, on the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, an Award of ResAmount Performance Share Units (the "Units"), such Units representing the right to receive, following vesting of the Units, such number of shares of the Company's common stock as may be determined in accordance with Section 4 of this Agreement, but in no event a total number of Shares greater than 150% of the number of Units. The Units granted to the Grantee shall be credited to an account in the Grantee's name. This account shall be a record of book-keeping entries only and shall be utilized solely as a device for the measurement and determination of the number of Shares to be granted to or in respect of the Grantee pursuant to this Agreement.
Section 1
Performance Share Unit Award
     . .
Section 2
Rights of Grantee
     (a) . The Units granted pursuant to this Award do not entitle Grantee to any rights of a shareholder of the Company's common stock. The Grantee's rights with respect to the Units shall remain forfeitable at all times by the Grantee until satisfaction of the vesting conditions set forth in Section 3 of this Agreement.
No Shareholder Rights
     (b) . The Grantee shall not be entitled to transfer, sell, pledge, alienate, hypothecate or assign the Units or this Award, except that in the event of the Grantee's death, the Grantee's designated beneficiary or estate shall be entitled to receive the Shares issuable in settlement of earned and vested Units. Any attempt to otherwise transfer the Units or this Award shall be void. All rights with respect to the Units and this Award shall be available only to the Grantee during his or her lifetime, and thereafter to the Grantee's designated beneficiary or estate.
Restrictions on Transfer
     . . Subject to the provisions of Sections 6 and 7 hereof, the Units granted hereunder (and the Grantee's right to receive Shares in settlement of the Units pursuant to this Award) shall vest on the earliest to occur of the following (the "Vesting Date"): (i) October 1, 2014; (ii) upon the occurrence of a Change in Control of the Company (as defined in the Plan after giving effect to the proviso regarding Code Section 409A at the end of that definition); or (iii) upon the death of the Grantee. Any outstanding Units granted hereunder that do not vest on the Vesting Date shall be forfeited.
Section 3
Vesting of Units
 
     . . The number of Shares that the Grantee will be entitled to receive in settlement of the vested Units following the Vesting Date will be determined as follows, subject to an overall limitation on such number of Shares equal to 150% of the number of vested Units:
Section 4
Number of Shares to be Received
     (a) . Each fiscal year of the Company occurring during the period July 1, 2011 to June 30, 2014 will be considered a "Performance Period" for purposes of this Agreement. As soon as practicable following the end of each Performance Period, the number of Shares issuable in settlement of one-third of the number of Units subject to this Agreement (the "Annual Share Settlement Amount") will be determined by the Committee by multiplying one-third of the number of Units by the Company Performance Factor (described in Section 4(b) below) for that Performance Period.
Annual Share Settlement Amount
     (b) .
Company Performance Factor
          (1) The Company Performance Factor for each Performance Period is a percentage multiplier, calculated to two decimal places, determined by the Committee for purposes of calculating payouts under the Company's annual cash incentive program for performance that occurred during the applicable Performance Period. As an example, the determination of the Company Performance Factor for the annual cash incentive program for fiscal 2010 is described on pages 20-22 of the Company's Proxy Statement for its annual meeting of stockholders held on November 4, 2010. The manner of determining the Company Performance Factor for each Performance Period for purposes of this Section 4 shall be established by the Committee no later than 90 days after the commencement of each Performance Period.
          (2) The Committee retains complete discretion to modify, from one year to the next, the manner in which it calculates payouts under the Company's annual cash incentive program, which may include changes in the way the Company Performance Factor is calculated (such as changes in the number, nature and weighting of financial and operational metrics upon which applicable performance goals are based, or changes in the level of achievement required to satisfy any applicable performance goal) and the use of a multiplier other than the Company Performance Factor. Any changes from one Performance Period to the next in the way the Company Performance Factor is calculated for a Performance Period for purposes of the annual cash incentive program shall equally apply to calculations affecting this Award under this Section 4. If the Committee makes other changes in the manner in which it calculates payouts under the Company's annual cash incentive program that will affect any Performance Period, then the Committee shall adapt the calculation methodology used under the annual cash incentive program as may be necessary to enable it to derive a Company Performance Factor for such Performance Period that may equitably be utilized for purposes of calculations under this Section 4. Any such adaptations and derivations made by the Committee pursuant to this Section 4(b)(2) shall be final, binding and conclusive for all purposes hereunder.
     (c) . If the Units vest pursuant to clause (ii) or clause (iii) of Section 3 of this Agreement, then to the extent that the number of Units that vest on the applicable Vesting Date exceeds the number of Units for which Annual Share Settlement
Additional Share Settlement Amount
 
Amounts have previously been determined in accordance with Section 4(a) above, the number of Shares issuable in settlement of Units for which no Annual Share Settlement Amounts have been calculated (the "Undetermined Units") will be determined by multiplying such number of Undetermined Units by the average of the Company Performance Factors previously determined by the Committee for Performance Periods completed prior to the applicable Vesting Date. If the Committee has not determined the Annual Share Settlement Amount for any Performance Period prior to the applicable Vesting Date, then the number of Shares issuable in settlement of the Undetermined Units shall be equal to the number of Undetermined Units. Any Share settlement amount determined pursuant to this Section 4(c) for Undetermined Units shall be referred to as the "Additional Share Settlement Amount."
     . . After any Units vest in accordance with Section 3 of this Agreement, the Company shall cause to be issued to the Grantee, or to the Grantee's designated beneficiary or estate in the event of Grantee's death, Shares in payment and settlement of such vested Units in an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the sum of all Annual Share Settlement Amounts and any Additional Share Settlement Amount determined in accordance with Section 4, or (ii) 150% of the number of vested Units. Except for vesting as a result of Grantee's death or a Change in Control of the Company, such issuance shall follow certification by the Committee of the calculation of the final Annual Share Settlement Amount, and shall occur on or before the later of (i) the end of the calendar year in which the Vesting Date occurs, or (ii) the 15th day of the third calendar month after the Vesting Date, and the Grantee shall have no power to affect the timing of such issuance. If vesting occurs as a result of Grantee's death, such issuance shall occur within 90 days of the date of Grantee's death, and if vesting occurs as a result of a Change in Control, such issuance shall occur as of the date of the Change in Control. Such issuance shall be evidenced by a stock certificate or appropriate entry on the books of the Company or a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company, shall be subject to the tax withholding provisions of Section 8, and shall be in complete settlement and satisfaction of such vested Units. If the ownership of or issuance of Shares to the Grantee as provided herein is not feasible due to applicable exchange controls, securities or tax laws or other provisions of applicable law, as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion, the Grantee or his legal representative shall receive cash proceeds in an amount equal to the Fair Market Value (as of the Vesting Date) of the Shares otherwise issuable to Grantee, net of any amount required to satisfy withholding tax obligations as provided in Section 8.
Section 5
Settlement of Units
          . . If the Grantee's service as an Employee ceases prior to the Vesting Date other than as a result of the Grantee's Retirement or Disability, the Grantee shall forfeit the Units. If such termination of service is a result of Grantee's Retirement or Disability, then subject to the forfeiture and recovery conditions of Section 7, Grantee's right to receive Shares pursuant to this Award shall continue to vest in accordance with Section 3.
Section 6
Effect of Termination of Service
          . . Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of termination of Grantee's service as an Employee for "cause" (as defined below), the breach of any non-competition or confidentiality restrictions applicable to the Grantee, or the Grantee's participation in an activity that is deemed by the Company to be detrimental to the Company (including, without limitation, criminal activity or accepting
Section 7
Forfeiture and Recovery Conditions
 
employment with a competitor of the Company), (i) the Grantee's right to receive an award of Units or an issuance of Shares in settlement of Units shall immediately terminate, (ii) any unvested Units held by the Grantee shall be forfeited, and (iii) if Shares have been issued (or the cash value thereof paid) after the Vesting Date, then either (A) the Shares so issued shall be forfeited and returned to the Company, or (B) the Grantee shall be required to pay to the Company in cash an amount equal to the Fair Market Value of such Shares as of the Vesting Date.
          For purposes hereof, "cause" shall have the meaning specified in such Grantee's employment agreement with the Company, or, in the case of a Grantee who is not employed pursuant to an employment agreement, "cause" shall mean any of the following acts by the Grantee: (i) embezzlement or misappropriation of corporate funds, (ii) any acts resulting in a conviction for, or plea of guilty or to, a charge of commission of a felony, (iii) misconduct resulting in injury to the Company or any subsidiary, (iv) activities harmful to the reputation of the Company or any subsidiary, (v) a violation of Company or subsidiary operating guidelines or policies, (vi) willful refusal to perform, or substantial disregard of, the duties properly assigned to the Grantee, or (vi) a violation of any contractual, statutory or common law duty of loyalty to the Company or any subsidiary.

          This Award shall also be subject to any compensation recovery policy adopted by the Board or the Committee in response to the requirements of Section 10D of the Exchange Act, and any incentive-based compensation associated with this Award may be recovered by the Company pursuant to such policy under the circumstances and to the extent required by Section 10D of the Exchange Act and the rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York Stock Exchange thereunder.
          . . The Grantee shall pay to the Company any required withholding taxes upon any event in connection with this Award, such as the issuance of Shares in settlement of the Units, that the Company determines may result in any domestic or foreign tax withholding obligation, and the delivery of such Shares shall be conditioned upon the prior payment by the Grantee, or the establishment of arrangements satisfactory to the Company for the payment by the Grantee, of such withholding tax obligation. The Company may permit the Grantee to satisfy all or any part of such withholding tax obligations (up to the Grantee's minimum required tax withholding rate) by having the Company withhold Shares otherwise payable in settlement of Units having a Fair Market Value on the date the tax is to be determined equal to the amount of such withholding tax obligations.
Section 8
Withholding of Taxes
          . . No Shares shall be delivered upon the vesting and settlement of any Units unless and until the Company and/or the Grantee shall have complied with all applicable federal, state or foreign registration, listing and/or qualification requirements and all other requirements of law or of any regulatory agencies having jurisdiction, unless the Committee has received evidence satisfactory to it that Grantee may acquire such shares pursuant to an exemption from registration under the applicable securities laws. Any determination in this connection by the Committee shall be final, binding, and conclusive. The Company reserves the right to legend any Share certificate or book entry, conditioning sales of such Shares upon compliance with applicable federal and state securities laws and regulations.
Section 9
Securities Law Compliance
 
          . . Nothing in this Agreement or this Award shall confer upon the Grantee any right to continue as an Employee or consultant of the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate, or to interfere in any way with the right of the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate to terminate the Grantee's service at any time.
Section 10
No Rights as Employee or Consultant
          . . If at any time while this Award is outstanding, the number of outstanding Shares is changed by reason of a reorganization, recapitalization, stock split or any of the other events described in Section 4.3 of the Plan, the number of Units and the number and kind of securities that may be issued in respect of such Units shall be adjusted in accordance with the provisions of the Plan.
Section 11

Any notice hereunder by the Company shall be given to the Grantee in writing and such notice shall be deemed duly given only upon receipt thereof at such address as the Grantee may have on file with the Company.
Section 12

Item 8.01 Other Events.
     On April 4, 2011, Archer-Daniels-Midland Company, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), settled the remarketing of $1,750,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 4.70% Debentures due 2041 (the "4.70% Debentures") that formed a component of the Company's equity units that were offered and sold on June 3, 2008 (the "Equity Units"). The remarketing was conducted pursuant to a remarketing agreement, dated January 11, 2011, by and among the Company; Citigroup Global Markets Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Barclays Capital Inc., BNP Paribas Securities Corp., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. and Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, as reset agents and remarketing agents (collectively, the "Remarketing Agents"); and the Bank of New York Mellon (formerly known as The Bank of New York), as the Purchase Contract Agent and as attorney-in-fact of the holders of the purchase contracts and, for purposes of Section 2(b) of the Remarketing Agreement, as Securities Intermediary and Custodial Agent (the "Remarketing Agreement").
     The Company originally issued the 4.70% Debentures on June 3, 2008 pursuant to an indenture, dated September 20, 2006, by and among the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon (successor to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.), as Trustee (the "Base Indenture"), as amended and supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of June 3, 2008, between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon (formerly known as The Bank of New York), as Trustee (the "First Supplemental Indenture" and, together with the Base Indenture, the "Original Indenture"). Pursuant to the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, dated as of June 3, 2008, by and among the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon (formerly known as The Bank of New York), as Purchase Contract Agent, and The Bank of New York Mellon (formerly known as The Bank of New York), as Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent and Securities Intermediary (the "Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement", the 4.70% Debentures were pledged to The Bank of New York Mellon as Purchase Contract Agent by holders of the Equity Units to secure such holders' obligations to purchase the Company's common stock on June 1, 2011 pursuant to the purchase contracts that form a component of the Equity Units.
     The 4.70% Debentures were remarketed as two tranches of securities: $750,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 4.479% Notes due 2021 (the "4.479% Notes") and $1,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 5.765% Debentures due 2041 (the "5.765% Debentures"). The 4.479% Notes and 5.765% Debentures were issued pursuant to the Original Indenture, as amended and supplemented by the Second Supplemental Indenture, dated as of November 29, 2010, between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon, as Trustee (the "Second Supplemental Indenture"), and the Third Supplemental Indenture, dated as of April 4, 2011, between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon, as Trustee (the "Third Supplemental Indenture"). The remarketing of the 4.70% Debentures was registered under an effective Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-165627).
     Upon settlement of the remarketing, the Bank of New York Mellon transferred the 4.70% Debentures it held to secure the purchase contracts to the Remarketing Agents. The Remarketing Agents then delivered the 4.479% Notes and the 5.765% Debentures to the buyers thereof. The purchase price paid by the buyers of the 4.479% Notes and 5.765% Debentures was used to
 
purchase a portfolio of U.S. treasury securities that will secure the Equity Unit holders' obligations to purchase shares of the Company's common stock under the purchase contracts until the purchase contracts are settled on June 1, 2011. Proceeds in excess of the purchase price of the treasury portfolio were distributed pro rata to holders of the Equity Units.
     This Current Report on Form 8-K is being filed to satisfy the requirement to file (i) copies of certain documents executed in connection with the remarketing of the 4.70% Debentures, and (ii) an opinion regarding the legality of the 4.479% Notes and 5.765% Debentures.
     The foregoing disclosure is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Remarketing Agreement, the form of which was filed as Exhibit 4.4 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on June 3, 2008; the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, which was filed as Exhibit 4.1 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on June 3, 2008; the Base Indenture, which was filed as Exhibit 4 to the Company's Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-137541); the First Supplemental Indenture, which was filed as Exhibit 4.6 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K on June 3, 2008; the Second Supplemental Indenture, which was filed as Exhibit 4.3 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on November 30, 2010; the Third Supplemental Indenture, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.4; the Form of 4.479% Note, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.5; and the Form of 5.765% Debentures, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.6.

Archer-Daniels-Midland Company 4666 Faries Parkway Decatur, Illinois 62526
Ladies and Gentlemen:
          We have acted as counsel to Archer-Daniels-Midland Company, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection withthe remarketing of $1,750,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 4.70% Debentures due 2041 (the "4.70% Debentures") pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") (Registration No. 333-165627) (the "Registration Statement"). The 4.70% Debentures were originally issued pursuant to an indenture dated September 20, 2006, by and among the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon (successor to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.), as Trustee (the "Base Indenture") as amended and supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of June 3, 2008, between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon (formerly known as The Bank of New York), as Trustee (the "First Supplemental Indenture" and, together with the Base Indenture, the "Original Indenture").
          The 4.70% Debentures were remarketed as two tranches: $750,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 4.479% Notes due 2021 (the "4.479% Notes") and $1,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 5.765% Debentures due 2041 (the "5.765% Debentures"). The 4.479% Notes and the 5.765% Debentures were issued pursuant to the Original Indenture, as amended and supplemented by the Second Supplemental Indenture, dated as of November 29, 2010, between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon, as Trustee (the "Second Supplemental Indenture"); and the Third Supplemental Indenture, dated as of April 4, 2011, between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon, as Trustee (the "Third Supplemental Indenture," and together with the Original Indenture and the Second Supplemental Indenture, the "Indenture").
          As such counsel, we have examined such matters of fact and questions of law as we have considered appropriate for purposes of this opinion. We have relied upon certificates and other assurances of officers of the Company and others as to factual matters without having independently verified such factual matters. In our review, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of the originals of the documents submitted to us and the conformity to authentic originals of any documents submitted to us as copies. We have further assumed, as to matters of fact, the truthfulness of the representations made in certificates of
 
public officials and officers of the Company, and that the Indenture is the legal, valid and binding obligation of each party thereto, other than the Company, enforceable against each such party in accordance with its terms. We also have assumed that the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Indenture will not (a) contravene the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company, (b) violate any law, rule or regulation applicable to the Company or (c) result in any conflict with or breach of any agreement or document binding on the Company.
          Our opinions set forth below are limited to the law of the State of Minnesota, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, and the law of the State of New York, and we do not express any opinion herein concerning any other law.
          Based upon the foregoing, and upon such other investigation as we have deemed necessary and subject to the qualifications set forth below, we are of the opinion that:
     The opinions set forth above are subject to (i) the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally (including without limitation all laws relating to fraudulent transfers) and (ii) the effect of general principles of equity, including without limitation concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).
     We understand that this opinion is to be used in connection with the Registration Statement. We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Registration Statement and to the use of our name in the prospectus supplement and accompanying prospectus under the caption "Legal Matters."

Archer Daniels Midland Company (NYSE: ADM) today reported third-quarter net earnings of $ 578 million and quarterly segment operating profit of $ 1.0 billion for the quarter ended March 31, 2011, up $ 157 million and $ 310 million, respectively, from the same period one year earlier.
The ADM team performed very well. Against a backdrop of volatile commodity prices, a challenging margin environment and geopolitical instability in the Middle East, North Africa and Cte dIvoire, our team worked smart and hard and delivered strong results, said Patricia Woertz, ADM chairman and CEO. As we look ahead, we are monitoring the planting and growing season in North America and Europe. Overall, global demand for crops and agricultural products remains relatively strong. In these conditions, ADM will use our unique global asset base and strong balance sheet to serve vital needs, efficiently connecting the worlds growers with the worlds buyers, and delivering value for our customers and our shareholders.

A summary of segment operating profit and net earnings follows:
Discussion of Net Earnings
Net earnings for the third quarter of $ 578 million increased $ 157 million due principally to a  $ 310 million increase in segment operating profit. This increase was partially offset by changes in LIFO inventory valuations, included in corporate, caused by higher agricultural commodity prices. Earnings before income taxes include a LIFO charge of $ 43 million this quarter, decreasing EPS by $ 0.04, compared to a LIFO gain of $ 43 million last year, which increased EPS by $ 0.04.
The fully diluted EPS calculation was impacted by the completion of the companys debt remarketing related to the Equity Units issued in 2008. While 44 million new common shares will be issued on June 1, the accounting requirement to use the if converted method assumes the company issued the shares at the beginning of the fiscal third quarter, and this assumption results in a $(0.05) per share impact for this quarter.
The companys effective income tax rate for the quarter was 28 percent, compared to the prior years third quarter rate of 22 percent. Last years effective tax rate included an adjustment to the quarterly rate to bring the cumulative effective tax rate for the year-to-date into line with the lower fiscal year forecast.

Oilseeds Processing
Oilseeds operating profit in the third quarter increased $ 107 million to $ 512 million.
Crushing and origination operating profit increased $ 133 million to $ 405 million for the quarter. Favorable ownership and strong North American results offset a decline from South America. European results increased significantly, principally on the reversal of mark-to-market timing effects.
Refining, packaging, biodiesel and other generated a profit of $ 89 million for the quarter, up $ 23 million from last year, as improved results from North and South America offset lower results from Europe.
Oilseeds results in Asia declined $ 49 million to $ 18 million for the quarter, principally reflecting ADMs share of the weaker results from its equity investee, Wilmar International Limited.
Corn Processing
For the quarter, corn processing operating profit increased $ 100 million to a profit of  $ 204 million. Processed volumes were up 13 percent, reflecting increased production at the companys corn processing plants, including the two new ethanol dry mills.
Sweeteners and starches operating profit of $ 46 million was essentially flat, as higher average selling prices and volumes were mostly offset by higher net corn costs. Export demand for sweetener remained strong, and U.S. demand for industrial starches improved.
Bioproducts profit in the quarter rose $ 99 million to $ 158 million, driven by favorable corn ownership and strong demand for value-added food and feed ingredients, particularly lysine.
Agricultural Services
Agricultural Services operating profit of $ 171 million increased $ 6 million from last years results.
The global merchandising and handling team delivered good results, comparable to last year, amid a challenging environment of significant volatility in agricultural commodity markets, regional instability in the Middle East and North Africa, and the earthquake and tsunami in Japan. U.S. export volumes and margins remained strong in the quarter.
Earnings from transportation operations improved on higher barge-freight rates.

Other
In the third quarter, profits from ADMs Other business units increased $ 97 million to $ 119 million.
In other processing, profits in wheat milling and cocoa operations were $ 96 million, an increase of $ 87 million from the year-ago quarter, which included large mark-to-market charges in the cocoa operations. During the quarter, cocoa operations in Cte dIvoire were suspended, and ADM met customer needs through its global cocoa processing network.
Other financial increased $ 10 million mainly due to improved results of ADMs captive insurance subsidiary and ADM Investor Services.
Corporate
Corporate results decreased $ 53 million principally due to an $ 86 million change in LIFO reserves and higher corporate costs. Last years third quarter included a $ 75 million charge relating to debt repurchase.
Current Market Conditions
Overall global economic conditions are being impacted by significant geopolitical developments, rising energy costs and evolving monetary and fiscal policies. These elements have the potential to temper global economic growth.
Regional crop supply imbalances are resulting in elevated prices and significant volatility. South America is harvesting a near-record soybean crop and has sufficient supply. In North America, the carryouts of corn and soybeans are projected to be tight, and farmers are beginning to plant. The global wheat supply is ample, and canola and rapeseed supplies vary by region.
Global demand for crops and agricultural products continues to grow. Global protein meal demand is firm. North American corn sweetener volumes are higher, led by Mexico. Ethanol consumption in the U.S. remains at maximum blendable levels, and global biodiesel demand is growing.

Archer Daniels Midland Company (NYSE: ADM) today reported net earnings for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011, of $ 2.0 billion and record segment operating profit of $ 4.0 billion, up 5 percent and 24 percent, respectively, from the prior year.
For the quarter ended June 30, 2011, net earnings were $ 381 million, down $ 65 million, and segment operating profit was $ 888 million, up $ 89 million, from the same period one year earlier.
Despite a challenging environment in several key markets, ADM delivered solid operating results across all our businesses for the quarter. We earned record operating profit for the fiscal year with our growing global asset base, diversified product portfolio and the acumen of the ADM team, said Patricia Woertz, ADM chairman and CEO. Looking ahead, we are confident in our people, our assets and our financial strength to deliver profitable growth and value for our shareholders as we serve the vital needs of a growing world.
Financial Highlights
 
(Amounts in millions, except per share data)
 
 
 
 
A summary of segment operating profit and net earnings follows:
Discussion of Net Earnings
Net earnings for the fourth quarter of $ 381 million decreased $ 65 million due principally to higher income tax expense of $ 280 million. This was partially offset by higher segment operating profit of $ 89 million and credits in LIFO inventory valuations, included in corporate, caused by lower agricultural commodity prices at the end of the fourth quarter compared to the beginning of the quarter. Earnings before income taxes include a LIFO credit of $ 52 million or $ 0.05 per share this quarter, compared to a LIFO charge of $ 23 million or $ 0.02 per share last year.
The companys effective income tax rate for the fourth quarter was 50 percent, compared to the prior years quarter rate of 19 percent. ADM recorded additional tax expenses in the fourth quarter to bring the effective tax rate for the full year to 33 percent compared to the prior years rate of 26 percent. The effective tax rate for the fiscal year was atypical and was primarily the result of several unfavorable specific tax items and changes in the geographic mix of earnings.
For fiscal year 2012, based on current estimates, ADM expects its effective tax rate to be in the range of 28-30 percent.

Oilseeds Processing
Oilseeds operating profit in the fourth quarter increased $ 20 million to $ 379 million.
Crushing and origination operating profit increased $ 14 million to $ 232 million for the quarter. North American results improved across the oilseed portfolio, particularly in softseeds, despite a weak margin environment. European and South American results were lower and were partially offset by positive mark-to-market timing effects.
Refining, packaging, biodiesel and other generated a profit of $ 86 million for the quarter, up   $ 7 million from last year, as improved results from North America offset lower results from Europe and South America.
Oilseeds results in Asia for the quarter were in line with last year, principally reflecting ADMs share of the results from equity investee, Wilmar International Limited.
Corn Processing
For the quarter, corn processing operating profit was $ 118 million, a decline of $ 22 million from the same quarter last year. While processed volumes were up 15 percent, net corn costs increased significantly from the fourth quarter of last year.
Sweeteners and starches operating profit of $ 9 million was down $ 110 million, as higher average selling prices and sales volumes were more than offset by higher net corn costs. Export demand for sweeteners remained strong.
Bioproducts profit the quarter rose $ 88 million to $ 109 million, driven by higher ethanol prices, favorable ownership positions and strong demand for value-added food and feed ingredients, particularly lysine and other amino acids.
in
Agricultural Services
Agricultural Services operating profit of $ 193 million increased $ 15 million from last years results.
Merchandising and handling earnings increased primarily due to stronger results from North American interior elevators and export operations, partially offset by weaker international results. Earnings from transportation operations were essentially flat compared to the fourth quarter of last year.
 
 
 
Archer Daniels Midland Company  Page 4
 
Other
In the fourth quarter, profits from ADMs Other business units increased $ 76 million to $ 198 million.
In other processing, which includes wheat milling, cocoa and ADMs share of Gruma, S.A.B. de C.V., profits were $ 192 million, an increase of $ 64 million from the year-ago quarter. ADMs portion of Grumas results included a $ 78 million gain on the disposal of assets.
Other financial increased $ 12 million mainly due to improved results of ADMs captive insurance subsidiary and ADM Investor Services.
Corporate
Corporate results improved $ 125 million. Lower commodity prices through the fourth quarter led to $ 52 million of LIFO credits on a decrease in ADMs LIFO inventory valuation reserves this quarter. This is compared to a LIFO charge of $ 23 million a year ago. Last years fourth quarter also included $ 59 million of unrealized losses on interest rate swaps.
Current Market Conditions
U.S. corn and soybean supplies are tight. Overall global crop supplies remain adequate following a good world wheat harvest and a record soybean harvest in South America. ADM is monitoring crop progress and harvests in Europe, North America and China.
Global demand for crops and agricultural products remains strong. Global protein meal and vegetable oil demand continues to grow, while industry margins remain under pressure. Export demand continues to drive strong U.S. corn sweetener volumes. With positive blending economics, ethanol consumption in the U.S. remains at maximum blendable levels.

Exhibit 99.1

The Reference United States Treasury Security used to determine the coupon on the New Debentures and the total exchange price to be received in each Exchange Offer (the "Total Exchange Price") for all of the Old Debentures is the 4.375% United States Treasury due May 15, 2041 (the "Reference Treasury"). The bid-side yield of the Reference Treasury as of the Pricing Time was 3.185%.
Set forth in the table below is the Total Exchange Price for each $1,000 principal amount of Old Debentures validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) and accepted by ADM at or prior to the Early Participation Date (as defined below), determined in accordance with the Offering Memorandum, and the consideration to be received for the Total Exchange Price for each series of Old Debentures.

The Exchange Offers remain subject to the condition that a sufficient principal amount of Old Debentures have been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn prior to the Early Participation Date such that a minimum of $250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of New Debentures will be issuable in exchange for such Old Debentures on the Early Settlement Date. The condition that the yield on the Reference Treasury is not more than 4.15% at the Pricing Time has been met.

On September 26, 2011, Archer-Daniels-Midland Company ("ADM") issued $527,681,000 aggregate principal amount of 4.535% Debentures due 2042 (the "New Debentures") in exchange for specified series of ADM's outstanding debt securities, in connection with the expiration of the early participation period for its previously announced exchange offers. The New Debentures were issued to qualified institutional buyers ("QIBs") pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and to non-U.S. persons in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act.
The New Debentures were issued under an indenture, dated as of September 20, 2006, between ADM and The Bank of New York Mellon (as successor to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.), as trustee. The New Debentures will pay interest on March 26 and September 26 of each year, beginning March 26, 2012, at a rate of 4.535% per annum. The New Debentures are ADM's senior obligations and rank equally with all of its other unsecured indebtedness. The New Debentures are subject to optional redemption prior to maturity. The New Debentures issuable to QIBs in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act were issued in the form of registered global securities in the form of debentures attached as Exhibit 4.1 hereto (the "Rule 144 A Global Debenture"), and the New Debentures issuable to non-U.S. persons pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act were issued in the form of registered global securities in the form of debentures attached as Exhibit 4.2 hereto (the "Regulation S Global Debenture"). The description of the New Debentures contained herein is qualified by reference to the form of Rule 144A Global Debenture and form of Regulation S Global Debenture attached hereto.
On September 26, 2011, in connection with the issuance of the New Debentures, ADM entered into a registration rights agreement (the "Registration Rights Agreement") with the dealer managers for the exchange offers named therein. Under the Registration Rights Agreement, ADM has agreed to file an exchange offer registration statement with the Securities Exchange Commission (the "SEC") to allow holders of the New Debentures to exchange such New Debentures for an equal principal amount of debentures with substantially identical terms, except that they will generally be freely transferable under the Securities Act. In addition, ADM has agreed pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, under certain circumstances, to file a shelf registration statement with the SEC to cover resales of the New Debentures. If ADM fails to satisfy these obligations, it will be required to pay additional interest as liquidated damages to the holders of the New Debentures. The Registration Rights Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.3, and the description of the Registration Rights Agreement contained herein is qualified by reference thereto.
The New Debentures have not been registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws. Therefore, the New Debentures may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and any applicable state securities laws. This report on Form 8-K does not constitute an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy, any security and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offering would be unlawful.

TRUSTEE'S CERTIFICATE OF AUTHENTICATION
This is one of the Securities of the
series designated herein and referred to
in the within-mentioned Indenture.
THE BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON
as Trustee
 
This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the "Securities"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under an Indenture, dated as September 20, 2006 (herein called the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon (successor to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.) (herein called the "Trustee," which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the Securities of the series designated herein, limited in aggregate principal amount in accordance with the terms of the exchange offers described in the Confidential Offering Memorandum of the Company dated as of September 8, 2011; provided, however, that the Company, without notice to or the consent of the Holders, may issue additional Securities of this series and thereby increase such principal amount in the future, on the same terms and conditions (except for issue date, public offering price and, if applicable, the date from which interest accrues and the first Interest Payment Date) and with the same CUSIP number as the Securities of this series.
The Holder of this Security is entitled to the benefits of the Registration Rights Agreement dated as of September 26, 2011, by and among the Company and the Dealer Managers, as defined therein (as the same may be amended from time to time, the "Registration Rights Agreement"). In the event of a Registration Default (as such term is defined in the Registration Rights Agreement), additional interest shall accrue on the Securities of this series over and above the interest set forth in the title of the Securities of this series from and including the date on which any such Registration Default shall occur to but excluding the date on which all filings, declarations of effectiveness and consummations, as the case may be, have been achieved which, if achieved on a timely basis, would have prevented the occurrence of all of the then existing Registration Defaults, at a rate of 0.25% per annum during the 90-day period immediately following the first occurrence of a Registration Default, which shall increase by 0.25% per annum at the end of each subsequent 90-day period up to a maximum of 0.50% per annum with respect to all Registration Defaults. Any such additional interest shall be paid to the same Persons, at the same times and in the same manner as ordinary interest on the Securities of this series. Any Exchange Debenture (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) issued in exchange for this Security shall evidence the same continuing indebtedness as this Security. Under no circumstances shall the surrender of this Security and the issue of an Exchange Debenture in exchange therefor constitute new indebtedness or obligate the Company to repay the principal amount of this Security in connection with the exchange.
The Securities of this series are redeemable at the option of the Company at any time, in whole or in part, at a Redemption Price equal to the greater of the following amounts, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the Redemption Date: (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Securities of this series to be redeemed, and (ii) the sum of the present values of the Remaining Scheduled Payments.
In determining the present values of the Remaining Scheduled Payments, such payments will be discounted to the Redemption Date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) using a discount rate equal to the Treasury Rate plus 20 basis points. A partial redemption of the Securities of this series may be effected by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate and may provide for the selection for redemption of portions (equal to the minimum authorized denomination for the Securities of this series or any integral multiple thereof) of the principal amount of Securities of a denomination larger than the minimum authorized denomination for the Securities of this series.
Notice of any redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the Redemption Date to each Holder of the Securities of this series to be redeemed.
Unless the Company defaults in payment of the Redemption Price, on and after the Redemption Date interest will cease to accrue on the Securities of this series or portions thereof called for redemption.
"Treasury Rate," with respect to any Redemption Date, means the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue. In determining this rate, it is assumed that a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) is equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such Redemption Date.
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Quotation Agent as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term (as measured from the Redemption Date) of the Securities of this series to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Securities.
"Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, (a) if the Quotation Agent obtains four or more Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of such quotations, after excluding the highest and lowest of such quotations, or (b) if the Quotation Agent obtains fewer than four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations, or (c) if only one reference Treasury Dealer Quotation is received, such quotation.
"Quotation Agent" means any Reference Treasury Dealer appointed by the Company.
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means (1) each of Barclays Capital Inc., BNP Paribas Securities Corp., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., and HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. (or their respective affiliates that are Primary Treasury Dealers) and their respective successors; provided, however, that if any of the foregoing shall cease to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer in New York City (a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), the Company will substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer, and (2) any other Primary Treasury Dealer appointed by the Company.
"Reference Treasury Dealers Quotations" mean, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date, the average, as determined by the Quotation Agent, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Quotation Agent by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding such Redemption Date.
"Remaining Scheduled Payments" means, with respect to any Security of this series, the remaining scheduled payments of the principal and interest thereon that would be due after the related Redemption Date but for such redemption; , that, if such Redemption Date is not an Interest Payment Date with respect to such Security, the amount of the next scheduled interest payment thereon will be reduced (solely for purposes of this definition) by the amount of interest accrued thereon to such Redemption Date.
provided, however
Notwithstanding Section 1104 of the Indenture, the notice of such redemption need not set forth the Redemption Price but only the manner of calculation thereof. The Company shall give the Trustee notice of the Redemption Price promptly after the calculation thereof and the Trustee shall not be responsible for such calculation.
This Security shall not be subject to any sinking fund.
If a change of control triggering event occurs, the Company will be required to make an offer (the "change of control offer") to each Holder of the Securities of this series to repurchase all or any part (equal to $1,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) of the Securities of this series held by such Holder on the terms set forth in this Security. In the change of control offer, the Company will be required to offer payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities of this series repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to the date of repurchase (the "change of control payment"). Within 30 days following any change of control triggering event or, at the Company's option, prior to any change of control, but after public announcement of the transaction that constitutes or may constitute the change of control, a notice will be mailed to the Holders of the Securities of this series describing the transaction that constitutes or may constitute the change of control triggering event and offering to repurchase such Securities on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (the "change of control
payment date"). The notice will, if mailed prior to the date of consummation of the change of control, state that the offer to purchase is conditioned on the change of control triggering event occurring on or prior to the change of control payment date.
On the change of control payment date, the Company will, to the extent lawful:
 
 
 
The Company will not be required to make a change of control offer upon the occurrence of a change of control triggering event if a third party makes such an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for an offer made by the Company and the third party repurchases all Securities of this series properly tendered and not withdrawn under its offer. In addition, the Company will not repurchase any Securities of this series if there has occurred and is continuing on the change of control payment date an Event of Default, other than a default in the payment of the change of control payment upon a change of control triggering event.
The Company will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Securities of this series as a result of a change of control triggering event. To the extent that the provisions of any such securities laws or regulations conflict with the change of control offer provisions of the Securities of this series, the Company will comply with those securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the change of control offer provisions of the Securities of this series by virtue of any such conflict.
For purposes of the change of control offer provisions of the Securities of this series, the following terms will be applicable:
"Change of control" means the occurrence of any of the following:
 
 
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a transaction will not be deemed to involve a change of control if (1) the Company becomes a direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of a holding company and (2) either (A) the direct or indirect holders of the voting stock of such holding company immediately following that transaction are substantially the same as the holders of the Company's voting stock immediately prior to that transaction or (B) immediately following that transaction no person (other than a holding company satisfying the requirements of this sentence) is the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the voting stock of such holding company.
"Change of control triggering event" means the occurrence of both a change of control and a rating event.
"Continuing directors" means, as of any date of determination, any member of the Board of Directors who (1) was a member of the Board of Directors on the date the Securities of this series were originally issued or (2) was nominated for election, elected or appointed to the Board of Directors with the approval of a majority of the continuing directors who were members of the Board of Directors at the time of such nomination, election or appointment (either by a specific vote or by approval of the Company's proxy statement in which such member was named as a nominee for election as a director, without objection to such nomination).
"Fitch" means Fitch Ratings.
"Investment grade rating" means a rating equal to or higher than BBB- (or the equivalent) by Fitch, Baa3 (or the equivalent) by Moody's and BBB- (or the equivalent) by S&P, and the equivalent investment grade credit rating from any additional rating agency or rating agencies selected by the Company.
"Moody's" means Moody's Investors Service Inc.
"Rating agencies" means (1) each of Fitch, Moody's and S&P; and (2) if any of Fitch, Moody's or S&P ceases to rate the Securities of this series or fails to make a rating of such Securities publicly available for reasons outside of the Company's control, a "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" within the meaning of Rule 15c3-1(c)(2)(vi)(F) under the Exchange Act selected by the Company (as certified by a resolution of the Board of Directors) as a replacement agency for Fitch, Moody's or S&P, or all of them, as the case may be.
"Rating event" means the rating on the Securities of this series is lowered by each of the rating agencies and such Securities are rated below an investment grade rating by each of the rating agencies on any day within the 60-day period (which 60-day period will be extended so long as the rating of the such Securities is under publicly announced consideration for a possible downgrade by any of the rating agencies) after the earlier of (1) the occurrence of a change of control and (2) public notice of the occurrence of a change of control or the Company's intention to effect a change of control; provided, however, that a rating event otherwise arising by virtue of a particular reduction in rating will not be deemed to have occurred in respect of a particular change of control (and thus will not be deemed a rating event for purposes of the definition of "change of control triggering event") if the rating agencies making the reduction in rating to which this definition would otherwise apply do not announce or publicly confirm or inform the Trustee in writing at the Company's request that the reduction was the result, in whole or in part, of any event or circumstance comprised of or arising as a result of, or in respect of, the applicable change of control (whether or not the applicable change of control has occurred at the time of the rating event). If any rating agency is not providing a rating of the Securities of this series on any day during the relevant period for any reason and the Company has not selected a replacement rating agency pursuant to the terms of the Securities of this series, the rating of such rating agency shall be deemed to be below an investment grade rating on such day and such rating agency will be deemed to have lowered its rating of the Securities of this series during the relevant period.
"S&P" means Standard & Poor's Rating Services, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.
"Voting stock" means, with respect to any specified "person" (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) as of any date, the capital stock of such person that is at the time entitled to vote generally in the election of the board of directors of such person.
As provided in the Indenture, defeasance may occur at any time of (a) the entire indebtedness of the Company on this Security and (b) certain restrictive covenants and the related defaults and Events of Default, upon compliance by the Company with certain conditions set forth therein, which provisions apply to this Security.
If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of this series shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Securities of this series may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of all series to be affected. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Securities of each or all series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
As set forth in, and subject to, the provisions of the Indenture, no Holder of any Security of this series will have any right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for any remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have previously given to the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to this series, the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of this series shall have made written request, and offered reasonable indemnity, to the Trustee to institute such proceeding as trustee, and the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of this series a direction inconsistent with such request and shall have failed to institute such proceeding within 60 days; , , that such limitations do not apply to a suit instituted by the Holder hereof for the enforcement of payment of the principal of or premium, if any, or interest on this Security on or after the respective due dates expressed or provided for herein.
provided
however
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on this Security at the times, places, and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Security is registrable in the Security Register, upon surrender for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Securities of this series and of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
The Securities of this series are issuable only in global or definitive registered form, without coupons, in denominations of $1,000 or any whole multiple of $1,000 above that amount.

TRUSTEE'S CERTIFICATE OF AUTHENTICATION
This is one of the Securities of the
series designated herein and referred to
in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the "Securities"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under an Indenture, dated as September 20, 2006 (herein called the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon (successor to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.) (herein called the "Trustee," which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the Securities of the series designated herein, limited in aggregate principal amount in accordance with the terms of the exchange offers described in the Confidential Offering Memorandum of the Company dated as of September 8, 2011; provided, however, that the Company, without notice to or the consent of the Holders, may issue additional Securities of this series and thereby increase such principal amount in the future, on the same terms and conditions (except for issue date, public offering price and, if applicable, the date from which interest accrues and the first Interest Payment Date) and with the same CUSIP number as the Securities of this series.
The Holder of this Security is entitled to the benefits of the Registration Rights Agreement dated as of September 26, 2011, by and among the Company and the Dealer Managers, as defined therein (as the same may be amended from time to time, the "Registration Rights Agreement"). In the event of a Registration Default (as such term is defined in the Registration Rights Agreement), additional interest shall accrue on the Securities of this series over and above the interest set forth in the title of the Securities of this series from and including the date on which any such Registration Default shall occur to but excluding the date on which all filings, declarations of effectiveness and consummations, as the case may be, have been achieved which, if achieved on a timely basis, would have prevented the occurrence of all of the then existing Registration Defaults, at a rate of 0.25% per annum during the 90-day period immediately following the first occurrence of a Registration Default, which shall increase by 0.25% per annum at the end of each subsequent 90-day period up to a maximum of 0.50% per annum with respect to all Registration Defaults. Any such additional interest shall be paid to the same Persons, at the same times and in the same manner as ordinary interest on the Securities of this series. Any Exchange Debenture (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) issued in exchange for this Security shall evidence the same continuing indebtedness as this Security. Under no circumstances shall the surrender of this Security and the issue of an Exchange Debenture in exchange therefor constitute new indebtedness or obligate the Company to repay the principal amount of this Security in connection with the exchange.
The Securities of this series are redeemable at the option of the Company at any time, in whole or in part, at a Redemption Price equal to the greater of the following amounts, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the Redemption Date: (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Securities of this series to be redeemed, and (ii) the sum of the present values of the Remaining Scheduled Payments.
In determining the present values of the Remaining Scheduled Payments, such payments will be discounted to the Redemption Date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) using a discount rate equal to the Treasury Rate plus 20 basis points. A partial redemption of the Securities of this series may be effected by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate and may provide for the selection for redemption of portions (equal to the minimum authorized denomination for the Securities of this series or any integral multiple thereof) of the principal amount of Securities of a denomination larger than the minimum authorized denomination for the Securities of this series.
Notice of any redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the Redemption Date to each Holder of the Securities of this series to be redeemed.
Unless the Company defaults in payment of the Redemption Price, on and after the Redemption Date interest will cease to accrue on the Securities of this series or portions thereof called for redemption.
"Treasury Rate," with respect to any Redemption Date, means the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue. In determining this rate, it is assumed that a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) is equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such Redemption Date.
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Quotation Agent as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term (as measured from the Redemption Date) of the Securities of this series to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Securities.
"Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, (a) if the Quotation Agent obtains four or more Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of such quotations, after excluding the highest and lowest of such quotations, or (b) if the Quotation Agent obtains fewer than four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations, or (c) if only one reference Treasury Dealer Quotation is received, such quotation.
"Quotation Agent" means any Reference Treasury Dealer appointed by the Company.
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means (1) each of Barclays Capital Inc., BNP Paribas Securities Corp., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., and HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. (or their respective affiliates that are Primary Treasury Dealers) and their respective successors; provided, however, that if any of the foregoing shall cease to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer in New York City (a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), the Company will substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer, and (2) any other Primary Treasury Dealer appointed by the Company.
"Reference Treasury Dealers Quotations" mean, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date, the average, as determined by the Quotation Agent, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Quotation Agent by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding such Redemption Date.
"Remaining Scheduled Payments" means, with respect to any Security of this series, the remaining scheduled payments of the principal and interest thereon that would be due after the related Redemption Date but for such redemption; , that, if such Redemption Date is not an Interest Payment Date with respect to such Security, the amount of the next scheduled interest payment thereon will be reduced (solely for purposes of this definition) by the amount of interest accrued thereon to such Redemption Date.
provided, however
Notwithstanding Section 1104 of the Indenture, the notice of such redemption need not set forth the Redemption Price but only the manner of calculation thereof. The Company shall give the Trustee notice of the Redemption Price promptly after the calculation thereof and the Trustee shall not be responsible for such calculation.
This Security shall not be subject to any sinking fund.
If a change of control triggering event occurs, the Company will be required to make an offer (the "change of control offer") to each Holder of the Securities of this series to repurchase all or any part (equal to $1,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) of the Securities of this series held by such Holder on the terms set forth in this Security. In the change of control offer, the Company will be required to offer payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities of this series repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to the date of repurchase (the "change of control payment"). Within 30 days following any change of control triggering event or, at the Company's option, prior to any change of control, but after public announcement of the transaction that constitutes or may constitute the change of control, a notice will be mailed to the Holders of the Securities of this series describing the transaction that constitutes or may constitute the change of control triggering event and offering to repurchase such Securities on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (the "change of control
payment date"). The notice will, if mailed prior to the date of consummation of the change of control, state that the offer to purchase is conditioned on the change of control triggering event occurring on or prior to the change of control payment date.
On the change of control payment date, the Company will, to the extent lawful:
 
 
 
The Company will not be required to make a change of control offer upon the occurrence of a change of control triggering event if a third party makes such an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for an offer made by the Company and the third party repurchases all Securities of this series properly tendered and not withdrawn under its offer. In addition, the Company will not repurchase any Securities of this series if there has occurred and is continuing on the change of control payment date an Event of Default, other than a default in the payment of the change of control payment upon a change of control triggering event.
The Company will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Securities of this series as a result of a change of control triggering event. To the extent that the provisions of any such securities laws or regulations conflict with the change of control offer provisions of the Securities of this series, the Company will comply with those securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the change of control offer provisions of the Securities of this series by virtue of any such conflict.
For purposes of the change of control offer provisions of the Securities of this series, the following terms will be applicable:
"Change of control" means the occurrence of any of the following:
 
 
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a transaction will not be deemed to involve a change of control if (1) the Company becomes a direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of a holding company and (2) either (A) the direct or indirect holders of the voting stock of such holding company immediately following that transaction are substantially the same as the holders of the Company's voting stock immediately prior to that transaction or (B) immediately following that transaction no person (other than a holding company satisfying the requirements of this sentence) is the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the voting stock of such holding company.
"Change of control triggering event" means the occurrence of both a change of control and a rating event.
"Continuing directors" means, as of any date of determination, any member of the Board of Directors who (1) was a member of the Board of Directors on the date the Securities of this series were originally issued or (2) was nominated for election, elected or appointed to the Board of Directors with the approval of a majority of the continuing directors who were members of the Board of Directors at the time of such nomination, election or appointment (either by a specific vote or by approval of the Company's proxy statement in which such member was named as a nominee for election as a director, without objection to such nomination).
"Fitch" means Fitch Ratings.
"Investment grade rating" means a rating equal to or higher than BBB- (or the equivalent) by Fitch, Baa3 (or the equivalent) by Moody's and BBB- (or the equivalent) by S&P, and the equivalent investment grade credit rating from any additional rating agency or rating agencies selected by the Company.
"Moody's" means Moody's Investors Service Inc.
"Rating agencies" means (1) each of Fitch, Moody's and S&P; and (2) if any of Fitch, Moody's or S&P ceases to rate the Securities of this series or fails to make a rating of such Securities publicly available for reasons outside of the Company's control, a "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" within the meaning of Rule 15c3-1(c)(2)(vi)(F) under the Exchange Act selected by the Company (as certified by a resolution of the Board of Directors) as a replacement agency for Fitch, Moody's or S&P, or all of them, as the case may be.
"Rating event" means the rating on the Securities of this series is lowered by each of the rating agencies and such Securities are rated below an investment grade rating by each of the rating agencies on any day within the 60-day period (which 60-day period will be extended so long as the rating of the such Securities is under publicly announced consideration for a possible downgrade by any of the rating agencies) after the earlier of (1) the occurrence of a change of control and (2) public notice of the occurrence of a change of control or the Company's intention to effect a change of control; provided, however, that a rating event otherwise arising by virtue of a particular reduction in rating will not be deemed to have occurred in respect of a particular change of control (and thus will not be deemed a rating event for purposes of the definition of "change of control triggering event") if the rating agencies making the reduction in rating to which this definition would otherwise apply do not announce or publicly confirm or inform the Trustee in writing at the Company's request that the reduction was the result, in whole or in part, of any event or circumstance comprised of or arising as a result of, or in respect of, the applicable change of control (whether or not the applicable change of control has occurred at the time of the rating event). If any rating agency is not providing a rating of the Securities of this series on any day during the relevant period for any reason and the Company has not selected a replacement rating agency pursuant to the terms of the Securities of this series, the rating of such rating agency shall be deemed to be below an investment grade rating on such day and such rating agency will be deemed to have lowered its rating of the Securities of this series during the relevant period.
"S&P" means Standard & Poor's Rating Services, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.
"Voting stock" means, with respect to any specified "person" (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) as of any date, the capital stock of such person that is at the time entitled to vote generally in the election of the board of directors of such person.

If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of this series shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Securities of this series may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of all series to be affected. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Securities of each or all series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
As set forth in, and subject to, the provisions of the Indenture, no Holder of any Security of this series will have any right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for any remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have previously given to the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to this series, the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of this series shall have made written request, and offered reasonable indemnity, to the Trustee to institute such proceeding as trustee, and the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of this series a direction inconsistent with such request and shall have failed to institute such proceeding within 60 days; , , that such limitations do not apply to a suit instituted by the Holder hereof for the enforcement of payment of the principal of or premium, if any, or interest on this Security on or after the respective due dates expressed or provided for herein.

This Security, if in global form, is exchangeable for Securities of this series in definitive registered form only if (x) The Depository Trust Company (the "Depository") notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depository for this global Security or if at any time the Depository ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act, and the Company has not appointed a successor Depository within 90 days of that notice or of its becoming aware of such cessation, (y) the Company in its sole discretion and subject to the procedures of the Depository determines that this Security shall be exchangeable for definitive Securities in registered form or (z) an Event of Default, or an event which with the passage of time or the giving of notice or both would become an Event of Default, with respect to the Securities represented hereby has occurred and is continuing, provided that the definitive Securities so issued in exchange for this permanent global Security shall be in denominations of $1,000 or any whole multiple of $1,000 above that amount and be of like aggregate principal amount and tenor as the portion of this permanent global Security to be exchanged. Except as provided above, owners of beneficial interests in this permanent global Security will not be entitled to receive physical delivery of Securities in definitive registered form and will not be considered the Holders thereof for any purpose under the Indenture.
Any Security in global form that is exchangeable pursuant to the preceding paragraph shall be exchangeable for Securities of this series in definitive registered form registered in such names as the Depository shall direct.
Neither the Company, the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in a Security in global form or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests.

Section 7(a)
Section 4(q)
(b) Each Holder of securities covered by a Registration Statement (including each Dealer Manager and, with respect to any Prospectus delivery as contemplated in hereof, each Exchanging Dealer), severally and not jointly, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, and each of its directors, officers, employees and agents and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act (each, a ""), to the same extent as the indemnity in from the Company to each such Holder, but only with reference to written information relating to such Holder furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Holder specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity, and further agrees to reimburse each Company Indemnitee for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Company Indemnitee in connection with investigating or defending or preparing to defend against any such loss, claim, damage, liability, judgment or action as such expenses are incurred.

Section 4(h)
Company Indemnitee
Section 7(a)
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this or notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section, notify the
Section 7
indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses; and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); provided, however, that such counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest; (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party; (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action; or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party shall not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties (not to be unreasonably withheld), settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding. An indemnifying party shall not be liable under this to any indemnified party regarding any settlement or compromise or consent to the entry of judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent is consented to by such indemnifying party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.
Section 7
(d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a) or (b) of this is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, then each applicable indemnifying party shall have an obligation to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) (collectively "") to which such indemnified party may be subject in such proportion as is
Section 7
Losses
appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by such indemnifying party, on the one hand, and such indemnified party, on the other hand, from the Initial Exchange Offer and the Registration Statement which resulted in such Losses; provided, however, that in no case shall any Dealer Manager who is a Holder of any New Debenture or Exchange Debenture be responsible, in the aggregate, for any amount in excess of the Fee applicable to such New Debenture, or in the case of an Exchange Debenture, applicable to the New Debenture that was exchangeable into such Exchange Debenture, in connection with the Initial Exchange Offer as set forth in the Dealer Manager Agreement, nor shall any underwriter be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the New Debentures or Exchange Debentures, as the case may be, purchased by such underwriter under the Registration Statement which resulted in such Losses. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of such indemnifying party, on the one hand, and such indemnified party, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to (x) the aggregate principal amount of Old Debentures exchanged in the Initial Exchange Offer (before deducting expenses), plus (y) the total amount of Additional Interest which the Company was not required to pay as a result of registering the New Debentures or Exchange Debentures covered by the Registration Statement which resulted in such Losses, minus (z) the aggregate amount of Fees paid by the Company in connection with the Initial Exchange Offer under the Dealer Manager Agreement. Benefits received by the Dealer Managers shall be deemed to be equal to the aggregate amount of Fees received by the Dealer Managers in connection with the Initial Exchange Offer under the Dealer Manager Agreement, and benefits received by any Holders shall be deemed to be equal to the value of receiving New Debentures or Exchange Debentures, as applicable, registered under the Act. Benefits received by any underwriter shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, as set forth on the cover page of the Prospectus forming a part of the Registration Statement which resulted in such Losses. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the indemnifying party, on the one hand, or by the indemnified party, on the other hand, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The parties agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Holders were treated as one entity for such purpose) or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section, each person who controls a Holder within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of such Holder shall have the same rights to contribution as such Holder, and each person who controls the Company within
the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each director, officer, employee and agent of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d).
(e) The provisions of this shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Holder or the Company or any of the officers, directors, employees, agents or controlling persons referred to in this , and shall survive the sale by a Holder of securities covered by a Registration Statement.

(b) No Holder may participate in any underwritten offering pursuant to any Shelf Registration Statement, unless such Holder (i) agrees to sell such Holder's New Debentures on the basis reasonably provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the persons entitled hereunder to approve such arrangements, and (ii) completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements.
The Company has not, as of the date hereof, entered into, nor shall it on or after the date hereof, enter into, any agreement with respect to any of its securities that is inconsistent with the rights granted to the Holders herein or that otherwise conflicts with the provisions hereof.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a waiver or consent to departure from the provisions hereof with respect to a matter that relates exclusively to the rights of Holders whose securities are being sold pursuant to a Registration Statement and that does not directly or indirectly affect the rights of other Holders may alternatively be given by the Majority Holders of the New Debentures or Exchange Debentures, as the case may be, being sold rather than registered under such Registration Statement.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1

ADM conducted these Exchange Offers to take advantage of lower interest rates by replacing existing higher-coupon debt with lower-coupon debt.
According to information provided by D.F. King & Co., Inc., the exchange agent for the Exchange Offers, $403,786,000 in aggregate principal amount of ADM's Old Debentures were validly tendered and not validly withdrawn in the Exchange Offers. The settlement date for Old Debentures validly tendered and not validly withdrawn after the expiration of the early participation period at 5:00 p.m. New York City time on September 23, 2011, but at or prior to the Expiration Date, is expected to be October 7, 2011.
The table below indicates the outstanding principal amount of each series of Old Debentures at commencement of the Exchange Offers and the principal amount of each series of Old Debentures validly tendered for exchange as of the Expiration Date pursuant to the Exchange Offers:
 
The New Debentures will pay interest semi-annually at a rate of 4.535% per annum. The New Debentures have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended ("Securities Act") or any state securities laws. Therefore, the New Debentures may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and any applicable state securities laws. On September 26, 2011, ADM entered into a registration rights agreement with respect to the New Debentures.
This press release is not an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any security. The Exchange Offers are being made solely by the offering memorandum and related letter of transmittal and only to such persons and in such jurisdictions as is permitted under applicable law.
Forward-looking information

The reader is cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements. Other risks that could impact the offering are described in detail in the ADM Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011, as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

DECATUR, Ill., Nov. 1, 2011  Archer Daniels Midland Company (NYSE: ADM) today reported financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2011. The company reported net earnings for the quarter of $460 million, or $0.68 per share, up 33 percent and 26 percent respectively from the same period one year earlier. Adjusted earnings per sharewhich excludes the impact of LIFO and other adjustmentsof $0.58 was 13 percent lower than the prior year quarter. Segment operating profit was $699 million, down 9 percent from the prior year quarter.

1
The first quarter presented a difficult and challenging market environment, said ADM Chairman and CEO Patricia Woertz. Margin conditions in our global oilseeds segment were generally weak, and net corn costs were high. We offset some of these pressures with good management of our commodity positions and by capturing opportunities through our broad and diverse portfolio.
During the quarter, we acquired oilseeds facilities in Poland and India, and expanded our agricultural services operations to support exports. And we returned capital to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks of $347 million, added Woertz. Looking ahead, we see the margin environment modestly improving, and we are optimistic about the long term.
First Quarter 2012 Highlights
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Non-GAAP financial measures, see pages 5 and 10 for explanations and reconciliations
1
 
 
 
Adjusted EPS of 58 Cents, down 9 Cents
Adjusted EPS declined primarily as segment operating profit was lower by $66 million ($46 million, after tax, or $0.07 per share). Additionally, a higher outstanding share balance resulted in a dilutive impact of $0.04 per share. Corporate costs this quarter were similar to last years quarter, after excluding the impacts of LIFO, losses on interest rate swaps, and debt exchange costs.
The companys effective income tax rate for the quarter was 30 percent, based on the forecast geographic mix of earnings for fiscal year 2012.
Diversity of Oilseeds Portfolio Mitigates Challenging Margin Environment
Oilseeds operating profit in the first quarter was $221 million, down $87 million from the same period one year earlier.
Crushing and origination operating profit fell $61 million to $115 million. A weak margin environment for global soybean crushing and European rapeseed crushing depressed earnings. That impact was mitigated by stronger results from ADMs North American softseed businesses and South American origination.
Refining, packaging, biodiesel and other generated a profit of $49 million for the quarter, down
$27 million, as good North American biodiesel demand and strong volumes and margins of protein specialty products offset lower results from South America and Europe.
Oilseeds results in Asia for the quarter were in line with last year, principally reflecting ADMs share of the results from equity investee Wilmar International Limited.
Additional highlights from the quarter include:
Corn Processing Portfolio Demand Remains Solid; Earnings Impacted by Higher Net Corn Costs
 
Corn processing operating profit was $179 million, down $162 million from the same period one year earlier. Processed volumes were up 5 percent, though overall net corn costs more than doubled from the first quarter of last year.
Sweeteners and starches operating profit decreased $118 million to $28 million, as higher net corn costs more than offset higher average selling prices and sales volumes. Export demand for sweeteners remained strong. Net corn costs for sweeteners and starches were negatively impacted by corn futures economic hedging benefits recognized in prior quarters.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Bioproducts profit in the quarter decreased $44 million to $151 million. Lysine and spot ethanol margins in the quarter were good. Offsetting the margin benefit, ADM ownership gains were lower than the prior year.
Agricultural Services Benefitted by Capturing Global Merchandising Opportunities
Agricultural Services operating profit was $244 million, up $112 million from the same period one year earlier.
Merchandising and handling earnings increased primarily due to stronger global merchandising results, including a strong recovery of exports from the Black Sea region.
Earnings from transportation operations were steady despite lower U.S. grain export volumes.
Additional highlights from the quarter include:
Other Businesses Improve on Stronger Cocoa Press Margins, While Timing Adjustments Impacted Results
In the first quarter, profit from ADMs Other business units was $55 million, up $71 million from the same period one year earlier.
In other processing, which includes wheat milling, cocoa and ADMs equity share of Gruma, S.A.B. de C.V., profits rose $33 million to $59 million, on stronger cocoa press margins. Wheat milling results remained strong. Results in the segment were negatively impacted by $58 million in mark-to-market net timing adjustments in cocoa. Last years results were impacted by a similar amount of net timing adjustments.
Other financial increased $38 million mainly due to improved results of ADMs captive insurance subsidiary. This quarter, ADM completed the sale of a majority stake of Hickory Point Bank, FSB.
Current Landscape Assessment
The U.S. harvest is nearing completion, with a smaller crop than last year. Global supply is adequate for soybeans and wheat, but tighter in corn. Global demand for crops and agricultural products continues to be solid. Global protein meal demand continues to grow, driven by emerging economies. U.S. corn sweetener capacity remains tight, driven by strong export demand. With positive blending economics, U.S. ethanol consumption remains at maximum blendable levels.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Ethanol spot margins should continue to be good in the near term. The company is contracting with corn sweetener customers and is optimistic for 2012 calendar year pricing and margins. There has been modest margin improvement in soybean and rapeseed crush, and ADM will continue to leverage the diversity and strength of its oilseed business portfolio. More of the worlds demand for agricultural commodities will be met with non-U.S. supply, and ADM will leverage its global asset base to help meet this demand.

Segment Operating Profit and Corporate Results
(unaudited)
A non-GAAP financial measure
Total segment operating profit is ADMs consolidated income from operations before income tax that includes interest expense of each segment relating to financing operating working capital. Management believes that segment operating profit is a useful measure of ADMs performance because it provides investors information about ADMs business unit performance excluding certain corporate overhead and impacts of its capital structure. Total segment operating profit is a non-GAAP financial measure and is not intended to replace earnings before income tax, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Total segment operating profit is not a measure of consolidated operating results under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to income before income taxes or any other measure of consolidated operating results under U.S. GAAP.

Adjusted EPS is ADMs fully diluted EPS after removal of the effect on EPS of certain specified items as more fully described above.

Exhibit 99.1
 
DECATUR, Ill., Jan. 11, 2012  Archer Daniels Midland Company (NYSE: ADM) announced today that it will streamline its organizational structure, reducing its global workforce to enhance the cost structure of the company. Approximately 1,000 positions, primarily salaried, will be eliminated, representing 3 percent of the company's total workforce worldwide. To help achieve this reduction, the company will offer a voluntary early retirement incentive in the U.S. ADM expects that these actions, in concert with other targeted cost reductions, will, when fully implemented, reduce its annual pre-tax expenses by more than $100 million.
"To ensure that we can continue to compete effectively in our global markets, we are taking actions to streamline our organization and achieve significant, sustained cost reductions," said Patricia Woertz, ADM chairman and chief executive officer. "These actions will help us enhance our productivity and earnings power."
The company hopes to achieve a significant portion of the position reductions through the voluntary retirement incentive and will offer severance and outplacement assistance to other affected employees.
In its fiscal 2012 third quarter, ADM expects to record a $50 million to $75 million pre-tax charge related to these actions. The company expects to begin benefiting from the cost reduction actions in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, with the full benefit recognized by the end of third quarter fiscal 2013.
"These decisions do not reflect on the talent or dedication of our ADM team," Woertz said. "They reflect our confidence that we can streamline our organization while maintaining our ability to grow profitability, as well as our commitment to customers and to operational excellence."

Exhibit 99.2
 
DECATUR, Ill., Jan. 12, 2012  Archer Daniels Midland Company (NYSE: ADM) announced today that ADM Polymer Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of ADM, will end its commercial alliance with Metabolix, Inc. on February 8, 2012. As a result of this decision, Telles LLC, the sales and marketing commercial alliance created to commercialize Mirel, a biobased plastic, will be dissolved, and Mirel production on behalf of Telles will end. Under the terms of their commercial alliance, ADM Polymer Corporation may provide PHA fermentation services for Metabolix during a three-year period following termination.
"We have analyzed our business portfolio, identifying areas that are not delivering sufficient results now or are not expected to deliver sufficient results within a reasonable timeframe," said Mark Bemis, president, Corn. "We have had a good working relationship with Metabolix, and the fermentation technology performed well at our facility. Unfortunately, uncertainty around projected capital and production costs, combined with the rate of market adoption, led to projected financial returns for ADM that are too uncertain. Therefore, we have decided to exit the business as permitted by the commercial alliance agreement with Metabolix."
ADM Polymer has been producing Mirel at ADM's integrated corn processing complex facility in Clinton, Iowa. There are currently approximately 90 full-time ADM Polymer employees at the Clinton polymer plant; in addition, there are a small number of ADM employees supporting the Telles sales and marketing efforts in Europe. ADM is currently evaluating the impact on staffing, and will make decisions on its needs as quickly as possible. For colleagues whose positions are affected, the company will offer severance packages, including outplacement services, and there may be opportunities for them to apply for positions at Clinton or other ADM facilities.
As a result of the change in circumstances and its decision to terminate the commercial alliance, ADM is evaluating other commercially viable uses for the fermentation assets in Clinton, but has not yet made any firm decision on alternative uses. As a result, ADM will record a one-time pretax charge in its second quarter of between $300 million and $360 million, primarily for impairment of the related production assets. ADM anticipates the cash portion of the total charge to be less than $5 million.

It was a tough quarter, said ADM Chairman and CEO Patricia Woertz. The operating environment was challenging. Ongoing weakness in global oilseeds margins, lower results in corn and poor international merchandising results hurt our second quarter profits.
We remain optimistic about the long-term fundamentals of our business and the growing earnings power of our company, added Woertz. We continue to execute our plan to drive shareholder value: prioritizing capital projects, implementing productivity measures and returning capital to shareholders through increased dividends and share buybacks.
Second Quarter 2012 Highlights
________________________
 
Non-GAAP financial measures, see pages 5 and 10 for explanations and reconciliations
1
 
 
 
 
Adjusted EPS of 51 Cents, down 69 Cents
Adjusted EPS declined primarily due to the decrease in segment operating profit. This was partially offset by lower corporate expenses.
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 31 percent, bringing the cumulative rate to 30 percent.
Weak Global Oilseeds Margin Environment Continues to Impact Earnings
Oilseeds operating profit in the second quarter was $253 million, down $72 million from the same period one year earlier.
Crushing and origination operating profit fell $61 million to $139 million. Continued weakness in global oilseeds crushing margins, particularly in Europe, reduced overall results. The prior years quarter reflected a $71 million pretax gain related to the acquisition of the controlling interest in Golden Peanut.In addition, last years results included significant, negative mark-to-market timing effects which were not repeated this year.
 
Refining, packaging, biodiesel and other generated a profit of $74 million for the quarter, essentially flat from year-ago levels.
Oilseeds results in Asia for the quarter were in line with last year, principally reflecting ADMs share of the results from its equity investee Wilmar International Limited.
Additional highlights from the quarter include:
Corn Processing Results Weaker, Reflecting PHA Impairment Charge
Corn processing reported an operating loss of $133 million, a decrease of $532 million from the same period one year earlier. The loss reflects $339 million in asset impairment charges related to the PHA renewable plastic production facility at Clinton, Iowa. Excluding the PHA impairment charges, corn processing operating profit of $206 million represented a $193 million reduction. Overall net corn costs were up, reflecting economic hedging benefits recognized in the prior year.
Sweeteners and starches operating profit decreased $46 million to $73 million. Export demand for sweeteners remained strong, though higher net corn costs more than offset higher average selling prices and increased sales volumes.
Page 2
 
 
 
Bioproducts results in the quarter decreased $486 million to a loss of $206 million, including the
$339 million PHA impairment charges and the absence of ownership gains from last year. Ethanol margins were good into December, when they declined significantly as industry production increased and exports declined.
Agricultural Services Down from Exceptionally
Strong Year-ago Quarter
Agricultural Services operating profit was $158 million, down $268 million from the exceptionally strong period one year earlier.
Merchandising and handling earnings decreased on poor international merchandising results and a reduction in U.S. grain exports from the prior years record levels. Earnings from transportation operations were steady.
Other Businesses Deliver Strong Results, Excluding Significant Mark-to-Market Timing Effects
In the second quarter, profit from ADMs Other businesses was $31 million, down $181 million from the same period one year earlier. Excluding net timing effects, the results in other processing were comparable to last years strong results.
In other processing, profits fell $150 million to $10 million. Results in the segment were impacted by $127 million in mark-to-market net timing losses in cocoa. Last years results reflected $23 million in net timing gains. The underlying performance in cocoa remained strong, driven by cocoa powder demand. Wheat milling results remained steady.
Other financial declined $31 million to $21 million on lower results of ADMs captive insurance subsidiary.
Current Landscape Assessment
Worldwide demand for crops and agricultural products continues to grow at a stable rate. The South American harvest is beginning and is expected to help maintain adequate global soybean supplies. With adequate global crop supplies and a smaller U.S. crop last year, the U.S. lost export volumes. Global protein meal demand continues to grow, led by Asia, but crush margins, while improved, remain weak. U.S. ethanol margins are weak, with excess production amid reduced exports. U.S. corn sweetener capacity remains tight, driven by strong export demand.

Segment Operating Profit and Corporate Results
(unaudited)
A non-GAAP financial measure
Total segment operating profit is ADMs consolidated income from operations before income tax that includes interest expense of each segment relating to financing operating working capital. Management believes that segment operating profit is a useful measure of ADMs performance because it provides investors information about ADMs business unit performance excluding certain corporate overhead and impacts of its capital structure. Total segment operating profit is a non-GAAP financial measure and is not intended to replace earnings before income tax, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Total segment operating profit is not a measure of consolidated operating results under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to income before income taxes or any other measure of consolidated operating results under U.S. GAAP.

On March 27, 2012, Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (the "Company"), as servicer, ADM Receivables, LLC, a wholly-owned bankruptcy-remote entity ("ADM Receivables"), as seller, Gotham Funding Corporation and Nieuw Amsterdam Receivables Corporation, as conduit purchasers, The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., New York Branch ("BTMU"), and Coperatieve Centrale Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank B.A., "Rabobank Nederland," New York Branch ("Rabobank"), as committed purchasers, BTMU and Rabobank, as co-program agents, BTMU and Rabobank, as purchaser agents, and BTMU, as collateral agent (the "Collateral Agent"), entered into an Amended and Restated Receivables Purchase Agreement (the "Receivables Purchase Agreement") amending and restating an agreement dated as of July 1, 2011.
The Receivables Purchase Agreement and related transaction documents provide a receivables securitization facility under which the Company and certain of its subsidiaries (the "Originators") may obtain up to $1.0 billion of funding against certain of their U.S.- originated accounts receivable (the "Receivables").
Under the securitization facility, the Originators sell the Receivables to ADM Receivables, which in turn may obtain funding from time to time from the conduit purchasers or the committed purchasers by requesting an initial purchase of its interests in the Receivables or, following an initial purchase, an additional capital payment. Upon an initial purchase, ADM Receivables transfers its interests in the Receivables to the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the funding purchasers, in exchange for amounts funded in cash together with deferred consideration payable only from collections of Receivables. Thereafter, interests in newly originated Receivables are generally transferred to the Collateral Agent on a daily basis; collections, after certain amounts are set aside for payment of "yield" and fees related to the facility, generally are paid to ADM Receivables in reduction of the deferred consideration and, in turn, to the Company and the other Originators in reduction of ADM Receivables' deferred obligation to pay the purchase price for the Receivables. In addition, collections will be applied, on a priority basis pursuant to the terms of the Receivables Purchase Agreement, to reduce amounts funded by the purchasers, from time to time at the request of ADM Receivables or upon termination of the securitization facility. The facility is subject to reserve requirements and termination events that are customary for such a facility.
Receivable balances related to this accounts receivable securitization facility had previously been reported as trade receivables in the Company's consolidated balance sheets. On March 27, 2012, the transaction documents were amended in such a way that, if funding is obtained under the facility, those receivable balances generally will no longer be reported as trade receivables in the Company's consolidated balance sheets.
The facility will terminate on June 29, 2012 unless extended by the parties.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

The company reported net earnings for the quarter of $399 million, or $0.60 per share, down 31 percent and 30 percent respectively from the same period one year earlier.

This quarter, we delivered very good results despite difficult margin environments, particularly in ethanol and European oilseeds, said ADM Chairman and CEO Patricia Woertz. The strong third quarter last year set a high bar, and this quarter represents a solid performance by the team.
Looking ahead, planting is underway in North America, and were encouraged by the projected corn and soybean acreage, added Woertz. Meanwhile, we continue to leverage our global origination, processing and transportation network to deliver products to our customers and returns to our shareholders.
Third Quarter 2012 Highlights
 
Non-GAAP financial measures, see pages 5 and 10 for explanations and reconciliations
1
 
 
 
 
Adjusted EPS of 78 Cents, down 11 Cents
Adjusted EPS decreased primarily due to lower segment operating profit, partially offset by lower corporate expenses.
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 29 percent, resulting in a cumulative rate of 30 percent.
Oilseeds Earnings Comparable Absent Timing Effects
Oilseeds operating profit in the third quarter was $395 million, down $117 million from the same period one year earlier. Excluding last years significant, positive mark-to-market timing effects, operating profit was comparable.
Crushing and origination operating profit was $271 million. Improved results in North and South America significantly offset continued weakness in Europe. Tight South American crop supplies led to increased soybean meal exports from North America. And, in South America, favorable positioning and increased farmer selling led to good grain origination results.
Refining, packaging, biodiesel and other generated a profit of $75 million for the quarter, down
$14 million on weaker biodiesel results from North and South America.
Oilseeds results in Asia for the quarter were up $31 million over the prior years third quarter, principally reflecting ADMs share of the results from its equity investee Wilmar International Limited.
Corn Processing Results Weaker on Poor Ethanol Margins
Corn processing operating profit was $130 million, a decrease of $74 million from the same period one year earlier.
Sweeteners and starches operating profit increased $47 million to $93 million. Export demand for sweeteners remained strong, and average selling prices rose as new sweetener contracts came into effect through the quarter.
Bioproducts results in the quarter decreased $121 million to $37 million. Ethanol margins remained weak through the quarter, amid excess industry production that lessened through the quarter. Results also reflect a $14 million charge related to the closure of ADMs 30 million gallon per year ethanol dry mill at Walhalla, N.D.

Agricultural Services Results Stable, Reflecting Balanced Footprint
Agricultural Services operating profit was $179 million, up $8 million from the same period one year earlier.
Merchandising and handling earnings were essentially flat. ADMs Black Sea and other international merchandising operations saw good volumes and margins, while North American grain export volumes were down due to low U.S. crop inventories. Earnings from transportation operations rose $7 million.
Other Results Steady, Excluding Timing Effects, with Other Processing Remaining Strong
In the third quarter, profit from ADMs Other businesses was $183 million, up $64 million from the same period one year earlier. Excluding net timing effects, the results in Other were comparable to last years results.
In other processing, profits rose $105 million to $201 million. Cocoa results this quarter were impacted by $72 million in mark-to-market timing gains. The underlying performance in cocoa remained strong, driven by good cocoa press margins. Wheat milling results, including ADMs share of Gruma S.A.B. de C.V., were essentially flat.
Other financial declined $41 million to a loss of $18 million due to loss reserves at ADMs captive insurance subsidiary related to crop risk and property claims.
Current Landscape Assessment
Worldwide demand for crops and agricultural products continues to grow at a stable rate. Global supplies of corn and soybeans should tighten until the North American harvest. As the South American harvest is coming into the market, U.S. oilseed processing rates and soybean meal exports are returning to seasonal levels. Depressed U.S. ethanol margins have slowed industry production, improving alignment of supply and demand. U.S. corn wet milling demand remains strong, led by sweetener exports.

Segment Operating Profit and Corporate Results
(unaudited)
A non-GAAP financial measure
Total segment operating profit is ADMs consolidated income from operations before income tax that includes interest expense of each segment relating to financing operating working capital. Management believes that segment operating profit is a useful measure of ADMs performance because it provides investors information about ADMs business unit performance excluding certain corporate overhead costs and impacts of its capital structure. Total segment operating profit is a non-GAAP financial measure and is not intended to replace earnings before income tax, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Total segment operating profit is not a measure of consolidated operating results under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to income before income taxes or any other measure of consolidated operating results under U.S. GAAP.

On May 3, 2012, the Board of Directors of Archer Daniels Midland Company (the "Company") determined, in accordance with the Company's Bylaws and upon the recommendation of the Audit Committee, that the Company's fiscal year shall begin on January 1 and end on December 31 of each year, starting on January 1, 2013. The Company's current fiscal year will end on June 30, 2012, and the transition period of July 1, 2012 to December 31, 2012 will be covered on a Form 10-K.

Exhibit 99.1
 
DECATUR, Ill., May 3, 2012  Archer Daniels Midland Company's (NYSE: ADM) Board of Directors today approved a change to calendar-year financial reporting, effective Jan. 1, 2013. Historically, ADM has operated on a June 30 fiscal year-end, primarily driven by the U.S. crop year. To accommodate the change, ADM will have an abbreviated fiscal year from July 1, 2012, to Dec. 31, 2012.
"As ADM has become more global in its operations, much of our statutory and tax reporting and many of our business contracts are tied to the calendar year," said ADM Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Ray Young. "Moving to calendar-year reporting will help streamline internal processes and eliminate redundancy and waste."
Cash Dividend Declared
ADM's Board of Directors also declared a cash dividend of 17.5 cents per share on the company's common stock payable June 7, 2012, to stockholders of record May 17, 2012.
This is ADM's 322nd consecutive quarterly payment, a record of 80 years of uninterrupted dividends. As of March 31, 2012, there were 659,868,382 shares of ADM common stock outstanding.

, Smith and the Company have reached an agreement in regard to Smith ceasing to be an active employee and an officer of the Company as set forth in this Agreement.
WHEREAS
, in consideration of the premises, the covenants as set forth in this Agreement, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:
NOW, THEREFORE
1. Smith shall resign as an officer of the Company and retire as an employee effective December 31, 2012, unless Smith's employment is earlier terminated by the Company for "Cause" as defined in Paragraph 14 below. The Company shall continue to pay Smith his base salary as of the date of this Agreement through the date of his separation from employment and Smith shall continue to participate in all applicable benefit plans of the Company in accordance with their respective terms.

Smith acknowledges that he will not be entitled to receive any form of unemployment compensation or benefits. While employed by the Company, Smith will be available to the Company to provide transition assistance, and to provide such advice, expertise, or knowledge with respect to his prior duties or other matters in which he was involved, as may be requested by the Company. Smith shall devote such time, attention, skill and efforts as necessary to the faithful performance of such duties in a professional, diligent, trustworthy and businesslike manner. In addition, Smith will timely execute and deliver such acknowledgments, instruments, certificates, and other ministerial documents (including without limitation, certification as to specific actions performed by Smith in his capacity as an officer of the Company) as may be necessary or appropriate to formalize and complete the applicable corporate records. It is anticipated by both the Company and Smith that Smith will provide services through December 31, 2012 in excess of twenty percent (20%) of his average level of services for the Company over the past thirty-six (36) months.
2. At the same time Smith signs this Agreement, Smith shall execute a Release of Claims in the form of Exhibit A, attached hereto and by this reference incorporated herein (the "First Release").

3. . Without the prior written consent of the Company, which consent must be signed by the Chief Executive Officer, while Smith remains employed by the Company and for a period of one (1) year commencing on the termination of Smith's employment with the Company, Smith shall not take any employment, or serve as a director, officer, consultant, advisor, agent, or in any other capacity whatsoever, directly or indirectly, with (i) Cargill, Inc.; Bunge Ltd.; Corn Products International; Tate & Lyle PLC; Louis Dreyfus SAS; Wilmar International, Ltd.; Gavilon LLC; Viterra; or any division, subsidiary, partnership, venture (regardless of the form of entity), or successor of or to any of the above-named companies; or (ii) any other person, corporation, partnership, limited liability company, or venture (regardless of the form of entity) anywhere in the world that competes with the Company or with any entity controlled by the Company and is engaged in the buying, selling or trading of physical agricultural commodities or products.

7.

ADM Reports Fourth Quarter 2012 Earnings of $284 Million or $0.43 per Share
Adjusted EPS of $0.38, down from year-ago quarter
Segment operating profit declined on negative ethanol margins and weaker Ag Services results
For the full fiscal year, dividends and share repurchases of nearly $1 billion
DECATUR, Ill., July 31, 2012  Archer Daniels Midland Company (NYSE: ADM) today reported financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2012. The company reported net earnings for the quarter of $284 million, or $0.43 per share, down from $0.58 per share in the same period one year earlier. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.38. Segment operating profit was $544 million.

For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012, net earnings were $1.2 billion, or $1.84 per share. Adjusted earnings per share were $2.25. Segment operating profit was $2.5 billion.
In a challenging fourth quarter, solid results from our global oilseeds business, particularly in South America, were more than offset by negative U.S. ethanol margins and weaker U.S. merchandising results, said ADM Chairman and CEO Patricia Woertz.
 
As we look ahead, while drought has reduced the potential size of the U.S. corn crop, we are tracking the development of other crops in North America and Europe, added Woertz. While U.S. crop carryouts are expected to be low, we have an experienced business team to manage through this environment.
Conditions like these demonstrate the vital role of our global agribusiness. As weather has regional effects on crops, we respond by working with our customers to provide the best alternatives to meet their needs from all growing regions of the world.
Fourth Quarter 2012 Highlights
 
 
 
   
   
   
   
 
Non-GAAP financial measures, see pages 5 and 12 for explanations and reconciliations
1
 
 
 
 
Adjusted EPS of 38 Cents, down 31 Cents
Adjusted EPS decreased primarily due to lower segment operating profit, partially offset by lower corporate expenses.
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 30 percent, resulting in an annual rate of 30 percent.
Oilseeds Earnings Down on Absence of Year-Ago Timing Gains and Weakness in Cocoa and Other
Oilseeds operating profit in the fourth quarter was $331 million, down $118 million from the same period one year earlier.
Crushing and origination operating profit was $150 million, down $76 million from the year-ago quarter. Significantly improved South American soybean and origination results were offset by lower North American softseeds crushing margins, and the absence of favorable mark-to-market timing effects in Europe that benefited the prior year. The net decrease in results from timing effects was approximately $70 million.
Refining, packaging, biodiesel and other generated a profit of $84 million for the quarter, down 
$6 million mainly on weaker biodiesel results from Europe.
Cocoa and other results declined $19 million, primarily due to weaker cocoa press margins in the quarter.
Oilseeds results in Asia for the quarter were down $17 million from the prior years fourth quarter, principally reflecting ADMs share of the results from its equity investee Wilmar International Limited.
Corn Processing Results Lower on Negative Ethanol Margins
Corn processing operating profit was $74 million, a decrease of $48 million from the same period one year earlier.
Sweeteners and starches operating profit increased $124 million to $135 million, amid continued good sweetener export demand and higher average selling prices. The year-ago quarters results were negatively impacted by higher net corn costs related to the timing effects of economic hedges, whose mark-to-market gains were recognized earlier in the fiscal year.
Bioproducts results in the quarter decreased $172 million to a loss of $61 million. Significantly weaker ethanol results more than offset improvements in other bioproducts businesses. Industry ethanol replacement margins were negative throughout the quarter, as the industry supply continued to exceed demand.
 
 
 
 
Agricultural Services Results Fall on Lower U.S. Exports
Agricultural Services operating profit was $123 million, down $222 million from the same period one year earlier.
Merchandising and handling earnings fell $152 million to $30 million due to lower U.S. merchandising results and lower U.S. crop supplies, which reduced North American export volumes. Results for the quarter also reflected an increase in loss provisions of approximately $40 million.
Transportation results increased $5 million to $17 million.
Excluding last years $78 million gain related to ADMs share of Gruma S.A.B. de C.V.s sale of assets, Milling and other results were steady.
Other Financial Results Slightly Up
In the fourth quarter, operating profit from ADMs Other Financial businesses was $16 million, up $11 million from the same period one year earlier. The improvement was primarily a result of lower captive insurance loss reserves, and better results at ADM Investor Services.
Current Landscape Assessment
The smaller South American spring harvest means that the U.S. is currently the primary global supplier of soybeans and meal. U.S. corn and soybean yields have been reduced by drought; wheat was less affected. Generally high crop prices will encourage large planted acreage in South America. Global protein meal demand remains good. Poor margins have lowered U.S. ethanol industry production which is reducing inventories. Demand for corn sweeteners remains solid, supported by exports.

Segment Operating Profit and Corporate Results
(1)
(unaudited)
A non-GAAP financial measure
 
 
Total segment operating profit is ADMs consolidated income from operations before income tax that excludes certain corporate items. Management believes that segment operating profit is a useful measure of ADMs performance because it provides investors information about ADMs business unit performance excluding certain corporate overhead costs. Total segment operating profit is a non-GAAP financial measure and is not intended to replace earnings before income tax, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Total segment operating profit is not a measure of consolidated operating results under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to income before income taxes or any other measure of consolidated operating results under U.S. GAAP.
(1) Beginning fourth quarter fiscal 2012, ADM realigned segment operating profit to reflect a change in how the company manages its businesses.  As a result, ADM now reports Cocoa processing results as part of a new category in Oilseeds called Cocoa and Other and Milling results in an Agricultural Services category called Milling and Other.  In addition, beginning fourth quarter fiscal 2012, the company discontinued the allocation of working capital interest to the operating segments.  Prior periods have been restated to conform to the current period presentation.

Management believes that Adjusted EPS is a useful measure of ADMs performance because it provides investors additional information about ADMs operations allowing better evaluation of ongoing business performance. Adjusted EPS is a non-GAAP financial measure and is not intended to replace or be an alternative to EPS, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, or any other measures of operating results under GAAP. Earnings amounts in the tables above have been divided by the companys diluted shares outstanding for each respective quarter in order to arrive at an adjusted EPS amount for each specified item.

The Exchange Offers are being conducted by ADM upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in a confidential offering memorandum, dated September 14, 2012, and related letter of transmittal. The Exchange Offers are only extended, and copies of the offering documents will only be made available, to any holder of the Old Debentures that has certified its status as (1) a "qualified institutional buyer" as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended ("Securities Act") or (2) a person who is not a "U.S. person" as defined in Regulation S under the Securities Act (each, an "Eligible Holder").
The Old Debentures will be accepted for exchange up to the Exchange Limit based on the acceptance priority level for each series as specified in the offering documents.
ADM is undertaking the offer to exchange higher coupon debt for lower coupon debt and additional consideration.
The Exchange Offers are subject to certain conditions, including the requirement that a sufficient principal amount of Old Debentures has been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn such that a minimum of $250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of New Debentures will be issuable in exchange for such Old Debentures on the Settlement Date (as defined below) and that the yield on the Reference Treasury (as defined below) is not less than 2.5% or more than 3.6% at the Pricing Time, which is 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on September 27, 2012 (subject to extension by ADM), except that in the case of the Exchange Offer for the 6.95% Debentures due 2097, the yield on the Reference Treasury may not be less than 2.67% or more than 3.34% at the Pricing Time. The "Settlement Date" will be promptly after the Expiration Date, which is 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on October 12, 2012 (subject to extension by ADM), and is expected to be on the second business day after the Expiration Date. The "Reference Treasury" is the 3.00% United States Treasury due May 15, 2042.
Subject to the Exchange Limit, Eligible Holders who validly tender and who do not validly withdraw their Old Debentures prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on September 27, 2012, subject to any extension by ADM, will be eligible to receive an early participation premium equal to $30 per $1,000 principal amount of Old Debentures.

The New Debentures have not been registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws. Therefore, the New Debentures may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and any applicable state securities laws. The Company will enter into a registration rights agreement with respect to the New Debentures.
Documents relating to the Exchange Offers will only be distributed to holders of the Old Debentures that complete and return a certification of eligibility confirming that they are Eligible Holders.

Item 7.01. Regulation FD Disclosure.
On September 20, 2012, Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (the "Company") amended its U.S. qualified pension plans and began notifying certain former employees of the Company of its offer to pay those employees' pension benefit in a lump sum. Former employees eligible for the voluntary lump sum payment option are generally those who are vested traditional formula participants of the U.S. qualified pension plans who terminated employment prior to August 1, 2012 and who have not yet started receiving monthly payments of their pension benefits.
The Company is offering the one-time voluntary lump sum window in an effort to reduce its long-term pension obligations and ongoing annual pension expense. The Company estimates that, depending on participation rates estimated at 50% to 75%, the voluntary lump sum payments, to be paid from plan assets, could reduce its global pension benefit obligation by approximately $140-$210 million and improve its pension underfunding by approximately $35-$55 million. The Company estimates that it will also have to incur a non-cash income statement charge of approximately $45-$65 million pre-tax in the quarter ending December 31, 2012 as a result of the requirement to expense the unrealized actuarial losses currently recognized as accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) that relate to the liabilities settled at December 31, 2012. The Company expects ongoing pension expense to be reduced by $4-$5 million pre-tax on an annual basis. Actual participation rates and payout amounts will not be known until December 2012.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

On October 15, 2012, Archer-Daniels-Midland Company ("ADM") issued a press release announcing the final results of its private exchange offers.
On October 16, 2012, ADM issued $570,425,000 aggregate principal amount of 4.016% Debentures due 2043 (the "New Debentures") in exchange for specified series of ADM's outstanding debt securities, in connection with the expiration of its previously announced exchange offers. The New Debentures were issued to qualified institutional buyers ("QIBs") pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and to non-U.S. persons in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act.
The New Debentures were issued under an indenture, dated as of October 16, 2012, between ADM and The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee (the "Indenture"), attached as Exhibit 4.1 hereto. The New Debentures will pay interest on April 16 and October 16 of each year, beginning April 16, 2013, at a rate of 4.016% per annum. The New Debentures are ADM's senior obligations and rank equally with all of its other unsecured indebtedness. The New Debentures are subject to optional redemption prior to maturity. The New Debentures issuable to QIBs in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act were issued in the form of registered global securities in the form of debentures attached as Exhibit 4.2 hereto (the "Rule 144A Global Debenture"), and the New Debentures issuable to non-U.S. persons pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act were issued in the form of registered global securities in the form of debentures attached as Exhibit 4.3 hereto (the "Regulation S Global Debenture"). The description of the Indenture and the New Debentures contained herein is qualified by reference to the terms of the Indenture and form of Rule 144A Global Debenture and form of Regulation S Global Debenture, respectively.
On October 16, 2012, in connection with the issuance of the New Debentures, ADM entered into a registration rights agreement (the "Registration Rights Agreement") with the dealer managers for the exchange offers named therein. Under the Registration Rights Agreement, ADM has agreed to file an exchange offer registration statement with the Securities Exchange Commission (the "SEC") to allow holders of the New Debentures to exchange such New Debentures for an equal principal amount of debentures with substantially identical terms, except that they will generally be freely transferable under the Securities Act. In addition, ADM has agreed pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, under certain circumstances, to file a shelf registration statement with the SEC to cover resales of the New Debentures. If ADM fails to satisfy these obligations, it will be required to pay additional interest as liquidated damages to the holders of the New Debentures. The Registration Rights Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.4, and the description of the Registration Rights Agreement contained herein is qualified by reference thereto.
The New Debentures have not been registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws. Therefore, the New Debentures may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and any applicable state securities laws. This report on Form 8-K does not constitute an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy, any security and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offering would be unlawful.

Neither the failure to give notice by publication to Holders of Bearer Securities as provided above, nor any defect in any notice so published, shall affect the sufficiency of any notice to Holders of Registered Securities given as provided herein.
Where this Indenture provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by the Person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by Holders of Securities shall be filed with the Trustee, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver.

SECTION 115. Legal Holidays.
In any case where any Interest Payment Date, Redemption Date or Stated Maturity Date of any Security shall not be a Business Day at any Place of Payment, then (notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture or of the Securities or Coupons other than a provision in the Securities of any series which specifically states that such provision shall apply in lieu of this Section) payment of interest or principal (and premium, if any) need not be made at such Place of Payment on such date, but may be made on the next succeeding Business Day at such Place of Payment with the same force and effect as if made on the Interest Payment Date or Redemption Date, or at the Stated Maturity Date, provided that no interest shall accrue on the amount so payable for the period from and after such Interest Payment Date, Redemption Date or Stated Maturity Date, as the case may be.
SECTION 116. Counterparts.
This Indenture may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which so executed shall be deemed to be an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same Indenture.

The Registered Securities, if any, of each series and the Bearer Securities, if any, of each series and related Coupons shall be in substantially the forms established by or pursuant to a Board Resolution or in one or more indentures supplemental hereto, in each case with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as are required or permitted by this Indenture, and may have such letters, numbers or other marks of identification and such legends or endorsements placed thereon as may be required to comply with the rules of any securities exchange or as may, consistently herewith, be determined by the officers executing
 
such Securities or Coupons, as evidenced by their execution of the Securities or Coupons. If temporary Securities of any series are issued in global form as permitted by Section 304, the form thereof shall be established as provided in the preceding sentence. If the forms of Securities or Coupons of any series (or any such temporary global Security) are established by action taken pursuant to a Board Resolution, a copy of an appropriate record of such action shall be certified by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Company and delivered to the Trustee at or prior to the delivery of the Company Order contemplated by Section 303 for the authentication and delivery of such Securities (or any such temporary global Security) or Coupons.
Unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301, Bearer Securities shall have Coupons attached.
The definitive Securities and Coupons, if any, shall be printed, lithographed or engraved on steel engraved borders or may be produced in any other manner, all as determined by the officers executing such Securities, as evidenced by their execution of such Securities or Coupons.
SECTION 202. Form of Trustee's Certificate of Authentication.
The Trustee's certificates of authentication shall be in substantially the following form:
This is one of the Securities of the series designated herein and referred to in the within mentioned Indenture.
 
SECTION 203. Securities in Global Form.
If Securities of a series are issuable in global form, as specified as contemplated by Section 301, then, notwithstanding clause (10) of Section 301 and the provisions of Section 302, any such Security shall represent such of the Outstanding Securities of such series as shall be specified therein and may provide that it shall represent the aggregate amount of Outstanding Securities from time to time endorsed thereon and that the aggregate amount of Outstanding Securities represented thereby may from time to time be reduced to reflect exchanges. Any endorsement of a Security in global form to reflect the amount, or any increase or decrease in the amount, of Outstanding Securities represented thereby shall be made by the Trustee in such manner and upon instructions given by such Person or Persons as shall be specified therein or in the Company Order to be delivered to the Trustee pursuant to Section 303 or Section 304. Subject to the provisions of Section 303 and, if applicable, Section 304, the Trustee shall deliver
 
and redeliver any Security in permanent global form in the manner and upon instructions given by the Person or Persons specified therein or in the applicable Company Order. If a Company Order pursuant to Section 303 or 304 has been, or simultaneously is, delivered, any instructions by the Company with respect to endorsement or delivery or redelivery of a Security in global form shall be in writing but need not comply with Section 102 and need not be accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel.
The provisions of the last sentence of Section 303 shall apply to any Security represented by a Security in global form if such Security was never issued and sold by the Company and the Company delivers to the Trustee the Security in global form together with written instructions (which need not comply with Section 102 and need not be accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel) with regard to the reduction in the principal amount of Securities represented thereby, together with the written statement contemplated by the last sentence of Section 303.
Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 201 and 307, unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301, payment of principal of and any premium and interest on any Security in permanent global form shall be made to the Person or Persons specified therein.
SECTION 301. Amount Unlimited; Issuable in Series.
The aggregate principal amount of Securities which may be authenticated and delivered under this Indenture is unlimited.
The Securities may be issued in one or more series. There shall be established in or pursuant to a Board Resolution and, subject to Section 303, set forth, or determined in the manner provided, in an Officers' Certificate (which shall comply with Section 102), or established in one or more indentures supplemental hereto, prior to the issuance of Securities of any series:

of interests in any such permanent global Security may exchange such interests for Securities of such series and of like tenor of any authorized form and denomination and the circumstances under which any such exchanges may occur, if other than in the manner provided in Section 305, and (ii) the name of the Common Depositary (as defined in Section 304) or the U.S. Depositary, as the case may be, with respect to any global Security;
(4) the Person to whom any interest on any Registered Security of the series shall be payable, if other than the Person in whose name that Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest, the manner in which, or the Person to whom, any interest on any Bearer Security of the series shall be payable, if otherwise than upon presentation and surrender of the Coupons appertaining thereto as they severally mature, and the extent to which, or the manner in which, any interest payable on a temporary global Security on an Interest Payment Date will be paid if other than in the manner provided in Section 304;
(5) the date or dates on which the principal of the Securities of the series is payable and whether such date or dates may be extended at the option of the Company;
(6) the rate or rates (or formula for determining such rate or rates) at which the Securities of the series shall bear interest, if any, the date or dates from which any such interest shall accrue, the Interest Payment Dates on which any such interest shall be payable, the Regular Record Date for any interest payable on any Registered Securities on any Interest Payment Date and the circumstances, if any, in which the Company may defer interest payments;
(7) whether the interest rate or interest rate formula, as the case may be, for Securities of the series may be reset at the option of the Company and, if so, the date or dates on which such interest rate or interest rate formula, as the case may be, may be reset;
(8) the place or places where, subject to the provisions of Section 1002, the principal of and any premium and interest on Securities of the series shall be payable, any Registered Securities of the series may be surrendered for registration of transfer, Securities of the series may be surrendered for exchange and notices and demands to or upon the Company in respect of the Securities of the series and this Indenture may be served;
(9) the period or periods within which, the price or prices at which and the terms and conditions upon which Securities of the series may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at the option of the Company or repaid at the option of the Holders;
(10) the obligation, if any, of the Company to redeem or purchase Securities of the series pursuant to any sinking fund or analogous provisions or at the option of a Holder thereof, and the period or periods within which, the price or prices at which and the terms and conditions upon which Securities of the series shall be redeemed or purchased, in whole or in part, pursuant to such obligation;
 
(11) the denominations in which any Registered Securities of the series shall be issuable, if other than denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof, and the denomination or denominations in which any Bearer Securities of the series shall be issuable, if other than the denomination of $5,000;
(12) the currency or currencies, including composite currencies, in which payment of the principal of and any premium and interest on the Securities of the series shall be payable if other than the currency of the United States;
(13) if the amount of payments of principal of and any premium or interest on the Securities of the series may be determined with reference to an index, the manner in which such amounts shall be determined;

All Securities of any one series and the Coupons appertaining to any Bearer Securities of such series shall be substantially identical except, in the case of Registered Securities, as to denomination and except as may otherwise be provided in or pursuant to the Board Resolution referred to above and (subject to Section 303) set forth in the Officers' Certificate referred to above or in any such indenture supplemental hereto.
If any of the terms of the series are established by action taken pursuant to a Board Resolution, a copy of an appropriate record of such action shall be certified by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Company and delivered to the Trustee at or prior to the delivery of the Officers' Certificate setting forth the terms of the series.
Notwithstanding Section 301(2) herein and unless otherwise expressly provided with respect to a series of Securities, the aggregate principal amount of a series of Securities may be increased and additional Securities of such series may be issued up to the maximum aggregate principal amount authorized with respect to such series as increased.
SECTION 302. Denominations.
Unless otherwise provided as contemplated by Section 301 with respect to any series of Securities, any Registered Securities of a series shall be issuable in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof and any Bearer Securities of a series shall be issuable in the denomination of $5,000.
 
SECTION 303. Execution, Authentication, Delivery and Dating.
The Securities shall be executed on behalf of the Company by its Chairman of the Board, a Vice Chairman of the Board, its President or one of its Vice Presidents, under its corporate seal reproduced thereon attested by its Secretary or one of its Assistant Secretaries. The signature of any of these officers on the Securities may be manual or facsimile. Coupons shall bear the facsimile signature of the Treasurer or any Assistant Treasurer of the Company.
Securities and Coupons bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of individuals who were at any time the proper officers of the Company shall bind the Company, notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them have ceased to hold such offices prior to the authentication and delivery of such Securities or did not hold such offices at the date of such Securities.
At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this Indenture, the Company may deliver Securities of any series, together with any Coupons appertaining thereto, executed by the Company to the Trustee for authentication, together with a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of such Securities, and the Trustee in accordance with the Company Order shall authenticate and deliver such Securities; that, in connection with its original issuance, no Bearer Security shall be mailed or otherwise delivered to any location in the United States; and that a Bearer Security may be delivered in connection with its original issuance only if the Person entitled to receive such Bearer Security shall have furnished a certificate in the form designated by the Company pursuant to Section 301, dated no earlier than 15 days prior to the earlier of the date on which such Bearer Security is delivered and the date on which any temporary Security first becomes exchangeable for such Bearer Security in accordance with the terms of such temporary Security and this Indenture. If any Security shall be represented by a permanent global Bearer Security, then, for purposes of this Section and Section 304, the notation of a beneficial owner's interest therein upon original issuance of such Security or upon exchange of a portion of a temporary global Security shall be deemed to be delivery in connection with its original issuance of such beneficial owner's interest in such permanent global Security. Except as permitted by Section 304 or 306, the Trustee shall not authenticate and deliver any Bearer Security unless all appurtenant Coupons then matured have been detached and cancelled.
provided, however,
provided, further,
If the forms or terms of the Securities of the series and any related Coupons have been established in or pursuant to one or more Board Resolutions as permitted by Sections 201 and 301, in authenticating such Securities, and accepting the additional responsibilities under this Indenture in relation to such Securities, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive, and (subject to Section 601) shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel stating:
(a) if the forms of such Securities and any Coupons have been established by or pursuant to Board Resolution as permitted by Section 201, that such forms have been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture;
(b) if the terms of such Securities and any Coupons have been established by or pursuant to Board Resolution as permitted by Section 301, that such terms have been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture;
 
(c) that such Securities, together with any Coupons appertaining thereto, when authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and issued by the Company in the manner and subject to any conditions specified in such Opinion of Counsel, will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company, enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject, as to enforcement, to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization and other laws of general applicability relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights and to general equity principles; and
(d) such other matters as the Trustee may reasonably request.
If such forms or terms have been so established, the Trustee shall not be required to authenticate such Securities if the issue of such Securities pursuant to this Indenture will affect the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under the Securities and this Indenture or otherwise in a manner which is not reasonably acceptable to the Trustee.
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 301 and of the preceding paragraph, if all Securities of a series are not to be originally issued at one time, it shall not be necessary to deliver the Officers' Certificate otherwise required pursuant to Section 301 or the Company Order and Opinion of Counsel otherwise required pursuant to such preceding paragraph at or prior to the time of authentication of each Security of such series if such documents are delivered at or prior to the authentication upon original issuance of the first Security of such series to be issued.
Each Registered Security shall be dated the date of its authentication, and each Bearer Security and any temporary Bearer Security in global form shall be dated as of the date of original issuance of the first Security of such series to be issued.
No Security or Coupon shall be entitled to any benefit under this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless there appears on such Security a certificate of authentication substantially in the form provided for herein executed by the Trustee by manual signature of an authorized signatory, and such certificate upon any Security shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Security has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Security shall have been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder but never issued and sold by the Company, and the Company shall deliver such Security to the Trustee for cancellation as provided in Section 309 together with a written statement (which need not comply with Section 102 and need not be accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel) stating that such Security has never been issued and sold by the Company, for all purposes of this Indenture such Security shall be deemed never to have been authenticated and delivered hereunder and shall never be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture.
SECTION 304. Temporary Securities.
Pending the preparation of definitive Securities of any series, the Company may execute, and upon Company Order the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, temporary Securities which are printed, lithographed, typewritten, mimeographed or otherwise produced, in any authorized denomination, substantially of the tenor of the definitive Securities in lieu of which they are issued, in registered form or, if authorized, in bearer form with one or more Coupons or without
 
Coupons, and with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as the officers executing such Securities may determine, as evidenced by their execution of such Securities. In the case of any series issuable as Bearer Securities, such temporary Securities may be in global form.
Except in the case of temporary Securities in global form (which shall be exchanged in accordance with the provisions of the following paragraphs), if temporary Securities of any series are issued, the Company will cause definitive Securities of that series to be prepared without unreasonable delay. After the preparation of definitive Securities of such series, the temporary Securities of such series shall be exchangeable for definitive Securities of such series upon surrender of the temporary Securities of such series at the office or agency of the Company maintained pursuant to Section 1002 in a Place of Payment for such series for the purpose of exchanges of Securities of such series, without charge to the Holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Securities of any series (accompanied by any unmatured Coupons appertaining thereto) the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a like aggregate principal amount of definitive Securities of the same series and of like tenor of authorized denominations; that no definitive Bearer Security shall be delivered in exchange for a temporary Registered Security; and that a definitive Bearer Security shall be delivered in exchange for a temporary Bearer Security only in compliance with the conditions set forth in Section 303.
provided, however,
provided, further,
If temporary Securities of any series are issued in global form, any such temporary global Security shall, unless otherwise provided therein, be delivered to a depositary or common depositary (the "Common Depositary"), for the benefit of Euroclear and Clearstream, for credit to the respective accounts of the beneficial owners of such Securities (or to such other accounts as they may direct).
Without unnecessary delay but in any event not later than the date specified in, or determined pursuant to the terms of, any such temporary global Security (the "Exchange Date"), the Company shall deliver to the Trustee definitive Securities, in aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of such temporary global Security, or, if so specified as contemplated by Section 301, a permanent global Security, in either case, executed by the Company. On or after the Exchange Date such temporary global Security shall be surrendered by the Common Depositary to the Trustee, as the Company's agent for such purpose, to be exchanged, in whole or from time to time in part, for definitive Securities without charge and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in exchange for each portion of such temporary global Security, an equal aggregate principal amount of definitive Securities of the same series of authorized denominations and of like tenor as the portion of such temporary global Security to be exchanged. The definitive Securities to be delivered in exchange for any such temporary global Security shall be in bearer form, registered form, permanent global bearer form or permanent global registered form, or any combination thereof, as specified as contemplated by Section 301, and, if any combination thereof is so specified, as requested by the beneficial owner thereof; that, unless otherwise specified in such temporary global Security, upon such presentation by the Common Depositary, such temporary global Security is accompanied by a certificate dated the Exchange Date or a subsequent date and signed by Euroclear as the portion of such temporary global Security held for its account then to be exchanged and a certificate dated the Exchange Date or a subsequent date and signed by Clearstream, as to the portion of
provided, however,
 
such temporary global Security held for its account then to be exchanged, each in the form designated by the Company pursuant to Section 301; and that definitive Bearer Securities shall be delivered in exchange for a portion of a temporary global Security only in compliance with the requirements of Section 303.
provided, further,
Unless otherwise specified in such temporary global Security, the interest of a beneficial owner of Securities of a series in a temporary global Security shall be exchanged for definitive Securities of the same series and of like tenor following the Exchange Date when the account holder instructs Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, to request such exchange on his or her behalf and delivers to Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, a certificate in the form designated by the Company pursuant to Section 301, dated no earlier than 15 days prior to the Exchange Date, copies of which certificate shall be available from the offices of Euroclear and Clearstream, the Trustee, any Authenticating Agent appointed for such series of Securities and each Paying Agent. Unless otherwise specified in such temporary global Security, any such exchange shall be made free of charge to the beneficial owners of such temporary global Security, except that a Person receiving definitive Securities must bear the cost of insurance, postage, transportation and the like in the event that such Person does not take delivery of such definitive Securities in person at the offices of Euroclear or Clearstream. Definitive Securities in bearer form to be delivered in exchange for any portion of a temporary global Security shall be delivered only outside the United States.
Until exchanged in full as hereinabove provided, the temporary Securities of any series shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities of the same series and of like tenor authenticated and delivered hereunder, except that, unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301, interest payable on a temporary global Security on an Interest Payment Date for Securities of such series occurring prior to the applicable Exchange Date shall be payable to Euroclear and Clearstream on such Interest Payment Date upon delivery by Euroclear and Clearstream to the Trustee of a certificate or certificates in the form designated by the Company pursuant to Section 301, for credit without further interest on or after such Interest Payment Date to the respective accounts of the Persons who are the beneficial owners of such temporary global Security on such Interest Payment Date and who have each delivered to Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, a certificate in the form designated by the Company pursuant to Section 301. Any interest so received by Euroclear and Clearstream and not paid as herein provided shall be returned to the Trustee immediately prior to the expiration of two years after such Interest Payment Date in order to be repaid to the Company in accordance with Section 1003.
SECTION 305. Registration, Registration of Transfer and Exchange.
With respect to the Securities of each series, the Company shall cause to be kept at an office or agency to be maintained by the Company in accordance with Section 1002 a register (the "Security Register") in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company shall provide for the registration of Registered Securities and the registration of transfers of Registered Securities. The Trustee is hereby appointed "Security Registrar" for the purpose of maintaining the Security Register and registering Registered Securities and transfers of Registered Securities as herein provided.
 
Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Registered Security of any series at the office or agency of the Company maintained pursuant to Section 1002 for such purpose in a Place of Payment for such series, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Registered Securities of the same series of any authorized denominations and of a like aggregate principal amount and tenor.
At the option of the Holder, Registered Securities of any series may be exchanged for other Registered Securities of the same series of any authorized denominations and of a like aggregate principal amount and tenor upon surrender of the Securities to be exchanged at any such office or agency. Whenever any Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive. Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301, Bearer Securities may not be issued in exchange for Registered Securities.
At the option of the Holder, Bearer Securities of any series may be exchanged for Registered Securities of the same series of any authorized denominations and of a like aggregate principal amount and tenor, upon surrender of the Bearer Securities to be exchanged at any such office or agency, with all unmatured Coupons and all matured Coupons in default thereto appertaining. If the Holder of a Bearer Security is unable to produce any such unmatured Coupon or Coupons or matured Coupon or Coupons in default, such exchange may be effected if the Bearer Securities are accompanied by payment in funds acceptable to the Company in an amount equal to the face amount of such missing Coupon or Coupons, or the surrender of such missing Coupon or Coupons may be waived by the Company and the Trustee if there is furnished to them such security or indemnity as they may require to save each of them and any Paying Agent harmless. If thereafter the Holder of such Security shall surrender to any Paying Agent any such missing Coupon in respect of which such a payment shall have been made, such Holder shall be entitled to receive the amount of such payment; that, except as otherwise provided in Section 1002, interest represented by Coupons shall be payable only upon presentation and surrender of those Coupons at an office or agency located outside the United States. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in case a Bearer Security of any series is surrendered at any such office or agency in exchange for a Registered Security of the same series and like tenor after the close of business at such office or agency on (i) any Regular Record Date and before the opening of business at such office or agency on the relevant Interest Payment Date, or (ii) any Special Record Date and before the opening of business at such office or agency on the related proposed date for payment of Defaulted Interest, such Bearer Security shall be surrendered without the Coupon relating to such Interest Payment Date or proposed date for payment, as the case may be, and interest or Defaulted Interest, as the case may be, will not be payable on such Interest Payment Date or proposed date for payment, as the case may be, in respect of the Registered Security issued in exchange for such Bearer Security, but will be payable only to the Holder of such Coupon when due in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture.
provided, however,
Whenever any Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301, any permanent global Security shall be exchangeable only as provided in this paragraph. No permanent global Registered Security may be exchanged in whole or in part for Securities registered, and no transfer of a permanent global Registered Security in whole or in part may be registered, in the name of any Person other than the Common Depositary or U.S. Depositary for such permanent global Registered Security or a nominee thereof unless (A) such Common Depositary or U.S. Depositary has notified the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Common Depositary or U.S. Depositary for such permanent global Registered Security and a successor Common Depositary or U.S. Depositary has not been appointed by the Company within 90 days of receipt by the Company of such notification, (B) at any time the Common Depositary or U.S. Depositary ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act or any other applicable law at a time when the Common Depositary or U.S. Depositary is required to be so registered to act as such Common Depositary or U.S. Depositary and no successor Common Depositary or U.S. Depositary shall have been appointed by the Company within 90 days after it became aware of such cessation, or (C) there shall exist such circumstances, if any, in addition to or in lieu of the foregoing as have been specified for this purpose as contemplated by Section 301. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may at any time in its sole discretion and subject to the procedures of the Common Depositary or U.S. Depositary determine that Securities issued in the form of a permanent global Registered Security shall no longer be represented in whole or in part by such permanent global Registered Security, and the Trustee, upon receipt of a Company Order therefor, shall authenticate and deliver definitive Registered Securities in exchange in whole or in part for such permanent global Registered Security. If the beneficial owners of interests in a permanent global Security are entitled to exchange such interests for Securities of such series and of like tenor and principal amount of another authorized form and denomination, as specified above or as contemplated by Section 301, then without unnecessary delay but in any event not later than the earliest date on which such interests may be so exchanged, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee definitive Securities of that series in aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of such permanent global Security, executed by the Company. On or after the earliest date on which such interests may be so exchanged, such permanent global Securities shall be surrendered from time to time by the Common Depositary or the U.S. Depositary, as the case may be, and in accordance with instructions given to the Trustee and the Common Depositary or the U.S. Depositary, as the case may be (which instructions shall be in writing but need not comply with Section 102 or be accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel), as shall be specified in the Company Order with respect thereto to the Trustee, as the Company's agent for such purpose, shall be exchanged, in whole or in part, for definitive Securities of the same series without charge. The Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery, in exchange for each portion of such surrendered permanent global Security, a like aggregate principal amount of definitive Securities of the same series of authorized denominations and of like tenor as the portion of such permanent global Security to be exchanged which (unless the Securities of the series are not issuable both as Bearer Securities and as Registered Securities, in which case the definitive Securities exchanged for the permanent global Security shall be issuable only in the form in which the Securities are issuable, as specified as contemplated by Section 301) shall be in the form of Bearer Securities or Registered Securities, or any combination thereof, as shall be specified by the beneficial owner thereof; that no such exchanges may occur during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before any selection of Securities of that series to be
provided, however,
 
redeemed and ending on the relevant Redemption Date; and that no Bearer Security delivered in exchange for a portion of a permanent global Security shall be mailed or otherwise delivered to any location in the United States. Promptly following any such exchange in part, such permanent global Security shall be returned by the Trustee to the Common Depositary or the U.S. Depositary, as the case may be, or such other depositary or Common Depositary or U.S. Depositary referred to above in accordance with the instructions of the Company referred to above. If a Registered Security is issued in exchange for any portion of a permanent global Security after the close of business at the office or agency where such exchange occurs on (i) any Regular Record Date and before the opening of business at such office or agency on the relevant Interest Payment Date, or (ii) any Special Record Date and before the opening of business at such office or agency on the related proposed date for payment of interest or Defaulted Interest, as the case may be, will not be payable on such Interest Payment Date or proposed date for payment, as the case may be, in respect of such Registered Security, but will be payable on such Interest Payment Date or proposed date for payment, as the case may be, only to the Person to whom interest in respect of such portion of such permanent global Security is payable in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture.
provided, further,
None of the Company, the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests of a global Security or maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 305, unless and until it is exchanged in whole or in part for Securities in definitive registered form, a permanent global Registered Security representing all or a portion of the Securities of a series may not be transferred except as a whole by the Common Depositary or U.S. Depositary for such series to a nominee of such Common Depositary or U.S. Depositary or by a nominee of such Common Depositary or U.S. Depositary to such Common Depositary or U.S. Depositary or another nominee of such Common Depositary or U.S. Depositary or by such Common Depositary or U.S. Depositary or any such nominee to a successor Common Depositary or U.S. Depositary for such series or a nominee of such successor Common Depositary or U.S. Depositary.
All Securities issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities shall be the valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Securities surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange.
Every Registered Security presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange shall (if so required by the Company or the Trustee or any transfer agent) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar or any transfer agent duly executed, by the Holder thereof or his or her attorney duly authorized in writing.
No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, other than exchanges pursuant to Section 304, 906 or 1107 not involving any transfer.
 
The Company shall not be required (i) to issue, register the transfer of or exchange Securities of any series during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before any selection of Securities of that series to be redeemed and ending at the close of business on (a) if Securities of the series are issuable only as Registered Securities, the day of the mailing of the relevant notice of redemption and (b) if Securities of the series are issuable as Bearer Securities, the day of the first publication of the relevant notice of redemption or, if Securities of the series are also issuable as Registered Securities and there is no publication, the mailing of the relevant notice of redemption, or (ii) to register the transfer of or exchange any Registered Security so selected for redemption, in whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of any Security being redeemed in part, or (iii) to exchange any Bearer Security so selected for redemption except that such a Bearer Security may be exchanged for a Registered Security of that series and like tenor, provided that such Registered Security shall be simultaneously surrendered for redemption.
SECTION 306. Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Securities and Coupons.
If any mutilated Security or a Security with a mutilated Coupon appertaining to it is surrendered to the Trustee, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a new Security of the same series and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding, with Coupons corresponding to the Coupons, if any, appertaining to the surrendered Security.
If there shall be delivered to the Company and the Trustee (i) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Security or Coupon and (ii) such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them and any agent of either of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company or the Trustee that such Security or Coupon has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Security or in exchange for the Security to which a destroyed, lost or stolen Coupon appertains (with all appurtenant Coupons not destroyed, lost or stolen), a new Security of the same series and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding, with Coupons corresponding to the Coupons, if any, appertaining to such destroyed, lost or stolen Security or to the Security to which such destroyed, lost or stolen Coupon appertains.
In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security or Coupon has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security, pay such Security or Coupon; that principal of (and premium, if any) and any interest on Bearer Securities shall, except as otherwise provided in Section 1002, be payable only at an office or agency located outside the United States and, unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301, any interest on Bearer Securities shall be payable only upon presentation and surrender of the Coupons appertaining thereto.
provided, however,
Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section, the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith.
 
Every new Security of any series, with its Coupons, if any, issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Security or in exchange for a Security to which a destroyed, lost or stolen Coupon appertains, shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Security and its Coupons, if any, or the destroyed, lost or stolen Coupon shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and any such new Security and Coupons, if any, shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities of that series and their Coupons, if any, duly issued hereunder.
The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) any other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities or Coupons.
SECTION 307. Payment of Interest; Interest Rights Preserved.
Unless otherwise provided as contemplated by Section 301 with respect to any series of Securities, interest on any Registered Security which is payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the Person in whose name that Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest.
Any interest on any Registered Security of any series which is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date (herein called "Defaulted Interest") shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder, and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company, at its election in each case, as provided in clause (1) or (2) below:
(1) The Company may elect to make payment of any Defaulted Interest to the Persons in whose names the Registered Securities of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed in the following manner. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each Registered Security of such series and the date of the proposed payment, and at the same time the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this clause provided. Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall be not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of such Special Record Date and, in the name and at the expense of the Company, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder of Registered Securities of such series at the address of such Holder as it appears in the Security Register, not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date. Notice of the proposed payment of such
 
Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor having been so mailed, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names the Registered Securities of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on such Special Record Date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the following clause (2).
(2) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest on the Registered Securities of any series in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which such Securities may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this Clause, such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee.
Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section and Section 305, each Security delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Security shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Security.
SECTION 308. Persons Deemed Owners.
Prior to due presentment of a Registered Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name such Registered Security is registered as the owner of such Registered Security for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of (and premium, if any) and (subject to Sections 305 and 307) any interest on such Security and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
Title to any Bearer Security and any Coupons appertaining thereto shall pass by delivery. The Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the bearer of any Bearer Security and the bearer of any Coupon as the absolute owner of such Security or Coupon for the purpose of receiving payment thereof or on account thereof and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Security or Coupon be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
SECTION 309. Cancellation.
All Securities and Coupons surrendered for payment, redemption, registration of transfer or exchange or for credit against any sinking fund payment shall, if surrendered to any Person other than the Trustee, be delivered to the Trustee. All Securities and Coupons so delivered shall be promptly cancelled by the Trustee. All Securities and Coupons held by the Trustee pending such cancellation shall be deemed to be delivered for cancellation for all purposes of this Indenture and the Securities. The Company may at any time deliver to the Trustee for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated and delivered hereunder which the Company may have acquired in any manner whatsoever, and may deliver to the Trustee (or to any other Person for delivery to the Trustee) for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated
 
hereunder which the Company has not issued and sold, and all Securities so delivered shall be promptly cancelled by the Trustee. No Securities shall be authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any Securities cancelled as provided in this Section, except as expressly permitted by this Indenture. All cancelled Securities and Coupons held by the Trustee shall be disposed of by the Trustee in accordance with its customary procedures and the Trustee shall furnish a certificate of such disposition to the Company.
SECTION 310. Computation of Interest.
Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 for Securities of any series, interest on the Securities of each series shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.
SECTION 401. Satisfaction and Discharge of Indenture.
This Indenture shall upon Company Request cease to be of further effect (except as to any surviving rights of registration of transfer or exchange of Securities herein expressly provided for), and the Trustee, at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, when
(1) either
(A) all Securities theretofore authenticated and delivered and all Coupons, if any, appertaining thereto (other than (i) Coupons appertaining to Bearer Securities surrendered for exchange for Registered Securities and maturing after such exchange, whose surrender is not required or has been waived as provided in Section 305, (ii) Securities and Coupons which have been destroyed, lost or stolen and which have been replaced or paid as provided in Section 306, (iii) Coupons appertaining to Securities called for redemption and maturing after the relevant Redemption Date, whose surrender has been waived as provided in Section 1106, and (iv) Securities and Coupons for whose payment money has theretofore been deposited in trust or segregated and held in trust by the Company and thereafter repaid to the Company or discharged from such trust, as provided in Section 1003) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or
(B) all such Securities and, in the case of (i) and (ii) below, any Coupons appertaining thereto not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation
(i) have become due and payable, or
(ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity Date within one year, or
 
(iii) are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Company,
and the Company, in the case of (i), (ii) or (iii) above, has deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust for the purpose an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on such Securities and Coupons not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal (and premium, if any) and any interest to the date of such deposit (in the case of Securities which have become due and payable) or to the Stated Maturity Date or Redemption Date, as the case may be;
(2) the Company has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable hereunder by the Company; and
(3) the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent herein provided for relating to the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture have been complied with.
Notwithstanding the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, the obligations of the Company to the Trustee under Section 607, the obligations of the Company to any Authenticating Agent under Section 614 and, if money shall have been deposited with the Trustee pursuant to clause (1)(B) of this Section, the obligations of the Trustee under Section 402 and the last paragraph of Section 1003 shall survive.
SECTION 402. Application of Trust Money.
Subject to the provisions of the last paragraph of Section 1003, all money deposited with the Trustee pursuant to Section 401, 403 or 1011 shall be held in trust and applied by it, in accordance with the provisions of the Securities, the Coupons and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any Paying Agent (including the Company acting as its own Paying Agent) as the Trustee may determine, to the Persons entitled thereto, of the principal (and premium, if any) and any interest for whose payment such money has been deposited with the Trustee.
SECTION 403. Satisfaction, Discharge and Defeasance of Securities of any Series.
(a) Upon satisfaction of the following conditions, the Company shall be discharged from all of its obligations under the Securities of any series and under this Indenture with respect to such Securities, except for its obligations under Sections 304, 305, 306, 1002 and 1003, this Section 403 and the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee hereunder, including those under Section 607 hereof (referred to below as a "Defeasance"):
(1) The Company shall irrevocably have deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee in trust for the Holders of such Securities (A) money in an amount, or (B) U.S. Government Obligations which through the scheduled payment of principal and interest
 
in respect thereof in accordance with their terms, and with no further reinvestment, will provide, not later than one day before the due date of any payment, lawful money of the United States in an amount, or (C) a combination thereof, sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, to pay and discharge the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on such Securities at or before the Stated Maturity Date thereof (and to redeem any sinking fund Securities required to be redeemed prior to such payment and discharge) in accordance with this Indenture and such Securities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of any redeemable Securities which are to be redeemed prior to their respective Stated Maturity Dates, no deposit under this paragraph shall be deemed sufficient to pay and discharge such Securities as aforesaid until proper notice of such redemption shall have been given in accordance with Article Eleven of this Indenture or irrevocable instructions shall have been given to the Trustee to give such notice.
(2) The Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel stating that the Holders of such Securities will not recognize income, gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit or Defeasance and will be subject to Federal income tax on the same amount, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit or Defeasance had not occurred, which Opinion of Counsel (except in the case of a Covenant Defeasance) shall be based upon (and accompanied by a copy of) a ruling of the Internal Revenue Service to the same effect unless there has been a change in applicable Federal income tax law after the original issue date of such Securities such that a ruling is no longer required or a ruling directed to the Trustee received from the Internal Revenue Service to the same effect as the aforementioned Opinion of Counsel.
(3) The Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate to the effect that such Securities, if then listed on any securities exchange or quoted on an automatic quotation system, will not be delisted or cease to be quoted as a result of such deposit.
(4) No Event of Default or event which with notice or lapse of time or both would become an Event of Default with respect to such Securities shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such deposit or, insofar as any event described in Section 501(6) or (7), at any time prior to the 91st day after such deposit.
(5) Such deposit or Defeasance shall not result in a violation of, or constitute a default under, any other agreement or instrument to which the Company is a party or by which it is bound.
(6) Such Defeasance shall not result in the trust arising from such deposit constituting an investment company as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940 or such trust shall be qualified under such act or exempt from regulation thereunder.
 
(7) Such Defeasance shall not cause the Trustee to have a conflicting interest under the Trust Indenture Act with respect to any Securities of the Company or any guarantor.
(8) The Company shall have delivered to the Trustee (i) an Officers' Certificate stating that all conditions precedent provided for relating to such Defeasance or deposit have been complied with, and (ii) an Opinion of Counsel stating that all conditions precedent provided for relating to such Defeasance or deposit have been complied with.
(b) Subject to the provisions of the last paragraph of Section 1003, all money and U.S. Government Obligations (including the proceeds thereof) deposited with the Trustee pursuant to paragraph (a) in respect of one or more series of Securities shall be held in trust and applied by the Trustee, in accordance with the provisions of such Securities and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any Paying Agent (including the Company acting as its own Paying Agent) as the Trustee may determine, to the Holders of such Securities, of all sums due and to become due thereon in respect of principal and any premium and interest, but such money need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law.
The Company shall pay (in addition to any U.S. Government Obligations deposited pursuant to paragraph (a)), and indemnify the Trustee against, any tax, fee or other charge imposed on or assessed against the U.S. Government Obligations deposited pursuant to paragraph (a) or the principal and interest received in respect thereof other than any such tax, fee or other charge which by law is for the account of the Holders of the Securities for which such deposit is made.
Anything in this Section 403 to the contrary notwithstanding, the Trustee shall deliver or pay to the Company from time to time upon Company Request any money or U.S. Government Obligations held by it as provided in paragraph (a) which, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, are in excess of the amount thereof which would then be required to be deposited to effect an equivalent Defeasance.
SECTION 404. Reinstatement.
If the Trustee is unable to apply any money or U.S. Government Obligations in accordance with Section 401, 403 or 1011 by reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, the Company's obligations under this Indenture and the Securities shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to Section 401, 403 or 1011 until such time as the Trustee is permitted to apply all such money or U.S. Government Obligations in accordance with Section 401, 403 or 1011; that if the Company has made any payment of interest on or principal of any Securities because of the reinstatement of its obligations, the Company shall be subrogated to the rights of the Holders of such Securities to receive such payment from the money or U.S. Government Obligations held by the Trustee.
provided, however,
 
SECTION 501. Events of Default.
"Event of Default," wherever used herein with respect to Securities of any series, means any one of the following events (whatever the reason for such Event of Default and whether it shall be voluntary or involuntary or be effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body):
(1) default in the payment of any interest upon any Security of that series when it becomes due and payable, and continuance of such default for a period of 30 days; or
(2) default in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any, on) any Security of that series at its Maturity; or
(3) default in the deposit of any sinking fund payment, when and as due by the terms of a Security of that series; or
(4) default in the performance, or breach, of any covenant or warranty of the Company in this Indenture (other than a covenant or warranty a default in whose performance or whose breach is elsewhere in this Section specifically dealt with or which has expressly been included in this Indenture solely for the benefit of series of Securities other than that series), and continuance of such default or breach for a period of 90 days after there has been given, by registered or certified mail, to the Company by the Trustee or to the Company and the Trustee by the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series a written notice specifying such default or breach and requiring it to be remedied and stating that such notice is a "Notice of Default" hereunder; or
(5) a default in respect of any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Company or any consolidated Subsidiary (including a default with respect to Securities of any series other than that series) or under any Mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Company or any Subsidiary which is consolidated with the Company on the Company's consolidated financial statements (including this Indenture), whether such Indebtedness now exists or shall hereafter be created, which default shall have resulted in Indebtedness in an aggregate outstanding principal amount in excess of $50,000,000 becoming or being declared due and payable prior to the date on which it would otherwise have become due and payable, without such acceleration having been rescinded or annulled, or without such Indebtedness having been discharged or waived, in each case, within a period of 10 days after there shall have been given, by registered or certified mail, to the Company by the Trustee or to the Company and the Trustee by the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series a written notice specifying such default and
 
requiring the Company to cause such acceleration to be rescinded or annulled or cause such Indebtedness to be discharged or waived and stating that such notice is a "Notice of Default" hereunder; that, subject to Section 601, the Trustee shall not be charged with knowledge of any such default unless either (i) a Responsible Officer of the Trustee shall have actual knowledge of such default, or (ii) written notice of such default shall have been given to the Trustee by the Company, by the trustee then acting under any indenture or other instrument under which such default shall have occurred or by the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of that series then Outstanding; or
provided, however,
(6) the entry by a court having jurisdiction in the premises of (a) a decree or order for relief in respect of the Company in an involuntary case or proceeding under any applicable Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or (b) a decree or order adjudging the Company a bankrupt or insolvent, or approving as properly filed a petition seeking reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition of or in respect of the Company under any applicable Federal or State law, or appointing a custodian, receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, sequestrator or other similar official of the Company or of any substantial part of its property, or ordering the winding up or liquidation of its affairs, and the continuance of any such decree or order for relief or any such other decree or order unstayed and in effect for a period of 90 consecutive days; or
(7) the commencement by the Company of a voluntary case or proceeding under any applicable Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or of any other case or proceeding to be adjudicated a bankrupt or insolvent, or the consent by it to the entry of a decree or order for relief in respect of the Company in an involuntary case or proceeding under any applicable Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or to the commencement of any bankruptcy or insolvency case or proceeding against it, or the filing by it of a petition or answer or consent seeking reorganization or relief under any applicable Federal or State law, or the consent by it to the filing of such petition or to the appointment of or taking possession by a custodian, receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, sequestrator or similar official of the Company or of any substantial part of its property, or the making by it of an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the admission by it in writing of its inability to pay its debts generally as they become due, or the taking of corporate action by the Company in furtherance of any such action; or
(8) any other Event of Default provided with respect to Securities of that series specified as contemplated by Section 301.
SECTION 502. Acceleration of Maturity; Rescission and Annulment.
If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of any series at the time Outstanding occurs and is continuing (other than those of the type described in Section 501(6) or (7) with respect to the Company), then in every such case the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series may declare the principal amount (or, if any of the Securities of that series are Original Issue Discount Securities, such portion of the principal amount of such Securities as may be specified in the terms thereof) of all of the
 
Securities of that series to be due and payable immediately, by a notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by Holders), and upon any such declaration such principal amount (or specified amount) shall become immediately due and payable.
If an Event of Default specified in Section 501(6) or (7) with respect to Securities of any series at the time Outstanding occurs and is continuing, the principal amount (or, if any of the Securities of that series are Original Issue Discount Securities, such portion of the principal amount of such Securities as may be specified in the terms thereof) of all of the Securities of that series shall become due and payable immediately without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or the Holders of the Securities of such series.
Upon payment of such due and payable principal amount referred to in the proceeding two paragraphs (or such portion thereof in the case of Original Issue Discount Securities), all obligations of the Company in respect of the payment of principal of the Securities of such series shall terminate.
At any time after such a declaration of acceleration with respect to Securities of any series has been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee as hereinafter in this Article provided, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series, by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if
(1) the Company has paid or deposited with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay
(A) all overdue interest on all Securities of that series,
(B) the principal of (and premium, if any, on) any Securities of that series which have become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and any interest thereon at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Securities,
(C) to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful, interest upon overdue interest at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Securities, and
(D) all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee hereunder and the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel;
and
(2) all Events of Default with respect to Securities of that series, other than the non-payment of the principal of Securities of that series which have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in Section 513.
No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.
 
SECTION 503. Collection of Indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement by Trustee.
The Company covenants that if an Event of Default specified in Section 501(1) or 501(2) shall have occurred and be continuing, the Company will, upon demand of the Trustee, pay to the Trustee, for the benefit of the Holders of such Securities, the whole amount then due and payable on such Securities for principal, premium, if any, and interest, with interest upon the overdue principal, premium, if any, and, to the extent that payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable, upon overdue installments of interest, at the rate then borne by the Securities; and, in addition thereto, such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel. If the Company fails to pay such amounts forthwith upon such demand, the Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, may, but is not obligated under this paragraph to, institute a judicial proceeding for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid and may, but is not obligated under this paragraph to, prosecute such proceeding to judgment or final decree, and may, but is not obligated under this paragraph to, enforce the same against the Company or any other obligor upon the Securities and collect the moneys adjudged or decreed to be payable in the manner provided by law out of the property of the Company or any other obligor upon the Securities, wherever situated.
If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of any series occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series and any related Coupons by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy.
SECTION 504. Trustee May File Proofs of Claim.
In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial proceeding relative to the Company or any other obligor upon the Securities or the property of the Company or of such other obligor or their creditors, the Trustee (irrespective of whether the principal of the Securities shall then be due and payable as therein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Trustee shall have made any demand on the Company for the payment of overdue principal or interest) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise,
(1) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of principal (and premium, if any) and any interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Securities and to file such other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel) and of the Holders of Securities and Coupons allowed in such judicial proceeding, and
(2) to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;

The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy.
SECTION 511. Delay or Omission Not Waiver.
No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Holder of any Security or Coupon to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any Event of Default shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence therein.

(2) in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which under Article Nine cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security of such series affected.

SECTION 514. Undertaking for Costs.
All parties to this Indenture agree, and each Holder of any Security or Coupon by his or her acceptance thereof shall be deemed to have agreed, that any court may in its discretion require, in any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture, or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken, suffered or omitted by it as Trustee, the filing by any party litigant in such suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and that such court may in its discretion assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, against any party litigant in such suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by such party litigant; but the provisions of this Section shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Company, to any suit instituted by the Trustee, to any suit instituted by any Holder, or group of Holders, holding in the aggregate more than 10% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series, or to any suit instituted by any Holder of any Security or Coupon for the enforcement of the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or any interest on any Security or the payment of any Coupon on or after the Stated Maturity Date or Maturities expressed in such Security or Coupon (or, in the case of redemption, on or after the Redemption Date).
SECTION 515. Waiver of Stay or Extension Laws.
The Company covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it will not at any time insist upon, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay or extension law wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, which may affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and the Company (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law and covenants that it will not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but will suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law has been enacted.
SECTION 601. Certain Duties and Responsibilities.
(a) Except during the continuance of an Event of Default,

(b) In case an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture, and shall use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his or her own affairs.
(c) No provision of this Indenture shall be construed to relieve the Trustee from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act, or its own willful misconduct, that
except
(1) this paragraph (c) shall not be construed to limit the effect of paragraph (a) of this Section;
(2) the Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by a Responsible Officer, unless it shall be proved that the Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts;

(4) no provision of this Indenture shall require the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder, or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if it shall have reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it.
(d) Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this Indenture relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or affording protection to the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of this Section.
SECTION 602. Notice of Defaults.
Within 90 days after the occurrence of any default hereunder with respect to the Securities of any series, the Trustee shall transmit in the manner and to the extent provided in Section 703(c), notice of such default hereunder known to the Trustee, unless such default shall have been cured or waived; that, except in the case of a default in the
provided, however,
 
payment of the principal of or any premium or interest on any Security of such series or in the payment of any sinking fund installment with respect to Securities of such series, the Trustee shall be protected in withholding such notice if and so long as the board of directors, the executive committee or a trust committee of directors or Responsible Officers of the Trustee in good faith determine that the withholding of such notice is in the interest of the Holders of Securities of such series; and that in the case of any default of the character specified in Section 501(4) with respect to Securities of such series, no such notice to Holders shall be given until at least 30 days after the occurrence thereof. For the purpose of this Section, the term "default" means any event which is, or after notice or lapse of time or both would become, an Event of Default with respect to Securities of such series.
provided, further,

(k) the Trustee may request that the Company deliver an Officers' Certificate setting forth the names of individuals and/or titles of officers authorized at such time to take specified actions pursuant to this Indenture, which Officers' Certificate may be signed by any person authorized to sign an Officers' Certificate, including any person specified as so authorized in any such certificate previously delivered and not superseded; and
(l) in no event shall the Trustee be responsible or liable for any failure or delay in the performance of its obligations hereunder arising out of or caused by, directly or indirectly, forces beyond its control, including, without limitation, strikes, work stoppages, accidents, acts of war or terrorism, civil or military disturbances, nuclear or natural catastrophes or acts of God, and interruptions, loss or malfunctions of utilities, communications or computer (software and hardware) services; it being understood that the Trustee shall use reasonable efforts which are consistent with accepted practices in the banking industry to resume performance as soon as practicable under the circumstances.

The recitals contained herein and in the Securities (except the Trustee's certificates of authentication) and in any Coupons shall be taken as the statements of the Company, and the Trustee or any Authenticating Agent assumes no responsibility for their correctness. The Trustee

SECTION 605. May Hold Securities.
The Trustee, any Authenticating Agent, any Paying Agent, any Security Registrar or any other agent of the Company, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Securities and Coupons and, subject to Sections 608 and 613, may otherwise deal with the Company with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee, Authenticating Agent, Paying Agent, Security Registrar or such other agent.
SECTION 606. Money Held in Trust.
Money held by the Trustee in trust hereunder need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law. The Trustee shall be under no liability for interest on any money received by it hereunder except as otherwise agreed with the Company.

The Company agrees
(1) to pay to the Trustee from time to time reasonable compensation for all services rendered by it hereunder (which compensation shall not be limited by any provision of law in regard to the compensation of a trustee of an express trust);

If such Corporation publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of the aforesaid supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section, the combined capital and surplus of such Corporation shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. If at any time the Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, it shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect hereinafter specified in this Article.
provided, however,
SECTION 610. Resignation and Removal; Appointment of Successor.
(a) No resignation or removal of the Trustee and no appointment of a successor Trustee pursuant to this Article shall become effective until the acceptance of appointment by the successor Trustee in accordance with the applicable requirements of Section 611.
(b) The Trustee may resign at any time with respect to the Securities of one or more series by giving written notice thereof to the Company. If the instrument of acceptance by a successor Trustee required by Section 611 shall not have been delivered to the Trustee within 30 days after the giving of such notice of resignation, the resigning Trustee may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series.
(c) The Trustee may be removed at any time with respect to the Securities of any series by Act of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series delivered to the Trustee and to the Company.
 
(d) If at any time:
(1) the Trustee shall fail to comply with Section 608 after written request therefor by the Company or by any Holder of a Security who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security for at least six months, or
(2) the Trustee shall cease to be eligible under Section 609 and shall fail to resign after written request therefor by the Company or by any such Holder, or
(3) the Trustee shall become incapable of acting or shall be adjudged a bankrupt or insolvent, or a receiver of the Trustee or of its property shall be appointed or any public officer shall take charge or control of the Trustee or of its property or affairs for the purpose or rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation,
then, in any such case, (i) the Company by a Board Resolution may remove the Trustee with respect to all Securities, or (ii) subject to Section 514, any Holder of a Security who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security for at least six months may, on behalf of himself or herself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee with respect to all Securities and the appointment of a successor Trustee or Trustees.
(e) If the Trustee shall resign, be removed or become incapable of acting, or if a vacancy shall occur in the office of Trustee for any cause, with respect to the Securities of one or more series, the Company, by a Board Resolution, shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee or Trustees with respect to the Securities of that or those series (it being understood that any such successor Trustee may be appointed with respect to the Securities of one or more or all of such series and that at any time there shall be only one Trustee with respect to the Securities of any particular series) and shall comply with the applicable requirements of Section 611. If, within one year after such resignation, removal or incapability, or the occurrence of such vacancy, a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series shall be appointed by Act of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series delivered to the Company and the retiring Trustee, the successor Trustee so appointed shall, forthwith upon its acceptance of such appointment in accordance with the applicable requirements of Section 611, become the successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series and to that extent supersede the successor Trustee appointed by the Company. If no successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series shall have been so appointed by the Company or the Holders of Securities and accepted appointment in the manner required by Section 611, any Holder of a Security who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security of such series for at least six months may, on behalf of himself or herself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series.
(f) The Company shall give notice of each resignation and each removal of the Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series and each appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series in the manner provided in Section 106. Each notice shall include the name of the successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series and the address of its Corporate Trust Office.
 
SECTION 611. Acceptance of Appointment by Successor.
(a) In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Trustee with respect to all Securities, every such successor Trustee so appointed shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Company and to the retiring Trustee an instrument accepting such appointment, and thereupon the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective and such successor Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee; but, on the request of the Company or the successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall, upon payment of its charges, execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor Trustee all the rights, powers and trusts of the retiring Trustee and shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Trustee all property and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder, subject nevertheless to its lien, if any, provided for in Section 607.
(b) In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more (but not all) series, the Company, the retiring Trustee and each successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more series shall execute and deliver an indenture supplemental hereto wherein each successor Trustee shall accept such appointment and which (1) shall contain such provisions as shall be necessary or desirable to transfer and confirm to, and to vest in, each successor Trustee all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates, (2) if the retiring Trustee is not retiring with respect to all Securities, shall contain such provisions as shall be deemed necessary or desirable to confirm that all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series as to which the retiring Trustee is not retiring shall continue to be vested in the retiring Trustee, and (3) shall add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder by more than one Trustee, it being understood that nothing herein or in such supplemental indenture shall constitute such Trustees as co-trustees of the same trust and that each such Trustee shall be trustee of a trust or trusts hereunder separate and apart from any trust or trusts hereunder administered by any other such Trustee; and upon the execution and delivery of such supplemental indenture the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective to the extent provided therein and each such successor Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates; but, on request of the Company or any successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Trustee all property and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates, subject nevertheless to its lien, if any, provided for in Section 607.
(c) Upon request of any such successor Trustee, the Company shall execute any and all instruments for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor Trustee all such rights, powers and trusts referred to in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, as the case may be.
 
(d) No successor Trustee shall accept its appointment unless at the time of such acceptance such successor Trustee shall be qualified and eligible under this Article.
SECTION 612. Merger, Conversion, Consolidation or Succession to Business.
Any Corporation into which the Trustee may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any Corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Trustee shall be a party, or any Corporation succeeding to all or substantially all the corporate trust business of the Trustee, shall be the successor of the Trustee thereunder, provided such Corporation shall be otherwise qualified and eligible under this Article, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto. In case any Securities shall have been authenticated, but not delivered, by the Trustee then in office, any successor by merger, conversion or consolidation to such authenticating Trustee may adopt such authentication and deliver the Securities so authenticated with the same effect as if such successor Trustee had itself authenticated such Securities. In case any Securities shall not have been authenticated by such predecessor Trustee, any such successor Trustee may authenticate and deliver such Securities, in either its own name or that of its predecessor Trustee, with the full force and effect which this Indenture provides for the certificate of authentication of the Trustee.
SECTION 613. Preferential Collection of Claims Against Company.
The Trustee shall comply with Section 311(a) of the Trust Indenture Act, excluding any creditor relationship listed in Section 311(b) of the Trust Indenture Act. A Trustee who has resigned or been removed shall be subject to Section 311(a) of the Trust Indenture Act to the extent indicated therein.
SECTION 614. Appointment of Authenticating Agent.
The Trustee may appoint an Authenticating Agent or Agents with respect to one or more series of Securities which shall be authorized to act on behalf of the Trustee to authenticate Securities of such series issued upon original issue or upon exchange, registration of transfer or partial redemption thereof or pursuant to Section 306, and Securities so authenticated shall be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture and shall be valid and obligatory for all purposes as if authenticated by the Trustee hereunder. Wherever reference is made in this Indenture to the authentication and delivery of Securities by the Trustee or the Trustee's certificate of authentication, such reference shall be deemed to include authentication and delivery on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent and a certificate of authentication executed on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent. Each Authenticating Agent shall be acceptable to the Company and shall at all times be a Corporation organized and doing business under the laws of the United States, any State thereof or the District of Columbia, authorized under such laws to act as Authenticating Agent, having a combined capital and surplus of not less than $50,000,000 and subject to supervision or examination by Federal or State authority. If such Authenticating Agent publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of said supervising or examining authority, then, for the purposes of this Section, the combined capital and surplus of such Authenticating Agent shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. If at any time an Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, such Authenticating Agent shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect specified in this Section.
 
Any Corporation into which an Authenticating Agent may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any Corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which such Authenticating Agent shall be a party, or any Corporation succeeding to the corporate agency or corporate trust business of such Authenticating Agent, shall continue to be an Authenticating Agent, provided such Corporation shall be otherwise eligible under this Section, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of the Trustee or such Authenticating Agent.
An Authenticating Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Trustee and to the Company. The Trustee may at any time terminate the agency of an Authenticating Agent by giving written notice thereof to such Authenticating Agent and to the Company. Upon receiving such a notice of resignation or upon such a termination, or in case at any time such Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, the Trustee may appoint a successor Authenticating Agent which shall be acceptable to the Company and shall mail written notice of such appointment by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to all Holders of Registered Securities, if any, of the series with respect to which such Authenticating Agent will serve, as their names and addresses appear in the Security Register. Any successor Authenticating Agent upon acceptance of its appointment hereunder shall become vested with all the rights, powers and duties of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as an Authenticating Agent. No successor Authenticating Agent shall be appointed unless eligible under the provisions of this Section.
The Company agrees to pay to each Authenticating Agent from time to time reasonable compensation for its services under this Section.
If an appointment with respect to one or more series is made pursuant to this Section, the Securities of such series may have endorsed thereon, in addition to the Trustee's certificate of authentication, an alternative certificate of authentication in the following form:
This is one of the Securities of the series designated herein and referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.

The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee and the Holders of the location, and any change in the location, of any such office or agency. If at any time the Company shall fail to maintain any such required office or agency in respect of any series of Securities or shall fail to furnish the Trustee with the address thereof, such presentations and surrenders of Securities of that series may be made and notices and demands may be made or served at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, except that Bearer Securities of that series and the related Coupons may be presented and surrendered for payment at an office maintained by the Trustee in London, and the Company hereby appoints the same as its agent to receive such respective presentations, surrenders, notices and demands.
Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301, no payment of principal, premium or interest on Bearer Securities shall be made at any office or agency of the Company in the United States or by check mailed to any address in the United States or by transfer to an account maintained with a bank located in the United States; that, if the Securities of a series are denominated and payable in Dollars, payment of principal of and any premium and interest on any Bearer Security shall be made at the office of the Company's Paying Agent in the Borough of Manhattan, the City of New York, if (but only if) payment in Dollars of the full amount of such principal, premium or interest, as the case may be, at all offices or agencies outside the United States maintained for the purpose by the Company in accordance with this Indenture is illegal or effectively precluded by exchange controls or other similar restrictions.
provided, however,
The Company may also from time to time designate one or more other offices or agencies where the Securities of one or more series may be presented or surrendered for any or all such purposes and may from time to time rescind such designations; that no such designation or rescission shall in any manner relieve the Company of its obligation to maintain an office or agency in accordance with the requirements set forth above for Securities of any series for such purposes.

SECTION 1003. Money for Securities Payments to Be Held in Trust.
If the Company shall at any time act as its own Paying Agent with respect to any series of Securities, it will, on or before each due date of the principal of and any premium or interest on any of the Securities of that series, segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto a sum sufficient to pay the principal and any premium or interest so becoming due until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein provided and will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to act.

(3) at any time during the continuance of any such default, upon the written request of the Trustee, forthwith pay to the Trustee all sums so held in trust by such Paying Agent.
The Company may at any time, for the purpose of obtaining the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture or for any other purpose, pay, or by Company Order direct any Paying Agent to pay, to the Trustee all sums held in trust by the Company or such Paying Agent, such sums to be held by the Trustee upon the same trusts as those upon which such sums were held by the Company or such Paying Agent; and, upon such payment by any Paying Agent to the Trustee, such Paying Agent shall be released from all further liability with respect to such money.
Any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then held by the Company, in trust for the payment of the principal of and any premium or interest on any Security of any series and remaining unclaimed for two years after such principal and any premium or interest has become due and payable shall be paid to the Company on Company Request, or (if then held by the Company) shall be discharged from such trust; and the Holder of such Security or any Coupon appertaining thereto shall thereafter, as an unsecured general creditor, look only to the Company for payment thereof, and all liability of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust money, and all liability of the Company as trustee thereof, shall thereupon cease; that the Trustee or such Paying Agent, before being required to make any such repayment, may at the expense of the Company cause to be transmitted in the manner and to the extent provided by Section 106, notice that such money remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein, which shall not be less than 30 days from the date of such notification, any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining will be repaid to the Company.

provided, however,
SECTION 1006. Payment of Taxes.
The Company will pay or discharge or cause to be paid or discharged, before the same shall become delinquent, all taxes, assessments and governmental charges levied or imposed upon the Company or any Subsidiary or upon the income, profits or property of the Company or any Subsidiary; that the Company shall not be required to pay or discharge or cause to be paid or discharged any such tax, assessment or charge whose amount, applicability or validity is being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings or if failure to so pay, discharge, or cause to be paid or discharged will not be disadvantageous in any material respect to the Holders.

condition applies shall, by Act of such Holders, either waive such compliance in such instance or generally waive compliance with such term, provision or condition, but no such waiver shall extend to or affect such term, provision or condition except to the extent so expressly waived, and, until such waiver shall become effective, the obligations of the Company and the duties of the Trustee in respect of any such term, provision or condition shall remain in full force and effect.

The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company in writing of the Securities selected for redemption and, in the case of any Securities selected for partial redemption, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed.

(6) that the redemption is for a sinking fund, if such is the case, and
(7) the CUSIP number, if any.
A notice of redemption published as contemplated by Section 106 need not identify particular Registered Securities to be redeemed.

provided, however
SECTION 1105. Deposit of Redemption Price.
Prior to any Redemption Date, the Company shall deposit with the Trustee or with a Paying Agent (or, if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 1003) an amount of money sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of, and (except if the Redemption Date shall be an Interest Payment Date, unless the Securities being redeemed provide that interest due on an Interest Payment Date that falls on a Redemption Date is payable to the Person to whom principal is payable) accrued interest on, all the Securities which are to be redeemed on that date.
SECTION 1106. Securities Payable on Redemption Date.
Notice of redemption having been given as aforesaid, the Securities so to be redeemed shall, on the Redemption Date, become due and payable at the Redemption Price therein specified, and from and after such date (unless the Company shall default in the payment of the Redemption Price and accrued interest) such Securities shall cease to bear interest and the Coupons for such interest appertaining to any Bearer Securities so to be redeemed, except to the extent provided below, shall be void. Upon surrender of any such Security for redemption in accordance with said notice, together with all Coupons, if any, appertaining thereto maturing after the Redemption Date, such Security shall be paid by the Company at the Redemption Price, together with accrued interest to the Redemption Date; that installments of interest on Bearer Securities whose Stated Maturity Date is on or prior to the Redemption Date shall be payable only at an office or agency located outside the United States (except as otherwise provided in Section 1002) and, unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301, only upon presentation and surrender of Coupons for such interest, and that, unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301, installments of interest on Registered Securities whose Stated Maturity Date is on or prior to the Redemption Date shall be payable to the Holders of such Securities, or one or more Predecessor Securities, registered as such at the close of business on the relevant Record Dates according to their terms and the provisions of Sections 305 and 307.
provided, however,
provided, further,
If any Bearer Security surrendered for redemption shall not be accompanied by all appurtenant Coupons maturing after the Redemption Date, such Security may be paid after deducting from the Redemption Price an amount equal to the face amount of all such missing
 
Coupons, or the surrender of such missing Coupon or Coupons may be waived by the Company and the Trustee if there be furnished to them such security or indemnity as they may require to save each of them and any Paying Agent harmless. If thereafter the Holder of such Security shall surrender to the Trustee or any Paying Agent any such missing Coupon in respect of which a deduction shall have been made from the Redemption Price, such Holder shall be entitled to receive the amount so deducted; that interest represented by Coupons shall be payable only at an office or agency located outside the United States (except as otherwise provided in Section 1002) and, unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301, only upon presentation and surrender of those Coupons.
provided, however,
If any Security called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, the principal and any premium shall, until paid, bear interest from the Redemption Date at the rate prescribed therefor in the Security.
SECTION 1107. Securities Redeemed in Part.
Any Registered Security which is to be redeemed only in part shall be surrendered at a Place of Payment therefor (with, if the Company or the Trustee so requires, due endorsement by, or a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder thereof or his or her attorney duly authorized in writing), and the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of such Security without service charge, a new Registered Security or Securities of the same series and of like tenor, of any authorized denomination as requested by such Holder, in aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the principal of the Security so surrendered. If a Security in permanent global form is so surrendered, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the U.S. Depositary or Common Depositary for such Security in permanent global form, without service charge, a new Security in permanent global form in a denomination equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the principal of the Security in permanent global form so surrendered.
SECTION 1201. Applicability of Article.
The provisions of this Article shall be applicable to any sinking fund for the retirement of Securities of a series except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 for Securities of such series.

If provided for by the terms of Securities of any series, the cash amount of any sinking fund payment may be subject to reduction as provided in Section 1202. Each sinking fund payment shall be applied to the redemption of Securities of any series as provided for by the terms of Securities of such series.
 
SECTION 1202. Satisfaction of Sinking Fund Payments with Securities.
The Company (1) may deliver Outstanding Securities of a series (other than any previously called for redemption), together in the case of any Bearer Securities of such series with all unmatured Coupons appertaining thereto, and (2) may apply as a credit Securities of a series which have been redeemed either at the election of the Company pursuant to the terms of such Securities or through the application of permitted optional sinking fund payments pursuant to the terms of such Securities, in each case in satisfaction of all or any part of any sinking fund payment with respect to the Securities of such series required to be made pursuant to the terms of such Securities as provided for by the terms of such series; that such Securities have not been previously so credited. Such Securities shall be received and credited for such purpose by the Trustee at the Redemption Price specified in such Securities for redemption through operation of the sinking fund and the amount of such sinking fund payment shall be reduced accordingly.
provided
SECTION 1203. Redemption of Securities for Sinking Fund.
Not less than 60 days prior to each sinking fund payment date for any series of Securities, the Company will deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate specifying the amount of the next ensuing sinking fund payment for that series pursuant to the terms of that series, the portion thereof, if any, which is to be satisfied by payment of cash and the portion thereof, if any, which is to be satisfied by delivering and crediting Securities of that series pursuant to Section 1202 and will also deliver to the Trustee any Securities to be so delivered. Not less than 30 days before each such sinking fund payment date the Trustee shall select the Securities to be redeemed upon such sinking fund payment date in the manner specified in Section 1103 and cause notice of the redemption thereof to be given in the name of and at the expense of the Company in the manner provided in Section 1104.

Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Security set forth on the pages following the certificate of authentication hereon, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.
Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee referred to below, directly or through an Authenticating Agent, by manual signature of an authorized signatory, this Security shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this instrument to be duly executed under its corporate seal.
 
 
This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the "Securities"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under an Indenture, dated as of October 16, 2012 (herein called the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon (herein called the "Trustee," which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the Securities of the series designated herein, limited in aggregate principal amount in accordance with the terms of the exchange offers described in the Confidential Offering Memorandum of the Company dated as of September 14, 2012; provided, however, that the Company, without notice to or the consent of the Holders, may issue additional Securities of this series and thereby increase such principal amount in the future, on the same terms and conditions (except for issue date, public offering price and, if applicable, the date from which interest accrues and the first Interest Payment Date) and with the same CUSIP number as the Securities of this series.
The Holder of this Security is entitled to the benefits of the Registration Rights Agreement dated as of October 16, 2012, by and among the Company and the Dealer Managers, as defined therein (as the same may be amended from time to time, the "Registration Rights Agreement"). In the event of a Registration Default (as such term is defined in the Registration Rights Agreement), additional interest shall accrue on the Securities of this series over and above the interest set forth in the title of the Securities of this series from and including the date on which any such Registration Default shall occur to but excluding the date on which all filings, declarations of effectiveness and consummations, as the case may be, have been achieved which, if achieved on a timely basis, would have prevented the occurrence of all of the then existing Registration Defaults, at a rate of 0.25% per annum during the 90-day period immediately following the first occurrence of a Registration Default, which shall increase by 0.25% per annum at the end of each subsequent 90-day period up to a maximum of 0.50% per annum with respect to all Registration Defaults. Any such additional interest shall be paid to the same Persons, at the same times and in the same manner as ordinary interest on the Securities of this series. Any Exchange Debenture (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) issued in exchange for this Security shall evidence the same continuing indebtedness as this Security. Under no circumstances shall the surrender of this Security and the issue of an Exchange Debenture in exchange therefor constitute new indebtedness or obligate the Company to repay the principal amount of this Security in connection with the exchange.
The Securities of this series are redeemable at the option of the Company at any time, in whole or in part, at a Redemption Price equal to the greater of the following amounts, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the Redemption Date: (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Securities of this series to be redeemed, and (ii) the sum of the present values of the Remaining Scheduled Payments.
In determining the present values of the Remaining Scheduled Payments, such payments will be discounted to the Redemption Date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) using a discount rate equal to the Treasury Rate plus 20 basis points. A partial redemption of the Securities of this series may be effected by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate and may provide for the selection for redemption of portions (equal to the minimum authorized denomination for the Securities of this series or any integral multiple thereof) of the principal amount of Securities of a denomination larger than the minimum authorized denomination for the Securities of this series.
Notice of any redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the Redemption Date to each Holder of the Securities of this series to be redeemed.
Unless the Company defaults in payment of the Redemption Price, on and after the Redemption Date interest will cease to accrue on the Securities of this series or portions thereof called for redemption.
"Treasury Rate," with respect to any Redemption Date, means the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue. In determining this rate, it is assumed that a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) is equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such Redemption Date.
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Quotation Agent as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term (as measured from the Redemption Date) of the Securities of this series to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Securities.
"Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, (a) if the Quotation Agent obtains five or more Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of such quotations, after excluding the highest and lowest of such quotations, or (b) if the Quotation Agent obtains fewer than five such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations, or (c) if only one reference Treasury Dealer Quotation is received, such quotation.
"Quotation Agent" means any Reference Treasury Dealer appointed by the Company.
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means (1) each of Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated (or their respective affiliates that are Primary Treasury Dealers) and their respective successors and (2) one Primary Treasury Dealer selected by Mitsubishi UFJ Securities (USA), Inc. or its successor after consultation with the Company; provided, however, that if any of the foregoing specified in (1) or (2) shall cease to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer in New York City (a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), the Company will substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer, and (3) any other Primary Treasury Dealer appointed by the Company.
"Reference Treasury Dealers Quotations" mean, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date, the average, as determined by the Quotation Agent, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Quotation Agent by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding such Redemption Date.
"Remaining Scheduled Payments" means, with respect to any Security of this series, the remaining scheduled payments of the principal and interest thereon that would be due after the related Redemption Date but for such redemption; , that, if such Redemption Date is not an Interest Payment Date with respect to such Security, the amount of the next scheduled interest payment thereon will be reduced (solely for purposes of this definition) by the amount of interest accrued thereon to such Redemption Date.
provided, however
The Company shall give the Trustee notice of the Redemption Price promptly after the calculation thereof and the Trustee shall not be responsible for such calculation.
This Security shall not be subject to any sinking fund.
If a change of control triggering event occurs, the Company will be required to make an offer (the "change of control offer") to each Holder of the Securities of this series to repurchase all or any part (equal to $1,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) of the Securities of this series held by such Holder on the terms set forth in this Security. In the change of control offer, the Company will be required to offer payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities of this series repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to the date of repurchase (the "change of control payment"). Within 30 days following any change of control triggering event or, at the Company's option, prior to any change of control, but after public announcement of the transaction that constitutes or may constitute the change of control, a notice will be mailed to the Holders of the Securities of this series describing the transaction that constitutes or may constitute the change of control triggering event and offering to repurchase such Securities on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (the "change of control payment date"). The notice will, if mailed prior to the date of consummation of the change of control, state that the offer to purchase is conditioned on the change of control triggering event occurring on or prior to the change of control payment date.
On the change of control payment date, the Company will, to the extent lawful:
 
 
 
The Company will not be required to make a change of control offer upon the occurrence of a change of control triggering event if a third party makes such an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for an offer made by the Company and the third party repurchases all Securities of this series properly tendered and not withdrawn under its offer. In addition, the Company will not repurchase any Securities of this series if there has occurred and is continuing on the change of control payment date an Event of Default, other than a default in the payment of the change of control payment upon a change of control triggering event.
The Company will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Securities of this series as a result of a change of control triggering event. To the extent that the provisions of any such securities laws or regulations conflict with the change of control offer provisions of the Securities of this series, the Company will comply with those securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the change of control offer provisions of the Securities of this series by virtue of any such conflict.
For purposes of the change of control offer provisions of the Securities of this series, the following terms will be applicable:
"Change of control" means the occurrence of any of the following:
 
 
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a transaction will not be deemed to involve a change of control if (1) the Company becomes a direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of a holding company and (2) either (A) the direct or indirect holders of the voting stock of such holding company immediately following that transaction are substantially the same as the holders of the Company's voting stock immediately prior to that transaction or (B) immediately following that transaction no person (other than a holding company satisfying the requirements of this sentence) is the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the voting stock of such holding company.
"Change of control triggering event" means the occurrence of both a change of control and a rating event.
"Continuing directors" means, as of any date of determination, any member of the Board of Directors who (1) was a member of the Board of Directors on the date the Securities of this series were originally issued or (2) was nominated for election, elected or appointed to the Board of Directors with the approval of a majority of the continuing directors who were members of the Board of Directors at the time of such nomination, election or appointment (either by a specific vote or by approval of the Company's proxy statement in which such member was named as a nominee for election as a director, without objection to such nomination).
"Fitch" means Fitch Ratings.
"Investment grade rating" means a rating equal to or higher than BBB- (or the equivalent) by Fitch, Baa3 (or the equivalent) by Moody's and BBB- (or the equivalent) by S&P, and the equivalent investment grade credit rating from any additional rating agency or rating agencies selected by the Company.
"Moody's" means Moody's Investors Service Inc.
"Rating agencies" means (1) each of Fitch, Moody's and S&P; and (2) if any of Fitch, Moody's or S&P ceases to rate the Securities of this series or fails to make a rating of such Securities publicly available for reasons outside of the Company's control, a "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" as defined in Section 3(a)(62) of the Exchange Act selected by the Company (as certified by a resolution of the Board of Directors) as a replacement agency for Fitch, Moody's or S&P, or all of them, as the case may be.
"Rating event" means the rating on the Securities of this series is lowered by each of the rating agencies and such Securities are rated below an investment grade rating by each of the rating agencies on any day within the 60-day period (which 60-day period will be extended so long as the rating of the such Securities is under publicly announced consideration for a possible downgrade by any of the rating agencies) after the earlier of (1) the occurrence of a change of control and (2) public notice of the occurrence of a change of control or the Company's intention to effect a change of control; provided, however, that a rating event otherwise arising by virtue of a particular reduction in rating will not be deemed to have occurred in respect of a particular change of control (and thus will not be deemed a rating event for purposes of the definition of "change of control triggering event") if the rating agencies making the reduction in rating to which this definition would otherwise apply do not announce or publicly confirm or inform the Trustee in writing at the Company's request that the reduction was the result, in whole or in part, of any event or circumstance comprised of or arising as a result of, or in respect of, the applicable change of control (whether or not the applicable change of control has occurred at the time of the rating event). If any rating agency is not providing a rating of the Securities of this series on any day during the relevant period for any reason and the Company has not selected a replacement rating agency pursuant to the terms of the Securities of this series, the rating of such rating agency shall be deemed to be below an investment grade rating on such day and such rating agency will be deemed to have lowered its rating of the Securities of this series during the relevant period.
"S&P" means Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.
"Voting stock" means, with respect to any specified "person" (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) as of any date, the capital stock of such person that is at the time entitled to vote generally in the election of the board of directors of such person.

If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of this series shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Securities of this series may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of all series to be affected. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Securities of each or all series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
As set forth in, and subject to, the provisions of the Indenture, no Holder of any Security of this series will have any right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for any remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have previously given to the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to this series, the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of this series shall have made written request, and offered reasonable indemnity, to the Trustee to institute such proceeding as trustee, and the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of this series a direction inconsistent with such request and shall have failed to institute such proceeding within 60 days; , , that such limitations do not apply to a suit instituted by the Holder hereof for the enforcement of payment of the principal of or premium, if any, or interest on this Security on or after the respective due dates expressed or provided for herein.

No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on this Security at the times, places, and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Security is registrable in the Security Register, upon surrender for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Securities of this series and of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
The Securities of this series are issuable only in global or definitive registered form, without coupons, in denominations of $1,000 or any whole multiple of $1,000 above that amount.

This Security, if in global form, is exchangeable for Securities of this series in definitive registered form only if (x) The Depository Trust Company (the "Depository") notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depository for this global Security or if at any time the Depository ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act, and the Company has not appointed a successor Depository within 90 days of that notice or of its becoming aware of such cessation, (y) the Company in its sole discretion and subject to the procedures of the Depository determines that this Security shall be exchangeable for definitive Securities in registered form or (z) an Event of Default, or an event which with the passage of time or the giving of notice or both would become an Event of Default, with respect to the Securities represented hereby has occurred and is continuing, provided that the definitive Securities so issued in exchange for this permanent global Security shall be in denominations of $1,000 or any whole multiple of $1,000 above that amount and be of like aggregate principal amount and tenor as the portion of this permanent global Security to be exchanged. Except as provided above, owners of beneficial interests in this permanent global Security will not be entitled to receive physical delivery of Securities in definitive registered form and will not be considered the Holders thereof for any purpose under the Indenture.
Any Security in global form that is exchangeable pursuant to the preceding paragraph shall be exchangeable for Securities of this series in definitive registered form registered in such names as the Depository shall direct.
Neither the Company, the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in a Security in global form or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests.
No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
Prior to the due presentment of this Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Security is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes (subject to the provisions of the Indenture), whether or not this Security is overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

This Security is one of the Securities of the series designated herein, limited in aggregate principal amount in accordance with the terms of the exchange offers described in the Confidential Offering Memorandum of the Company dated as of September 14, 2012; provided, however, that the Company, without notice to or the consent of the Holders, may issue additional Securities of this series and thereby increase such principal amount in the future, on the same terms and conditions (except for issue date, public offering price and, if applicable, the date from which interest accrues and the first Interest Payment Date) and with the same CUSIP number as the Securities of this series.
The Holder of this Security is entitled to the benefits of the Registration Rights Agreement dated as of October 16, 2012, by and among the Company and the Dealer Managers, as defined therein (as the same may be amended from time to time, the "Registration Rights Agreement"). In the event of a Registration Default (as such term is defined in the Registration Rights Agreement), additional interest shall accrue on the Securities of this series over and above the interest set forth in the title of the Securities of this series from and including the date on which any such Registration Default shall occur to but excluding the date on which all filings, declarations of effectiveness and consummations, as the case may be, have been achieved which, if achieved on a timely basis, would have prevented the occurrence of all of the then existing Registration Defaults, at a rate of 0.25% per annum during the 90-day period immediately following the first occurrence of a Registration Default, which shall increase by 0.25% per annum at the end of each subsequent 90-day period up to a maximum of 0.50% per annum with respect to all Registration Defaults. Any such additional interest shall be paid to the same Persons, at the same times and in the same manner as ordinary interest on the Securities of this series. Any Exchange Debenture (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) issued in exchange for this Security shall evidence the same continuing indebtedness as this Security. Under no circumstances shall the surrender of this Security and the issue of an Exchange Debenture in exchange therefor constitute new indebtedness or obligate the Company to repay the principal amount of this Security in connection with the exchange.
The Securities of this series are redeemable at the option of the Company at any time, in whole or in part, at a Redemption Price equal to the greater of the following amounts, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the Redemption Date: (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Securities of this series to be redeemed, and (ii) the sum of the present values of the Remaining Scheduled Payments.
In determining the present values of the Remaining Scheduled Payments, such payments will be discounted to the Redemption Date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) using a discount rate equal to the Treasury Rate plus 20 basis points. A partial redemption of the Securities of this series may be effected by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate and may provide for the selection for redemption of portions (equal to the minimum authorized denomination for the Securities of this series or any integral multiple thereof) of the principal amount of Securities of a denomination larger than the minimum authorized denomination for the Securities of this series.
Notice of any redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the Redemption Date to each Holder of the Securities of this series to be redeemed.
Unless the Company defaults in payment of the Redemption Price, on and after the Redemption Date interest will cease to accrue on the Securities of this series or portions thereof called for redemption.
"Treasury Rate," with respect to any Redemption Date, means the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue. In determining this rate, it is assumed that a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) is equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such Redemption Date.
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Quotation Agent as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term (as measured from the Redemption Date) of the Securities of this series to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Securities.
"Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, (a) if the Quotation Agent obtains five or more Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of such quotations, after excluding the highest and lowest of such quotations, or (b) if the Quotation Agent obtains fewer than five such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations, or (c) if only one reference Treasury Dealer Quotation is received, such quotation.
"Quotation Agent" means any Reference Treasury Dealer appointed by the Company.
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means (1) each of Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated (or their respective affiliates that are Primary Treasury Dealers) and their respective successors and (2) one Primary Treasury Dealer selected by Mitsubishi UFJ Securities (USA), Inc. or its successor after consultation with the Company; provided, however, that if any of the foregoing specified in (1) or (2) shall cease to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer in New York City (a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), the Company will substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer, and (3) any other Primary Treasury Dealer appointed by the Company.
"Reference Treasury Dealers Quotations" mean, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date, the average, as determined by the Quotation Agent, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Quotation Agent by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding such Redemption Date.
"Remaining Scheduled Payments" means, with respect to any Security of this series, the remaining scheduled payments of the principal and interest thereon that would be due after the related Redemption Date but for such redemption; , that, if such Redemption Date is not an Interest Payment Date with respect to such Security, the amount of the next scheduled interest payment thereon will be reduced (solely for purposes of this definition) by the amount of interest accrued thereon to such Redemption Date.
provided, however
The Company shall give the Trustee notice of the Redemption Price promptly after the calculation thereof and the Trustee shall not be responsible for such calculation.
This Security shall not be subject to any sinking fund.
If a change of control triggering event occurs, the Company will be required to make an offer (the "change of control offer") to each Holder of the Securities of this series to repurchase all or any part (equal to $1,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) of the Securities of this series held by such Holder on the terms set forth in this Security. In the change of control offer, the Company will be required to offer payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities of this series repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to the date of repurchase (the "change of control payment"). Within 30 days following any change of control triggering event or, at the Company's option, prior to any change of control, but after public announcement of the transaction that constitutes or may constitute the change of control, a notice will be mailed to the Holders of the Securities of this series describing the transaction that constitutes or may constitute the change of control triggering event and offering to repurchase such Securities on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (the "change of control payment date"). The notice will, if mailed prior to the date of consummation of the change of control, state that the offer to purchase is conditioned on the change of control triggering event occurring on or prior to the change of control payment date.
On the change of control payment date, the Company will, to the extent lawful:
 
 
 
The Company will not be required to make a change of control offer upon the occurrence of a change of control triggering event if a third party makes such an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for an offer made by the Company and the third party repurchases all Securities of this series properly tendered and not withdrawn under its offer. In addition, the Company will not repurchase any Securities of this series if there has occurred and is continuing on the change of control payment date an Event of Default, other than a default in the payment of the change of control payment upon a change of control triggering event.
The Company will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Securities of this series as a result of a change of control triggering event. To the extent that the provisions of any such securities laws or regulations conflict with the change of control offer provisions of the Securities of this series, the Company will comply with those securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the change of control offer provisions of the Securities of this series by virtue of any such conflict.
For purposes of the change of control offer provisions of the Securities of this series, the following terms will be applicable:
"Change of control" means the occurrence of any of the following:
 
 
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a transaction will not be deemed to involve a change of control if (1) the Company becomes a direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of a holding company and (2) either (A) the direct or indirect holders of the voting stock of such holding company immediately following that transaction are substantially the same as the holders of the Company's voting stock immediately prior to that transaction or (B) immediately following that transaction no person (other than a holding company satisfying the requirements of this sentence) is the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the voting stock of such holding company.
"Change of control triggering event" means the occurrence of both a change of control and a rating event.
"Continuing directors" means, as of any date of determination, any member of the Board of Directors who (1) was a member of the Board of Directors on the date the Securities of this series were originally issued or (2) was nominated for election, elected or appointed to the Board of Directors with the approval of a majority of the continuing directors who were members of the Board of Directors at the time of such nomination, election or appointment (either by a specific vote or by approval of the Company's proxy statement in which such member was named as a nominee for election as a director, without objection to such nomination).
"Fitch" means Fitch Ratings.
"Investment grade rating" means a rating equal to or higher than BBB- (or the equivalent) by Fitch, Baa3 (or the equivalent) by Moody's and BBB- (or the equivalent) by S&P, and the equivalent investment grade credit rating from any additional rating agency or rating agencies selected by the Company.
"Moody's" means Moody's Investors Service Inc.
"Rating agencies" means (1) each of Fitch, Moody's and S&P; and (2) if any of Fitch, Moody's or S&P ceases to rate the Securities of this series or fails to make a rating of such Securities publicly available for reasons outside of the Company's control, a "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" as defined in Section 3(a)(62) of the Exchange Act selected by the Company (as certified by a resolution of the Board of Directors) as a replacement agency for Fitch, Moody's or S&P, or all of them, as the case may be.
"Rating event" means the rating on the Securities of this series is lowered by each of the rating agencies and such Securities are rated below an investment grade rating by each of the rating agencies on any day within the 60-day period (which 60-day period will be extended so long as the rating of the such Securities is under publicly announced consideration for a possible downgrade by any of the rating agencies) after the earlier of (1) the occurrence of a change of control and (2) public notice of the occurrence of a change of control or the Company's intention to effect a change of control; provided, however, that a rating event otherwise arising by virtue of a particular reduction in rating will not be deemed to have occurred in respect of a particular change of control (and thus will not be deemed a rating event for purposes of the definition of "change of control triggering event") if the rating agencies making the reduction in rating to which this definition would otherwise apply do not announce or publicly confirm or inform the Trustee in writing at the Company's request that the reduction was the result, in whole or in part, of any event or circumstance comprised of or arising as a result of, or in respect of, the applicable change of control (whether or not the applicable change of control has occurred at the time of the rating event). If any rating agency is not providing a rating of the Securities of this series on any day during the relevant period for any reason and the Company has not selected a replacement rating agency pursuant to the terms of the Securities of this series, the rating of such rating agency shall be deemed to be below an investment grade rating on such day and such rating agency will be deemed to have lowered its rating of the Securities of this series during the relevant period.
"S&P" means Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.
"Voting stock" means, with respect to any specified "person" (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) as of any date, the capital stock of such person that is at the time entitled to vote generally in the election of the board of directors of such person.

As set forth in, and subject to, the provisions of the Indenture, no Holder of any Security of this series will have any right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for any remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have previously given to the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to this series, the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of this series shall have made written request, and offered reasonable indemnity, to the Trustee to institute such proceeding as trustee, and the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of this series a direction inconsistent with such request and shall have failed to institute such proceeding within 60 days; , , that such limitations do not apply to a suit instituted by the Holder hereof for the enforcement of payment of the principal of or premium, if any, or interest on this Security on or after the respective due dates expressed or provided for herein.

This Security, if in global form, is exchangeable for Securities of this series in definitive registered form only if (x) The Depository Trust Company (the "Depository") notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depository for this global Security or if at any time the Depository ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act, and the Company has not appointed a successor Depository within 90 days of that notice or of its becoming aware of such cessation, (y) the Company in its sole discretion and subject to the procedures of the Depository determines that this Security shall be exchangeable for definitive Securities in registered form or (z) an Event of Default, or an event which with the passage of time or the giving of notice or both would become an Event of Default, with respect to the Securities represented hereby has occurred and is continuing, provided that the definitive Securities so issued in exchange for this permanent global Security shall be in denominations of $1,000 or any whole multiple of $1,000 above that amount and be of like aggregate principal amount and tenor as the portion of this permanent global Security to be exchanged.

Section 4(l)

5. Additional Interest.
(a) The parties hereto acknowledge that the Holders of New Debentures or Exchange Debentures, as the case may be, will suffer damages if the Company fails to perform its obligations under or hereof and that it would not be feasible to ascertain the extent of such damages. Accordingly, in the event that:
Section 2
3
 
 
 
 
 
 
(each such event referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) through (vi), a ""), then additional interest ("") will accrue on the principal amount of the New Debentures or the Exchange Debentures affected thereby (in addition to the stated interest on the New Debentures and the Exchange Debentures), from and including the date on which any Registration Default first occurs and while any such Registration Default has occurred and is continuing, to but excluding the date on which all filings, declarations of effectiveness and consummations, as the case may be, have been achieved which, if achieved on a timely basis, would have prevented the occurrence of all of the then existing Registration Defaults. Additional Interest will accrue at a rate of 0.25% per annum during the 90-day period immediately following such first occurrence of a Registration Default and while any such Registration Default has occurred and is continuing, and shall increase by 0.25% per annum at the end of each subsequent 90-day period up to a maximum of 0.50% per annum with respect to all Registration Defaults, until the date on which all of the filings, declarations of effectiveness and consummations referred to in the preceding sentence have been achieved, on which date the interest rate on the applicable New Debentures and Exchange Debentures will revert to the interest rate originally borne by such debentures.
Registration Default
Additional Interest
(b) The Company shall notify the Trustee immediately upon its knowledge of the happening of each and every Registration Default.

The Additional Interest due shall be payable on each interest payment date specified by the Indenture to the record holders entitled to receive the interest payment to be made on such date.
 
(c) The parties hereto agree that the Additional Interest provided for in this constitutes a reasonable estimate of the damages that will be suffered by Holders of New Debentures or Exchange Debentures by reason of the happening of any Registration Default.
Section 5
(d) All of the Company's obligations set forth in this shall survive the termination of this Agreement.
Section 5
(e) Any Additional Interest under this will constitute liquidated damages and will be the exclusive remedy, monetary or otherwise, available to any holder of New Debentures with respect to any Registration Default.

Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the Company shall not have any obligation whatsoever in respect of any underwriters' discounts or commissions, brokerage commissions, dealers' selling concessions, transfer taxes or, except as otherwise expressly set forth herein, any other selling expenses incurred in connection with the underwriting, offering or sale of New Debentures or Exchange Debentures by or on behalf of any person.

7. Indemnification and Contribution.
(a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Holder of New Debentures or Exchange Debentures, as the case may be, covered by any Registration Statement (including each Dealer Manager and, with respect to any Prospectus delivery as contemplated in hereof, each Exchanging Dealer), the directors, officers, employees and agents of each such Holder and each person who controls any such Holder within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which any of the foregoing may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in such Registration Statement as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in any preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of a Prospectus, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by it in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that the
Section 4(h)
 
Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any such Holder specifically for inclusion therein and provided, further, that with respect to any untrue statement or omission of a material fact made in any preliminary Prospectus, the indemnity agreement contained in this shall not inure to the benefit of any indemnified party under this indemnity agreement from whom the person asserting any such loss, claim, damage or liability purchased the New Debentures or Exchange Debentures concerned to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability of such party occurs under the circumstance where (i) the Company had previously furnished copies of the Prospectus to such indemnified party in accordance with the terms hereof and prior to the written confirmation of the sale of such New Debentures or Exchange Debentures, as applicable, to such person, (ii) to the extent required by applicable law, a copy of the final Prospectus was not sent or given to such person at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of such New Debentures or Exchange Debentures, as applicable, to such person and (iii) the untrue statement in or omission from the preliminary Prospectus was corrected in the final Prospectus. This indemnity agreement shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
Section 7(a)
The Company also agrees to indemnify as provided in this or contribute as provided in hereof to Losses of each underwriter of New Debentures, registered under a Shelf Registration Statement, their directors, officers, employees or agents and each person who controls such underwriter on substantially the same basis as that of the indemnification of the selling Holders provided in this and shall, if requested by any Holder, enter into an underwriting agreement reflecting such agreement, as provided in hereof.

Section 7(d)
Section 7(a)
Section 4(q)
(b) Each Holder of securities covered by a Registration Statement (including each Dealer Manager and, with respect to any Prospectus delivery as contemplated in hereof, each Exchanging Dealer), severally and not jointly, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, and each of its directors, officers, employees and agents and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act (each, a ""), to the same extent as the indemnity in from the Company to each such Holder, but only with reference to written information relating to such Holder furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Holder specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity, and further agrees to reimburse each Company Indemnitee for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Company Indemnitee in connection with investigating or defending or preparing to defend against any such loss, claim, damage, liability, judgment or action as such expenses are incurred. This indemnity agreement shall be in addition to any liability which any such Holder may otherwise have.
Section 4(h)
Company Indemnitee
Section 7(a)
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this or notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section, notify the
Section 7
 
indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses; and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); provided, however, that such counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest; (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party; (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action; or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party shall not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties (not to be unreasonably withheld), settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding. An indemnifying party shall not be liable under this to any indemnified party regarding any settlement or compromise or consent to the entry of judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent is consented to by such indemnifying party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.
Section 7
(d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a) or (b) of this is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, then each applicable indemnifying party shall have an obligation to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) (collectively "") to which such indemnified party may be subject in such proportion as is
Section 7
Losses
 
appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by such indemnifying party, on the one hand, and such indemnified party, on the other hand, from the Initial Exchange Offer and the Registration Statement which resulted in such Losses; provided, however, that in no case shall any Dealer Manager who is a Holder of any New Debenture or Exchange Debenture be responsible, in the aggregate, for any amount in excess of the Fee applicable to such New Debenture, or in the case of an Exchange Debenture, applicable to the New Debenture that was exchangeable into such Exchange Debenture, in connection with the Initial Exchange Offer as set forth in the Dealer Manager Agreement, nor shall any underwriter be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the New Debentures or Exchange Debentures, as the case may be, purchased by such underwriter under the Registration Statement which resulted in such Losses. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of such indemnifying party, on the one hand, and such indemnified party, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to (x) the aggregate principal amount of Old Debentures exchanged in the Initial Exchange Offer (before deducting expenses), plus (y) the total amount of Additional Interest which the Company was not required to pay as a result of registering the New Debentures or Exchange Debentures covered by the Registration Statement which resulted in such Losses, minus (z) the aggregate amount of Fees paid by the Company in connection with the Initial Exchange Offer under the Dealer Manager Agreement. Benefits received by the Dealer Managers shall be deemed to be equal to the aggregate amount of Fees received by the Dealer Managers in connection with the Initial Exchange Offer under the Dealer Manager Agreement, and benefits received by any Holders shall be deemed to be equal to the value of receiving New Debentures or Exchange Debentures, as applicable, registered under the Act. Benefits received by any underwriter shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, as set forth on the cover page of the Prospectus forming a part of the Registration Statement which resulted in such Losses. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the indemnifying party, on the one hand, or by the indemnified party, on the other hand, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The parties agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Holders were treated as one entity for such purpose) or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section, each person who controls a Holder within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of such Holder shall have the same rights to contribution as such Holder, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each director, officer, employee and agent of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d).
 
(e) The provisions of this shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Holder or the Company or any of the officers, directors, employees, agents or controlling persons referred to in this , and shall survive the sale by a Holder of securities covered by a Registration Statement.
Section 7
Section 7
8. Underwritten Registrations.
(a) If any of the New Debentures covered by any Shelf Registration Statement are to be sold in an underwritten offering, the Managing Underwriters shall be selected by the Majority Holders, subject to the reasonable approval of the Company.
(b) No Holder may participate in any underwritten offering pursuant to any Shelf Registration Statement, unless such Holder (i) agrees to sell such Holder's New Debentures on the basis reasonably provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the persons entitled hereunder to approve such arrangements, and (ii) completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements.
The Company has not, as of the date hereof, entered into, nor shall it on or after the date hereof, enter into, any agreement with respect to any of its securities that is inconsistent with the rights granted to the Holders herein or that otherwise conflicts with the provisions hereof.
9.
No Inconsistent Agreements.
The provisions of this Agreement, including the provisions of this sentence, may not be amended, qualified, modified or supplemented, and waivers or consents to departures from the provisions hereof may not be given, unless the Company has obtained the written consent of the Majority Holders (or, after the consummation of any Registered Exchange Offer in accordance with hereof, the Holders of a majority in the aggregate principal amount of the Exchange Debentures); provided that, with respect to any matter that directly or indirectly affects the rights of the Dealer Managers hereunder, the Company shall obtain the written consent of the Dealer Managers against which such amendment, qualification, supplement, waiver or consent is to be effective. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a waiver or consent to departure from the provisions hereof with respect to a matter that relates exclusively to the rights of Holders whose securities are being sold pursuant to a Registration Statement and that does not directly or indirectly affect the rights of other Holders may alternatively be given by the Majority Holders of the New Debentures or Exchange Debentures, as the case may be, being sold rather than registered under such Registration Statement.

Exhibit 99
 
DECATUR, Ill., Oct. 15, 2012  Archer Daniels Midland Company (NYSE: ADM) announced today the results as of 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on October 12, 2012 (the "Expiration Date") of its private offers to exchange its outstanding debentures listed below (collectively, the "Old Debentures") for its 4.016% Debentures due 2043 (the "New Debentures") and cash (the "Exchange Offers"), in accordance with ADM's confidential offering memorandum dated September 14, 2012, as amended by the press release issued by ADM on September 28, 2012 (the "Offering Memorandum") and the related letter of transmittal.
According to information provided by D.F. King & Co., Inc., the exchange agent for the Exchange Offers, $567,883,000 in aggregate principal amount of the Old Debentures were validly tendered and not validly withdrawn in the Exchange Offers (the "Tendered Debentures"). The table below indicates the principal amount of each series of Old Debentures outstanding at the commencement of the Exchange Offers and the principal amount of each series of Old Debentures validly tendered and not validly withdrawn as of the Expiration Date.
 
The aggregate principal amount of the Tendered Debentures was in excess of $540,000,000, the maximum amount of Old Debentures to be accepted for exchange pursuant to the Offering Memorandum. Instead of accepting the Tendered Debentures on a prorated basis, ADM has accepted additional Tendered Debentures for exchange pursuant to ADM's right under federal securities laws to accept up to an additional 2% of the outstanding debentures subject to the Exchange Offers without extending the Exchange Offers. Accordingly, all of the Tendered Debentures have been accepted for exchange. The settlement date for the Tendered Debentures is expected to be October 16, 2012.
The New Debentures have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") or any state securities laws. Therefore, the New Debentures may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and any applicable state securities laws. ADM will enter into a registration rights agreement with respect to the New Debentures.
This press release is not an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any security. The Exchange Offers are being made solely by the Offering Memorandum and related letter of transmittal and only to such persons and in such jurisdictions as is permitted under applicable law.
Forward-Looking Information
This press release includes forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, including the current market demand for these types of securities and the securities of ADM and the negotiations between ADM and the dealer managers. These risks, uncertainties and other factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those referred to in the forward-looking statements. The reader is cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements. Other risks that could impact the offering are described in detail in the ADM Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

DECATUR, Ill., Oct. 30, 2012  Archer Daniels Midland Company (NYSE: ADM) today reported financial results for the quarter ended Sept. 30, 2012. The company reported net earnings for the quarter of $182 million, or $0.28 per share, down from $0.68 per share in the same period one year earlier. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.50, primarily reflecting a $0.16 charge related to ADMs planned divestment of Gruma. Segment operating profit was $498 million, including a $146 million charge related to Gruma.

1
Our first-quarter segment results were mixed, said ADM Chairman and CEO Patricia Woertz. Oilseeds performance was strong, the ethanol industry experienced sustained negative margins, and Agricultural Services managed well through a complicated quarter, challenged by the drought.
During the first quarter, we focused on actions that will improve returns. We made progress in our ongoing portfolio management efforts. And Im proud of our efforts and the results of our work to reduce costs and capital.
 
As we look ahead to 2013, we are bringing online our large Paraguay soybean processing plant as South American farmers are responding to market conditions with record plantings, and we are implementing plans to navigate the tight U.S. crop supply.
Longer-term, we remain optimistic as we see continued growth in global demand for protein meal and other agricultural products. We continue to execute our strategy, aligning our business to serve rising demand from customers around the world.
First Quarter 2012.5 Financial Highlights
 
 
 
 
Non-GAAP financial measures, see pages 5 and 10 for explanations and reconciliations
1
 
 
 
Adjusted EPS of 50 Cents, down 8 Cents
Adjusted EPS decreased primarily due to lower segment operating profit.
This quarters effective tax rate was 38 percent and included special factors. Excluding these items, the effective tax rate was 30 percent, in line with last years first quarter.
Oilseeds Earnings Improve Across All Three Regions
Oilseeds operating profit in the first quarter was $336 million, up $116 million from the same period one year earlier.
Crushing and origination operating profit was $256 million, up $150 million from the year-ago quarter on strong improvements by all three geographies. ADMs U.S. soybean operations delivered very strong results amid good U.S. demand and meal exports. In Europe, soybean and rapeseed crushing earnings improved significantly.
Refining, packaging, biodiesel and other generated a profit of $28 million for the quarter, down
$27 million, with steady results in North and South America offset by weaker European biodiesel results.
Cocoa and other results increased $27 million. Weaker cocoa press margins were offset by the absence of last years significant negative mark-to-market impacts.
Oilseeds results in Asia for the quarter were down $34 million from the prior years first quarter, principally reflecting ADMs share of the results from its equity investee Wilmar International Limited.
Corn Processing Results Weak on Continued Ethanol Industry Challenges
Corn processing operating profit was $68 million, a decrease of $115 million from the same period one year earlier.
Sweeteners and starches operating profit increased $64 million to $94 million, as tight sweetener industry capacity supported higher year-over-year selling prices. The year-ago quarters results were negatively impacted by higher net corn costs related to the timing effects of economic hedges.
Bioproducts results in the quarter decreased $179 million to a loss of $26 million. Weak U.S. ethanol exports, strong Brazilian imports and slow E15 implementation kept industry margins negative.
 
 
 
Agricultural Services Down From Strong Prior-Year Results
Agricultural Services operating profit excluding the Gruma charge was $224 million, down $99 million from the same period one year earlier.
Merchandising and handling earnings fell $101 million to $108 million, mostly due to weaker U.S. merchandising results impacted by the smaller U.S. harvest.
Transportation results decreased $9 million to $19 million impacted by low barge freight utilization driven by reduced corn exports.
Milling and other results increased $11 million, excluding the Gruma charge. Milling results remained strong, and ADM Alliance Nutrition saw improved margins amid stronger demand.
Other Financial Results Improve
Operating profit from ADMs Other Financial businesses was $16 million, up $21 million, with improved results from captive insurance and ADM Investor Services.

Segment Operating Profit and Corporate Results
(1)
(unaudited)
A non-GAAP financial measure
 
Total segment operating profit is ADMs consolidated income from operations before income tax that excludes certain corporate items. Management believes that segment operating profit is a useful measure of ADMs performance because it provides investors information about ADMs business unit performance excluding certain corporate overhead costs. Total segment operating profit is a non-GAAP financial measure and is not intended to replace earnings before income tax, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Total segment operating profit is not a measure of consolidated operating results under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to income before income taxes or any other measure of consolidated operating results under U.S. GAAP.
Beginning fourth quarter fiscal 2012, ADM realigned segment operating profit to reflect a change in how the company manages its businesses. As a result, ADM now reports Cocoa processing results as part of a new category in Oilseeds called Cocoa and Other and Milling results in an Agricultural Services category called Milling and Other. In addition, beginning fourth quarter fiscal 2012, the company discontinued the allocation of working capital interest to the operating segments. Prior periods have been restated to conform to the current period presentation.

The following exhibit is filed herewith:
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

EXHIBIT 99.1
 
DECATUR, Ill., Dec. 17, 2012  Archer Daniels Midland Company (NYSE: ADM) announced that it has sold its 23 percent interest in Gruma, S.A.B. de C.V. ("Gruma") and its equity investments in related joint ventures for $450 million plus an additional contingent payment of up to $60 million.
"We are pleased that we were able to reach an agreement with Gruma," said Ray G. Young, chief financial officer for ADM. "This sale is part of our ongoing portfolio management actions to redeploy capital into key strategic areas that will help drive higher returns in the future."
Under the terms of the sale, ADM received $450 million up front and will also receive up to $60 million in future contingent payments over the next 42 months. The contingent payments are triggered based upon various conditions, including: the increase in Gruma's stock market price, over the closing price of Gruma's stock determined for purposes of the transaction, at the end of the 42 month period; the difference between the price of Gruma's stock fixed for public offers made by Gruma and the closing price; the acquisition, by any strategic investor of Gruma, of 15 percent or more of Gruma's capital stock; or the percentage of Gruma's shares that are considered to be held by the public at any time.
While ADM has exited from its ownership position in Gruma and related investments, ADM expects to maintain a healthy and strong commercial relationship with Gruma globally. Bank of America Merrill Lynch was the financial adviser to ADM in the transaction.

DECATUR, Ill., Feb. 5, 2013  Archer Daniels Midland Company (NYSE: ADM) today reported financial results for the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2012. The company reported net earnings for the quarter of $510 million, or $0.77 per share, up from $0.12 per share in the same period one year earlier. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.60, up from $0.51 in the same period last year. Segment operating profit was $808 million.

The ADM team managed well despite challenges from the U.S. drought and from persistent, negative margins in the ethanol industry, said ADM Chairman and CEO Patricia Woertz. Our results in Oilseeds and Agricultural Services demonstrated the ability of our people to use our global asset network to prepare for and manage in a range of market conditions.
In North America, we fully utilized our oilseeds crushing capacity to meet strong global demand, and we adjusted our transportation and origination network to move goods efficiently despite constrained river traffic and a smaller corn crop. In South America, we leveraged our origination, transportation and export facilities to move the record corn crop to world markets. And, in Europe, we made some operational changes, and the market responded to reduced imports.
 
During our abbreviated fiscal year, we drove meaningful improvements in capital, costs and cash to enhance our future competitiveness. We continued taking action to improve underperforming businesses. As part of our ongoing portfolio management, we sold $570 million of non-core investments. And, through a companywide focus, we unlocked more than $1 billion in working cash.
Second Quarter 2012.5 Highlights
 
 
 
 
                                                        
  
    
   
Non-GAAP financial measures, see pages 5 and 12 for explanations and reconciliations
1
 
 
 
Adjusted EPS of 60 Cents, up 9 Cents
Adjusted EPS increased primarily due to higher segment operating profit.
This fiscal years effective tax rate of 30 percent was in line with the same six-month period last year.
Oilseeds Earnings Improve Across All Three Regions
Oilseeds operating profit in the second quarter was $411 million, up $202 million from the same period one year earlier. Results included unfavorable mark-to-market timing effects of about $50 million (about $0.05 per share), compared to an unfavorable impact of about $110 million in the year-ago quarter.
Crushing and origination operating profit was $261 million, up $140 million from the year-ago quarter on strong improvements in all three geographies. ADMs U.S. soybean operations ran at record capacity during the quarter and delivered very strong results amid good domestic and export meal demand. In South America, ADM was well prepared to move the record corn harvest. And in Europe, operational changes and reduced imports from South America drove improved results.
Refining, packaging, biodiesel and other generated a profit of $50 million for the quarter, down
$27 million, due to weakness in biodiesel margins in the U.S. and Europe.
Cocoa and other results increased $66 million. Weaker cocoa press margins were offset by the absence of last years significant negative mark-to-market impacts.
Oilseeds results in Asia for the quarter were up $23 million from the prior years second quarter, principally reflecting ADMs share of the results from its equity investee Wilmar International Limited.
Corn Processing Results Weak on Continued Ethanol Industry Challenges
Corn processing operating profit of $3 million represented a decline of $207 million from the same period one year earlier, when excluding the year-ago quarters $339 million asset impairment.
Sweeteners and starches operating profit increased $22 million to $97 million, as tight sweetener industry capacity and higher corn costs supported higher year-over-year selling prices.
Excluding last years $339 million asset impairment charge, bioproducts results decreased $229 million to a loss of $94 million. Weak domestic gasoline demand and unfavorable global ethanol trade flows resulted in continued excess industry capacity, keeping ethanol margins negative.
 
 
 
 
 
Agricultural Services Solid Despite Impact of U.S. Drought
Agricultural Services operating profit was $317 million, up $77 million from the same period one year earlier. Results included a $62 million gain on ADMs investment in GrainCorp.
Excluding the gain on GrainCorp, merchandising and handling earnings rose $23 million to $129 million, as solid U.S. soybean exports and improved international merchandising results more than offset lower U.S. corn origination and export volumes.
Transportation results were solid, despite challenges from low water on the Mississippi River. Results decreased $5 million to $48 million as increased barge operating expenses were partially offset by higher freight rates.
Milling and other results remained steady, as the milling business continued to perform well.
Other Financial Results Improve
Operating profit from ADMs Other Financial businesses was $77 million, up $55 million, with asset disposal gains and favorable captive insurance loss reserve adjustments.

A non-GAAP financial measure

Adjusted EPS is ADMs fully diluted EPS after removal of the effect on Reported EPS of certain specified items as more fully described above. Management believes that Adjusted EPS is a useful measure of ADMs performance because it provides investors additional information about ADMs operations allowing better evaluation of ongoing business performance. Adjusted EPS is a non-GAAP financial measure and is not intended to replace or be an alternative to EPS, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, or any other measures of operating results under GAAP. Earnings amounts in the tables above have been divided by the companys diluted shares outstanding for each respective quarter in order to arrive at an adjusted EPS amount for each specified item.

On February 7, 2013, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (the "Company") approved an amendment to the Company's Bylaws effective as of that date (the "Amendment"). The Bylaws, as amended through February7, 2013, are attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 3(ii).
The Amendment reduces the ownership threshold in the Bylaw provision regarding stockholders' ability to call special meetings of stockholders from a majority of the outstanding shares to not less than 10% of such shares. The Amendment also provides that the stockholder or stockholders requesting a special meeting must have held at least 10% of the outstanding shares in a "net long position" (as defined in the Bylaws) for at least one year and contains other conditions applicable to stockholders' ability to request a special meeting, including an expansion of the information that must be contained in a special meeting request from a stockholder or stockholders and a requirement that at least one stockholder who requested the special meeting appear at such meeting to present the business proposed.
 
On February 7, 2013, the Board set the date for the Company's next annual meeting of stockholders as May 2, 2013. A notice of annual meeting, proxy statement and proxy will be delivered to all stockholders as of the close of business on March 11, 2013. In accordance with the Company's Bylaws, written notice of any stockholder proposal intended to be presented at the next annual meeting of stockholders but not included in the Company's proxy statement for that meeting must be received by the Secretary, Archer-Daniels-Midland Company, 4666 Faries Parkway, Decatur, Illinois 62526-566, by the close of business on February21, 2013 (i.e., ten days following public disclosure of the date of the annual meeting by means of this Current Report on Form 8-K). The deadline for submission of proposals of stockholders intended to be presented at the next annual meeting and desired to be included in the Company's proxy statement is also the close of business on February 21, 2013.

The following exhibit is filed herewith:
3(ii) Bylaws, as amended through February 7, 2013.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 3(ii)
Section 1.1. Annual Meeting. The annual meeting of stockholders shall be held at such date, time and place, either within or without the State of Delaware, as may be designated by resolution of the Board of Directors from time to time. At the annual meeting, directors shall be elected and such other business transacted as shall have been properly brought before the meeting.
Section 1.2. Special Meeting.
(a) Special meetings of stockholders for any purpose or purposes may be called by the Chairman of the Board, the President, a majority of the Board of Directors, or a majority of the Executive Committee, and shall be called by the Secretary upon the request, in writing, of one or more stockholders owning not less than ten percent (10%) aggregate "net long position" of the shares of capital stock of the Corporation issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at such meeting (the "Requisite Percentage") for at least one year prior to the date such request is delivered to the Corporation (such period, the "One-Year Period"). For purposes of determining the Requisite Percentage, "net long position" shall be determined with respect to each requesting stockholder in accordance with the definition thereof set forth in Rule 14e-4 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder (as so amended and inclusive of such rules and regulations, the "Exchange Act"); that (x) for purposes of such definition, (A) "the date that a tender offer is first publicly announced or otherwise made known by the bidder to the holders of the security to be acquired" shall be the date of the relevant special meeting request, (B) the "highest tender offer price or stated amount of the consideration offered for the subject security" shall refer to the closing sales price of capital stock on the New York Stock Exchange (or any successor thereto) on such date (or, if such date is not a trading day, the next succeeding trading day), (C) the "person whose securities are the subject of the offer" shall refer to the Corporation, and (D) a "subject security" shall refer to the outstanding capital stock; and (y) the net long position of such holder shall be reduced by the number of shares of capital stock as to which such holder does not, or will not, have the right to vote or direct the vote at the stockholder requested special meeting or as to which such holder has, at any time during the One-Year Period, entered into any derivative or other agreement, arrangement or understanding that hedges or transfers, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, any of the economic consequences of ownership of such shares.
provided
(b) A stockholder request for a special meeting shall be signed, dated and delivered to the Secretary, shall state the purpose of the proposed meeting, and shall provide the information required by Section 1.4(c) hereof. In addition to the information required in Section 1.4(c) hereof, the stockholder request for a special meeting shall also include (i) documentary evidence that the stockholders requesting the special meeting own the Requisite Percentage as of the date on which the special meeting request is delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation; , that if the stockholders are not the beneficial owners of the shares constituting all or part of the Requisite Percentage, then to be valid, the special meeting request must also include documentary evidence (or, if not simultaneously provided with the special meeting request, such documentary evidence must be delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation within ten (10) days after the date on which the special meeting request is delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation) that the beneficial owners on whose behalf the special meeting request is made beneficially own such shares as of the date on which such special meeting request is delivered to the Secretary, and (ii) an agreement by each of the stockholders requesting the special meeting and each beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the special meeting request is being made to notify the Corporation promptly in the event of any decrease in the net long position held by such stockholder or beneficial owner following the delivery of such special meeting request and prior to the stockholder requested special meeting and an acknowledgement that any such decrease shall be deemed to be a revocation of such special meeting request by such stockholder or beneficial owner to the extent of such reduction. Any requesting stockholder may revoke his, her or its special meeting request at any time prior to the stockholder requested special meeting by written revocation delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation at the principal executive offices of the Corporation. If at any time after sixty (60) days following the earliest dated special meeting request, the unrevoked (whether by specific written revocation or by a reduction in the net long position held by such stockholder, as described above) valid special meeting requests represent in the aggregate less than the Requisite Percentage, there shall be no requirement to hold a special meeting.
provided, however
(c) The Board of Directors or, in the absence of action by the Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board, shall have the sole power to (i) determine whether special meeting requests have met the requirements of this Section 1.2, (ii) establish the date, time and place for any special meeting of stockholders and (iii) set a record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting pursuant to Section 1.11 hereof. Following such determination, it shall be the duty of the Secretary to cause notice to be given to the stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting, in the manner set forth in Section 1.3 hereof, that a meeting will be held at the place, time and date and in accordance with the record date determined by the Board of Directors or the Chairman of the Board. The stockholders requesting the special meeting shall not have the power to give notice of the meeting.
(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Secretary of the Corporation shall not be required to call a special meeting of stockholders if (i) the Board of Directors calls an annual meeting of stockholders or a special meeting of stockholders at which a Similar Item (as defined in this Section 1.2(d)) is to be presented pursuant to the notice of such meeting, in either case to be held not later than sixty (60) days after the date on which valid special meeting request(s) constituting the Requisite Percentage are delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation (such date of delivery being the "Delivery Date"); (ii) the Delivery Date is during the period commencing ninety (90) days prior to the first anniversary of the date of the immediately preceding annual meeting and ending on the earlier of (A) the date of the next annual meeting and (B) thirty (30) days after the first anniversary of the date of the immediately preceding annual meeting; or (iii) the special meeting request(s) (A) contain an identical or substantially similar item (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, a "Similar Item") to an item that was presented at any meeting of stockholders held not more than one hundred and twenty (120) days before the Delivery Date (and, for purposes of this clause (iii) the election of directors shall be deemed a "Similar Item" with respect to all items of business involving the election or removal of directors); (B) relate to an item of business that is not a proper subject for action by the stockholders under applicable law; (C) were made in a manner that involved a violation of Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act or other applicable law or would cause the Corporation to violate any law; or (D) do not comply with the provisions of this Section 1.2.
(e) If none of the stockholders who submitted a special meeting request appears or sends a qualified representative to present the item of business submitted by the stockholders for consideration at the stockholder requested special meeting, such item of business shall not be submitted for vote of the stockholders at such stockholder requested special meeting, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the Corporation or such stockholder(s).
Section 1.3. Notice of Meetings. Whenever stockholders are required or permitted to take any action at a meeting, a written notice of the meeting shall be given that shall state the place, date and hour of the meeting and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called. Unless otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-laws, the written notice of any meeting shall be given not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting. If mailed, such notice shall be deemed given when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at his or her address as it appears on the records of the Corporation.
Section 1.4. Advance Notice Requirements for Stockholder Proposals. The following procedures shall govern all cases in which a stockholder seeks to propose business to be addressed at a meeting of stockholders or to nominate persons to stand for election as directors of the Corporation (a "Stockholder Proposal"). No business shall be transacted at a meeting of stockholders except in accordance with the following procedures. Only persons who are nominated in accordance with the following procedures shall be eligible for election as directors of the Corporation. Notwithstanding any language in these by-laws to the contrary, this section shall not apply to any right of holders of preferred shares of the Corporation to nominate and elect a specified number of directors in certain circumstances to the extent such procedures are set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation.
 
(1) A Stockholder Proposal may be brought before an annual meeting of stockholders only (i) pursuant to the Corporation's notice of meeting delivered pursuant to Section 1.3 hereof (or any supplement thereto), (ii) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors (or any duly authorized committee thereof) or the Chairman of the Board or (iii) by any stockholder of the Corporation who was a stockholder of record of the Corporation at the time the notice provided for in this Section 1.4 is delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in subparagraphs (2) and (3) of this paragraph (a) in this Section 1.4.
(2) For a Stockholder Proposal to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder pursuant to clause (iii) of paragraph (a)(1) of this Section 1.4, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation and the subject of the Stockholder Proposal must otherwise be a proper matter for stockholder action as determined by the Board of Directors. The stockholder's notice shall contain, at a minimum, the information set forth in Section 1.4(c). To be timely, a stockholder's notice shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not less than sixty (60) nor more than ninety (90) days prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of stockholders; provided, however, that in the event that the annual meeting is called for a date that is not within thirty (30) days before or after such anniversary date, the stockholder's notice in order to be timely must be so received not later than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which such notice of the date of the annual meeting was mailed or public disclosure of the date of the annual meeting was made, whichever first occurs. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting of stockholders commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described above.
(3) Notwithstanding anything in paragraph (a)(2) of this Section 1.4 to the contrary, in the event that the Stockholder Proposal relates to the nomination of candidates for director and the number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors of the Corporation at an annual meeting is increased and there is no public announcement by the Corporation naming all of the nominees for director or specifying the size of the increased Board of Directors at least one hundred days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, a stockholder's notice required by this Section 1.4 shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new positions created by such increase, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the Corporation.
(b) Special Meetings of Stockholders. Only such business shall be conducted at a special meeting of stockholders as shall have been described in the Corporation's notice of meeting given pursuant to Section 1.3 hereof. To the extent such business includes the election of directors, a Stockholder Proposal nominating persons to stand for election as directors may be made at a special meeting of stockholders only (i) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors (or any duly authorized committee thereof) or the Chairman of the Board, or (ii) by any stockholder of the Corporation who is a stockholder of record at the time the notice provided for in this Section 1.4(b) is delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation, who is entitled to vote at the special meeting and who gives timely notice in writing by the Secretary of the Corporation. The stockholder's notice shall contain, at a minimum, the information set forth in Section 1.4(c). To be timely, a stockholder's notice shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of a special meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described above.
(c) Contents of Stockholder's Notice. Any stockholder's notice required by this Section 1.4 shall set forth the following information: As to the stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the Stockholder Proposal is made, the stockholder's notice shall set forth (i) the name and address of such stockholder and of such beneficial owner, as they appear on the Corporation's books, (ii) (A) the class and number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation which are owned beneficially and of record by such stockholder or such beneficial owner, (B) any option, warrant, convertible security, stock appreciation right, or similar right with an exercise or conversion privilege or a settlement payment or mechanism at a price related to any class of shares of the Corporation or with a value derived in whole or in part from the value of any class of shares of the Corporation, whether or not such instrument or right shall be subject to settlement in the underlying class of capital stock of the Corporation or otherwise (a "Derivative Instrument") directly or indirectly owned beneficially by such stockholder or such beneficial owner and any other direct or indirect opportunity to profit or share in any profit derived from any
 
increase or decrease in the value of shares of the Corporation, (C) any proxy, contract, arrangement, understanding, or relationship pursuant to which such stockholder or such beneficial owner has a right to vote any shares of any security of the Company, (D) any short interest of such stockholder or such beneficial owner in any security of the Corporation (for purposes of this provision, a person shall be deemed to have a short interest in a security if such person directly or indirectly, through any contract, arrangement, understanding, relationship or otherwise, has the opportunity to profit or share in any profit derived from any decrease in the value of the subject security), (E) any rights to dividends on the shares of the Corporation owned beneficially by such stockholder or such beneficial owner that are separated or separable from the underlying shares of the Corporation, (F) any proportionate interest in shares of the Corporation or Derivative Instruments held, directly or indirectly, by a general or limited partnership in which such stockholder or such beneficial owner is a general partner or, directly or indirectly, beneficially owns an interest in a general partner and (G) any performance-related fees (other than an asset-based fee) that such stockholder or such beneficial owner is entitled to based on any increase or decrease in the value of shares of the Corporation or Derivative Instruments, if any, as of the date of such notice, including without limitation any such interests held by members of such stockholder's or such beneficial owner's immediate family sharing the same household (which information shall be supplemented by such stockholder and beneficial owner, if any, not later than 10 days after the record date for the meeting to disclose such ownership as of the record date), and (iii) a representation that such stockholder intends to appear in person or by proxy at the stockholder meeting.
For any Stockholder Proposal that seeks to nominate persons to stand for election as directors of the Corporation, the stockholder's notice also shall include (i) a description of all arrangements or understandings between such stockholder and each proposed nominee and any other person or persons (including their names) pursuant to which the nomination(s) are to be made, (ii) a representation whether the stockholders or the beneficial owners, if any, intend or are part of a group which intends to (1) deliver a proxy statement and/or form of proxy to holders of at least the percentage of the Corporation's outstanding capital stock required to elect the nominee and/or (2) otherwise solicit proxies from stockholders in support of such nomination and (iii) any other information relating to such stockholder that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings required to be made in connection with solicitations of proxies for election of directors pursuant to Section 14 of the Exchange Act of 1934, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

(d) Only Stockholder Proposals made in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 1.4 shall be considered at an annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation. Except as otherwise provided by law, the chair of the meeting shall have the power and duty to (i) determine whether a Stockholder Proposal was made in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 1.4 and (ii) if any Stockholder Proposal is not in compliance with this Section 1.4, including whether the stockholder or beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the Stockholder Proposal is made solicits (or is part of a group which solicits) or fails to so solicit (as the case may be) proxies in support of the Stockholder Proposal in compliance with such stockholder's representation as required by Section (c) of this Section 1.4, to declare that such Stockholder Proposal shall be disregarded.
(e) For purposes of this Section 1.4, "public announcement" shall mean disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press or comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed by the Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.
(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 1.4, a stockholder also shall comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in this Section 1.4. Nothing in this Section 1.4 shall be deemed to affect any rights of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the Corporation's proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act.
Section 1.5. Postponement and Cancellation of Meeting. Any previously scheduled annual or special meeting of the stockholders may be postponed and any previously scheduled annual or special meeting of the stockholders called by the Chairman of the Board, the President, a majority of the Board of Directors, or a majority of the Executive Committee may be canceled by resolution of the Board of Directors upon public notice given prior to the time previously scheduled for such meeting of stockholders.
Section 1.6. Quorum. Except as otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these by-laws, at each meeting of stockholders the presence in person or by proxy of the holders of a majority in voting power of the outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote at the meeting shall be necessary and sufficient to constitute a quorum. In the absence of a quorum, the chair of the meeting may adjourn the meeting from time to time in the manner provided in Section 1.10 hereof until a quorum shall attend. Shares of the Corporation's own stock belonging to the Corporation or to another corporation, if a majority of the shares entitled to vote in the election of directors of such other corporation is held, directly or indirectly, by the Corporation, shall neither be entitled to vote nor be counted for quorum purposes; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not limit the right of the Corporation or any subsidiary of the Corporation to vote stock, including but not limited to its own stock, held by it in a fiduciary capacity. The chair of the meeting shall have the power and the duty to determine whether a quorum is present at any meeting of stockholders.
Section 1.7. Officers for Meeting of Stockholders. Meetings of stockholders shall be presided over by the Chairman of the Board, if any, or in his or her absence by the President, or in his or her absence by a Vice President, or in the absence of the foregoing persons by a chair designated by the Board of Directors, or in the absence of such designation by a chair chosen at the meeting by a plurality vote. The Secretary shall act as secretary of the meeting, but in his or her absence the chair of the meeting may appoint any person to act as secretary of the meeting.
Section 1.8. Conduct of Meetings. Every meeting of stockholders shall be presided over by the chair of the meeting selected pursuant to Section 1.7, hereof. The date and time of the opening and the closing of the polls for each matter upon which the stockholders will vote at a meeting shall be determined by the chair of the meeting and announced at the meeting. The Board of Directors may adopt by resolution such rules and regulations for the conduct of the meeting of stockholders as it shall deem appropriate. Except to the extent inconsistent with such rules and regulations as adopted by the Board of Directors, the chair of the meeting shall have the exclusive right and authority to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and to do all such acts as, in the judgment of the chair, are appropriate for the proper conduct of the meeting. Such rules, regulations or procedures, whether adopted by the Board of Directors or prescribed by the chair of the meeting, may include, without limitation, the following: (i) the establishment of an agenda or order of business for the meeting; (ii) rules and procedures for maintaining order at the meeting and the safety of those present; (iii) limitations on attendance at or participation in the meeting to stockholders of record of the Corporation, their duly authorized and constituted proxies or such other persons as the chair of the meeting shall determine; (iv) restrictions on entry to the meeting after the time fixed for the
 
commencement thereof; and (v) limitations on or the elimination of time allotted to questions or comments by participants. Unless and to the extent determined by the Board of Directors or the chair of the meeting, meetings of stockholders shall not be required to be held in accordance with the rules of parliamentary procedure.
Section 1.9. Voting; Elections.
1.9.1. Voting Generally; Proxies. Except as otherwise provided by or pursuant to the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation, each stockholder entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall be entitled to one vote for each share of stock held by such stockholder which has voting power upon the matter in question. Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders or to express consent or dissent to corporate action in writing without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder by proxy, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. A stockholder may revoke any proxy which is not irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting in person or by filing an instrument in writing revoking the proxy or by delivering a proxy in accordance with applicable law bearing a later date to the Secretary of the Corporation. Voting at meetings of stockholders need not be by written ballot. All elections and questions shall, unless otherwise provided by the Certificate of Incorporation, these by-laws, the rules or regulations of any stock exchange applicable to the Corporation, or applicable law or pursuant to any regulation applicable to the Corporation or its securities, be decided by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the shares of stock of the Corporation which are present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote thereon.
1.9.2. Elections of Directors. Each director shall be elected by the vote of the majority of the votes cast with respect to the director at any meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present, provided that the directors shall be elected by the vote of a plurality of the votes cast for the nominees at any meeting for the election of directors where the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected at the meeting (exclusive of nominees with respect to whom the Secretary of the Corporation has received a notice that such nomination has been withdrawn on or prior to the date next preceding the date that the Corporation first mails notice of the meeting to the stockholders). For purposes of this Section 1.9.2, a majority of the votes cast means that the number of shares voted "for" a director must exceed the number of votes cast "against" that director.
Section 1.10. Adjournment of Meeting. Any meeting of stockholders, annual or special, may be adjourned solely by the chair of the meeting from time to time to reconvene at the same or some other time, date and place. The stockholders present at a meeting shall not have authority to adjourn the meeting. Notice need not be given of any such adjourned meeting if the time, date and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. If the time, date and place of the adjourned meeting are not announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken, then the Secretary of the Corporation shall give written notice of the time, date and place of the adjourned meeting not less than ten (10) days prior to the date of the adjourned meeting. Notice of the adjourned meeting also shall be given if the meeting is adjourned in a single adjournment to a date more than 30 days or in successive adjournments to a date more than 120 days after the original date fixed for the meeting.
At an adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present, the stockholders may transact any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting. Once a share is represented for any purpose at a meeting, it shall be present for quorum purposes for the remainder of the meeting and for any adjournment of that meeting unless a new record date is or must be set for the adjourned meeting. A new record date shall be set if the meeting is adjourned in a single or successive adjournments to a date more than 120 days after the original date fixed for the meeting. If after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting consistent with the new record date.
Section 1.11 Fixing Date for Determination of Stockholders of Record.
In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action other than stockholder action by written consent, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date
 
is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which record date: (i) in the case of determination of stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders or adjournment thereof, shall, unless otherwise required by law, not be more than sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) days before the original date of such meeting, and (ii) in the case of any other lawful action other than stockholder action by written consent, shall not be more than sixty days prior to such other action. If no record date is fixed by the Board of Directors: (i) the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held, and (ii) the record date for determining stockholders for any other purpose (other than stockholder action by written consent) shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting and shall fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting if the meeting is adjourned in a single or successive adjournments to a date more than 120 days after the original date fixed for the meeting.
Section 1.12. Procedures for Stockholder Action by Consent.
1.12.1. Request for Record Date. The record date for determining stockholders entitled to express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be as fixed by the Board of Directors or as otherwise established under this Section 1.12.1. Any person seeking to have the stockholders authorize or take corporate action by written consent without a meeting shall, by written notice addressed to the Secretary and delivered to the Corporation and signed by a stockholder of record, request that a record date be fixed for such purpose. The written notice shall contain at a minimum a description of the action that such stockholder proposes to take by written consent, including the text of any proposal to be submitted to stockholders. The Board of Directors shall have ten (10) days following the date of receipt of the notice to determine the validity of the request. During the ten (10) day period, the Corporation may require the stockholder of record and/or beneficial owner requesting a record date for proposed stockholder action by consent to furnish such other information as it may reasonably require to determine the validity of the request for a record date. Following the determination of the validity of the request, and no later than ten (10) days after the date on which such request is received by the Corporation, the Board of Directors may fix a record date for such purpose which shall be no more than ten (10) days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors and shall not precede the date such resolution is adopted. If the Board of Directors fails within ten (10) days after the date the Corporation receives such notice to fix a record date for such purpose, the record date shall be the day on which the first written consent is delivered to the Corporation in the manner described in Section 1.12.3 below unless prior action by the Board of Directors is required by law, in which event the record date shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action.
1.12.2. Form of Consent. Every written consent purporting to take or authorize the taking of corporate action and/or related revocations (each such written consent and related revocation is referred to in this Section 1.12 as a "Consent") shall bear the date of signature of each stockholder who signs the Consent, and no Consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless, within 60 days of the earliest dated Consent delivered in the manner required by this Section 1.12, Consents signed by a sufficient number of stockholders to take such action are so delivered to the Corporation.
1.12.3. Delivery of Consent. A Consent shall be delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware or to the Secretary of the Corporation at the Corporation's principal place of business. Delivery to the Corporation's registered office shall be made by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested.
In the event of the delivery to the Corporation of a Consent, the Secretary of the Corporation shall provide for the safe-keeping of such Consent and shall promptly conduct such ministerial review of the sufficiency of the Consents and of the validity of the action to be taken by stockholder consent as the Secretary deems necessary or appropriate, including, without limitation, whether the holders of a number of shares having the requisite voting power to authorize or take the action specified in the Consent have given consent; provided, however, that if the corporate action to which the Consent relates is the removal or replacement of one or more members of the Board of Directors, the Secretary of the Corporation shall promptly designate two persons, who shall not be members of the Board of
 
Directors, to serve as Inspectors with respect to such Consent and such Inspectors shall discharge the functions of the Secretary of the Corporation under this Section 1.12.3. If after such investigation the Secretary or the Inspectors (as the case may be) shall determine that the Consent is valid and that the action therein specified has been validly authorized, that fact shall forthwith be certified on the records of the Corporation kept for the purpose of recording the proceedings of meetings of stockholders, and the Consent shall be filed in such records, at which time the Consent shall become effective as stockholder action. In conducting the investigation required by this Section 1.12.3, the Secretary or the Inspectors (as the case may be) may, at the expense of the Corporation, retain special legal counsel and any other necessary or appropriate professional advisors, and such other personnel as they may deem necessary or appropriate to assist them, and shall be fully protected in relying in good faith upon the opinion of such counsel or advisors.
No action by written consent without a meeting shall be effective until such date as the Secretary or the Inspectors (as the case may be) certify to the Corporation that the Consents delivered to the Corporation in accordance with Section 1.12.3 represent at least the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to take the action.
Nothing contained in this Section 1.12.3 shall in any way be construed to suggest or imply that the Board of Directors or any stockholder shall not be entitled to contest the validity of any Consent or revocation thereof, whether before or after such certification by the Secretary or the Inspectors, or to take any other action (including, without limitation, the commencement, prosecution, or defense of any litigation with respect thereto, and the seeking of injunctive relief in such litigation).
Section 1.13. Inspectors of Election. The Corporation may, and shall if required by law, in advance of any meeting of stockholders, appoint one or more inspectors of election, who may be employees of the Corporation, to act at the meeting or any adjournment thereof and to make a written report thereof. The Corporation may designate one or more persons as alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act. In the event that no inspector so appointed or designated is able to act at a meeting of stockholders, the person presiding at the meeting shall appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting. Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of his or her duties, shall take and sign an oath to execute faithfully the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her ability. The inspector or inspectors so appointed or designated shall (i) ascertain the number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation outstanding and the voting power of each such share, (ii) determine the shares of capital stock of the Corporation represented at the meeting and the validity of proxies and ballots, (iii) count all votes and ballots, (iv) determine and retain for a reasonable period a record of the disposition of any challenges made to any determination by the inspectors, and (v) certify their determination of the number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation represented at the meeting and such inspectors' count of all votes and ballots. Such certification and report shall specify such other information as may be required by law. In determining the validity and counting of proxies and ballots cast at any meeting of stockholders of the Corporation, the inspectors may consider such information as is permitted by applicable law. No person who is a candidate for an office at an election may serve as an inspector at such election.
Section 1.14. List of Stockholders Entitled to Vote. The Secretary shall prepare and make, at least ten (10) days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting, either at a place within the city where the meeting is to be held, which place shall be specified in the notice of the meeting, or if not so specified, at the place where the meeting is to be held. The list shall also be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present. Upon the willful neglect or refusal of the directors to produce such a list at any meeting for the election of directors, they shall be ineligible for election to any office at such meeting. Except as otherwise provided by law, the stock ledger shall be the only evidence as to who are the stockholders entitled to examine the stock ledger, the list of stockholders or the books of the Corporation, or to vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of stockholders.
 
Section 2.1. Number; Qualifications. The Board of Directors shall consist of one or more members, the number thereof to be determined from time to time by resolution of the Board of Directors. Directors need not be stockholders.
Section 2.2. Election; Resignation; Vacancies. At each annual meeting, the stockholders shall elect directors each of whom shall hold office until the next annual meeting of stockholders and until his or her successor is duly elected and qualified, subject to such director's earlier death, resignation, disqualification or removal. Any director may resign at any time upon written notice to the Corporation. Such resignation need not be accepted to be effective. Unless otherwise provided by law or the Certificate of Incorporation, any newly created directorship or any vacancy occurring on the Board of Directors for any cause may be filled solely by a majority of the remaining members of the Board of Directors, although such majority is less than a quorum, or by the sole remaining director, and each director so elected shall hold office until the expiration of the term of office of the director so replaced or until the director's successor is elected and qualified. The stockholders shall not have the power to appoint directors to any newly created directorship or vacancy.
Section 2.3. Regular Meetings. Regular meetings of the Board of Directors may be held at such places within or without the State of Delaware and at such times as the Board of Directors may from time to time determine. It shall not be necessary to give notice of regular meetings of the Board of Directors.
Section 2.4. Special Meetings. Special meetings of the Board of Directors may be called by the Chairman of the Board, the President, the Executive Committee, or by three (3) or more directors. Notice of a special meeting of the Board of Directors shall be given by the person or persons calling the meeting at least twenty-four hours before the special meeting if such notice is given personally or by telephone or sent by telegram, telecopier or other electronic means. Notice of a special meeting of the Board of Directors shall be given by the person or persons calling the meeting at least three days before the special meeting if given by regular mail. No notice of a special meeting shall be necessary if the time and place of the special meeting was set by resolution at a validly convened meeting of the Board of Directors. The notice of a special meeting need not state the purpose or purposes of the meeting.
Section 2.5. Telephonic Meetings Permitted. Members of the Board of Directors, or any committee designated by the Board of Directors, may participate in a meeting thereof by means of conference telephone or similar communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and participation in a meeting pursuant to this by-law shall constitute presence in person at such meeting.
Section 2.6. Quorum; Vote Required for Action. At all meetings of the Board of Directors a majority of the whole Board of Directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. Except in cases in which the certificate of incorporation, these by-laws or applicable law otherwise provides, the vote of a majority of the directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the Board of Directors.
Section 2.7. Officers for Board Meetings. Meetings of the Board of Directors shall be presided over by the Chairman of the Board, if any, or in his or her absence by the Vice Chairman of the Board, if any, or in his or her absence by the President, or in their absence by a chairman chosen at the meeting. The Secretary shall act as secretary of the meeting, but in his or her absence the chair of the meeting may appoint any person to act as secretary of the meeting.
Section 2.8. Independent Directors And Board Structure. A majority of the Board of Directors shall be comprised of independent directors. The Chief Executive Officer should be a member of the Board of Directors. In order to ensure the greatest number of independent directors on a board of manageable size, other direct management representation should be kept to a minimum and should in no event exceed two other management directors.
The Board of Directors shall make clear to Senior Management of the Company that board membership is neither necessary to their present positions nor a prerequisite to a higher management position in the Company. Attendance of management staff at Board Meetings should be at the discretion of the Chairman of the Board but should be
 
encouraged by the Board. The Board shall have full and direct access to members of Senior Management and should be encouraged to request reports directly to the Board by any member of Senior Management. Board members should use judgment in dealings with management so that they do not distract management from the business operations of the Company.
Conflicts of Interest. A director's personal financial or family relationships may occasionally give rise to that director's material personal interest in a particular issue. There will be times when a director's material personal interest in an issue will limit that director's ability to vote on that issue. The Governance Committee of the Board of Directors shall determine whether such a conflict of interest exists on a case-by-case basis, including any related determination as to materiality. The Governance Committee shall take appropriate steps to identify such potential conflicts and to ensure that a majority of the directors voting on an issue are both disinterested and independent with respect to that issue. A determination by the Governance Committee on any issue of independence or conflict of interest shall be final and not subject to review.
For purposes of this Section, an "independent director" means a director who: (a) is neither a current employee nor a former member of Senior Management of the Company or an Affiliate; (b) is not employed by a provider of professional services to the Company; (c) does not have any business relationship with the Company, either personally or through a company of which the director is an officer or a controlling shareholder, that is material to the Company or to the director; (d) does not have a close family relationship, by blood, marriage or otherwise with any member of Senior Management of the Company or one of the Company's Affiliates; (e) is not an officer of a company of which the Company's chairman or chief executive officer is also a board member; (f) is not personally receiving compensation from the Company in any capacity other than as a director; (g) does not personally receive or is not an employee of a foundation, university, or other institution that receives grants or endowments from the Company, that are material to the Company or to either the recipient and/or the foundation, university, or institution; and (h) meets the independence requirements of the New York Stock Exchange.
"Senior Management" includes the chief executive, chief operating, chief financial, chief legal and chief accounting officers, president, vice president(s), treasurer, secretary and the controller of the Company.
"Affiliate" includes any person or entity which, alone or by contractual obligation, owns or has the power to vote more than twenty-five (25) percent of the equity interest in another, unless some other person or entity acting alone or with another by contractual obligation owns or has the power to vote a greater percentage of the equity interest. A subsidiary is considered an affiliate if it is at least eighty (80) percent owned by the Company and accounts for at least twenty-five (25) percent of the Company's consolidated sales or assets.
Section 2.9. Action by Written Consent of Directors. Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation or these by-laws, any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors, or of any committee thereof, may be taken without a meeting if all members of the Board of Directors or such committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing, and the writing or writings are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the Board of Directors or such committee.
Section 2.10. Committees. The Board of Directors may designate one or more committees, each committee to consist of one or more of the directors of the Corporation. The Board of Directors may designate one or more directors as alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of the committee. In the absence or disqualification of a member of the committee, the member or members thereof present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not he/she or they constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the Board of Directors to act at the meeting in place of any such absent or disqualified member. Any such committee, to the extent permitted by law and to the extent provided in the resolution of the Board of Directors, shall have and may exercise all the powers and authority of the Board of Directors in the management of the business and affairs of the Corporation, and may authorize the seal of the Corporation to be affixed to all papers which may require it.
Section 2.11. Committee Rules. Unless the Board of Directors otherwise provides, each committee designated by the Board of Directors may make, alter and repeal rules for the conduct of its business. In the absence of such rules each committee shall conduct its business in the same manner as the Board of Directors conducts its business pursuant to Article II hereof.
 
Section 2.12. Executive Committee. There shall be an Executive Committee to consist of such number of directors of the Board of Directors (the "Executive Committee") to consist of that number of directors as the Board of Directors may from time to time determine. The Board of Directors shall have power at any time to change the number of the Executive Committee, except that a reduction in the number of members of the Executive Committee shall not affect any currently serving member. The Board of Directors may remove any member of the Executive Committee at any time with or without cause and may fill vacancies in the Committee by election from the members of the Board of Directors.
When the Board of Directors is not in session, the Executive Committee shall have and may exercise all the power and authority of the Board of Directors in the management and direction of the business and affairs of the Corporation, and shall have power to authorize the seal of the Corporation to be affixed to all papers which may require it. All actions of the Executive Committee shall be reported to the Board of Directors at the meeting next succeeding such action, provided, however, that such report need not be made to the Board of Directors if prior to such meeting copies of the written minutes of the meetings of the Executive Committee at which such action has been taken shall have been mailed or delivered to all members of the Board of Directors.
Section 3.1. Executive Officers; Election; Qualifications; Term of Office; Resignation; Removal; Vacancies.

Each such officer shall hold office until the first meeting of the Board of Directors after the annual meeting of stockholders next succeeding his or her election, and until his or her successor is elected and qualified or until his or her earlier resignation or removal. Any officer may resign at any time upon written notice to the Corporation. Such resignation need not be accepted to be effective. The Board of Directors may remove any officer with or without cause at any time, but such removal shall be without prejudice to the contractual rights of such officer, if any, with the Corporation. Any number of offices may be held by the same person. Any vacancy occurring in any office of the Corporation by death, resignation, removal or otherwise may be filled for the unexpired portion of the term by the Board of Directors.
Section 3.2. Powers and Duties of Executive Officers. The officers of the Corporation shall have such powers and duties in the management of the Corporation as may be prescribed in a resolution by the Board of Directors and, to the extent not so provided, as generally pertain to their respective offices, subject to the control of the Board of Directors.

Any of or all the signatures on the certificate may be a facsimile. In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate shall have ceased to be such officer, transfer agent, or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the Corporation with the same effect as if he or she were such officer, transfer agent, or registrar at the date of issue.
Section 4.2. Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Stock Certificates; Issuance of New Certificates. The Corporation may issue a new certificate of stock in the place of any certificate theretofore issued by it, alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, and the Corporation may require the owner of the lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, or his/her legal representative, to give the Corporation a bond sufficient to indemnify it against any claim that may be made against it on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of any such certificate or the issuance of such new certificate.
 
Section 5.1. Fiscal Year. The fiscal year of the Corporation shall be determined by resolution of the Board of Directors.
Section 5.2. Seal. The corporate seal shall have the name of the Corporation inscribed thereon and shall be in such form as may be approved from time to time by the Board of Directors.
Section 5.3. Signature of Checks, etc. All checks and drafts on the bank accounts of the Corporation, and all bills of exchange and promissory notes, and all acceptances, obligations and other instruments for the payment of money shall be signed by such officer or officers, or agent or agents, as shall be thereunto authorized, from time to time, by the Board of Directors or the Executive Committee.
Section 5.4. Waiver of Notice of Meetings of Stockholders, Directors and Committees. Any written waiver of notice, signed by the person entitled to notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at nor the purpose of any regular or special meeting of the stockholders, directors, or members of a committee of directors need be specified in any written waiver of notice.
Section 5.5. Form of Records. Any records maintained by the Corporation in the regular course of its business, including its stock ledger, books of account, and minute books, may be kept on, or be in the form of, punch cards, magnetic tape, photographs, microphotographs, or any other information storage device, provided that the records so kept can be converted into clearly legible form within a reasonable time.
Section 5.6. Amendment of By-laws. These by-laws may be altered, amended or repealed, and new by-laws made, by the Board of Directors, but the stockholders may make additional by-laws and may alter and repeal any by-laws whether adopted by them or otherwise.
Section 6.1. Right to Indemnification. The Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law as it presently exists or may hereafter be amended, any person (a "Covered Person") who was or is made or is threatened to be made a party or is otherwise involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a "proceeding"), by reason of the fact that he or she, or a person for whom he or she is the legal representative, is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or, while a director or officer of the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another Corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust, enterprise or nonprofit entity, including service with respect to employee benefit plans, against all liability and loss suffered and expenses (including attorneys' fees) reasonably incurred by such Covered Person. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, except as otherwise provided in Section 6.3, the Corporation shall be required to indemnify a Covered Person in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) commenced by such Covered Person only if the commencement of such proceeding (or part thereof) by the Covered Person was authorized by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.
Section 6.2. Prepayment of Expenses. The Corporation shall pay the expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by a Covered Person in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition, provided, however, that, to the extent required by law, such payment of expenses in advance of the final disposition of the proceeding shall be made only upon receipt of an undertaking by the Covered Person to repay all amounts advanced if it should be ultimately determined that the Covered Person is not entitled to be indemnified under this Article VI or otherwise.
 
Section 6.3. Claims. If a claim for indemnification or advancement of expenses under this Article VI is not paid in full within thirty days after a written claim therefore by the Covered Person has been received by the Corporation, the Covered Person may file suit to recover the unpaid amount of such claim and, if successful in whole or in part, shall be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such claim. In any such action the Corporation shall have the burden of proving that the Covered Person is not entitled to the requested indemnification or advancement of expenses under applicable law.
Section 6.4. Nonexclusivity of Rights. The rights conferred on any Covered Person by this Article VI shall not be exclusive of any other rights which such Covered Person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the certificate of incorporation, these by-laws, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.
Section 6.5. Other Sources. The Corporation's obligation, if any, to indemnify or to advance expenses to any Covered Person who was or is serving at its request as a director, officer, employee or agent of another Corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, enterprise or nonprofit entity shall be reduced by any amount such Covered Person may collect as indemnification or advancement of expenses from such other Corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, enterprise or non-profit enterprise.
Section 6.6. Amendment or Repeal. Any repeal or modification of the foregoing provisions of this Article VI shall not adversely affect any right or protection hereunder of any Covered Person in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to the time of such repeal or modification.
Section 6.7. The rights conferred on any Covered Person by this Article VI are contract rights, vest as of the commencement of service, and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director or officer and shall inure the benefit of the person's heirs, executors and administrators.
Section 6.8. Other Indemnification and Prepayment of Expenses.

On February 13, 2013, notification was made to Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (the "Company") pursuant to Section 101(i)(2)(E) of the Employee Retirement Income Securities Act of 1974, as amended, regarding a blackout period (the "Blackout Period") with respect to the ADM 401(k) and Employee Stock Ownership Plan for Salaried Employees and the ADM 401(k) and Employee Stock Ownership Plan for Hourly Employees (the "Plans"). The Blackout Period is required due to the transition of the Plans to a new administrator. The Blackout Period will begin after 3:00 p.m., central time, on March 19, 2013 and last through April 5, 2013, although it is possible that the blackout period will end prior to April 5, 2013. During the Blackout Period, Plan participants will be unable to change contribution percentages, enroll in the 401(k) Plans, submit withdrawal requests, submit a new loan request or process loan payoffs, exchange an existing balance or elect or change an ESOP dividend election.
On February 19, 2013, the Company sent a notice to its directors and executive officers pursuant to Section 306 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Section 104 of Regulation BTR under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "BTR Notice"). The BTR Notice informed the Company's directors and executive officers of the Blackout Period and of the common stock trading restrictions (including with respect to derivatives) that apply to them during the Blackout Period. A copy of the BTR Notice is attached as Exhibit 99.1. During the Blackout Period and for a period of two years after the ending date of the Blackout Period, stockholders or other interested parties may obtain, without charge, information about the actual beginning and ending dates of the Blackout Period by contacting the Company's Investor Relations department at 217-424-5200.
 
 
The following exhibit is filed herewith:
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
February 19, 2013
Archer-Daniels-Midland Company ("ADM") is changing the administrator of the ADM 401(k) and Employee Stock Ownership Plan for Salaried Employees and the ADM 401(k) and Employee Stock Ownership Plan for Hourly Employees (the "401(k) Plans"). During this changeover, employees will not be able to change contribution percentages, enroll in the 401(k) Plans, submit withdrawal requests, submit a new loan request or process loan payoffs, exchange an existing balance or elect or change an ESOP dividend election. We expect this "blackout period" to begin after 3:00 p.m. central time, on March 19, 2013 and last through April 5, 2013, although it is possible that the blackout period will end prior to April 5, 2013 (the "Blackout Period"). We regret any inconvenience resulting from the Blackout Period, but we believe you will be pleased with the new administrator of the 401(k) Plans.
As a director or executive officer, these prohibitions apply to you and to members of your immediate family who share your household, as well as to trusts, corporations and other entities whose share ownership may be attributed to you. Penalties for trading during a Blackout Period are severe.
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Federal securities laws provide that, during the Blackout Period, all directors and executive officers are prohibited from any transaction in our common shares (including exercising stock options) or any derivatives of our common shares, regardless of whether the director or executive officer participates in either of the 401(k) Plans.
If you have questions regarding the Blackout Period, including when it has started or ended, you may call Marschall I. Smith, Senior Vice President, Secretary and General Counsel, (217) 424-6183, or Stuart E. Funderburg, Associate General Counsel and Assistant Secretary, (217) 451-4847, or contact either by mail at Archer-Daniels-Midland Company, 4666 Faries Parkway, Decatur, Illinois 62526.

On April 25, 2013, Archer-Daniels-Midland Company () entered into a takeover bid implementation deed (the ) with GrainCorp Limited (), which provides for GrainCorp to make available to ADM certain due diligence materials and, subject to ADMs satisfaction with that due diligence, ADM to make a cash offer (the ) to acquire GrainCorp for A$12.20 per share on the terms and conditions specified in the Deed through ADMs wholly owned subsidiary ADM Australia Holdings II Pty Ltd ().

Potential Offer

ADM may terminate the Deed prior to the expiration of a seven-day due diligence period, which period commenced at 3:00 a.m Eastern Daylight Time on April 25, 2013 if it (i) identifies one or more matters not previously known to it or if the significance of a previously known matter would have been materially different when considered together with additional matters identified during the seven-day due diligence period and (ii) the knowledge of such matters would have caused it to (a) not be prepared to make the Potential Offer or (b) only be prepared to make an offer on terms, taken as a whole, materially less favorable to GrainCorps shareholders than the Potential Offer.
 
If the Potential Offer is consummated, each GrainCorp shareholder that accepts the Potential Offer will receive A$12.20 in cash from ADM.   In addition, GrainCorp is permitted to pay its shareholders, prior to the completion of the transaction, dividends of A$1.00 per share out of GrainCorps current and retained earnings.  If all required regulatory approvals have not been obtained or waived by October 1, 2013, GrainCorp will be permitted to pay to its shareholders an additional dividend of A$0.035 per share for each complete month following October 1, 2013, until the earliest of the date on which (i) all required regulatory approvals have been obtained or waived, (ii) ADM terminates the Deed as a result of any GrainCorp director withdrawing or changing his or her recommendation or recommending a competing proposal or (iii) a majority of GrainCorp directors withdraw or change their recommendation or recommend a competing proposal, provided that GrainCorps net profit after tax over the applicable period is positive.
 
The completion of the Potential Offer is subject to certain customary conditions, including: (i) ADM Australia receiving acceptances under the Potential Offer that give it a relevant interest in at least 50.1% of GrainCorps shares, (ii) the receipt of certain required regulatory approvals, including from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the Foreign Investment and Review Board of Australia and the Ministry of Commerce of the Peoples Republic of China and (iii) there not having occurred any act, omission, event, change, condition, matter or thing or information concerning any act, omission, event, change, condition, matter or thing becomes known to ADM Australia, which, individually or when aggregated with all other such acts, omissions, events, changes, conditions, matters or things of a like kind arising from the same or similar facts or circumstances, has resulted in, or could reasonably be expected to result in, a GrainCorp material adverse change (as such term is defined in the Deed).
 
The Deed contains a no shop provision which, in general, restricts GrainCorps ability to invite, initiate or solicit competing acquisition proposals or any approach, inquiry or expression of interest which would reasonably be expected to lead to a competing acquisition proposal.  The Deed also contains a match right which provides that GrainCorp may not enter into an acquisition agreement or arrangement with any third party in respect of a competing proposal and GrainCorps board of directors may not change or withdraw their recommendation of the Potential Offer unless (i) GrainCorp has provided written notice to ADM of the material terms of the competing proposal and (ii) within two days ADM does not make a proposal to GrainCorps shareholders which would result in an outcome for GrainCorps shareholders that is as favorable or more favorable than the outcome that would result from the competing proposal.
 
Under the Deed, GrainCorps board of directors will unanimously recommend the Potential Offer subject to (i) there being no superior proposal and (ii) an independent expert concluding that the Potential Offer is both fair and reasonable to GrainCorp shareholders.  Any GrainCorp director may withdraw or change his or her recommendation in the event that (i) a superior proposal emerges, (ii) the independent expert concludes that the Potential Offer is not fair and reasonable to GrainCorp shareholders, (iii) any required regulatory approval is not obtained or waived by December 31, 2013 or (iv) he or she ceases to be of the view that the Potential Offer is in the best interests of GrainCorp shareholders.  ADM may terminate the Deed if any GrainCorp director withdraws or changes his or her recommendation or recommends a competing proposal, and GrainCorp may terminate the Deed if a majority of GrainCorp directors publicly withdraw or change their recommendation or recommend a competing proposal or if any of the regulatory approval conditions are not satisfied or waived by December 31, 2013.

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
 
Any statements in this communication about ADMs expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, prospects, financial condition, assumptions or future events or performance, including statements regarding the Potential Offer, that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are often, but not always, made through the use of words or phrases such as believe, anticipate, should, intend, plan, will, expect(s), estimate(s), project(s), positioned, strategy, outlook and similar expressions. Accordingly, all such forward-looking statements involve estimates and assumptions that are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results expressed in the statements, including, without limitation, with respect to any potential acquisition by ADM of all or any portion of GrainCorp. Among the key factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements, are the following: the parties ability to consummate the transaction; the conditions to the completion of the transaction; the regulatory approvals required for the transaction may not be obtained on the terms expected or on the anticipated schedule; the parties ability to meet expectations regarding the timing, completion and accounting and tax treatments of the transaction; the possibility that the parties may be unable to achieve expected synergies and operating efficiencies in the arrangement within the expected time-frames or at all and to successfully integrate GrainCorps operations into those of ADM; such integration may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected; operating costs, customer loss and business disruption (including, without limitation, difficulties in maintaining relationships with employees, customers, clients or suppliers) may be greater than expected following the transaction; the retention of certain key employees of GrainCorp may be difficult; ADM is subject to intense competition and increased competition is expected in the future; fluctuations in foreign currencies could result in transaction losses and increased expenses; and general economic conditions that are less favorable than expected.  Additional information and other risks are contained in the ADM Transition Report on Form 10-K for the transition period from July 1, 2012 to December 31, 2012, as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Because the factors referred to above could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements made by ADM, the reader is cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements.  Further, all forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to ADM, and ADM assumes no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements.

Decatur, Ill. 62526
 
SYDNEY, April 26, 2013Archer Daniels Midland Company (NYSE: ADM) announced today that it has signed a takeover bid implementation deed with GrainCorp Limited (ASX: GNC) and begun due diligence on GrainCorp. Subject to the satisfactory completion of this due diligence, ADM has agreed to make a cash offer, which would be unanimously recommended by the GrainCorp board, to acquire the company for A$12.20 per share (the potential offer). Under the terms of the bid implementation deed, GrainCorp will pay to its shareholders dividends out of current and retained earnings of the business prior to the transaction close.
 
We are pleased to have reached agreement with GrainCorp to conduct due diligence and, subject to that due diligence, put a recommended offer before GrainCorps shareholders, said ADM Chairman and CEO Patricia Woertz. We anticipate that the offer will be cash accretive in the first full year and will meet our key financial objectives.
 
GrainCorp is a leader in the Australian agribusiness sector. Should the offer proceed, the addition of GrainCorp to our global network would fit our strategy and help to further connect Australias growers with growing global demand for crops and food, particularly in Asia and the Middle East. ADM and GrainCorp have complementary geographies with little overlap and highly compatible cultures. We look forward to working with the GrainCorp team and Australian growers to build on their history of success.
 
The agreement permits ADM to undertake due diligence on GrainCorp for a seven-day period. Subject to the satisfactory completion of this due diligence, ADM will announce whether the potential offer will proceed or the agreement will be terminated. The announcement will occur prior to the completion of ADMs first-quarter earnings call, which has been rescheduled to begin May 1, 2013, at 5 p.m. Central U.S. Time (May 2, 2013, at 8 a.m. Australian Eastern Standard Time).
 
Should the potential offer proceed, ADM would announce a takeover bid to GrainCorp shareholders. GrainCorp has advised that such an offer would be unanimously recommended by the GrainCorp board, subject to there being no superior proposal, an independent expert confirming that the offer is fair and reasonable, and the regulatory conditions for the acquisition being satisfied or waived by Dec. 31, 2013.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If the potential offer proceeds, GrainCorp would pay to its shareholders, prior to the completion of the transaction, dividends totaling A$1.00 per share. If the regulatory conditions are not achieved by Oct. 1, 2013, GrainCorp will pay an additional dividend of A3.5 cents per share for each full month between Oct. 1, 2013, and the satisfaction or waiver of the regulatory conditions, subject to GrainCorp being profitable over that period.
 
The potential offer would imply an aggregate transaction value of A$3.4 billion, including GrainCorps net debt. The transaction value reflects the weighted average cost of acquiring the initial 19.8 percent stake in GrainCorp at an average of A$11.24 per share and the outstanding shares of GrainCorp at A$12.20 per share. The transaction is expected to be cash accretive in the first full year and to meet ADMs key financial objectives. Following successful completion of the due diligence process, ADM would provide additional details.
 
The offer would be subject to the conditions set out in the takeover bid implementation deed, viewable at www.adm.com, which include that ADM receives minimum acceptances of 50.1 percent. ADM presently owns 19.8 percent of GrainCorps shares.

ADM Reports First Quarter 2013 Earnings of $269 Million or $0.41 per Share
DECATUR, Ill., May 1, 2013  Archer Daniels Midland Company (NYSE: ADM) today reported financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2013. The company reported net earnings for the quarter of $269 million, or $0.41 per share, down from $0.60 per share in the same period one year earlier. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.48, down from $0.78 in the same period last year. Segment operating profit was $630 million.
1
1
As expected, this was a challenging quarter, with agricultural services negatively impacted by the ongoing effects of last summers U.S. drought, said ADM Chairman and CEO Patricia Woertz. In oilseeds, our earnings were reduced by challenges in Brazil and depressed margins in cocoa. Our ethanol business improved as declining inventories supported overall industry margins, and we began to see positive results from the actions weve been taking to improve the profitability of that business.
We continue to manage through tight U.S. stocks of oilseeds and grains until the North American harvest. Demand for our products remains solid, and we will continue to leverage our global origination and processing network to serve the needs of our customers worldwide.
First Quarter 2013 Highlights
 
 
______________________
 
Non-GAAP financial measures, see pages 5 and 10 for explanations and reconciliations
1
 
 
 
Adjusted EPS of 48 Cents, down 30 Cents
Adjusted EPS decreased primarily due to lower segment operating profit.
This quarters effective tax rate of 28 percent was in line with the same period last year.
Oilseeds Earnings Decline on Cocoa, South American Origination and North American Softseeds
Oilseeds operating profit in the first quarter was $313 million, down $229 million from the same period one year earlier. Year-ago results included net favorable mark-to-market timing effects of about $60 million, while this quarter included minimal timing effects.
Crushing and origination operating profit was $156 million, down $108 million from the year-ago quarter. In North America, softseed crushing results were down from last years strong results as tight supplies affected seed basis and capacity utilization. North American soybean crushing results were strong in the quarter, but margins and production declined through the quarter amid weaker export meal demand and lower bean availability. In South America, higher trucking costs and reluctant farmer selling negatively impacted results. European crushing and origination results continued to recover, aided by reduced imports of North and South American meal.
Refining, packaging, biodiesel and other generated a profit of $108 million for the quarter, up
$29 million, as U.S. biodiesel demand saw a modest recovery, offset by poor margin conditions in Europe. Results included about $20 million in biodiesel blenders credits, retroactive from 2012 blending.
Cocoa and other results decreased $181 million amid weaker press margins and the absence of last years $72 million favorable mark-to-market timing effect. Press margins were negatively impacted by the addition of industry processing capacity, lower cocoa powder prices, and customer inventory reductions.
Oilseeds results in Asia for the quarter were up $31 million from the same period last year, principally reflecting ADMs share of the improved results from Wilmar International Limited.
Corn Processing Results Reflect Improved Ethanol Conditions
Corn processing operating profit of $153 million represented an increase of $20 million from the same period one year earlier. This quarters results included a $44 million negative timing effect related to open corn cash-flow hedges at quarter end (about $0.04 per share), up from $11 million in the same period last year.
Sweeteners and starches operating profit decreased $19 million to $76 million, and was improved when adjusted for corn hedge-program timing effects, as solid demand translated to tight sweetener industry capacity.
 
 
 
Bioproducts results increased $39 million to $77 million. Ethanol margins improved through the quarter as reduced industry production rates, lower levels of imports and steady domestic demand resulted in reduced inventories and improved margins. Results also benefited from actions taken by ADM to improve the performance of its ethanol business.
Agricultural Services Pressured by Lower U.S. Volumes
Agricultural Services operating profit was $151 million, down $110 million from the same period one year earlier.
Merchandising and handling earnings declined $62 million to $86 million, due to lower volumes of U.S. origination and exports and lower execution margins in international merchandising.
Transportation results decreased $21 million to $6 million as lower U.S. exports reduced barge freight utilization.
Milling and other results remained steady, excluding last years $21 million equity income from Gruma. ADM disposed of its ownership in Gruma in December 2012. The milling business continued to perform well.
Other Financial Results Improve
Operating profit from ADMs Other Financial businesses was $13 million, up $31 million. Last years results had significant provisions for property and crop risk losses.
Provision for FCPA Matter
ADM is in discussions with the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission regarding a previously disclosed FCPA matter dating back to 2008 and earlier, and expects a resolution sometime this year. Based upon recent discussions, ADM believes it is appropriate to establish a provision of $25 million ($0.04 per share) to cover the potential assessments that may be imposed by these government agencies.

Segment Operating Profit and Corporate Results
(unaudited)
A non-GAAP financial measure
 
Total segment operating profit is ADMs consolidated income from operations before income tax that excludes certain corporate items. Management believes that segment operating profit is a useful measure of ADMs performance because it provides investors information about ADMs business unit performance excluding certain corporate overhead costs. Total segment operating profit is a non-GAAP financial measure and is not intended to replace earnings before income tax, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Total segment operating profit is not a measure of consolidated operating results under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to income before income taxes or any other measure of consolidated operating results under U.S. GAAP.

DECATUR, Ill., May 1, 2013 and SYDNEY, May 2, 2013Archer Daniels Midland Company (NYSE: ADM) announced today that it has completed due diligence on GrainCorp Limited (ASX: GNC) and intends to make a cash offer to acquire the outstanding common shares of the company for A$12.20 per share under the terms of the takeover bid implementation deed signed with GrainCorp last week.
We believe the offer delivers strong value for both companies shareholders, said ADM Chairman and CEO Patricia Woertz. The acquisition fits well with our growth strategy and will meet our return objectives. We are also confident in the cultural fit of our two companies: we share similar values of integrity, excellence and safety, with strong commitments to people, communities, customers and sustainability.
With the worlds population growing by half a billion people every decade, and with rising incomes driving increased consumption of grains and protein, global demand for agricultural products will continue to see significant growth. GrainCorp provides an excellent platform to serve that growth, particularly in fast-growing markets in the Middle East, Africa and Asia. Together, ADM and GrainCorp will give customers around the world access to a more diversified origination portfolio while providing Australian growers with greater access to world markets, enhanced logistics, and leading market insight.
The offer implies an aggregate transaction value of about A$3.4 billion. The transaction value reflects the weighted average cost of acquiring the initial 19.8 percent stake in GrainCorp at an average of A$11.24 per share, and the remaining shares of GrainCorp at A$12.20 per share. The transaction meets ADMs key financial objectives, and will be earnings accretive in the first full year. ADM will fund the acquisition through a combination of operating cash flows and debt.
As part of the agreement, GrainCorp will additionally pay to its shareholders, prior to the completion of the transaction, dividends totaling A$1.00 per share. If the regulatory conditions are not achieved by Oct. 1, 2013, GrainCorp will pay an additional dividend of A3.5 cents per share for each full month between Oct. 1, 2013 and the satisfaction or waiver of the regulatory conditions, subject to GrainCorp being profitable over that period.
GrainCorp has indicated that the ADM offer would be unanimously recommended by the GrainCorp board, subject to there being no superior proposal, an independent expert confirming that the offer is fair and reasonable, and the regulatory conditions for the acquisition being satisfied or waived by Dec. 31, 2013.
The offer is subject to conditions, set out in the takeover bid implementation deed viewable at www.adm.com, which include ADM receiving a minimum acceptance of 50.1 percent of GrainCorp shares. ADM presently owns 19.8 percent of GrainCorps shares.
 
 
 
The company will discuss the GrainCorp transaction during todays first quarter financial results conference call and audio webcast at 5 p.m. Central U.S. Time (8 a.m. Australian Eastern Standard Time). To listen to the call via the Internet or to download the slide presentation, go to www.adm.com/webcast. To listen by telephone, dial (888) 522-5398 in the U.S. or (706) 902-2121 if calling from outside the U.S. The access code is 32838804.
ADM will file a Bidders Statement, and GrainCorp will file a Targets Statement with the Australian Securities Exchange (the ASX).
