Exhibit 99
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
 
SAN DIEGO(April 29, 2003)AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. (NYSE:AHS) today reported revenue and earnings results for the first quarter of 2003. These results reflect a 15% increase in revenue to $199.8 million, up from $174.0 million for the same period a year ago. The company reported net income of $12.4 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2003, up from $0.24 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2002, representing an increase of 21%.
 
"Our earnings performance in the first quarter illustrates the strength of the AMN model and our ability to execute that model effectively in a dynamic market," said Steven C. Francis, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Our revenue growth of 15% for the quarter, compared to the prior year, was primarily driven by a 10% increase in travel healthcare professionals working on assignment, with an average of over 8,000 during the quarter. This traveler growth, combined with the benefit of effective cost management, translated into strong earnings growth."
 
Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and non-cash stock-based compensation related to the company's initial public offering (adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure) increased 13% to $21.9 million for the first quarter of 2003, up from $19.5 million for the first quarter of 2002. The adjusted EBITDA margin for the first quarter of 2003 of 11.0% was relatively flat compared to 11.2% for the first quarter of 2002, as the company's effective leveraging of selling, general and administrative expenses during the quarter was offset by higher costs associated with travelers.
 
Gross profit increased to $44.8 million for the first quarter of 2003, compared to $42.2 million for the first quarter of 2002, driven primarily by growth in the average number of travelers on assignment and partially offset by higher nurse compensation and other direct costs during the quarter. This resulted in a first quarter gross margin of 22.4%, compared to the 24.3% gross margin reported in the first quarter of last year.
 
 
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the first quarter of 2003 improved substantially to 11.4% of revenue, compared to 13.1% of revenue for the first quarter of 2002, reflecting the effective leveraging of the company's flexible operating model and infrastructure.
 
The company, which continues to be debt free, with over $28 million of cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2003, generated over $21 million in net cash from operating activities for the first quarter of 2003. The company continued its progress in its share repurchase program, spending $31 million to purchase 2.4 million shares during the first quarter of 2003. Since the inception of the share repurchase program in November 2002, the company has spent $66 million to acquire 4.5 million shares of the company's stock in open market purchases.
 
Revenue and Earnings Guidance for Second Quarter 2003
 
As announced last quarter, the current uncertainty in the travel healthcare staffing industry limits the company's visibility as to revenue and earnings guidance. Therefore, the company will continue its announced practice of limiting guidance to the next quarter to be reported. For the second quarter of 2003, the company expects to generate revenue ranging from $178 million to $182 million. The company expects net income for the second quarter to be between $9.0 million and $9.9 million, or approximately $0.22 to $0.24 per diluted share. The company expects to have approximately 40.6 million average diluted shares outstanding for the second quarter of 2003.
 
"Our hospital clients continue to seek opportunities to employ the best mix of permanent and flexible staff, while currently attempting to stretch the productivity of their nursing resources. These changes in demand trends, combined with the uncertainty brought on by the current U.S. economy, continue to limit our visibility and have decreased the current demand for our services," added Mr. Francis. "However, we believe that the company's fundamental long-term drivers, primarily our hospital clients' need for cost-effective variable staffing solutions, rising admissions and the escalating long-term nursing shortage, will fuel AMN's long-term growth prospects. We strongly believe that our industry-leading position, combined with our proven operating model and the outstanding execution by our management team and employees, will position us for continued success."

ITEM 12.    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
 
On July 28, 2003, we reported our second quarter 2003 results. Our second quarter 2003 results are discussed in detail in the press release attached hereto as Exhibit 99, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT 99
 
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
 
SAN DIEGO  (July 28, 2003)  AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. (NYSE:AHS) today reported revenue and earnings results for the second quarter of 2003. The company reported earnings per diluted share of $0.27 for the second quarter of 2003, up 4% over the $0.26 per diluted share reported in the second quarter of 2002. The company generated net income of $11.2 million for the second quarter of 2003, compared to $12.5 million reported for the second quarter of 2002, a decline of 10%. Revenue for the second quarter of 2003 was $183.4 million, a decline of 4% from the $191.2 million reported for the same period a year ago. For the six months ended June 30, 2003, the company reported revenue of $383.1 million, representing an increase of 5% from the $365.2 million reported for the same period a year ago. For the six months ended June 30, 2003, the company reported earnings per diluted share of $0.56, an increase of 12% over the $0.50 per diluted share reported for the same period a year ago.
"Considering the extremely favorable financial results achieved by AMN last year and the recent pressures being experienced by the healthcare staffing industry, we are pleased with our performance for the second quarter. Our ability to exceed our expectations for the quarter was the direct result of focused efforts by our team, the flexibility of our business model and our hospital clients' continued preference for AMN's high quality nurses and value-added services. These same elements are why AMN continues to be the leader in the industry," said Steven C. Francis, Chief Executive Officer. "A combination of improved sequential gross profit margins, careful operating expense management and an effective share repurchase program resulted in an
 
improvement in diluted earnings per share for our stockholders this quarter compared to the prior year, even in the face of a challenging environment."
Earnings before interest (net of investment income), taxes, depreciation, amortization, and non-cash stock-based compensation related to the company's initial public offering (adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure) was $20.0 million for the second quarter of 2003, representing a 9% decline from the second quarter of 2002. The adjusted EBITDA margin during the second quarter of 2003 of 10.9% declined slightly from 11.5% during the second quarter of 2002. The company's net income margin of 6.1% during the second quarter of 2003 declined from 6.5% during the second quarter of 2002. The company's effective control of selling, general and administrative expenses during the quarter was offset by higher direct wage and insurance costs for its healthcare professionals.
Gross profit for the second quarter of 2003 was $42.0 million, compared to $46.4 million for the second quarter of 2002. The decrease was driven primarily by a decline in the average number of healthcare professionals on assignment, and higher compensation and other direct costs during the quarter. This resulted in a second quarter gross margin of 22.9%, compared to the 24.3% gross margin reported in the second quarter of last year and the 22.4% gross margin reported in the first quarter of 2003.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the second quarter of 2003 improved to 12.0% of revenue, compared to 12.8% of revenue for the second quarter of 2002, reflecting the cost-effective impact of the company's flexible operating model and infrastructure.
The company, which continues to be debt free, with $43.5 million of cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, 2003, generated $25.0 million in net cash provided by operating activities for the second quarter of 2003.
 
Revenue and Earnings Guidance for Third Quarter 2003
 
The company provides revenue and earnings guidance for the next quarter to be reported, consistent with its previously announced practice. For the third quarter of 2003, the company expects to generate revenue ranging between $165 million and $171 million, resulting in net income ranging between $7.5 million and $8.6 million, or approximately $0.18 and $0.21 per diluted share. The company expects to have approximately 41.3 million average diluted shares outstanding for the third quarter of 2003.
 
"In an effort to expand our leading market position, we are augmenting our investment in client-focused initiatives to solidify AMN's position as the preferred staffing partner with hospitals across the country," added Mr. Francis. "We believe that the company's fundamental long-term drivers, primarily the projected escalating nursing shortage and increasing hospital admissions, along with the need for cost-effective variable staffing solutions, will fuel AMN's long-term growth prospects. Our focus on meeting the changing needs of both our healthcare facility clients and our healthcare professionals will strengthen our ability to achieve success in the future."

On November 4, 2003, we reported our third quarter 2003 results. Our third quarter 2003 results are discussed in detail in the press release attached hereto as Exhibit 99, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
Date: November 5, 2003
 
 
 

EXHIBIT 99
 
 
 
 
 
SAN DIEGO  (November 4, 2003)  AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. (NYSE: AHS) today reported revenue and earnings results for the quarter ended September 30, 2003. The company reported revenue for the third quarter of $171.5 million, compared to $203.4 million for the third quarter of 2002. The company generated net income of $9.3 million for the third quarter of 2003, resulting in earnings per diluted share of $0.22, compared to net income of $14.3 million for the third quarter of 2002, or $0.30 per diluted share. For the nine months ended September 30, 2003, the company reported revenue of $554.6 million, compared to $568.6 million for the same period a year ago. For the nine months ended September 30, 2003, the company reported earnings per diluted share of $0.78, compared to $0.80 per diluted share for the same period a year ago.
 
"Our performance for the third quarter was positive, especially given the market pressures that our industry experienced earlier in the year. Our ability to meet or exceed our guidance for the third quarter is the result of a more stabilized demand environment, combined with AMN's focused efforts on continuing to differentiate our services to our hospital clients and our travelers," said Steven C. Francis, Chief Executive Officer.
 
Gross margin for the third quarter of 22.8%, which was in line with the company's expectations and was consistent with the 22.9% reported in the second quarter of 2003, declined compared to 24.4% reported in the third quarter of 2002. Gross profit for the third quarter of 2003 was $39.0 million, compared to $49.7 million for the third quarter of 2002.
 
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the third quarter of 2003 of $22.2 million represented a decline of 12%, or $2.9 million, compared to the same period in 2002. Selling,
general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of revenue, increased from 12.3% for the third quarter of 2002 to 12.9% for the third quarter of 2003, primarily as a result of relatively consistent fixed costs compared to a decline in revenue.
 
Income from operations was $15.4 million for the third quarter of 2003, compared to $23.5 million reported for the third quarter of 2002. The income from operations margin during the third quarter of 2003 of 9.0% was lower than the 11.5% reported for the third quarter of 2002, primarily due to the higher level of direct wage and benefit costs for healthcare professionals experienced by the company in the current year.
 
The company had $56.1 million of cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2003, and generated $17.5 million in net cash provided by operating activities for the third quarter of 2003.
 
As previously reported, on October 16, 2003, the company completed a $180.0 million tender offer for the company's equity securities. In the tender offer, the company purchased 9,722,222 shares of common stock at $18.00 per share for a total of $175.0 million. The company also purchased 376,029 stock options at a price of $18.00 per option less the applicable option exercise price for a total of $5.0 million. The tender offer, including the related transaction costs, was financed under the company's amended credit facility, which included a new $130.0 million senior secured term loan and $15.0 million of borrowings under the revolving portion of the credit facility, and approximately $39.5 million from cash and cash equivalents on-hand.
 
Revenue and Earnings Guidance for Fourth Quarter 2003
 
Consistent with previous practice, the company provides revenue and earnings guidance for the next quarter to be reported. For the fourth quarter of 2003, the company expects to generate revenue ranging between $158 million and $162 million, resulting in net income, excluding a charge related to the tender offer completed in October, ranging between $5.0 million and $6.1 million, or approximately $0.15 and $0.18 per diluted share. During the fourth quarter, the company expects to record a charge of approximately $1.1 million within selling, general and administrative expenses related to compensation expense associated with stock options that were purchased in the tender offer. Including this charge, the company expects to report fourth quarter earnings per diluted share of $0.13 to $0.16, and net income between $4.3 million and $5.4 million. Volume trends for the fourth quarter are projected to be relatively steady compared to the end of the third quarter of 2003. The normal seasonal decline in travelers that occurs each December is expected to have a more pronounced impact on the company's fourth quarter results, compared to previous years when the company experienced exceptionally high growth rates. The company expects to have an average of approximately 33.2 million diluted shares outstanding for the fourth quarter of 2003, reflecting the repurchase of common stock and options in the tender offer completed in October.
 
"We believe our continued effort to expand our leading market position is raising the level of service delivered to our hospital clients across the country," said Francis. "Our confidence in our industry's fundamental long-term drivers, primarily the benefits of flexible staffing, the projected escalating nursing shortage and increasing hospital admissions, continues to be strong. Indications of an improving U.S. economy, combined with signs of continued sequential stability in demand for our services, are encouraging as we look forward to the future."

ITEM 12. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
 
On February 25, 2004, we reported our fourth quarter 2003 results. Our fourth quarter 2003 results are discussed in detail in the press release attached hereto as Exhibit 99, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 

Exhibit 99
 
 
 
 
SAN DIEGO  (February 25, 2004)  AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. (NYSE: AHS) today reported revenue and earnings results for the quarter and year-ended December 31, 2003. Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2003 was $159.6 million, compared to $207.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2002. The company generated adjusted net income of $5.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2003, resulting in adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.17, which excludes a $0.02 per diluted share charge related to its October 2003 self-tender offer. The company generated net income of $4.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2003, resulting in earnings per diluted share of $0.15, after giving effect for the tender offer charge of $0.02 per diluted share. The tender offer charge of $1.2 million is recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses and relates to compensation expense associated with stock options that were purchased in the tender offer. In the fourth quarter of 2002, the company generated net income of $14.4 million, or $0.31 per diluted share. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2003 includes net interest expense of $2.0 million compared to net interest income of $0.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2002. The average diluted shares outstanding in the fourth quarter of 2003 were 33.1 million, as compared to an average of 45.8 million diluted shares outstanding in the fourth quarter of 2002.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2003, the company reported revenue of $714.2 million, compared to $775.7 million for the same period a year ago. The company generated adjusted net income of $38.5 million for 2003, resulting in adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.97, which excludes the tender offer charge of $0.02 per diluted share. The company generated net income for 2003 of $37.8 million resulting in earnings per diluted share of $0.95, compared to net income of $52.4 million, or $1.12 per diluted share, for 2002.
"Given the market pressures that our industry experienced earlier in 2003, we are proud of our performance for the fourth quarter and for the year. Since October, we have been encouraged by the improving demand for our services as evidenced by increased client orders. Historically, there has been a lag between the changes in client orders and the impact of these changes to our financial results. However, this favorable trend in our industry, combined with our strong market position, provides us with optimism as we look ahead. Additionally, we completed our tender offer in October, which we believe was an effective use of our capital structure that provides tangible benefits to our shareholders," said Steven C. Francis, Chief Executive Officer.
 
Gross margin for the fourth quarter of 22.8% was in line with the company's expectations and was consistent with the 22.8% reported in the third quarter of 2003, but does represent a decline compared to the 24.4% reported in the fourth quarter of 2002. Gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2003 was $36.4 million, compared to $50.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2002. The decline in gross margin compared to the prior year quarter is primarily due to the higher level of direct wage and benefit costs for healthcare professionals in 2003.
 
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter of 2003 were $25.5 million in total, including a $1.2 million pre-tax charge related to the fourth quarter tender offer. This represents 16.0% of revenue for the fourth quarter of 2003, compared to 12.9% for the third quarter of 2003 and 12.3% for the fourth quarter of 2002. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of revenue, compared to the prior year was primarily the result of the stock compensation charge related to the tender offer, an increase in professional liability insurance expense, and relatively consistent fixed costs compared to a decline in revenue.
 
Income from operations was $9.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2003, compared to $23.5 million reported for the fourth quarter of 2002. The income from operations margin
 
during the fourth quarter of 2003 of 5.8% was lower than the 11.4% reported for the fourth quarter of 2002, as a result of the lower gross profit margin and higher selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue.
 
At December 31, 2003, the company had $4.7 million of cash and cash equivalents and debt of $138.9 million. The Company generated $1.0 million in net cash provided by operating activities during the fourth quarter of 2003.
 
As previously reported, on October 16, 2003, the company completed a $180 million self-tender offer for the company's equity securities. In the tender offer, the company purchased approximately 10 million shares of common stock and stock options. The tender offer was financed under the company's amended credit facility, which included a new $130 million senior secured term loan and $15 million of borrowings under the revolving portion of the credit facility, and with approximately $35 million from cash and cash equivalents on-hand.
 
Revenue and Earnings Guidance for First Quarter 2004
 
Consistent with previous practice, the company provides revenue and earnings guidance for the next quarter to be reported. Revenue for the first quarter of 2004 is expected to range between $160 million and $163 million, resulting in net income ranging between $4.4 million and $5.1 million, or approximately $0.14 and $0.16 per diluted share. The company expects to have an average of approximately 31.3 million diluted shares outstanding for the first quarter of 2004.
 
"We expect first quarter traveler count to be comparable with the prior quarter. This would represent the first time since the beginning of 2003 in which traveler count has not declined from one quarter to the next. We believe this is a positive trend that reflects both a stabilizing market environment and the results of our recent investments in our sales and service teams, ultimately allowing us to better serve our clients," said Francis.

ITEM 12. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
 
On April 28, 2004, we reported our first quarter 2004 results. Our first quarter 2004 results are discussed in detail in the press release attached hereto as Exhibit 99, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
Date: April 28, 2004
 

Exhibit 99
 
 
 
 
SAN DIEGO  (April 28, 2004)  AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. (NYSE: AHS) today reported revenue for the first quarter of 2004 of $161.3 million, compared to $199.8 million for the first quarter of 2003, and $159.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2003. The company generated net income of $4.6 million for the first quarter of 2004, resulting in diluted earnings per share of $0.15. This compares to net income of $12.4 million, or diluted earnings per share of $0.29 for the first quarter of 2003, and net income of $4.9 million, or diluted earnings per share of $0.15 for the fourth quarter of 2003. Diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2003 included a $0.02 per share charge for compensation expense associated with stock options purchased in connection with the company's $180 million self-tender offer in October 2003.
 
"The first quarter's results, highlighted by sequentially stable volume and revenue over the fourth quarter, mark an important and positive inflection point for AMN. We believe that these results reflect the stabilizing market environment and the effectiveness of our operational initiatives and sales and service teams," said Steven C. Francis, Chief Executive Officer.
 
In line with the Company's expectations, gross profit margin for the first quarter was 22.2%, which was relatively consistent with the 22.4% reported in the first quarter of 2003, but slightly lower than the 22.8% reported in the fourth quarter of 2003. Gross profit for the first quarter of 2004 was $35.8 million, compared to $44.8 million for the first quarter of 2003 and $36.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2003. The gross profit margin decline in the first quarter
from the fourth quarter was consistent with historical patterns due to the impact of higher housing and traveler payroll costs driven by a higher percentage of new traveler assignments and fewer days in the first quarter.
 
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the first quarter of 2004 were $24.6 million, representing 15.3% of revenue, compared to $22.8 million, or 11.4% of revenue for the first quarter of 2003, and $25.5 million, or 16.0% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2003. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2003, adjusted to exclude the $1.2 million charge related to the October 2003 self-tender offer, selling, general and administrative expenses for the first quarter of 2004 remained relatively constant in total dollars and as a percentage of revenue.
 
Income from operations was $9.5 million for the first quarter of 2004, compared to $20.6 million for the first quarter of 2003, and $9.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2003. The income from operations margin for the first quarter of 2004 of 5.9% was comparable to the 5.8% operating margin reported in the fourth quarter of 2003, but lower than the 10.3% reported for the first quarter of 2003 as a result of lower gross profit margin and higher selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue.
 
Net income for the first quarter of 2004 included net interest expense of $2.1 million, compared to net interest expense of $0.1 million in the first quarter of 2003, and $2.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2003. The increase in interest expense over the prior year was a result of borrowings associated with the self-tender offer for approximately 10 million of the company's equity securities. The weighted average diluted shares outstanding in the first quarter of 2004 was 31.3 million, compared to a weighted average of 43.0 million diluted shares outstanding in the first quarter of 2003 and 33.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2003.
 
As of March 31, 2004, the company had $6.8 million of cash and cash equivalents and debt of $137 million. The company generated $5.7 million in cash provided by operating activities during the first quarter of 2004.
 
Revenue and Earnings Guidance for Second Quarter 2004
 
Consistent with previous practice, the company provides revenue and earnings guidance for the next quarter to be reported. Revenue for the second quarter of 2004 is expected to range between $157 million and $161 million, resulting in net income ranging between $4.0 million and $5.0 million, or diluted earnings per share of approximately $0.13 to $0.16. The company expects to have an average of approximately 31.4 million diluted shares outstanding for the second quarter of 2004.
 
"Considering the historical seasonal decline in demand and working travelers that normally occurs during the second quarter, we believe that our projections for the second quarter reflect continued stabilization in the market environment. Our prospects for short term and long term growth are driven by overall improvement in the U.S. economy, increasing hospital admissions, the focus on the quality of patient care, and cost effectiveness of travel healthcare professionals. These trends continue to give us confidence and optimism for the future strengthening of our market," said Francis.

AMN Healthcare Services, Inc., a leading healthcare staffing company, is the largest nationwide provider of travel nurse staffing services. The company recruits nurses and allied health professionals nationally and internationally and places them on temporary assignments, of variable lengths, at acute-care hospitals and healthcare facilities throughout the United States.

ITEM 12. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
 
On July 28, 2004, we reported our second quarter 2004 results. Additionally, we announced certain changes to our management. These items are discussed in detail in the press release attached hereto as Exhibit 99, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
Date: July 28, 2004
 

Exhibit 99
 
 
 
 
 
SAN DIEGO  (July 28, 2004)  AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. (NYSE: AHS) today reported revenue for the second quarter of 2004 of $153.4 million, compared to $183.4 million for the second quarter of 2003, and $161.3 million for the first quarter of 2004. The company generated net income of $4.3 million for the second quarter of 2004, resulting in diluted earnings per share of $0.14. This compares to net income of $11.2 million, or diluted earnings per share of $0.27 for the second quarter of 2003, and net income of $4.6 million, or diluted earnings per share of $0.15 for the first quarter of 2004.
 
For the six months ended June 30, 2004, the company reported revenue of $314.6 million, compared to $383.1 million reported for the same period a year ago. For the six months ended June 30, 2004, the company reported earnings per diluted share of $0.28, compared to $0.56 per diluted share reported for the same period a year ago.
 
"We believe our solid second quarter financial results confirm the continued stabilization of our market. Demand for our services continued to grow during the second quarter, representing the third consecutive quarter of increasing demand. However, the corresponding growth in the supply of travel healthcare professionals has not kept pace with the increase in demand that we have experienced. It appears that it is taking longer for nurses to recognize the breadth of the travel nursing opportunities that are currently available. This lag in supply
growth contributed to revenue falling slightly below our expectations in the second quarter. We anticipate that the supply of nurses will grow in the future as the awareness of travel nursing opportunities spread," said Steven C. Francis, chief executive officer.
 
In line with the company's expectations, gross profit margin for the second quarter of 2004 was 22.8%, reflecting an anticipated seasonal improvement over the 22.2% reported in the first quarter of 2004, and in line with the 22.9% reported in the second quarter of 2003. Gross profit for the second quarter of 2004 was $35.0 million, compared to $42.0 million for the second quarter of 2003 and $35.8 million for the first quarter of 2004.
 
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the second quarter of 2004 were $24.0 million, representing 15.7% of revenue, compared to $22.0 million, or 12.0% of revenue for the second quarter of 2003, and $24.6 million, or 15.3% of revenue in the first quarter of 2004. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses compared to the prior year was primarily due to the expansion of corporate facilities and increased professional liability insurance costs.
 
Income from operations was $9.2 million for the second quarter of 2004, compared to $18.6 million for the second quarter of 2003, and $9.5 million for the first quarter of 2004. The income from operations margin for the second quarter of 2004 was 6.0%, relatively consistent with the first quarter of 2004, and lower than the 10.1% reported for the second quarter of 2003, primarily as a result of higher selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue.
 
Net income for the second quarter of 2004 included net interest expense of $2.1 million, compared to net interest expense of $0.1 million in the second quarter of 2003, and $2.1 million in the first quarter of 2004. The increase in interest expense over the prior year was a result of borrowings associated with the self-tender offer for approximately 10 million of the company's equity securities in October 2003. The weighted average diluted shares outstanding in the second quarter of 2004 was 31.3 million.
 
As of June 30, 2004, the company had $13.8 million of cash and cash equivalents and debt of $128.5 million. The company generated $15.2 million in cash provided by operating activities during the second quarter of 2004. In addition, in order to provide increased financing flexibility and liquidity under the company's $205 million credit facility, the company recently amended certain covenants under the company's credit agreement.
 
Revenue and Earnings Guidance for Third Quarter 2004
 
Consistent with previous practice, the company provides revenue and earnings guidance for the next quarter to be reported. Revenue for the third quarter of 2004 is expected to range between $151 million and $157 million, resulting in net income ranging between $3.3 million and $4.4 million, or diluted earnings per share of approximately $0.11 to $0.14. The company expects to have an average of approximately 31.5 million diluted shares outstanding for the third quarter of 2004.
 
"Our third quarter guidance projects revenues that are approximately equal to the second quarter, reflecting a continued stabilization in our market. The rise in demand experienced this year certainly creates opportunity for growth, but further growth expansion in the supply of healthcare professionals interested in a travel career is also necessary to keep pace with the increasing needs of our hospital clients. We are confident in our belief that AMN's recruitment channels, combined with the focused initiatives that we have recently implemented, will give AMN a competitive advantage to capture future growth in supply. Additionally, we continue to believe that the macroeconomic and strategic drivers for our industry remain strong," said Mr. Francis.
 
Additionally Announced Today
 
In March 2004, AMN announced that Donald Myll, the company's chief financial officer and treasurer, intended to resign in order to refocus his career on emerging companies, his core interest. Mr. Myll's resignation will be effective August 11, 2004.
 
"All of us at AMN, including the board of directors, thank Don for his leadership and service to AMN," said Mr. Francis. "We wish him success with his future endeavors."
 
The company has appointed Susan Nowakowski as interim chief financial officer, a role that Ms. Nowakowski has previously performed at AMN, to replace Mr. Myll until a successor is named. Serving as interim chief accounting officer and treasurer will be AMN's current vice president of accounting and finance, Brent Rivard. Mr. Rivard joined AMN's corporate finance team in 2001 and has been actively involved in all corporate accounting, public reporting, operations planning, treasury and M&A activities. Mr. Rivard is a CPA, and prior to 2001, worked for Deloitte & Touche.
 
"Both Susan and Brent have solid financial experience," continued Mr. Francis. "I am confident in their abilities and that AMN's resources are more than sufficient to ensure appropriate operational and financial leadership for the company and its shareholders until Don's successor is named."
 
AMN has retained Heidrick and Struggles, an international senior-level executive recruiting firm, to search for a chief financial officer.

Item 2.02(a) Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
 
On March 8, 2005, we reported our fourth quarter 2004 results. Additionally, we announced certain changes to our management. These items are discussed in detail in the press release attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.
 
Item 9.01(c) Financial Statements and Exhibits.
 
99.1     Press release issued by the Company on March 8, 2005.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 
 
SAN DIEGO  (March 8th, 2005)  AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. (NYSE: AHS) today reported revenue and earnings results for the quarter and year-ended December 31, 2004. Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2004 was $158.3 million, compared to $159.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2003, and $156.1 million for the third quarter of 2004. The company generated net income of $4.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2004, resulting in diluted earnings per share of $0.14. This compares to net income of $4.9 million, or diluted earnings per share of $0.15 for the fourth quarter of 2003, and net income of $3.9 million, or diluted earnings per share of $0.13 for the third quarter of 2004.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2004, the company reported revenue of $629.0 million, compared to $714.2 million for the prior year. The year-over-year decrease in revenue was primarily due to the decrease in demand for the company's services experienced in 2003 and the delayed impact this reduced demand had on the supply of nurses willing to travel in 2004. The company generated net income of $17.3 million for 2004, resulting in diluted earnings per share of $0.55, compared to net income of $37.8 million, or $0.95 per diluted share, for 2003.
 
"We are pleased to report that the average number of travelers on assignment during the fourth quarter increased 3% from the prior quarter to 6,297. This was at the upper end of our expectations," said Steven Francis, chief executive officer. "Fourth quarter financial results were at the mid or higher-end of our expectations, reflecting both the continued stability in our market and what we continue to believe are early signs of a return to a modest growth market," added Mr. Francis.
 
Gross profit in the fourth quarter of 2004 was $36.9 million as compared to $36.4 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2003, and $36.7 million reported in the third quarter of 2004. Gross profit margin increased 50 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2004 to 23.3% as compared to 22.8% in the fourth quarter of 2003, and was comparable on a sequential basis to last quarter's gross profit margin. The increase in year-over-year gross profit margin was primarily due to a decrease in the cost of housing and insurance expenses partially offset by increased traveler compensation, as a percentage of revenue.
 
Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses in the fourth quarter of 2004 were $26.4 million as compared to $25.5 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2003, which included a charge of $1.2 million in 2003 related to last year's tender offer. The increase over the prior year was mainly related to higher employee and professional services for Sarbanes-Oxley compliance and an increase in bad debt expense, partially offset by lower professional liability insurance expense. Fourth quarter 2004 SG&A expenses in total were unchanged relative to the third quarter of 2004, which is reflective of the company's ongoing initiative to leverage its infrastructure and maintain consistent SG&A spending, exclusive of customary changes related to inflation or adjustments to insurance reserves.
 
Income from operations was $8.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2004, compared to $9.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2003, and $8.7 million for the third quarter 2004. Income from operations as a percentage of revenue for the fourth quarter 2004 was 5.6%, slightly lower than the 5.8% reported for the fourth quarter of 2003, yet a slight improvement over the third quarter of 2004.
 
Net interest expense for the fourth quarter of 2004 was $1.8 million, compared to net interest expense of $2.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2003, and $2.4 million in the third quarter of 2004. The decrease in year-over-year interest expense reflects the company's strong cash flow and aggressive debt reductions during the year. Interest expense in the fourth quarter of 2004 decreased from the third quarter of 2004 due mainly to the write-off of deferred financing costs recorded in the third quarter of 2004.
 
AMN used $1.8 million in cash for operating activities during the fourth quarter of 2004, due mainly to the higher number of traveler pay dates during the quarter compared to the prior quarter; however, for the year AMN generated $39.0 million in net cash from operating activities. Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2004 totaled $3.9 million and total debt outstanding at December 31, 2004 was $101.7 million, which represented a reduction of $37.2 million since December 31, 2003. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 31.4 million for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2004.
 
Revenue and Earnings Guidance
 
AMN's past policy since late 2002 was to provide guidance for the upcoming reporting quarter only. However, with the recent market stabilization the company is expanding its guidance to include the full year 2005. Annual revenue is expected to grow 4% to 5% as compared to 2004, ranging from $654 million to $660 million. Gross margin is expected to remain at approximately 23%. Diluted earnings per share, excluding the impact of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 123R ("SFAS 123R"), is expected to range from $0.64 to $0.68. Full year 2005 earnings per share is expected to benefit from the combination of growth in revenue, leverage resulting from stable SG&A spending, and lower interest expense from reduced debt balances.
 
First quarter 2005 revenue is expected to range from $155 million to $157 million, reflecting two fewer billing days in the first quarter as compared to the fourth quarter of 2004. First quarter diluted earnings per share is expected to range from $0.12 to $0.13. Second quarter 2005 revenue is expected to trend closely with the first quarter, in a range from $156 million to $160 million. Due to key market growth assumptions and expected seasonal trends, third quarter 2005 revenue is projected to grow approximately 6% to 8% over the second quarter, and fourth quarter 2005 revenue is expected to grow approximately 1% to 2% over the third quarter. Given this increased revenue projection and the expectation of stable SG&A spending and reduced interest expense, diluted earnings per share is expected to grow at notably higher rates during the second half of 2005.
 
Key assumptions used in the development of the 2005 guidance include continued stability in the healthcare staffing market prompted by the economic recovery, a continued decrease in unemployment rates and growth in hospital admission levels expected during the last half of the year. The company has taken these external variables into consideration in setting its guidance. However, it is important to recognize that changes in these and other variables could negatively impact the company's quarterly and annual estimates.
 
"We have been encouraged by the continuing signs of recovery in the market and remain confident that the healthcare staffing industry is improving. These factors, combined with our continued focus on efficiency and customer service, provide a solid foundation for modest business growth in 2005," said Mr. Francis.
 
Executive Changes
 
Robert Haas, the company's non-executive chairman and director since November 1999, has announced that he will step down from his position as chairman effective May 4, 2005, in conjunction with the annual shareholders' meeting. He will continue to serve as a director and chairman of the executive committee. Steven Francis, co-founder of the company, director and current chief executive officer, will assume the role of executive chairman and will be actively engaged in the strategic development and operational oversight of the company. Susan Nowakowski, currently president, chief operating officer and director, will become chief executive officer. Ms. Nowakowski has been with AMN Healthcare for over 15 years and prior to her appointment as president in 2003, also held positions as executive vice president and chief financial officer.
 
"AMN has clearly reached a position of leadership and stability in the healthcare staffing industry," said Mr. Haas. "I am confident that Steven Francis and Susan Nowakowski will continue to take the company to the next level."

Forward-Looking Statements
 
This press release contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The company has tried, whenever possible, to identify these forward-looking statements using words such as "anticipates," "believes," "estimates," "projects," "expects," "plans," "intends" and similar expressions. Similarly, statements herein that describe the company's business strategy, outlook, objectives, plans, intentions or goals are also forward-looking statements. Accordingly, such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which could cause the company's actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, such statements. These risks and uncertainties may include, but are not limited to: the company's ability to continue to recruit and retain qualified temporary healthcare professionals
 
at reasonable costs; the company's ability to attract and retain sales and operational personnel; the company's ability to enter into contracts with hospitals and other healthcare facility clients on terms attractive to the company and to secure orders related to those contracts; the company's ability to demonstrate the value of its services to its healthcare and facility clients; changes in the timing of hospital and healthcare facility clients' orders for and the company's placement of its temporary healthcare professionals; the general level of patient occupancy at the company's hospital and healthcare facility clients' facilities; the overall level of demand for services offered by temporary healthcare staffing providers; the ability of the company's hospital and healthcare facility clients to retain and increase the productivity of their permanent staff; the company's ability to successfully implement its strategic growth, acquisition and integration strategies; the company's ability to leverage its cost structure; the performance of the company's management information and communication systems; the effect of existing or future government legislation and regulation; the company's ability to grow and operate its business in compliance with legislation and regulation; the impact of medical malpractice and other claims asserted against the company; the disruption or adverse impact to the company's business as a result of a terrorist attack; the company's ability to carry out its business strategy; the effect of recognition by the company of an impairment to goodwill; the effect of control by the company's existing majority stockholder; and the effect of adjustments by the company to accruals for self-insured retentions. Other factors that could cause actual results to differ from those implied by the forward-looking statements contained in this press release are set forth in the company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2003, and the company's quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. These statements reflect the company's current beliefs and are based upon information currently available to it. Be advised that developments subsequent to this release are likely to cause these statements to become outdated with the passage of time. The company does not intend, however, to update the guidance provided today prior to its next earnings release.
 
The accounting provisions of SFAS 123R are effective for the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after June 15, 2005. The company is required and plans to adopt SFAS 123R in the third quarter of fiscal 2005.

The indemnity agreement set forth in this Section 8(a) shall be in addition to any liabilities that the Company may otherwise have.
 
(b) . Each of the Selling Stockholders, severally and not jointly, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Underwriter, its officers and employees, and each person, if any, who controls the Underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense, as incurred, to which the Underwriter or such controlling person may become subject, under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or other federal or state statutory law or regulation, or at common law or otherwise (including in settlement of any litigation, if such settlement is effected with the written consent of the Selling Stockholders), insofar as such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense (or actions in respect thereof as contemplated below) arises out of or is based: (i) upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, or any amendment thereto, including any information deemed to be a part thereof pursuant to Rule 430A or Rule 434 under the Securities Act, or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or (ii) upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or the omission or alleged omission

The indemnity agreement set forth in this Section 8(b) shall be in addition to any liabilities that the Selling Stockholders may otherwise have.
 
(c) . The Underwriter agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signed the Registration Statement, the Selling Stockholders and each person, if any, who controls the Company or any Selling Stockholder within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense, as incurred, to which the Company, or any such director, officer, Selling Stockholder or controlling person may become subject, under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, or other federal or state statutory law or regulation, or at common law or otherwise (including in settlement of any litigation, if such settlement is effected with the written consent of such Underwriter), insofar as such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense (or actions in respect thereof as contemplated below) arises out of or is based upon any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or arises out of or is based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Underwriter expressly for use therein and to reimburse the Company, or any such director, officer, Selling Stockholder or controlling person for any legal and other expense reasonably incurred by the Company, or any such director,
Indemnification of the Company,
Its Directors and Officers and the Selling Stockholders
 
officer, Selling Stockholder or controlling person in connection with investigating, defending, settling, compromising or paying any such loss, claim, damage, liability, expense or action. Each of the Company and each of the Selling Stockholders hereby acknowledges that the only information that the Underwriter has furnished to the Company and the Selling Stockholders expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) are the statements set forth in the eighth and ninth paragraphs under the caption "Underwriting" in the Prospectus, concerning penalty bids and stabilizing transactions; and the Underwriter confirms that such statements are correct. The indemnity agreement set forth in this Section 8(c) shall be in addition to any liabilities that the Underwriter may otherwise have.
 
(d) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof, but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party for contribution or otherwise than under the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 8 or to the extent it is not prejudiced as a proximate result of such failure. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party and such indemnified party seeks or intends to seek indemnity from an indemnifying party, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate in, and, to the extent that it shall elect, jointly with all other indemnifying parties similarly notified, by written notice delivered to the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party; provided, however, if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that a conflict may arise between the positions of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party in conducting the defense of any such action or that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to assume such legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties. Upon receipt of notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of such indemnifying party's election so to assume the defense of such action and approval by the indemnified party of counsel, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 8 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof unless (i) the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in accordance with the proviso to the next preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the reasonable expenses of more than one separate counsel (together with local counsel), approved by the indemnifying party, representing the indemnified parties who are parties to such action) or (ii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of commencement of the action, in each of which cases the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel shall be at the expense of the indemnifying party.
Notifications and Other Indemnification Procedures.
 
(e) The indemnifying party under this Section 8 shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such
Settlements.
 
consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by Section 8(d) hereof, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement, except, with respect to clause (ii), to the extent the indemnifying party has provided written notice to the indemnified party that the indemnifying party disputes in good faith the unpaid balance of such fees and expenses for which reimbursement was requested. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement, compromise or consent to the entry of judgment in any pending or threatened action, suit or proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity was or could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such action, suit or proceeding.
 
Section 9. If the indemnification provided for in Section 8 is for any reason held to be unavailable to or otherwise insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount paid or payable by such indemnified party, as incurred, as a result of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Selling Stockholders, on the one hand, and the Underwriter, on the other hand, from the offering of the Common Shares pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company and the Selling Stockholders, on the one hand, and the Underwriter, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and the Selling Stockholders, on the one hand, and the Underwriter, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Common Shares pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Common Shares pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the Selling Stockholders, and the total underwriting discount received by the Underwriter, in each case as set forth on the front cover page of the Prospectus (or, if Rule 434 under the Securities Act is used, the corresponding location on the Term Sheet) bear to the aggregate public offering price of the Common Shares as set forth on such cover. The relative fault of the Company and the Selling Stockholders, on the one hand, and the Underwriter, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Selling Stockholders (in the case of a Selling Stockholder, if such information was furnished to the Company in writing by such Selling Stockholder expressly for use in the Preliminary Prospectus, Prospectus or Registration Statement under the caption
Contribution.
 
"Principal and Selling Stockholders"), on the one hand, or the Underwriter, on the other hand, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
 
The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 8(d), any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim. The provisions set forth in Section 8(d) with respect to notice of commencement of any action shall apply if a claim for contribution is to be made under this Section 9; provided, however, that no additional notice shall be required with respect to any action for which notice has been given under Section 8(d) for purposes of indemnification.
 
The Company, the Selling Stockholders and the Underwriter agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 9 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 9.
 
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 9, (i) the Underwriter shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the underwriting commissions received by the Underwriter in connection with the Common Shares underwritten by it and distributed to the public and (ii) no Selling Stockholder shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the net proceeds received by such Selling Stockholder from the sale of Common Shares hereunder. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Selling Stockholders' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 9 are several, and not joint, in proportion to their respective aggregate sale proceeds of Common Shares (including Optional Common Shares). For purposes of this Section 9, each officer and employee of the Underwriter or a Selling Stockholder, as applicable, and each person, if any, who controls the Underwriter or a Selling Stockholder, as applicable, within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Underwriter or such Selling Stockholder, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company.
 
Section 10. Prior to the First Closing Date this Agreement may be terminated by the Underwriter by notice given to the Company and the Selling Stockholders if at any time (i) trading or quotation in any of the Company's securities shall have been suspended or limited by the Commission or by the New York Stock Exchange, or trading in securities generally on either the Nasdaq Stock Market or the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or limited, or minimum or maximum prices shall have been generally established on any of such stock exchanges by the Commission or the NASD; (ii) a general banking moratorium shall have been declared by any of federal or New York authorities; (iii) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of national or international hostilities or any crisis or calamity, or any change in the United States or international financial markets, or any substantial change or development involving a prospective substantial change in United

, the Company, the HWP Stockholders and the Francis Stockholders are parties to the Agreement;
WHEREAS
 
, pursuant to Section 10(d) of the Agreement, the Company, the HWP Stockholders and the Francis Stockholders desire to amend certain provisions of the Agreement; and

WHEREAS
 
AGREEMENT:
 
, in consideration of the foregoing recitals and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:
NOW THEREFORE
 
1. Section 3(a) of the Agreement shall hereby be amended and restated in its entirety as follows:
 
"(a) . The HWP Stockholders as a group, acting through HWH Capital Partners or its written designee, BancAmerica or the Francis Stockholders as a group, acting though Francis, may make a written request to the Company to register (the party making such request, the "Initiating Holders"), and the Company shall register, under the Securities Act (other than pursuant to a Registration
Request for Demand Registration
Statement on Form S-4 or S-8 or any successor thereto) (a "Demand Registration"), the number of Registrable Securities stated in such request; provided, however, that the Company shall not be obligated to effect (x) more than five such Demand Registrations requested by the HWP Stockholders, more than one such Demand Registration requested by BancAmerica and more than two such Demand Registrations requested by the Francis Stockholders, (y) a Demand Registration if the Initiating Holders, together with the Designated Holders (other than the Initiating Holders) which have requested to register securities in such registration pursuant to Section 3(b), propose to sell their Registrable Securities at an aggregate price (calculated based upon the Market Price of the Registrable Securities on the date of filing of the Registration Statement with respect to such Registrable Securities) to the public of less than $5,000,000 and (z) any Demand Registration requested by the Francis Stockholders at any time prior to the earlier of (i) March 31, 2006 or (ii) the date on which the HWP Stockholders beneficially own an amount of Registrable Securities equal to or less than 4,931,303 shares of Common Stock (as such number may be adjusted to reflect stock splits, stock dividends, consolidations and/or similar transactions). For purposes of the preceding sentence, two or more Registration Statements filed in response to one demand shall be counted as one Demand Registration. If the Board of Directors, in its good faith judgment, determines that any registration of Registrable Securities should not be made or continued because it would materially interfere with any material financing, acquisition, corporate reorganization or merger or other material transaction involving the Company (a "Valid Business Reason"), the Company may (x) postpone filing a Registration Statement relating to a Demand Registration until such Valid Business Reason no longer exists, but in no event for more than (i) forty-five (45) days in the case of a Demand Registration requested by the HWP Stockholders or the Francis Stockholders and (ii) nine (9) months in the case of a Demand Registration requested by BancAmerica and (y) in case a Registration Statement has been filed relating to a Demand Registration, the Company, upon the approval of a majority of the Board of Directors, may cause such Registration Statement to be withdrawn and its effectiveness terminated or may postpone amending or supplementing such Registration Statement (in which case, if the Valid Business Reason no longer exists or if more forty-five (45) days (in the case of a Demand Registration requested by the HWP Stockholders or the Francis Stockholders) or nine (9) months (in the case of a Demand Registration requested by BancAmerica) have passed since such withdrawal or postponement, the Initiating Holders may request a new Demand Registration). The Company shall give written notice of its determination to postpone or withdraw a Registration Statement and of the fact that the Valid Business Reason for such postponement or withdrawal no longer exists, in each case, promptly after the occurrence thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Company may not postpone or withdraw a filing under this Section 3(a) more than once in any eighteen (18) month period. Each request for a Demand Registration by the Initiating Holders shall state the amount of the Registrable Securities proposed to be sold and the intended method of disposition thereof. Any Demand Registration requested by the Francis Stockholders may be only in the form of a firm commitment underwritten offering."
 
2. The following new sentence is hereby added to the end of 3(b) of the Agreement:
 
"For avoidance of doubt, even though any Designated Holder (other than Initiating Holders which have requested a registration under Section 3(a)) may have previously registered any or a portion of its Registrable Securities on a Registration Statement on Form S-3, such Designated Holder may request all or a portion of its Registrable Securities be included in a Demand Registration in accordance with this Section 3(b) whether through registering such Registrable Securities, preparing a joint prospectus issued under Rule 429 promulgated under the Securities Act or otherwise."
 
3. Section 5(a) of the Agreement shall hereby be amended and restated in its entirety as follows:
 
"(a) . The Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to file all required reports under the Exchange Act in order to qualify for the use of Form S-3 under the Securities Act; , that this covenant shall not require the Company to remain a reporting company under the Exchange Act if the Company shall have determined to enter into a merger, acquisition, going private transaction or similar transaction. Upon the Company becoming eligible for use of Form S-3 (or any successor form thereto) under the Securities Act in connection with a public offering of its securities, in the event that the Company shall receive from one or more of the HWP Stockholders, acting through HWH Capital Partners or its written designee, or one or more Francis Stockholders, acting through Francis (collectively, the "S-3 Initiating Holders"), a written request that the Company register, under the Securities Act on Form S-3 (or any successor form then in effect) (an "S-3 Registration"), all or a portion of the Registrable Securities owned by such S-3 Initiating Holders, the Company shall give written notice of such request to all of the Designated Holders (other than S-3 Initiating Holders which have requested an S-3 Registration under this Section 5(a)) at least ten (10) days before the anticipated filing date of such Form S-3, and such notice shall describe the proposed registration and offer such Designated Holders the opportunity to register the number of Registrable Securities as each such Designated Holder may request in writing to the Company, given within ten (10) days after their receipt from the Company of the written notice of such registration. With respect to each S-3 Registration, the Company shall, subject to Section 5(b), (i) include in such offering the Registrable Securities of the S-3 Initiating Holders and the Designated Holders (who have requested in writing to participate in such registration on the same terms and conditions as the Registrable Securities of the S-3 Initiating Holders included therein) and (ii) use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such registration pursuant to this Section 5(a) to become and remain effective as soon as practicable."
Request for a Form S-3 Registration
provided
 
4. Section 5(c) of the Agreement shall hereby be amended and restated in its entirety as follows:
 
"(c) . If the Board of Directors has a Valid Business Reason, the Company may (x) postpone filing a Registration Statement
Limitations on Form S-3 Registrations
 
relating to a S-3 Registration until such Valid Business Reason no longer exists, but in no event for more than forty-five (45) days following the request and (y) in case a Registration Statement has been filed relating to a S-3 Registration, the Company, upon the approval of a majority of the Board of Directors, may cause such Registration Statement to be withdrawn and its effectiveness terminated or may postpone amending or supplementing such Registration Statement (in which case, if the Valid Business Reason no longer exists or if more than forty-five (45) days have passed since such withdrawal or postponement, the S-3 Initiating Holder may request the prompt amendment or supplement of such Registration Statement or a new S-3 Registration). The Company shall give written notice of its determination to postpone or withdraw a Registration Statement and of the fact that the Valid Business Reason for such postponement or withdrawal no longer exists, in each case, promptly after the occurrence thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Company may not postpone or withdraw a filing, under either this Section or Section 3(a), due to a Valid Business Reason more than once in any twelve (12) month period. In addition, the Company shall not be required to effect any registration pursuant to Section 5(a), (i) within ninety (90) days after the effective date of any other Registration Statement of the Company (other than a Registration Statement on Form S-4 or S-8 or any successor thereto), (ii) if Form S-3 is not available for such offering by the S-3 Initiating Holders, (iii) if the S-3 Initiating Holders, together with the Designated Holders (other than S-3 Initiating Holders which have requested an S-3 Registration under Section 5(a)) registering Registrable Securities in such registration, propose to sell their Registrable Securities at an aggregate price (calculated based upon the Market Price of the Registrable Securities on the date of filing of the Form S-3 with respect to such Registrable Securities) to the public of less than $5,000,000 or (iv) if it is requested by the Francis Stockholders prior to the date on which the HWP Stockholders own an amount of Registrable Securities equal to or less than 2,000,000 shares of Common Stock (as such number may be adjusted to reflect stock splits, stock dividends, consolidations and/or similar transactions)."

Item 2.02(a) Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
 
On May 9, 2005, we reported our first quarter 2005 results. Our first quarter 2005 results are discussed in detail in the press release attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.
 
Item 9.01(c) Financial Statements and Exhibits.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
SAN DIEGO  (May 9, 2005)  AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. (NYSE: AHS) today reported revenue for the first quarter of 2005 of $156.8 million, compared to $161.3 million for the first quarter of 2004, and $158.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2004. The company generated net income of $4.0 million for the first quarter of 2005, resulting in diluted earnings per share of $0.13. This compares to net income of $4.6 million, or diluted earnings per share of $0.15 for the first quarter of 2004, and net income of $4.5 million, or diluted earnings per share of $0.14 for the fourth quarter of 2004. Revenue declined slightly in the first quarter of 2005 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2004 due mainly to two fewer billing days. The modest year-over-year decline in revenue was reflective of a slight decrease in revenue per traveler per day and one less billing day in the three months ended March 31, 2005.
 
"We are pleased to report strong first quarter results, which were at the higher end of our guidance range issued last quarter. Most importantly, the average number of travelers on assignment increased by 1% over the fourth quarter of 2004 to 6,350, representing the second consecutive quarter of sequential traveler count growth. Additionally, the first quarter traveler count was flat on a year-over-year basis, reversing a trend of seven consecutive quarters of year-over-year declines and reflecting the continued stabilization and modest growth dynamics of our market environment." said Susan R. Nowakowski, president and chief executive officer.
 
Gross profit margin for the first quarter of 2005 was 22.8%, which was higher than the 22.2% reported in the first quarter of 2004, and lower than the 23.3% reported in the fourth
 
quarter of 2004. Gross profit for the first quarter of 2005 was $35.7 million, slightly lower than the first quarter of 2004, and down 3% from $36.9 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2004. The decline in gross profit in the first quarter from the fourth quarter was due to the combined impact of slightly lower revenue due to the two fewer billing days in the quarter and an adjustment of $0.9 million to the workers' compensation reserve. Absent the adjustment to the workers' compensation reserve, the gross margin in the first quarter of 2005 would have been comparable to the 23.3% reported in the fourth quarter of 2004.
 
Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses for the first quarter of 2005 were $26.2 million, compared to $24.6 million in the first quarter of 2004, and $26.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2004. SG&A expenses in the first quarter of 2005 were relatively stable as compared to the fourth quarter of 2004 and unchanged as a percentage of revenue. The year-over-year increase in SG&A expense was due mainly to normal growth in employee expenses and professional liability insurance costs.
 
Income from operations was $8.4 million for the first quarter of 2005, compared to $9.5 million for the first quarter of 2004, and $8.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2004. Income from operations margin for the first quarter of 2005 was 5.3%, as compared to 5.9% reported in the first quarter of 2004, and 5.6% reported in the fourth quarter of 2004. The decrease in income from operations margin as compared to the prior quarter reflected the small declines in revenue and gross margin and flat SG&A spending levels. The year-over-year decrease in operating margin was mainly attributable to higher SG&A spending in the first quarter of 2005.
 
Net interest expense in the first quarter of 2005 was $1.8 million, compared to net interest expense of $2.1 million in the first quarter of 2004, and $1.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2004. The decrease in interest expense from the prior year was reflective of the company's aggressive debt reduction during the year using strong cash flow generated from operations.
 
AMN generated $16.9 million in cash flow from operations during the first quarter of 2005 and, as of March 31, 2005, cash and cash equivalents totaled $10.5 million. Total debt outstanding at March 31, 2005 was $92.5 million, which represented a reduction of $9.2 million, or 9% since December 31, 2004, and a reduction of $44.5 million, or 32% since March 31, 2004. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 31.5 million during the quarter.
 
Revenue and Earnings Guidance for Second Quarter 2005
 
Revenue in the second quarter of 2005 is expected to range from $159 million to $162 million, resulting in diluted earnings per share of approximately $0.13 to $0.15. The average number of travelers on assignment in the second quarter of 2005 is expected to range from 6,375 to 6,475. Management reaffirms full year 2005 guidance previously issued on March 8, 2005, with full year revenue ranging from $654 to $660 million and diluted earnings per share ranging from $0.64 to $0.68.
 
"The projected rise in second quarter revenue, which is being driven by a strong demand and a growing supply of travelers on assignment, is a positive sign for our business. Recruiting more quality nurses and allied healthcare professionals to help our clients with their critical staffing needs is a priority for us, but we will also continue to focus on controlling SG&A spending levels and paying down debt with our positive operating cash flow," said Ms. Nowakowski.

Any registration statement filed by the Company pursuant to Rule 462(b) under the Securities Act is called the "Rule 462(b) Registration Statement," and from and after the date and time of filing of the Rule 462(b) Registration Statement the term "Registration Statement" shall include the Rule 462(b) Registration Statement. Any preliminary prospectus included in the Registration Statement or filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(a) of the rules and regulations of the Commission under the Act is hereinafter called a "preliminary prospectus." The term "Prospectus" shall mean the final prospectus relating to the Common Shares that is first filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) after the date hereof or, if no filing pursuant to Rule 424(b) is required, shall mean the form of final prospectus relating to the Common Shares included in the Registration Statement at the date of effectiveness of the Registration Statement. Any reference herein to any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 under the Act, as of the date of such preliminary prospectus or Prospectus, as the case may be; any reference to any amendment or supplement to any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include any documents filed after the date of such preliminary prospectus or Prospectus, as the case may be, under the Exchange Act, and incorporated by reference in such preliminary prospectus or Prospectus, as the case may be; and any reference to any amendment to the Registration Statement shall be deemed to refer to and include any annual report of the Company filed pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act after the effective date of the Registration Statement that is incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement.

On the basis of the representations, warranties and agreements herein contained, and upon the terms but subject to the conditions herein set forth, the Underwriters agree, severally and not jointly, to purchase from the Selling Stockholders the respective number of Firm Common Shares set forth opposite their names on Schedule B. The purchase price per Firm Common Share to be paid by the several Underwriters to the Selling Stockholders shall be $13.1312 per share.
The Firm Common Shares

The First Closing Date
 
Company and the Representatives) at 9:00 a.m. New York City time, on May 27, 2005 or such other time and date as the Representatives and the Company may agree upon in writing (the time and date of such closing are called the "First Closing Date"). The Company and the Selling Stockholders hereby acknowledge that circumstances under which the Representatives may provide notice to postpone the First Closing Date as originally scheduled include, but are not limited to, any determination by the Company, the Selling Stockholders or the Representatives to recirculate to the public copies of an amended or supplemented Prospectus or a delay as contemplated by the provisions of Section 10.
 
(c) . In addition, on the basis of the representations, warranties and agreements herein contained, and upon the terms but subject to the conditions herein set forth, the Selling Stockholders, severally and not jointly, hereby grant an option to the several Underwriters to purchase, severally and not jointly, up to an aggregate of 1,381,303 Optional Common Shares from the Selling Stockholders at the purchase price per share to be paid by the Underwriters for the Firm Common Shares. The option granted hereunder may be exercised at any time (but not more than once) upon notice by the Representatives to the Company which notice may be given at any time within 30 days from the date of this Agreement. Such notice shall set forth (i) the aggregate number of Optional Common Shares as to which the Underwriters are exercising the option, (ii) the names and denominations in which the certificates for the Optional Common Shares are to be registered and (iii) the time, date and place at which such certificates will be delivered (which time and date may be simultaneous with, but not earlier than, the First Closing Date; and in such case the term "First Closing Date" shall refer to the time and date of delivery of certificates for the Firm Common Shares and the Optional Common Shares). Such time and date of delivery, if subsequent to the First Closing Date, is called the "Second Closing Date" and shall be determined by the Representatives and shall not be earlier than three nor later than five full business days after delivery of such notice of exercise. The Representatives may cancel the option at any time prior to its expiration by giving written notice of such cancellation to the Company. If any Optional Common Shares are to be purchased, each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to purchase the number of Optional Common Shares (subject to such adjustments to eliminate fractional shares as the Representatives may determine) that bears the same proportion to the total number of Optional Common Shares to be purchased as the number of Firm Common Shares set forth on Schedule B opposite the name of such Underwriter bears to the total number of Firm Common Shares.
The Optional Common Shares; the Second Closing Date
 
(d) . The Representatives hereby advise the Company and the Selling Stockholders that the Underwriters intend to offer for sale to the public, as described in the Prospectus, the Common Shares as soon after this Agreement has been executed and the Registration Statement has been declared effective as the Underwriters have determined is advisable and practicable.

Each Selling Stockholder shall, severally and not jointly, also deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Representatives for the accounts of the several Underwriters, certificates, accompanied by duly executed stock powers, representing the number of shares of Common Stock set forth under the column titled "Maximum Number of Optional Common Shares to be Sold" opposite such Selling Stockholder's name that the Underwriters have agreed to purchase at the First Closing Date or the Second Closing Date, as the case may be, against the irrevocable release of a wire transfer of immediately available funds for the amount of the purchase price therefor. The certificates for the Common Shares shall be in definitive form and registered in such names and denominations as the Representatives shall have requested at least two full business days prior to the First Closing Date (or the Second Closing Date, as the case may be) and shall be made available for inspection on the business day preceding the First Closing Date (or the Second Closing Date, as the case may be) at a location in New York City as the Representatives may designate.

(c) . If, during the Prospectus Delivery Period, any event shall occur or condition exist as a result of which it is necessary to amend or supplement the Prospectus in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances when the Prospectus is delivered to a purchaser, not misleading, or if in the reasonable opinion of the Representatives or counsel for the Underwriters it is otherwise necessary to amend or supplement the Prospectus to comply with law, the Company agrees to promptly prepare (subject to Section 3(A)(a) hereof), file with the Commission and furnish at its own expense to the Representatives and to dealers, amendments or supplements to the Prospectus so that the statements in the Prospectus as so amended or supplemented will not, in the light of the circumstances when the Prospectus is delivered to a purchaser, be misleading or so that the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, will comply in all material respects with law.

The Company shall not be required to qualify as a foreign corporation or to take any action that would subject it to general service of process in any such jurisdiction where it is not presently qualified or where it would be subject to taxation as a foreign corporation. The Company will advise the Representatives promptly upon receipt of any notice of the suspension of the qualification or registration of (or any such exemption relating to) the Common Shares for offering, sale or trading in any jurisdiction or any initiation or threat of any proceeding for any such purpose, and in the event of the issuance of any order suspending such qualification, registration or exemption, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the withdrawal thereof at the earliest possible moment.

With respect to any preliminary prospectus, the foregoing indemnity agreement shall not inure to the benefit of any Underwriter from whom the person asserting any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense purchased Common Shares, or any person controlling such Underwriter, if copies of the Prospectus were timely delivered to the Underwriter pursuant to Section 2 and a copy of the Prospectus (as then amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto) was not sent or given by or on behalf of such Underwriter to such person, if required by law so to have been delivered, at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of the Common Shares to such person, and if the Prospectus (as so amended or supplemented) would have cured the defect giving rise to such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense. The indemnity agreement set forth in this Section 8(a) shall be in addition to any liabilities that the Company may otherwise have.
 
(b) . Each of the Selling Stockholders, severally and not jointly, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its officers and employees, and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act against any loss, claim, damage, liability or

expense, as incurred, to which such Underwriter or such controlling person may become subject, under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or other federal or state statutory law or regulation, or at common law or otherwise (including in settlement of any litigation, if such settlement is effected with the written consent of the Selling Stockholders), insofar as such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense (or actions in respect thereof as contemplated below) arises out of or is based: (i) upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, or any amendment thereto, including any information deemed to be a part thereof pursuant to Rule 430A or Rule 434 under the Securities Act, or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or (ii) upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in each case, with respect to each Selling Stockholder, with respect to clauses (i) and (ii) above, to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished by such Selling Stockholder to the Company expressly for use therein under the caption "Selling Stockholders"; and to reimburse each Underwriter and each such controlling person for any and all expenses (including the fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by BAS) as such expenses are reasonably incurred by such Underwriter or such controlling person in connection with investigating, defending, settling, compromising or paying any such loss, claim, damage, liability, expense or action; provided, however, that with respect to any preliminary prospectus, the foregoing indemnity agreement shall not inure to the benefit of any Underwriter from whom the person asserting any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense purchased Common Shares, or any person controlling such Underwriter, if copies of the Prospectus were timely delivered to the Underwriter pursuant to Section 2 and a copy of the Prospectus (as then amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto) was not sent or given by or on behalf of such Underwriter to such person, if required by law so to have been delivered, at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of the Common Shares to such person, and if the Prospectus (as so amended or supplemented) would have cured the defect giving rise to such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense; and provided, further, that the liability of each Selling Stockholder pursuant to this Section 8 shall not exceed the net proceeds received by such Selling Stockholder from the sale of the Common Shares hereunder. The indemnity agreement set forth in this Section 8(b) shall be in addition to any liabilities that the Selling Stockholders may otherwise have.
 
(c) . Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signed the Registration Statement, the Selling Stockholders and each person, if any, who controls the Company or any Selling Stockholder within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense, as incurred, to which the Company, or any such director, officer, Selling Stockholder or controlling person may become subject, under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, or other federal or state statutory law or regulation, or at common law or otherwise (including in settlement of any litigation, if such settlement is effected
Indemnification of the Company, Its Directors and Officers and the Selling Stockholders
 
with the written consent of such Underwriter), insofar as such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense (or actions in respect thereof as contemplated below) arises out of or is based upon any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or arises out of or is based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Representatives expressly for use therein and to reimburse the Company, or any such director, officer, Selling Stockholder or controlling person for any legal and other expense reasonably incurred by the Company, or any such director, officer, Selling Stockholder or controlling person in connection with investigating, defending, settling, compromising or paying any such loss, claim, damage, liability, expense or action. Each of the Company and each of the Selling Stockholders hereby acknowledges that the only information that the Underwriters have furnished to the Company and the Selling Stockholders expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) are the statements set forth in the seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth and eleventh paragraphs under the caption "Underwriting" in the Prospectus, concerning penalty bids and stabilizing transactions; and the Underwriters confirm that such statements are correct. The indemnity agreement set forth in this Section 8(c) shall be in addition to any liabilities that the Underwriters may otherwise have.
 
(d) . Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof, but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party for contribution or otherwise than under the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 8 or to the extent it is not prejudiced as a proximate result of such failure. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party and such indemnified party seeks or intends to seek indemnity from an indemnifying party, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate in, and, to the extent that it shall elect, jointly with all other indemnifying parties similarly notified, by written notice delivered to the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party; provided, however, if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that a conflict may arise between the positions of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party in conducting the defense of any such action or that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to assume such legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties. Upon receipt of notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of such indemnifying party's election so to assume the defense of such action and approval by the indemnified party of counsel, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 8 for any legal or other expenses subsequently
Notifications and Other Indemnification Procedures
 
incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof unless (i) the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in accordance with the proviso to the next preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the reasonable expenses of more than one separate counsel (together with local counsel), approved by the indemnifying party ((BAS in the case of Section 8(c)), representing the indemnified parties who are parties to such action) or (ii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of commencement of the action, in each of which cases the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel shall be at the expense of the indemnifying party.
 
(e) . The indemnifying party under this Section 8 shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by Section 8(d) hereof, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement, except, with respect to clause (ii), to the extent the indemnifying party has provided written notice to the indemnified party that the indemnifying party disputes in good faith the unpaid balance of such fees and expenses for which reimbursement was requested. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement, compromise or consent to the entry of judgment in any pending or threatened action, suit or proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity was or could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such action, suit or proceeding.
Settlements
 
Section 9. . If the indemnification provided for in Section 8 is for any reason held to be unavailable to or otherwise insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount paid or payable by such indemnified party, as incurred, as a result of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Selling Stockholders, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, from the offering of the Common Shares pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company and the Selling Stockholders, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and the Selling Stockholders, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the
Contribution
 
Common Shares pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Common Shares pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the Selling Stockholders, and the total underwriting discount received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the front cover page of the Prospectus (or, if Rule 434 under the Securities Act is used, the corresponding location on the Term Sheet) bear to the aggregate public offering price of the Common Shares as set forth on such cover. The relative fault of the Company and the Selling Stockholders, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Selling Stockholders (in the case of a Selling Stockholder, if such information was furnished to the Company in writing by such Selling Stockholder expressly for use in the Preliminary Prospectus, Prospectus or Registration Statement under the caption "Principal and Selling Stockholders"), on the one hand, or the Underwriters, on the other hand, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
 
The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 8(d), any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim. The provisions set forth in Section 8(d) with respect to notice of commencement of any action shall apply if a claim for contribution is to be made under this Section 9; provided, however, that no additional notice shall be required with respect to any action for which notice has been given under Section 8(d) for purposes of indemnification.
 
The Company, the Selling Stockholders and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 9 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 9.
 
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 9, (i) no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the underwriting commissions received by such Underwriter in connection with the Common Shares underwritten by it and distributed to the public and (ii) no Selling Stockholder shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the net proceeds received by such Selling Stockholder from the sale of Common Shares hereunder. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 9 are several, and not joint, in proportion to their respective underwriting commitments as set forth opposite their names in Schedule B. The Selling Stockholders' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 9 are several, and not joint, in proportion to their respective aggregate sale proceeds of Common Shares (including Optional Common Shares). For purposes of this Section 9, each officer and employee of an Underwriter or a Selling Stockholder, as applicable, and each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter or a Selling Stockholder, as applicable, within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as
 
an Underwriter or such Selling Stockholder, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company.
 
Section 10. If, on the First Closing Date or the Second Closing Date, as the case may be, any one or more of the several Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Common Shares that it or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on such date, and the aggregate number of Common Shares which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase does not exceed 10% of the aggregate number of the Common Shares to be purchased on such date, the other Underwriters shall be obligated, severally, in the proportions that the number of Firm Common Shares set forth opposite their respective names on Schedule A bears to the aggregate number of Firm Common Shares set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as may be specified by the Representatives with the consent of the non-defaulting Underwriters, to purchase the Common Shares which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date. If, on the First Closing Date or the Second Closing Date, as the case may be, any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Common Shares and the aggregate number of Common Shares with respect to which such default occurs exceeds 10% of the aggregate number of Common Shares to be purchased on such date, and arrangements satisfactory to the Representatives and the Company for the purchase of such Common Shares are not made within 48 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability of any party (other than the liability of the defaulting underwriter) to any other party except that the provisions of Section 4, Section 6, Section 8 and Section 9 shall at all times be effective and shall survive such termination. In any such case either the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the First Closing Date or the Second Closing Date, as the case may be, but in no event for longer than seven days in order that the required changes, if any, to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus or any other documents or arrangements may be effected.
Default of One or More of the Several Underwriters.
 
As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" shall be deemed to include any person substituted for a defaulting Underwriter under this Section 10. Any action taken under this Section 10 shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.
 
Section 11. . Prior to the First Closing Date this Agreement may be terminated by the Representatives by notice given to the Company and the Selling Stockholders if at any time (i) trading or quotation in any of the Company's securities shall have been suspended or limited by the Commission or by the New York Stock Exchange, or trading in securities generally on either the Nasdaq Stock Market or the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or limited, or minimum or maximum prices shall have been generally established on any of such stock exchanges by the Commission or the NASD; (ii) a general banking moratorium shall have been declared by any of federal or New York authorities; (iii) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of national or international hostilities or any crisis or calamity, or any change in the United States or international financial markets, or any substantial change or development involving a prospective substantial change in United States' or international political, financial or economic conditions, as in the judgment of the
Termination of This Agreement
 
Representatives is material and adverse and makes it impracticable to market the Common Shares in the manner and on the terms described in the Prospectus or to enforce contracts for the sale of securities; (iv) in the judgment of the Representatives there shall have occurred any Material Adverse Change; or (v) the Company shall have sustained a loss by strike, fire, flood, earthquake, accident or other calamity of such character as in the judgment of the Representatives may interfere materially with the conduct of the business and operations of the Company regardless of whether or not such loss shall have been insured. Any termination pursuant to this Section 11 shall be without liability on the part of (a) the Company or the Selling Stockholders to any Underwriter, except that the Company shall be obligated to reimburse the expenses of the Representatives and the Underwriters pursuant to Sections 4 and 6 hereof, (b) any Underwriter to the Company and the Selling Stockholders, or (c) any party hereto to any other party except that the provisions of Section 8 and Section 9 shall at all times be effective and shall survive such termination.
 
Section 12. . The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company, of its officers, of the Selling Stockholders and of the several Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or the Company or any of its or their partners, officers or directors or any controlling person, or the Selling Stockholders, as the case may be, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Common Shares sold hereunder and any termination of this Agreement.
Representations and Indemnities to Survive Delivery

If one or more of the Selling Stockholders shall fail to sell and deliver to the Underwriters the Common Shares that they have agreed to sell hereunder on the First Closing Date, the other non-defaulting Selling Stockholders shall have the right, severally, in the proportions that the number of Firm Common Shares set forth opposite their respective names on Schedule A bears to the aggregate number of Firm Common Shares set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Selling Stockholders, or in such other proportions as may be agreed to by the Committee with the consent of all non-defaulting Selling Stockholders, to sell the number of Common Shares which such defaulting Selling Stockholder or Selling Stockholders agreed but failed or refused to sell and deliver on such date. If the non-defaulting Selling Stockholders do not so agree to sell in the aggregate the number of Common Shares that the defaulting Selling Stockholders failed or refused to sell and deliver, and arrangements satisfactory to the Representatives, the Company and the other Selling Stockholders for the sale of such Common
Failure of One or More of the Selling Stockholders to Sell and Deliver Common Shares
 
Shares are not made within 48 hours after such default, then the Underwriters may at their option, by written notice from the Representatives to the Company and the Selling Stockholders, either (i) terminate this Agreement without any liability on the part of any Underwriter or, except as provided in Sections 4, 6, 8 and 9 hereof, the Company or the Selling Stockholders, or (ii) purchase the Common Shares which the other Selling Stockholders have agreed to sell and deliver in accordance with the terms hereof. In any such case where one or more of the Selling Stockholders shall fail to sell and deliver to the Underwriters the Common Shares to be sold and delivered by such Selling Stockholders pursuant to this Agreement at the First Closing Date or the Second Closing Date, then the Underwriters shall have the right, by written notice from the Representatives to the Company and the Selling Stockholders, to postpone the First Closing Date or the Second Closing Date, as the case may be, but in no event for longer than seven days in order that the required changes, if any, to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus or any other documents or arrangements may be effected.

This Agreement may not be amended or modified unless in writing by all of the parties hereto, and no condition herein (express or implied) may be waived unless waived in writing by each party whom the condition is meant to benefit.

General Provisions
 
Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that it is a sophisticated business person who was adequately represented by counsel during negotiations regarding the provisions hereof, including, without limitation, the indemnification provisions of Section 8 and the contribution provisions of Section 9, and is fully informed regarding said provisions. Each of the parties hereto further acknowledges that the provisions of Sections 8 and 9 hereto fairly allocate the risks in light of the ability of the parties to investigate the Company, its affairs and its business in order to assure that adequate disclosure has been made in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus and the Prospectus (and any amendments and supplements thereto), as required by the Securities Act and the Exchange Act.
 
If the foregoing is in accordance with your understanding of our agreement, kindly sign and return to the Company the enclosed copies hereof, whereupon this instrument, along with all counterparts hereof, shall become a binding agreement in accordance with its terms.
 
The foregoing Underwriting Agreement is hereby confirmed and accepted by the Representatives in New York, New York as of the date first above written.
 
 
 
 
 
(i) The Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. The Company has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement and to own and hold its properties and conduct its business as described in the Prospectus.
 
(ii) The Shares have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company and have been validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.
 
(iii) The Common Stock of the Company conforms in all material respects to the description contained in the Prospectus under the caption "Description of Capital Stock."
 
(iv) The form of certificate used to evidence the Common Stock is in due and proper form in all material respects under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "GCL").
 
(v) Except as described in the Prospectus, there are no preemptive or other similar rights to subscribe for or to purchase shares of Common Stock in the Company's amended and restated certificate of incorporation or by-laws, each as in effect on the date of this letter, or in any agreement or other outstanding instrument known to us to which the Company is a party, or under the GCL.
 
(vi) This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company.
 
(vii) The statements in the Prospectus under the caption "Description of Capital Stock" and in Item 15 of the Registration Statement, to the extent that they constitute summaries of United States federal law or regulations, the GCL, the Company's charter or by-law provisions or portions thereof, fairly summarize, in all material respects, the matters described under that heading.
 
(viii) To our knowledge, there are no legal or governmental actions, suits or proceedings pending or threatened which are required to be disclosed in the Registration Statement, other than those disclosed therein.
 
(ix) Except as disclosed in the Prospectus, to our knowledge, there are no persons with registration rights to have any equity or debt securities registered for sale under the Registration Statement or included in the offering contemplated by this Agreement, except for such rights as have been duly waived.
 
(x) Each of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, as of their respective effective or issue dates, appears on its face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission under the Act (the "Rules and Regulations"), except for the financial statements, financial statement schedules, other financial data and statistical data derived from financial statements included therein or incorporated by reference in or omitted from either of them, as to which we express no opinion. For purposes of the opinion in this paragraph (x), we have assumed that the statements made in the Registration Statement and Prospectus are complete and correct.
 
(xi) We do not know of any contract or other document which is required to be filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement by the Act or the Rules and Regulations which has not been so filed or incorporated by reference as an exhibit to the Registration Statement as permitted by the Rules and Regulations.

SAN DIEGO  (August 3, 2005)  AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. (NYSE: AHS) today reported revenue for the second quarter of 2005 of $160.7 million, a 5% increase compared to $153.4 million for the second quarter of 2004, and a 2% increase compared to the $156.8 million for the first quarter of 2005. The company generated net income of $4.4 million for the second quarter of 2005, resulting in diluted earnings per share of $0.14. This compares to net income of $4.3 million, or diluted earnings per share of $0.14 for the second quarter of 2004, and net income of $4.0 million, or diluted earnings per share of $0.13 for the first quarter of 2005. The second quarter's revenue and diluted earnings per share results are both within management's second quarter guidance issued on May 9, 2005, of revenue between $159 million to $162 million, and diluted earnings per share between $0.13 to $0.15.
 
For the six months ended June 30, 2005, the company reported revenue of $317.5 million, a 1% increase compared to $314.6 million reported for the same period a year ago. For the six months ended June 30, 2005, the company reported diluted earnings per share of $0.27, compared to $0.28 per diluted share reported for the same period a year ago.
 
"We are pleased to report that for the first time in eight quarters our average traveler count for the second quarter increased notably on a year-over-year basis, from 6,130 to 6,388, an increase of 4%. Furthermore, average travelers on assignment in the second quarter 2005 grew 1% over the first quarter, generating solid second quarter revenue and margin that exceeded both our prior year and prior quarter results," said Susan R. Nowakowski, president and chief executive officer.
 
Gross profit margin for the second quarter of 2005 was 23.1%, which was higher than the 22.8% reported in both the second quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005. Gross profit for the second quarter of 2005 was $37.2 million, which was higher than the $35.0 million reported in the second quarter of 2004, and the $35.7 million reported in the first quarter of 2005.
 
Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses for the second quarter of 2005 were $26.7 million, compared to $24.0 million in the second quarter of 2004, and $26.2 million in the first quarter of 2005. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue were 16.6% in the second quarter of 2005, compared to 15.7% in the second quarter of 2004, and 16.7% in the first quarter of 2005. The year-over-year increase in SG&A expense was due primarily to growth in employee expenses, reflecting normal cost increases and selective additions to headcount over the last year.
 
Income from operations was $9.0 million for the second quarter of 2005, compared to $9.2 million for the second quarter of 2004, and $8.4 million for the first quarter of 2005. Income from operations margin for the second quarter of 2005 was 5.6%, compared to the 6.0% reported in the second quarter of 2004, and the 5.3% reported in the first quarter of 2005.
 
Net interest expense in the second quarter of 2005 was $1.7 million, compared to net interest expense of $2.1 million in the second quarter of 2004, and $1.8 million in the first quarter of 2005. The decrease in interest expense from the prior year was reflective of the company's continued aggressive debt reduction using strong cash flow generated from operations.
 
AMN Healthcare generated $9.2 million in cash flow from operations during the second quarter of 2005 and, as of June 30, 2005, cash and cash equivalents totaled $14.8 million. Total debt outstanding at June 30, 2005 was $88.9 million, which represented a reduction of $12.8 million, or 13% since December 31, 2004, and a reduction of $39.6 million, or 31% since June 30, 2004. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 31.6 million for the quarter.
 
Nowakowski added, "In addition to our solid financial results during the second quarter, we also made significant progress on several of our initiatives for the year. Most notable was the launch of our newest brand, NURSECHOICE
InDemand
sm
, which is targeted to help hospitals with their most urgent short-term staffing needs. This investment helps AMN Healthcare to build a stronger foundation for 2006 and beyond."
 
Revenue and Earnings Guidance for Third Quarter and Full Year 2005
 
Revenue in the third quarter of 2005 is expected to range from $165 million to $168 million, reflecting an increase in the average number of travelers on assignment which is expected to range from 6,400 to 6,500. Diluted earnings per share in the third quarter of 2005 is expected to range from $0.17 to $0.19. Based on year-to-date results and increased visibility, management expects 2005 full year results to be within the range of the original 2005 guidance provided on March 8, 2005. And with only two quarters remaining in the year, management has further refined full year guidance with revenue expected to range from $654 to $658 million, and diluted earnings per share expected to range from $0.64 to $0.66, which is within the previously issued guidance range.
 
"Our performance year-to-date and our estimates for the remainder of the year reflect continued modest growth in the temporary healthcare staffing market," said Nowakowski. "We believe that the sustained strength in demand from our hospital clients is a sign of stability and continued growth opportunities in our industry. Achieving our expectation of sequential growth in the number of average travelers on assignment in the third quarter of 2005 would mark the fourth consecutive quarter of volume and revenue growth for AMN."

SAN DIEGOOctober 5, 2005AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. (NYSE:AHS), a leading healthcare staffing company and the largest nationwide provider of travel nurse staffing services, entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all of the stock of The MHA Group, Inc., a leader in providing temporary and permanent physician and allied healthcare staffing services. The combined company will become the nation's largest healthcare staffing provider with pro forma revenue of approximately $889 million for the twelve months ended June 30, 2005.
 
Under the terms of the agreement, the purchase price is $160 million plus an earn-out provision expected to result in approximately $38 million of additional consideration based on 2005 performance, with a guaranteed minimum earn-out of $35 million. The total consideration will be paid approximately 75% in cash and 25% in AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. stock. Upon completion of the transaction and payment of the earn-out in March, 2006, current stockholders of AMN Healthcare will own approximately 91% of the combined company and MHA's current stockholders will own the remainder. The transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to fourth quarter 2005 and full year 2006 earnings. Management will provide updated earnings guidance following the close of the transaction, which is expected to occur in the fourth quarter of this year.
 
Commenting on today's announcement, Susan R. Nowakowski, President and CEO of AMN Healthcare, said: "This combination of leaders in quality and service for both travel nurse staffing and locum tenens and permanent physician staffing will deliver great value for our clients. Our complementary businesses will enable hospitals to further streamline their recruitment and staffing efforts through a stronger partnership with our company. We believe that the combined value, breadth and depth of services that we can offer to our clients is unparalleled within the industry today."
 
"This is a perfect combination for MHA's clients and employees," said Joseph Hawkins, CEO of MHA. "Bringing together MHA's physician and allied staffing businesses with AMN Healthcare's industry-leading position and expertise in travel nurse staffing substantially improves our ability to deliver a total solution to our diverse client base. We believe that this business combination will allow us to be even more effective in delivering high quality, innovative healthcare staffing solutions to our clients."
 
Ms. Nowakowski added: "This transaction significantly supports our long term strategy of growth and leadership in the placement of high-quality clinical staff at all levels within healthcare organizations. We believe that both companies share similar cultures and management philosophies. This, combined with the fact that the founders and tenured MHA management
team will remain with MHA following the completion of the transaction, gives us confidence that the organizations will transition together smoothly and create opportunities for sales and operational efficiencies."
 
AMN Healthcare intends to finance the cash portion of the transaction with cash on hand and $280 million in senior secured credit facilities consisting of a five-year $75 million revolving credit instrument and a six-year $205 million term loan B instrument. These funds will be used to finance the acquisition of MHA, refinance AMN Healthcare's existing debt, and provide for working capital and general corporate purposes. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals.

Regulation FD Disclosure
 
Hurricane Wilma has caused much of Southern Florida to be without power and water utilities, resulting in significant interruptions to businesses in the area. One of the nurse recruitment brands of AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. (the "company"), Preferred Healthcare Staffing ("PHS"), is headquartered in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, one of the areas affected. The company also has some of its O'Grady Peyton International ("OGP") brand operations in its Ft. Lauderdale office.
 
All of our corporate employees and healthcare professionals working in Florida are safe. Our disaster recovery plan has been implemented, and our other offices in areas of the country have assumed the operations of our Florida office. Some PHS and OGP employees are temporarily relocating to some of our other offices in order to maintain their productivity. It is too early to assess whether the effects of Hurricane Wilma will have any impact on the company's results for the fourth quarter of 2005 or beyond. However, at this stage, it appears unlikely that any impact would be material to our overall results.

The Board of Directors
The MHA Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries:
 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The MHA Group, Inc. and subsidiaries as of September 30, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2005. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
 
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of The MHA Group, Inc. and subsidiaries as of September 30, 2005 and 2004, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2005, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

The MHA Group, Inc. was incorporated in Texas on July 17, 1997. The MHA Group, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries recruit and place physicians, nurses, and allied professionals on a permanent or temporary basis at hospitals and other healthcare facilities throughout the United States. The MHA Group, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries are herein referred to as "the Company."
 
 
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of The MHA Group, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
 
 
For purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid money market securities with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company maintains cash balances at certain financial institutions which at times may exceed insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is not exposed to significant credit risk on cash and cash equivalents.
 
 
Short-term investments consist of auction rate securities which are classified as marketable available for sale securities. Therefore, such securities are carried at fair value. Auction rate securities are variable-rate debt instruments with longer stated maturities whose interest rates are reset at predetermined short-term intervals through an auction system. As of September 30, 2005 and 2004, the cost of these securities approximated their fair value.
 
 
The Company extends credit to hospitals and healthcare facilities that use its services, on an unsecured basis, on terms that it establishes for individual clients, throughout the United States. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated credit losses resulting from collection risks, including the inability of customers to make required payments. The allowance for doubtful accounts is reported as a reduction of accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheets. The adequacy of this allowance is determined by evaluating historical payment trends and delinquency trends. The Company provided additions to the allowance of $1.7 million, $1.5 million, and $1.2 million during the years ended September 30, 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. The Company recorded write-offs of $1.8 million, $1.3 million, and $1.0 million during the years ended September 30, 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.
 
 
Furniture, equipment, leasehold improvements, and software are recorded at cost, less accumulated amortization and depreciation. Major additions and improvements are capitalized and maintenance and repairs are expensed when incurred. Depreciation on furniture, equipment, and software is calculated using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the related assets
 
 
 
 
(generally three to five years). Leasehold improvements and equipment obtained under capital leases are amortized over the shorter of the term of the lease or their estimated useful life.
 
Costs incurred to develop internal-use software during the application development stage are capitalized and recorded at cost, subject to an impairment test as described below. Application development stage costs generally include costs associated with internal-use software configuration, coding, installation, and testing. Costs of significant upgrades and enhancements that result in additional functionality also are capitalized whereas costs incurred for maintenance and minor upgrades and enhancements are expensed as incurred. Capitalized costs are amortized using the straight-line method over four years once placed into service. The Company assesses potential impairment of capitalized internal-use software whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future undiscounted net cash flows that are expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value, less costs to sell.
 
 
The Company provides malpractice insurance for contracting healthcare professionals. In January 2004, the Company became partially self-insured. The malpractice insurance policy provides coverage up to $1,000,000 per occurrence, $3,000,000 per healthcare professional per year, and $8,000,000 annual limit. Accordingly, the Company maintains an accrual for professional liability self-insured retention limits, which is included in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The Company determines the adequacy of this accrual by evaluating its historical experience and trends, loss reserves established by the Company's insurance carriers and third-party administrators, as well as through the use of independent actuarial studies. The Company obtains updated actuarial studies on at least an annual basis that use actual claims data to determine the appropriate reserves for incurred, but not reported, professional liability claims for each year. As of September 30, 2005 and 2004, the Company had $7.9 million and $2.8 million, respectively, accrued for professional liability retention.
 
 
Revenue consists of fees earned from the permanent and temporary placement of healthcare professionals. Revenue is recognized when earned and realizable and therefore when the following criteria have been met: (a) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (b) services have been rendered; (c) the fee is fixed or determinable; and (d) collectibility is reasonably assured. For temporary placements, revenue is recognized in the period in which services are provided based on hours worked by the temporary healthcare professionals. For permanent placements, revenue is recognized over the estimated maximum period of performance on a straight-line basis. Any fees that are billable on a contingent basis are recognized once the contingency is resolved over the remaining estimated maximum period of performance. Billings in excess of revenue are recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
 
No single facility customer exceeded 10% of revenue for the years ended September 30, 2005, 2004, and 2003.
 
 
 
 
 
The Company expenses advertising costs as they are incurred. Advertising costs amounted to $342,000, $404,000 and $517,000 in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.
 
 
The Company records income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in operations in the period the changes are enacted. If it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recognized.
 
 
Long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future undiscounted cash flows that are expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value, less costs to sell.
 
 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
 
 
 
 
 
The consolidated balance sheet details are as follows as of September 30 (in thousands):
 
 
 
Merritt, Hawkins and Associates, Inc. (MHA), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, has a revolving and term loan credit agreement (the Credit Agreement). Under the Credit Agreement, MHA may borrow up to $1 million on a revolving line of credit and up to an additional $2.25 million on term notes. The Credit Agreement is collateralized by accounts receivable, fixed assets and general intangibles of the Company and is guaranteed by certain wholly owned subsidiaries and assignment of life insurance policies. Interest on the revolving line of credit and term loans is due quarterly at prime minus 1%. There were no amounts outstanding under the credit agreement at September 30, 2005 and 2004. The line of credit matures on March 31, 2006. See Note 9.
 
Staff Care, Inc. (SCI), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, has a revolving line of credit agreement (SCI Agreement), for which MHA is the guarantor. The SCI Agreement allows SCI to borrow up to $3 million on the revolving line of credit with interest due quarterly at prime minus 1% and has a maturity date of March 31, 2006. The loan is secured by accounts receivable, fixed assets and general intangibles of SCI and MHA, and assignment of life insurance policies. There were no amounts outstanding under the SCI Agreement at September 30, 2005 and 2004. See Note 9.
 
 
 
 
 
The provision for income taxes for the years ended September 30, 2005, 2004, and 2003 consists of the following (in thousands):
 
 
The Company's income tax expense differs from the amount that would have resulted from applying the federal statutory rate of 35% in 2005 and 34% in 2004 and 2003 to pretax income because of the effect of the following items during the years ended September 30, 2005, 2004, and 2003 (in thousands):
 
 
 
 
 
The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are presented below as of September 30, 2005 and 2004 (in thousands):
 
 
Management believes it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets, excluding state net operating loss carryfowards, and accordingly, has not provided a valuation allowance for these assets. As of September 30, 2005, the Company had state net operating loss carryforwards of $347,000 that are set to expire at various dates between 2009 and 2017. Management believes it is not more likely than not that the Company will generate sufficient taxable income to utilize these state losses prior to the expiration of these carryforwards, and therefore the Company has established a valuation allowance reducing the maximum possible benefit of these carryforwards.
 
 
The Company implemented a restricted stock plan called The MHA Group Restricted Stock Plan (the Restricted Plan) to provide incentives to certain employees. The restricted stock cannot be sold, pledged, transferred or exchanged, and must be returned to the Company on the date the employee ceases employment with the Company. The restrictions on the stock expire only upon (i) a change in control of the Company or (ii) the closing of an initial public offering (IPO) by the Company of its capital stock. A total of 1,052,000 shares of Class B nonvoting common stock have been reserved for the Restricted Plan as of September 30, 2005 and 2004. A total of 1,038,000 and 1,051,000 shares of Class B nonvoting common stock are issued and outstanding under the Restricted Plan as of September 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
 
 
 
 
The Company has elected to account for the Restricted Plan under Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, and related interpretations. As the shares must be returned to the Company upon termination of employment and the restrictions only lapse upon a change in control of the Company or a closing of an IPO, no compensation cost has been recognized for the shares issued. In addition, the shares were determined to have an immaterial fair value during 2005, 2004 and 2003 under SFAS No. 123, due to the restrictions of the stock.
, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
 
 
The Company implemented the MHA 401(k) Retirement Plan (the Plan) for eligible employees effective January 1, 1991. Company contributions to the Plan vest based upon the number of years of service and are made at the discretion of the Board of Directors. There were no employer contributions to the Plan for the years ended September 30, 2005, 2004, or 2003.
 
 
Leases
 
The Company conducts operations from leased premises and also leases automobiles under operating leases expiring through 2012. Certain of these leases provide for payment of taxes, insurance, and maintenance, and contain escalating rent payments. As the Company records rent on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, a deferred rent liability of $447,000 and $388,000 has been recognized as of September 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively, which is recorded in other current liabilities and other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
 
Rental expense was approximately $2.4 million, $2.3 million and $2.4 million for the years ended September 30, 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.
 
Aggregate minimum rental commitments under all operating noncancelable leases (with initial or remaining lease terms in excess of one year) are as follows for the years ending September 30 (in thousands):
 
 
During the years ended September 30, 2005, 2004, and 2003, there were no capital leases.
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Company is involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.
 
 
In 2005, the Company received an assessment from the California Employment Development Department in the amount of $2.9 million for payroll and other state taxes related to physicians and other professionals placed on contract in California from April 2001 through March 2004. The Company believes an adverse outcome is not probable relating to the physician component of this assessment and, accordingly, has not accrued for this contingency in the consolidated financial statements. The Company has determined it is probable that it will be required to pay the amount due relating to the non-physician component of this assessment. Accordingly, the Company has accrued $100,000 as of September 30, 2005 relating to this contingency.
 
 
On October 5, 2005, the Company and its principal shareholders, James C. Merritt and Joseph E. Hawkins, entered into an Acquisition Agreement with AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. (AMN), a Delaware corporation, to sell all shares of the Company to AMN. The acquisition closed on November 2, 2005. The purchase price consisted of $160.0 million plus an earn-out payment of up to $51.9 million based on the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 performance of MHA, of which $35.0 million is guaranteed. The initial $160.0 million of consideration was, and the earn-out payment will be, paid approximately 75% in cash and 25% in unregistered shares of AMN's common stock.
 
On October 21, 2005, MHA's Credit Agreement was amended to increase the maximum borrowing capacity under the revolving line of credit to $2.0 million and to change the maturity date to the earlier of November 30, 2005 or the closing date of the acquisition of the Company by AMN. Additionally, the amended agreement released the collateral assignments in the life insurance policies, and waived the event of default caused by the acquisition of the Company by AMN. On October 28, 2005, the Company borrowed $2.0 million under the amended Credit Agreement. In connection with the closing of the acquisition of the Company on November 2, 2005, all amounts were paid in full and the Credit Agreement expired.
 
On October 21, 2005, the SCI Agreement was amended to increase the maximum borrowing capacity to $8.0 million and to change the maturity date to the earlier of November 30, 2005 or the closing date of the acquisition of the Company by AMN. Additionally, the amended agreement released the collateral assignments in the life insurance policies and waived the event of default caused by the acquisition of the Company by AMN. On October 28, 2005, the Company borrowed $3.5 million under the amended SCI Agreement. In connection with the closing of the acquisition of the Company on November 2, 2005, all amounts were paid in full and the SCI Agreement expired.
 
On November 1, 2005, the Company paid a $31.0 million cash dividend to its principal shareholders.
 

EXHIBIT 99.2
 
 
AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. ("AMN", "our" or "we") acquired The MHA Group, Inc. and subsidiaries ("MHA") on November 2, 2005. The acquisition of MHA has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and, accordingly, the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities assumed were recorded at their estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition. Our preliminary allocation of the purchase price is pending completion of several elements, including the finalization of our independent appraisal for purposes of the valuation of acquired intangible assets. Accordingly, there may be material adjustments to the allocation of the purchase price.
 
Our estimate of the total purchase price of MHA, excluding assumed liabilities and any earn-out payment which is not guaranteed, is summarized as follows (in thousands):
 
 
The acquisition agreement also provides for an earn-out payment of up to $51.9 million based on the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 performance of MHA, of which $35.0 million is guaranteed. The initial $160.0 million of consideration was, and the earn-out payment will be, paid approximately 75% in cash and 25% in unregistered shares of the Company's common stock, par value $0.01 per share. At the closing of the acquisition of MHA, we issued 2.3 million shares of our common stock and intend to issue up to an additional 0.8 million shares for payment of the earn-out. The acquisition agreement also includes a $15.0 million holdback of the cash portion of the purchase price for potential claims indemnified by the selling shareholders. The holdback, net of any indemnified claims made, will be released to the selling shareholders in March 2007.
 
Intangible assets include amounts recognized for the fair value of tradenames and trademarks, customer relationships, non-compete agreements, and staffing databases. Based on a preliminary valuation, the tradenames and trademarks have an indefinite life, excluding a $1.0 million tradename with a 10 year life, and the remaining intangible assets have a weighted average useful life of approximately 13 years. Because this valuation is preliminary, the valuation of intangible assets and their useful lives may change upon completion of the final valuation. The excess of the purchase price over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets was recorded as goodwill and amounted to approximately $99.6 million. In accordance with current accounting standards, the goodwill will not be amortized and will be tested for impairment as required by SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.
 
Our fiscal year ends on December 31 of each year. MHA's fiscal year ended on September 30 of each year. The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated statements of operations have been prepared to assist you in your analysis of the financial effects of the acquisition of MHA, and have been presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2004 combines the historical results for AMN for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 and the historical results for MHA for the twelve months ended September 30, 2004, as if the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2004. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated statement of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2005, combines the historical results for both AMN and MHA for the nine months ended September 30, 2005, as if the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2004. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2005 gives effect to the acquisition of MHA as of such date.
 
This pro forma financial information does not purport to represent what our actual results of operations or financial position would have been had the acquisition occurred on the dates indicated nor is the information necessarily indicative of future operating results. The pro forma adjustments are based upon information and assumptions available at the time of the filing of this Form 8-K. You should read our pro forma condensed combined consolidated financial information in conjunction with (i) our consolidated financial statements and the related notes, our "Selected Consolidated Financial and Operating Data," and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," which all appear in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004, and (ii) our consolidated unaudited financial statements and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," which appear in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2005.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2005 gives effect to the acquisition of MHA as of such date.
 
 
(a) To reflect the following cash transactions:
 
 
AMN's new debt of $205,000,000 was issued on November 2, 2005, bearing interest at floating rates based upon either LIBOR or a prime interest rate option selected by AMN, plus a spread of 1.75% to 2.00% and 0.75% to 1.00%, respectively, to be determined based on AMN's current leverage ratio. A 1/8% change in the floating rate would result in a $256,000 change in interest expense annually, excluding the effect of interest rate swap arrangements.
 
(b) To reflect (i) deferred tax assets of $21,737,000, primarily related to the tax benefit for a compensation charge incurred on restricted stock which vested on the acquisition date, (ii) the reclassification of $754,000 and $40,000 of transaction costs and financing costs, respectively, from other assets to goodwill and intangible assets, respectively, upon consummation of the acquisition of MHA and the related issuance of new AMN debt and (iii) a reduction of income tax liabilities of $129,000 assumed by the MHA stockholders.
 
(c) To reflect the preliminary allocation of purchase price to the fair value assigned to acquired developed software.
 
(d) To record the estimated goodwill resulting from the allocation of the purchase price to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
 
(e) To reflect the preliminary allocation of $116,800,000 of purchase price to identifiable intangible assets and to reflect $4,822,000 of financing costs incurred to finance the acquisition. Identifiable intangible assets include customer relationships, tradenames and trademarks, non-compete agreements and staffing databases. Tradenames and trademarks have an indefinite life, excluding a $1,000,000 tradename with a 10 year life, and the remaining intangible assets have a weighted average useful life of 13 years.
 
(f) To reflect the accrual of the $35,000,000 guaranteed earn-out and $854,000 for employer payroll taxes related to a compensation charge incurred for the vesting of MHA restricted stock, offset by a $619,000 reduction for the repayment of accrued interest on AMN's then existing debt and a $561,000 reduction of tax liabilities assumed by the MHA stockholders.
 
(g) To reflect the accrual of the $15,000,000 cash holdback, net of $400,000 paid on the acquisition date.
 
 
 
(h) To reflect a deferred tax liability of $43,410,000 related to acquired intangible assets.
 
(i) To reflect AMN's incremental debt of $117,170,000, of which $3,332,000 is the current portion, and $376,000 of tax liabilities resulting from the acquisition.
 
(j) To reflect the elimination of the shareholders' equity accounts of MHA and to reflect the issuance of AMN common stock as partial consideration for the purchase of MHA, consisting of $23,000 of par value and $35,474,000 of additional paid-in-capital.
 
(k) To reflect a $2,923,000 and $2,738,000 reduction in compensation expense related to non-recurring executive salary expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 and the nine months ended September 30, 2005, respectively, and a pro forma adjustment of $122,000 and $1,562,000 for non-recurring professional service fees for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 and the nine months ended September 30, 2005, respectively. The professional service fees consist of transaction costs related to the acquisition and legal costs related to specific tax matters incurred by MHA during the periods presented. Pursuant to the acquisition agreement, costs incurred related to these matters subsequent to the date of acquisition will be borne by the MHA stockholders and will not impact the results of operations of the combined entity. As these costs are factually supported, directly attributable to the acquisition and not expected to have a continuing impact to the combined entity, the historical MHA costs have been excluded from the pro forma income statements.
 
(l) To reflect amortization expense related to the fair value of identifiable amortizable intangible assets.
 
(m) To reflect interest expense of $7,393,000 and $5,103,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 and nine months ended September 30, 2005, respectively, and additional deferred financing cost amortization, recorded in interest expense, of $658,000 and $376,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 and nine months ended September 30, 2005, respectively, related to additional AMN borrowings and financing costs incurred to finance the acquisition.
 
(n) To reflect the income tax effect of the pro forma adjustments.

Exhibit 99.1
 
SAN DIEGO  (March 8, 2006)  AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. (NYSE: AHS), the nation's largest healthcare staffing company, today reported results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2005. Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2005 was $221.4 million, a 40% increase compared to the $158.3 million reported for the fourth quarter of 2004, and a 33% increase compared to the $166.9 million reported for the third quarter of 2005. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2005 was $7.0 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, which included non-operating after-tax charges incurred in connection with the Company's acquisition of The MHA Group, Inc. ("MHA") of $0.02 for the write-off of deferred financing costs associated with the acquisition financing and $0.01 for imputed interest expense also related to the acquisition. Excluding these adjustments, fourth quarter 2005 adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.24. A reconciliation of diluted earnings per share to adjusted diluted earnings per share is attached at the end of this press release.
The increase in revenue and earnings in the fourth quarter of 2005 as compared to the same quarter in the prior year and the preceding quarter reflected improvement in the nurse and allied staffing businesses as well as contributions from MHA since the acquisition on November 2, 2005. Revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 was $705.8 million, as compared to $629.0 million for 2004. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $22.2 million, or $0.69 per diluted share, up 28% from $17.3 million or $0.55 per diluted share for 2004. Excluding the $0.02 charge for the write-off of deferred financing costs and the $0.01 charge for imputed interest expense, full year adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.72.
 
"2005 represented a critical and positive turning point for AMN Healthcare," said Susan R. Nowakowski, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Our nurse and allied staffing businesses experienced modest annual revenue growth after two years of contraction and stabilization. Through diligent management of expenses and gross margin expansion, our team was able to convert this modest revenue growth into even greater diluted earnings per share growth.
"During the year, AMN continued to invest in the future and launched its newest brand, NurseChoice InDemand, in order to provide a premium quick response solution for hospitals with urgent nurse staffing needs. The company also took a significant step in fulfilling its long-term strategy by negotiating and completing the acquisition of The MHA Group, one of the nation's leading physician staffing companies," added Nowakowski.
Gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2005 was $57.8 million, representing a 26.1% gross margin, up from the $36.9 million, or 23.3% gross margin, reported in the fourth quarter of 2004, and the $39.5 million, or 23.7% gross margin, reported in the third quarter of 2005. The increases were due largely to the addition of the higher margin physician staffing business as a result of the MHA acquisition and also to a widening of bill to pay spread in the company's nurse staffing business.
Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses for the fourth quarter of 2005 were $39.1 million, compared to $26.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2004, and $25.2 million in the third quarter of 2005, with the increases due mainly to the inclusion of SG&A expenses from MHA. Fourth quarter 2005 SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue was 17.7%, as compared to 16.7% in the fourth quarter of 2004, and 15.1% in the third quarter of 2005.
Income from operations was $16.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2005, compared to $8.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2004 and $12.9 million for the third quarter of 2005. Income from operations margin for the fourth quarter of 2005 was 7.5%, as compared to 5.6% for the fourth quarter of 2004 and 7.7% for the third quarter of 2005.
 
Fourth quarter net interest expense was $4.6 million, as compared to $1.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2004 and $1.5 million in the third quarter of 2005. The increase was primarily due to interest expense related to the company's new $205.0 million term loan used to fund the acquisition of MHA and to repay prior debt, as well as a $1.2 million write-off of deferred financing costs. The company expects to continue paying down debt using the combined excess operating cash flow.
The company generated $15.9 million in cash flow from operations during the fourth quarter of 2005 and, as of December 31, 2005, had $19.1 million in cash and cash equivalents. For the full year 2005, the company generated $44.1 million in cash flow from operations, as compared to $39.0 million in 2004. Total debt outstanding at December 31, 2005 was $205 million. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding during the fourth quarter of 2005 were 33.7 million.
The company also announced that the acquisition earnout provision for MHA was recently finalized at $47.3 million, resulting in a final acquisition purchase price for MHA of $210.0 million, which includes $2.7 million in transaction costs. The earnout is expected to be paid on March 10, 2006 in approximately 75% cash and 25% stock. The cash portion of the earnout will be funded with cash on hand and drawings on the company's revolving credit facility.
Revenue and Earnings Guidance for First Quarter and Full Year 2006
During 2006, the company expects revenue and earnings growth in all of its business lines. Revenue for the first quarter of 2006 is expected to range from $248 million to $252 million and diluted earnings per share is expected to range from $0.17 to $0.19, which includes estimated charges of $0.02 for stock compensation expense related to the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 123R ("FAS 123R") on January 1, 2006 and $0.01 for imputed interest expense related to the MHA acquisition. Excluding these adjustments, first quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to range from $0.20 to $0.22, and reflects the impact of two fewer billing days in the quarter as compared to the fourth quarter of 2005. For the full year 2006, management expects AMN Healthcare to become the first healthcare staffing company in the U.S. to generate revenue in excess of one billion dollars, with full year revenue
 
expected to range from $1.025 billion to $1.050 billion. Full year 2006 diluted earnings per share, including estimated stock compensation expense of $0.10 for the adoption of FAS 123R and $0.02 for imputed interest expense, is expected to range from $0.76 to $0.80. Excluding these adjustments, full year 2006 adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to range from $0.88 to $0.92.
"Looking to 2006, we believe that the healthcare staffing industry is healthy and continuing to grow at a moderate pace. Our 2006 guidance reflects opportunity for continued volume growth and price expansion in our nurse and allied staffing businesses as well as strong growth in our physician staffing business," said Nowakowski. "During the coming year, we intend to invest in new initiatives to further expand our supply of physician, nurse and allied candidates and maximize sales synergies of our complementary services. At the same time, we intend to seek operational efficiencies from the combined businesses in order to leverage our size and resources," added Nowakowski.

Susan Nowakowski -
AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. - President, CEO
Thanks, Chris. Good morning and thank you for joining us today to discuss AMN's fourth quarter and year end results for 2005. We really appreciate your interest in AMN Healthcare and for taking the time to participate on our earnings call today. We are very pleased with the performance of our business in 2005 and with our financial results for both the fourth quarter and the full year. Overall the fourth quarter results were at the top end of our guidance range provided to you last November with revenue of 221 million, and diluted earnings per share of $0.21. This represents a 40% increase in revenue and a 50% increase in diluted earnings per share over the fourth quarter of 04. On a full year basis, AMN generated revenue of 706 million, and diluted earnings per share of $0.69.
2005 represented an important turning point in our nurse and allied staffing businesses which generated a 5% increase in revenue after two years of contraction and stabilization. While this represented modest revenue growth, our team was able to grow this segment's operating income by 16% through careful management of expenses and through gross margin expansion.
At the same time, we continue to invest in our future and introduced four new service offerings during the year. The most significant was NurseChoice InDemand, which was launched in order to provide a short term, quick response solution for hospitals who have urgent staffing needs. We also expanded our O'Grady-Peyton International brand with OGP Continuity, OGP Connect Select and OGP Europe.
In 2005, we also took a significant step in fulfilling our long-term strategy of growth and leadership by completing the acquisition of The MHA Group, one of the nation's leading physician staffing companies. In addition to being immediately accretive to earnings, this investment expands AMN's market opportunity and creates significant competitive differentiation. The expansion also diversifies our revenue and earnings reach. Adequate physician staffing is critical in generating revenue and margins for healthcare facilities. It's a top priority. And because the physician staffing business currently has lower penetration into the healthcare community, we believe the expansion into this market positions AMN for stronger growth rates in the future. David will provide you with some perspective on what these stronger growth rates mean to our 2006 revenue and earnings guidance following my comments.
But at this time I would like to reflect back on the fourth quarter and some of the trends that are bringing us in Q 2006. Revenues for our nurse and allied healthcare staffing segment increased by 10% in the fourth quarter of 2005 as compared to the same quarter in 04. About half of the increase was due to the contribution of the MHA allied and nurse staffing businesses and the other half was the increase driven primarily by the continued bill rate increases in our nursing client business.
We continue to experience a higher percentage increase in our renegotiated rate as hospitals seek to attract travelers from a still relatively tight supply. Demand for travel nurses and allied professionals remained relatively strong during the fourth quarter of 2005 with open orders at about 50% over the prior year. As is typical for this time of year, orders trended down during December and into January. However, open orders are still today at levels far above what we can fill.
On the supply front, the number of unique new high need nurse applicants was higher for 2005 as compared to the prior year, increasing in the high single digits. But bringing in more supply of candidates is still a key to even stronger growth. To bolster our supply for 2006 and beyond, we are increasing our investment in both existing and new supply marketing efforts. Opening new domestic and international supply channels and attracting non-traditional nurse demographics is one of our key strategic initiatives and we think that we are in a prime position this year to be more aggressive in our marketing and recruiting efforts.

Now turning to our newer business segment of physician staffing, we were extremely pleased with all aspects of the performance of this business in the fourth quarter. We filled the equivalent of 29,600 physician days during November and December which was up 20% over the same period in 2004. Physician days filled, which is a new metric for AMN, has long been used by MHA as a measure of physician placement volume. Two additional metrics that we will report for the locum portion of our physician staffing business are revenue per day filled and gross profit per day filled.
In terms of permanent placement, we initiated 360 new search engagements in November and December, which was an increase of 40% as compared to the same period in 2004. Trends in all aspects of our physician staffing business remain very strong as we enter into 2006.
As I reported during our last call, we intend to maximize revenue synergies across our combined staffing lines. The overlap in our nurse, allied and physician client basis is currently relatively small and we believe this provides us with an immediate opportunity to cross market our services. For larger hospital systems or facilities, our combined ability to deliver a more comprehensive solution also gives us access to key decision makers at both the C suites and administrator levels. During the fourth quarter, we began our integration efforts and these activities are going very well, which I attribute to the commitment and exceptional talent of the team members involved.
With the combined strengths and capabilities of our physician, nurse and allied staffing businesses, AMN moves forward into 2006 as an even stronger leader in our industry. We expect demand to continue to be relatively robust in all of our business lines which should also continue to drive increases in our average bill rates and revenue per day. Supply of nurses is still our greatest challenge but we believe that the increased resources we will focus in this area will have a meaningful impact on our candidate pool.
As we look ahead at the macro trends in our industry combined with our enhanced competitive strategy and our broadened management strength, AMN is well-positioned for the future. At this point, I will turn the call over to David Dreyer who will recap our year end financial results and provide you with 2006 guidance.
David Dreyer -
AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. - CFO
Thank you, Susan. Before I discuss our fourth quarter results, I would like to recap on a few of the closing details of our acquisition of The MHA Group. Just to remind you, we closed the transaction on November 2, 2005. The final purchase price for MHA was 210 million, which includes an earn-out provision of 47 million of additional consideration based on MHA's final 2005 financial results and 2.7 million of transaction costs. The final earn-out provision is 9 million more than our earlier estimate of 38 million. The final earn-out will be paid tomorrow with approximately 75% paid in cash and 25% in AMN shares. The cash portion of approximately 36 million will be paid from cash on hand and a small portion of $5 million or less from borrowings on our new revolver and we will issue approximately 721,000 shares in addition to the shares we issued in November.
At year end, our leverage ratio was 2.9 times on a pro forma full year basis as compared to 2.2 times at September 30, 2005. The interest rate on the new debt is partially fixed through interest rate swap agreements. At year end, interest rate was approximately 6.4%. Because operating cash flow from our physician, nursing and allied staffing businesses is expected to remain strong, we anticipate that our debt will will be repaid aggressively.
Now I would like to turn your attention to AMN's fourth quarter financial results. We reported revenue of 221 million for the fourth quarter of 2005, a 40% increase compared to the 158 million reported for the fourth quarter of 2004; and a 33% increase compared to the 167 million reported for the third quarter of 2005. The increase in revenue in the fourth quarter of 2005 was mostly due to the inclusion of almost two months of MHA revenue as well as the benefit of continued increases in nurse staff billing rates. Diluted earnings pe share for the fourth quarter of 2005 was $0.21, which included non-operating, after tax charges of $0.02 for the writeoff of deferred financing costs associated with the acquisition financing and $0.01 for imputed interest expense related to recording the deferred portion of the purchase price at present value. Excluding these adjustments, our fourth quarter 2005 adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.24.
With our acquisition of MHA, we've identified two business segments which we will report on. The first is our nurse and allied healthcare staffing segment and the second is our physician staffing segment which includes both our locum tenens staffing and permanent placement businesses. For the fourth quarter of 2005, revenue from our nurse and allied healthcare staffing segment was 174 million, a 10% increase from the fourth quarter of last year, and a 5% increase from the prior quarter. The $16 million increase from the fourth quarter of 2004 reflected the inclusion of MHA's revenue and a 6% increase in revenue generated for traveler due primarily to an increase in the average billing rate charge to hospital and healthcare facility clients. The 7.5 million increase from the prior quarter reflected a 2% increase in revenue per traveller per day.

Revenue from our physician staffing segment in the fourth quarter of 2005 was 47 million, and reflects revenue from November 3 through the end of the year. Locum tenens staffing revenue accounted for approximately 84% of our fourth quarter physician staffing revenue or approximately $40 million. The volume and billing components of our physician staffing revenue are measured with physician days filled and physician revenue per day filled. Days filled is calculated by dividing the physician hours filled during the quarter by eight hours. For the fourth quarter 2005, physician days filled was 29,600, and physician revenue per day filled was approximately $1,337. Gross margin for our locums business in the fourth quarter of 2005 was approximately 27%. We will provide these new metrics in future quarters when reporting on historical physician staffing results.
Physician permanent placement comprised the remaining 7 million of the fourth quarter physician staffing revenue. It's important to point out that a portion of the permanent placement revenue is deferred and recognized over a service period that reflects the average time frame for completing these types of engagements. At December 31, 2005, the permanent placement deferred revenue balance was $7.6 million, which will grow as our business grows, but it's not expected to have a material effect on future reported revenue. Gross margin for the permanent placement business during 2005 averaged approximately 60% and reflected a change from the prior accounting methodology whereby permanent placement recruiting expense has been reclassified as a cost of sales rather than as an SG&A expense. The change didn't reflect our operating, didn't affect our operating income dollars or margin but did it reduce the gross margin percentage.
For the full year 2005, we reported revenue of 706 million, as compared to 629 million, for the same period a year ago. Net income for the full year 2005 was 22 million, or $0.69 per diluted share, up 28% from 17.3 million or $0.55 per diluted share, for the same period a year ago. Excluding the $0.02 charge for the write off of deferred financing costs and a $0.01 charge for imputed interest expense related to recording the deferred portion of the purchase price at present value, the full year adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.72.
Gross profit for the fourth quarter was 58 million representing a gross margin of 26.1% as compared to 23.3% in the prior year quarter and 23.7% last quarter. The increase in gross profit and margin were due mainly to the addition of the slightly higher margin physician staffing segment and also due to a widening of the bill to pay spread in the Company's nurse staffing business.
Selling, General and Administrative expenses, or SG&A, totaled 39 million, representing 17.7% of revenue for the fourth quarter compared to 26 million or 16.7% for the fourth quarter of 2004, and 25 million or 15.1% for the third quarter of 2005. The increase in SG&A expenses was mostly due to the inclusion of MHA's SG&A expense for the last two months of 2005.
Income from operations for the fourth quarter of 2005 totaled 16.5 million, or 7.5% of revenue, increasing from 8.9 million or 5.6% of revenue, in the fourth quarter of 2004, and from 12.9 million or 7.7% of revenue in the third quarter of 2005.
Net interest expense in the fourth quarter was 4.6 million, which included additional interest expense from MHA and 1.2 million or $0.02 per diluted share, for the write off of deferred financing cost.
Amortization expense for the fourth quarter of 2005 was 503,000, and our full year tax rate was approximately 40% which we expect to remain relatively consistent in 2006.
Turning to our financial position at December 31, 2005, AMN generated 16 million in cash flow from operations during the fourth quarter and at year end had 19 million in cash and cash equivalents on hand. For the full year, the Company generated 44 million in cash flow from operations compared to 39 million in 2004. Our Day Sales Outstanding, or DSO, at the end of 2005 was 57 days as compared to 63 days at December 31, 2004. The decrease in DSO resulted from the MHA business historically having slightly lower DSO levels than the AMN business as well as improvements in the nurse billing and collection processes.
At this time, I will provide you with revenue and earnings guidance for the first quarter and full year 2006. The first quarter 2006 revenue is expected to range from 248 to 252 million, and diluted earnings per share is expected to range from $0.17 to $0.19, which reflects the impact of two fewer billing days in the quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2005, and includes estimated stock compensation expense of $0.02 related to our adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 123R, or FAS 123R., on January 1, 2006, and it includes $0.01 for imputed interest expense related to the MHA acquisition. Management believes that diluted earnings per share, Excluding these charges, represents a better indicator of the trends in AMN's operations. Excluding these charges, first quarter 2006 adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to range from $0.20 to $0.22.
For the full year 2006, we are pleased to announce that we expect AMN Healthcare to become the first healthcare staffing company in the U.S. to generate revenue in excess of $1 billion with 2006 revenue ranging from 1.025 billion to 1.05 billion, or an expected growth rate of approximately 50% from the 2005 reported revenue. Diluted earnings per share is expected to range from $0.76 to $0.80 which includes

estimated stock compensation expense of $0.10 related to the adoption of FAS 123 R, and $0.02 for imputed interest expense. Excluding these adjustments, full year 2006 adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to range from $0.88 to $0.92. That concludes my financial overview. Thank you for joining our conference call today and for your interest in AMN. We would now like to open the call up for questions.
QUESTION AND ANSWER

[OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS] Your first question comes from the line of Jason Boles from Banc of America Securities. Please go ahead.
Jason Boles -
Banc of America Securities - Analyst
Hi, guys. Susan, you mentioned earlier the integration of MHA and the cross-selling opportunities and cost synergies you expect to see from that. Just wondering how the progress you've made compares to your expectations and if you have any sense on how long the integration will take to complete?
Susan Nowakowski -
AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. - President, CEO
Sure, and I think, my comment was probably more around the sales synergies that we expect to gain. Clearly this was a combination that was more about the competitive differentiation in sales synergies as opposed to any cost reductions. Now, certainly our teams are working together to look for those efficiency gains and there are some relatively low hanging fruit there that we can capture. To answer your broader question, I would say thing are going slightly better than we expected. We certainly expected thing to go well and we knew that we would resource it appropriately and have a plan established that our teams are working together extremely well and they have a very well thought out plan across all of the areas including sales, operations and some of the administrative areas and they are working that plan. In terms of the sales synergies which we think is the highest priority, there's really two aspects to that. One is the field sales activities where we have immediate opportunities to cross-sell to our existing clients in the physician, nurse and allied markets. As I mentioned, we have actually relatively low overlap in our top clients which we think is good news because it gives us that immediate opportunity to be introducing our services to those clients and our teams are in the field doing that.
The other big opportunity is in your larger national accounts and health systems where we can approach the facilities at a higher level, typically in the C suite, to talk about a longer term, broader partnership. Just to anecdotally, it is interesting, our executive leaders from our physician and staffing businesses met just in the last couple of days with 50 hospital and systems CEOs and about 90% of those CEOs said that physician and nurse staffing were in the top three key areas to focus on during the coming years, and that it was a top priority for them. And they were very interested in finding a way to partner with our staffing companies and get away from the short term transactional nature of the relationship. So we certainly got a great validation of our strategy from those interactions over the last couple of days.
Jason Boles -
Banc of America Securities - Analyst
Great. On your last couple calls, you spoke about the geographic demand across the country and about an update on your exposure in California. I'm wondering how that's trended, if California is still your top state, and just what's going on there.
Susan Nowakowski -
AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. - President, CEO
Sure. There really has not been any significant change in the regional distribution of the business. California is still our largest state. I think we typically stay kind of 20 to 25% of our revenue and that really hasn't changed. Florida, Arizona, Texas are some of our larger states and that's been pretty consistent as well. We do see some pick up in demand in some smaller states like Nevada where there is a lot of population growth and lots of building going on there. But it doesn't come anywhere close to the sheer size of some of the other states like Arizona and Florida.

Just one final one and I will jump back in the queue. Can you give a little more of an update on the NurseChoice initiative, how that compares to your expectations and how much of an impact do you think it will have over the next couple of quarters? I know it was pretty small on your last call.
Susan Nowakowski -
AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. - President, CEO
Sure. Well, it exceeded our expectations in 2005. The team has done a terrific job of building that brand very quickly. I also think it happens to be exactly the right service for the hospital environment today since there is such an urgent demand and it is relatively small and that's why you are not going to hear about it specifically affecting our earnings but I will say it exceeded our expectations for its first six months in 05 and we are expecting it to grow faster than our other travel nurse brands in 06, probably more a reflection of its size and its ramp up, but also a reflection of this very urgent demand that hospitals have for nurses to start quickly.

And your next question comes from the line of Jim Janesky from Ryan Beck and Company. Please go ahead.
Jim Janesky -
Ryan Beck & Co. - Analyst
Good morning, a couple of questions. When you look at your outlook for 2006, it implies that your earnings expectations are relatively flat for the year which is inconsistent with the margin trends that happened in the fourth quarter. Can you give us an idea of what your thoughts are there?
David Dreyer -
AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. - CFO
Well, sure. The $0.92, the range that we have for earnings per share, which basically the high-end of that was the $0.92, is not that far from what I know the Street consensus was, about $0.93. But a couple things have changed. While the gross margin rates are higher because of the combined physician business and nurse allied business, the SG&A spending levels are a bit higher as well. We've historically had our SG&A around 15, 16, 17%, and now with the combination of the physician business, it's running a little bit higher. That's actually pretty clear. For example, if you look at the MHA business, they've had approximately 800 employees with the revenue base historically let's say around 300 million. We've had 900 employees with a revenue base of over 600 million. So we do have this higher SG&A rate and so that's partly going to change the make up. But I think we believe that the earnings result is basically somewhat being cautious but it's also reflecting the fact that we are making some investments this year. Susan had mentioned that we are really focusing on growing our nurse supply. We are making some specific investments in that area which we can expand on. So net/net, we think it's a respectable earnings result but we are basically looking to make some investments and also covering a little bit of a different cost structure than we've had previously.
Jim Janesky -
Ryan Beck & Co. - Analyst
Is it appropriate to look at the investments in the following way that if you make the investments and they start to pay off then we could see a better acceleration on the top line? And if the market is such on the flip side that the investments are not paying off, that as you move throughout 2006, you might be expected to scale back?
Susan Nowakowski -
AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. - President, CEO
Well, Jim, let me first address what some of those investments and initiatives are and why we think they are important. We continuously talked about the need to drive greater supply. While we saw increase in supply in 05, we think that we have much greater opportunity because of the demand that's out there and if we can drive stronger supply we can drive some better growth rates. We think we are in a very strong position to kind of step up the pace in our investments and our marketing recruiting efforts to make that happen in 06. And so our marketing, for example, we are going to be increasing our nurse and allied marketing spend by about 25% during 06 versus 05. And that's to reach out and attract a broader audience of the nursing and allied healthcare professional pool and tap into some new markets as well.

Second area is OGP which has been a very strong supply channel for us in the past. We've doubled the number of international nurses that we've had working over the last three years, and it's been a very good proven supply channel for us to build upon. So we are going to be both investing in our existing supply channels which, as you know, last year, we actually had a lower level of spending than expected because of Visa retro graction so we are going to be picking up the pace in the existing supply channels to sort of bolster the supply channels that we already had there but we are also going to be expanding into some new areas like India, Ireland and Singapore where we are setting up offices. Those are markets where we've actually been recruiting from and we've had very good success so we've decided to make the commitment and actually set up offices there and build that pipeline even stronger.
The third area is around conversion of our existing supply. And in a tight supply market, we need to make sure we are doing everything possible to convert the nurses that have already signed up with us and are currently working with recruiters so we are going to be increasing our resources around training and better aligning incentives with recruiters so that we can increase our conversion of the existing supply that's signed up with us. In terms what have that means to 06 and beyond, we do expect to impact in 06 from some of the initiatives like training and marketing. We would expect more immediate impact in 06 and that is built into our expectations. There is probably some upside there because it's hard to exactly predict. But some of the investments, we know will take longer, like the OGP, investments which generally don't see revenue until 18 to 24 months down the road. Does that help? Does that help?
Jim Janesky -
Ryan Beck & Co. - Analyst
Yes, that's helpful. OGP, you mean O'Grady-Peyton, right?
Susan Nowakowski -
AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. - President, CEO
Correct.
Jim Janesky -
Ryan Beck & Co. - Analyst
Second is that on your perm fee structure, do you get a percentage of the doctor's first year's salary or do you find that it's generally you have a bigger percentage of retained or a bigger percentage of fixed fee? Can you give us an idea of how that works within your organization?

Susan Nowakowski -
AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. - President, CEO
Sure. I will talk about this generally how it works and maybe David can also come back and address the deferred revenue piece because that does play into how it's recognized. Because it is all retained search, about two-thirds of the fees are built based upon the activities and for competitive reasons we don't want to get into our pricing structure with the hospitals but up front the majority of the fees are billed to the client as activities are performed in terms of the recruitment activities, the interview process. It's really only a very small portion at the end that is contingent upon ultimately placing the physician. Obviously, in a retained search business, you need to be placing the majority of your physicians in order to maintain your credibility and reputation for that retained fee. So the majority of those fees, just to repeat myself, are sort of activity based around the front end of the process. David, you want to talk about the deferred revenue piece?
David Dreyer -
AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. - CFO
The deferred amount is basically, it's fairly big on the balance sheet, over $7 million, but in terms of the recognition of revenue, it's fairly insignificant. Basically we have to defer a portion of it during the activity of the engagement period or and recognize it as basically it's considered to be earned or in some cases no longer contingent but again on a full year basis, because this business is also growing the effect basically on revenue is again fairly insignificant.
Jim Janesky -
Ryan Beck & Co. - Analyst
So just to be clear it's not in the physician placement market generally, it's more of a fixed or retained fee as opposed to a percentage of the first year's salary, for example, like it is with other executives in other industries. Is that correct?
Susan Nowakowski -
AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. - President, CEO
Yes, that's correct. It may be somewhat tied to their compensation level but it's not like the corn fairies of the world where they charge X% necessarily. And the other thing I will say, the other thing that's very different than maybe some of the more executive traditional perm placement companies is that the way that MHA has their model set up, there is a constant flow of both demand, I know search engagements and supply of candidates. They don't have one consultant that's out there trying to both market the business and find the candidate. They have a very, very strong infrastructure to be constantly driving more demand, more search engagements, and constantly driving candidates and that helps keep a very consistent and growing pool of both demand and supply.
Jim Janesky -
Ryan Beck & Co. - Analyst
Okay. Good. One last question, David, the tax rate in the December quarter was higher than your historic rate. It was over 41%. What should we be using going forward?
David Dreyer -
AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. - CFO
On a go forward basis, I would say approximately 40% as a rate going forward. Fourth quarter was partly really for us to true up and basically finish the year at a correct rate. One comment I did want to make, though, was that the variability of the tax rate, the fourth quarter was again more about trueing up, it wasn't necessarily transaction related but on a go forward basis I think the 40% is what we've guided at.
Jim Janesky -
Ryan Beck & Co. - Analyst
Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber from Harris Nesbitt. Please go ahead.
Jeff Silber -
Harris Nesbitt - Analyst
Thanks and good morning. In prior calls, you've been kind enough to give us a little bit more color on your revenue guidance. I was wondering if we can get the same thing, if you give us some of your expected trends by segment from both the volume and pricing perspective, that would be great.
David Dreyer -
AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. - CFO
Sure. You know, we are not really breaking the segments down on a guidance basis but as I did basically explain on a pro forma for historical and I just want to reiterate these numbers again, on a pro forma basis with both MHA and AMN, if you looked at the nursing revenues, fourth quarter, that was about 179 million, and the physician segment was about 71, so that's the 250 for the quarter broken down roughly 72% nursing, 28% physician. On a full year 05 basis, as I said in my prepared remarks, the nursing was about 688 and the physician was about 274, total about 962, same split, 72% nursing and 28% physician. And one other detail and we would basically add on to that again, just historically. If you look at the physician piece and you can pretty much do this with the math on what I gave in the prepared remarks, but in the perm placement business made up roughly 40, low 40s out of that 274, the locum's around 230. So that's at least our starting base in 2005 going forward.

Jeff Silber -
Harris Nesbitt - Analyst
But again just kind of looking going forward, what would we expect or what are you expecting on trends? I know you don't want to give specific numbers but trends would be helpful.
David Dreyer -
AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. - CFO
Sure. Really we are expecting pretty much growth rates that I think are very similar that have been quoted within the industry. For example, one reference point would be the staffing industry report. nursing, travel nursing, they've quoted rates about 5% growth rates. I believe the allied, they said around 9%. Locums, they said around 12%. Without me commenting specifically on our individual growth rates, we believe we are growing consistent with the industry expectations and the aggregate business, certainly the aggregate revenues we believe are in line with those industry expectations.
Jeff Silber -
Harris Nesbitt - Analyst
Okay. Great. I think most of us have an understanding of the impact of seasonality on your core nursing business. How does that change with the addition of MHA Group to the model?
David Dreyer -
AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. - CFO
Simply, the variation, I think, is not as strong on the physician segment as it has been historically on the nursing allied, but there is a big of a ramp up third quarter similar to the nursing but not quite to the same degree as what we have probably seen historically with the nursing business comparable. One comment I wanted to make though at least on the perm placement side, that's relatively smooth. It grows at a more consistent level. We don't see the same variation as we've seen on the locums and the nursing side.
Jeff Silber -
Harris Nesbitt - Analyst
A couple of other things on guidance and I will let somebody else jump in. What should we be assuming for depreciation, amortization, interest expense and share counts?
David Dreyer -
AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. - CFO
The total share count is pretty clear. Let me go through that numbers first. For the basically the full year 06, the estimate is about 35.1 million shares on a fully diluted basis. Pretty much for the first quarter, and I think a lot of the quarters going forward, it's right around 35 million shares. If you look at the depreciation and interest, basically on I guess on a percentage of revenue basis on a full year, interest rate, we've mentioned the effective rate's about 6.4%. That actually might go down slightly because we do have a provision where once our leverage ratio gets full of 3.0, it goes down slightly like about 6.2. So at least for three of the four quarters, we should be more at 6.2. Depreciation on a full year basis is probably close to about $10 million or so with the combined entities or let's say 2.5 million on a quarterly basis. The incremental amortization that we talked about from the intangibles of the deal, we are still holding to our earlier estimate of about 800,000 a quarter.

Chris Rigg -
Merrill Lynch - Analyst
Good morning. It's actually Chris Rigg filling in for A.J. Can you guys provide a few more details on the earn out provision and what caused that to be about $9 million higher than your original estimate?
David Dreyer -
AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. - CFO
Sure. The earn out provision, again, it was really based on a measurement of the EBITDA of the MHA business and we had originally had measured it earlier in the third quarter. And then based on the, how it finished at year end, based on the incremental amount of EBITDA, there was also then the multiples added on top of that. For the total deal, that full purchase price now is about 210 million. Basically that comes in at about I think an 8.5, 8.7, I'm sorry, give me one second, I think it's 8.7 multiple, but when you look at the earn out, the multiples there were in the 6 range. I believe it's going to average somewhere closer, like not quite 6.5 times. The incremental EBITDA was basically a respectable amount but it was really, that with the multiple on top of that, let's say roughly 6.5 times in the earn out provision, I think it's 6.3, that basically accounted for the incremental 9 million. That was really right out of the original agreement and the performance did deliver the incremental EBITDA.
Susan Nowakowski -
AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. - President, CEO
Chris, we were probably a little on the conservative side as we estimated that earn out. As you recall, the earn out had a potential from going from 35 to 52 million. We had estimated it to come in at 38 which was probably at the lower end of what we thought the expectations could be and the business just performed exceptionally well and continued to have a lot of momentum in Q24 and the team has really driven that. And it continues to grow into the first quarter of 2006. So it's really, I would say for us, it's good news. As much as it's more money out the door, we are very very happy to pay it because it's a great sign of the health and strength of the business. As I said, we continue to see that strength go into the first quarter.
Chris Rigg -
Merrill Lynch - Analyst
I guess and just a follow up on that and the profitability of MHA, David you had talked about this a little bit earlier, the sequential increase in SG&A, the sequential increase is probably a little bit higher than what we would have expected and sort of if we did the math on the staffing data you put in there and kind of figure in what the permanent placement would be, it sort of seems like the true positioning staffing business, at least on the numbers here, is not as profitable as what we would have thought given the gross margin and that maybe the physician, the permanent placement business is really the entity that's substantially contributing to the higher margin relative to the traditional staffing. Is there anything - and is that the right way to this about this business going forward and hopefully that's reasonably clear.
David Dreyer -
AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. - CFO
No, it was but I think that's the wrong premise, though. I don't believe the higher profitability is from the perm placement business. The locums business is very much profitable. Again, on a forward basis, I'm not really breaking the two segments out but basically on a full year pro forma basis, the combined physician gross margins are 31, 32%. And the SG&A spending levels are higher, as I said, the 23, maybe 24%, but on a combined basis, the Company is going to look at pretty much a gross margin of 26, 26 plus percent and an SG&A spending level of, let's say, 19%. So again I think that was sort of anticipated. When you get down to EBITDA margins, as we said when we first announced the deal, nursing has pretty much been trending at 7%, EBITDA margins going up to 8, and the combined physician business 8% margins going up, upward. And so on a combined basis, you blend it. We've been sort of targeting somewhere around the 7.5, working our way up to 8, and I believe that the locums is very much contributing to that. There's not a difference in terms of the profitability. We talked about the change in some of the accounting on the permanent placement business. Still, though, the gross margins there being 60% are clearly very respectable. But it is a relatively smaller piece of our business. Physician in 05 made up 28%. The perm placement business made up a smaller percent. I said on a run rate of roughly 40, 43 million for 05. I think that was the wrong premise. I believe both are contributing and certainly that's helping to improve our earnings and we believe that's reflected in the guidance we've given.
Chris Rigg -
Merrill Lynch - Analyst
Okay, and just the last question here on a different subject. Just in terms of your acquisition pipeline going forward and sort of the outlook there, what's your appetite at this point? Is it really just to clamp down and focus on doing things organically over the next year or two or do you think there's still some opportunity to pick off some competitors here?
Susan Nowakowski -
AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. - President, CEO
For the next year, we are very focused on the integration of these two businesses and really positioning ourselves within the marketplace and taking advantage of what we have to offer our hospital clients. We also are focused on paying down our debt. While we are comfortable with the debt levels that we are at, we'd like to pay that down so that it gives us more flexibility in the future. There are some pocket opportunities that we will continue to look at over the next year or two, around the allied health in particular. Pharmacy staffing continues to be an area that our clients ask us for and we are not currently providing. We can also continue to bolster our position within the overall allied market. We believe that we are about the number three player in the allied market with our combined brands and we think we could continue to grow that organically but also could add to that via acquisition. Down the road it is conceivable that we would continue to build upon our physician staffing business but we have such a phenomenal team right now with our physician staffing business and they are driving terrific organic growth so we want to let them continue to focus on that for the short term.

Tobey Sommer -
SunTrust Robinson - Analyst
Good morning. Could you comment on what retention has been like within The MHA Group in terms of key personnel and what your expectation is for the balance of the year?
Susan Nowakowski -
AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. - President, CEO
Yes. We haven't seen any change in retention there at the management level. All of the team managers that were there when we were talking about coming together are still there today and passionately driving that business and that great performance that you saw in the fourth quarter. I can tell you they are an exceptionally talented and engaged group of managers and sales professionals. And so we haven't seen them miss a beat or be at all distracted. If anything, they are just extremely focused on helping to continue to build not only the physician business but the broader business. In fact, they are hiring significant staff there. That's not to replace people but that's to continue to build upon their team. As we mentioned in previous calls, the two founders, CEO Joe Hawkins and President Jim Merritt, do have employment agreements with us for two years. However, there is nothing to make me think that they wouldn't be here even beyond that at this point.
Tobey Sommer -
SunTrust Robinson - Analyst
I was wondering you mentioned investing in both marketing and maybe even recruiters. I was wondering if you could share with us either the number of recruiters that you have, I'm thinking on the nurse staffing side, and/or sort of the year over year change in your recruiter base and maybe talk about the capacity that you think you have among your existing recruiters even before you kind of add somebody?
Susan Nowakowski -
AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. - President, CEO
Sure, Tobey. You're right, we have not provided specific numbers for competitive reasons on the number of recruiters and I'm pretty consistent, what we tend to be even more focused on, we just believe it's our job to have the right number of sales professionals and recruiters and for that matter matter, yes, we are adding to that over the next year, but we believe that we have even greater opportunity to grow our recruiter productivity. Now our recruiter productivity did grow in the fourth quarter. In fact it was one of our best quarters on a year over year basis in terms of productivity growth but we are still at relatively lower productivity levels compared to where we were, say, three, four years ago. So we know that we have room to grow that recruiter productivity. So we are going to be investing in initiatives this year to try to bring that productivity level up and help our recruiters to place more individuals that they are working with.
Tobey Sommer -
SunTrust Robinson - Analyst

Susan Nowakowski -
AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. - President, CEO
Sure. We started to talk in the third quarter of last year, in particular, about being at above 5% in our renegotiated rates and that's part of what you have seen flow through to our higher revenue per traveller per day. During the fourth quarter and first quarter, we've seen that stay above 5% and in the first quarter, it's actually, it has accelerated. So we don't see any change in that pricing environment. If anything, we have seen a slight acceleration since the first of the year.
Tobey Sommer -
SunTrust Robinson - Analyst
And I guess I fibbed. I will ask one follow up related to that, then. When you look at your different customers on either a regional basis or on a relative size basis, can you decipher any trends in those price increases that you are seeing, either is it among smaller customers versus large once or is it in California versus Florida, could you comment on that?
Susan Nowakowski -
AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. - President, CEO
Well, for competitive reasons, I probably don't want to provide too much detail and color. I think we've said in the past that the pricing increases have been relatively consistent across the sort of the West Coast and the East Coast or the western U.S. and eastern U.S. I'd say that continued to be true other than the first part of this year we probably have seen greater pricing traction in the east than we have in the west and I think that's because some of those hospitals have been lagging behind and maybe kind of dragging their heels and now they are coming into some of their higher needs seasonally they are realizing that they need to become more competitive in their bill rate so they can get the travelers that they need.

Your next question comes from the line of Gene Mannheimer from Caris & Company.
Gene Mannheimer -
Caris & Co. - Analyst
Hi, and congratulations on a great quarter. My questions are, can you just remind us of the top line growth rate of the MHA business historically?
David Dreyer -
AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. - CFO
Sure. Basically if you go back to the 8-K that we had filed earlier and you look at what the growth rates were on revenue from 04 to 05 on a pro forma basis to 04, it's in like the mid 30 range from this last year. If you go back historically over about a five-year period, let's say 2001 through 2004, it was also in the 30% average growth rate revenue top line growth as well. I would not necessarily say that's always, the assumption of going forward. Clearly that's inconsistent with what the industry report is guiding for the locums industry but that's historically been the revenue growth rate. I also would like to add is that late in 04, they did make pretty significant investments in terms of growing their sales group, adding employee resources with the intent of, again, growing sales and that in essence has been very effective in 05, I think contributing to that 30 plus percent growth rate.

Caris & Co. - Analyst
While you're looking for that, a question for Susan. I think one or more of your competitors had cited weak hospital admissions as a current marketplace challenge. Do you see that and if so, is there anything to defend against that?
Susan Nowakowski -
AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. - President, CEO
I'm sorry, could you repeat that?
Gene Mannheimer -
Caris & Co. - Analyst
Yes. I was saying one or more of your competitors had cited weak hospital admissions as a current trend in the marketplace and I wanted to know if you are seeing that as well and if there is anything to do to combat that.
Susan Nowakowski -
AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. - President, CEO
We see and hear the same things that you and the other analysts here in terms of soft hospital admissions. But what we hear more from our clients and what we see in the macro environment is that the number of healthcare job openings and job quits, basically the tightness of the permanent labor market for hospitals, continues to drive demand. If you go to the BLS information where they report the number of job openings and job quits, it was up again on a year over year basis in the fourth quarter. And so that continues to drive strength in demand. Really throughout 05, we believe that it was that tight kind of labor market that really drove the surge in demand because clearly it wasn't a rise in admissions. I don't think that anyone foresees that landscape changing significantly throughout 06. It continues to be a tight labor market for hospitals and so that's why we believe that sort of regardless of admissions, we will continue to have a strong demand. Now that's on the nursing and allied side in particular. On the physician side, hospitals and physician practice groups are always looking for physicians because they're such an important element in driving revenue and margin for the hospitals, and in building their service reach within their community.
David Dreyer -
AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. - CFO
Gene, the answer on the other question you asked, for Q4, the amortization is about 500,000. But again we only had two months of MHA. And as I said earlier, on a full quarter basis, you would expect that to be about 800,000 per quarter. The depreciation was 1.7 million for the quarter,

Bruce Ackerman -
Sandhill Equity Research - Analyst
Good morning and congratulations again on the MHA acquisition which seems to be turning out so well for you. You already gave us your thoughts on acquisitions in the near term but my question is down the road, can you tell me how you view the attractiveness of a per diem staffing business acquisition?
Susan Nowakowski -
AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. - President, CEO
It's not something that's in our short term strategy because we believe that we are currently in the most attractive segments of healthcare staffing industry and certainly if you look at growth rates within the industry, travel nurse staffing, allied staffing and locums tenens staffing have all been the most attractive growth rates and we think, just because of the macro trends, will continue to be so. It also gives us the opportunity to leverage our operating model because these are all businesses that tend to be fairly centralized in their operations and yet have a national reach and so it gives us that ability to gain some competitive advantage and efficiencies by combining our, some of our back office resources or even for that matter our sales resources where appropriate. So it's not, per diem isn't something that we are looking at sort of in the foreseeable future so it's sort of hard for me to comment several, several years out but we think that we are in the right market for the next two years.

Craig Benkey -
Founders Asset Management - Analyst
Okay. And if you can help me out with what was the approximate spend on that in 05?
Susan Nowakowski -
AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. - President, CEO
Well, we are not going to break out each individual one. Anecdotally I think I mentioned that marketing was about a 25% increase and that equates to about a $2 million increase in spend in 2006.
Craig Benkey -
Founders Asset Management - Analyst
Okay.
Susan Nowakowski -
AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. - President, CEO
That's just one of the factors but that's one that's very important because it's focused on driving new supply. Now OGP, you'd have to break out differently because OGP, part of it was the fact that we spent less in some of our existing supply channels last year so it's really bringing up those supply channels to where we want them to be to drive volume for the future but then also on top of that, expanding into some of the newer markets. Now the difference with OGP is that some of the spend is investing to drive volume. Some of the spend is directly related to the volume that you are driving meaning that you are not going to spend it unless you actually get the candidates in the pipeline.
Craig Benkey -
Founders Asset Management - Analyst
Okay. And all that spend is basically just on getting more recruiters at the firm working or is some of it in other areas that actually is a permanent expense like some kind of marketing or ad campaigns to drive nurses into your door?
Susan Nowakowski -
AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. - President, CEO
I think of it in three areas, one is, yes, some additional headcount in order to reach out and recruit and interface with the candidates. The second is around marketing and advertising and attracting the candidates and the third is around the actual sort of operational expense, the candidates traveling, investing in their education to take their licensure test, through the immigration process and that's where I say you are only spending those dollars if you are actually getting the candidates into the pipeline.

David Dreyer -
AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. - CFO
Sure. Capital spending basically for the full year of 05 which again is mostly in end sight was right around $4 million so that's kind of consistent with what we've been guiding. On a go forward basis, we expect it to be a little bit higher in 06, more in the neighborhood of 6 to $7 million, so again relatively small.
Sam Osceola
- Guggenheim Partners - Analyst
Just on the EBITDA guidance for 06, do you have a range?
David Dreyer -
AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. - CFO
We don't really give that guidance but as I had mentioned historically, if you looked at what we have been saying is that the nursing we have been 7% working up and the physician side had been more 8%. So I think if you looked at it on a pro forma basis or you go back to the the 8-K and what we have been reporting, basically I think we are working towards high 7's, low 8's, as being a territory that we have been moving into.

We'll move on to the line of Tobey Sommer from SunTrust Robinson.
Tobey Sommer
- SunTrust Robinson - Analyst
One other question, on the travel side, the nurse side, what sort of opportunity do you have perhaps to get some gross margin expansion not only from higher bill rate and bill pay rates per expansion but also maybe having more in shared housing or any of the other kind of ancillary expenses that hit cost of service. Is there any opportunity there as you look into 06?
Susan Nowakowski
- AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. - President, CEO
We are really projecting our gross margin percentage to be a relatively consistent throughout 2006 and, yes, we do expect to get pricing increases but we are going to be passing that along in bill rates, I'm sorry, pay rate increases and covering some housing increases as well. We know that because of the low vacancy rates across the country that there is likely to be some housing cost increases so our bill rate increases are used to increase the overall nurses compensation package which can come in the form of increased housing, increased housing subsidies because if housing costs are going up, our nurses are expecting us to pay them potentially a higher subsidy to cover that and also pay rate. So all of that translates down to a pretty consistent gross margin percentage throughout 06. Is there upside? Sure. If we were to get stronger pricing increases than we anticipate, then there could be upside but in the short term, we believe we should use those pricing increases largely to pass on the nurse to drive greater supply.
David Dreyer
- AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. - CFO
The only thing I would add to that, Tobey, is there's sometimes, is a timing lag effect because we are managing obviously how we pass on the higher billing rate to travelers that last quarter, for example, you see that some of it still landed in gross margin but that's because we were very
F T
INAL
RANSCRIPT

careful as to and strategic as to how we pass it on in housing or benefits or pay rates. So as long as the price increases continue to grow, there can be a lag effect but as Susan said, the margin rates will ultimately start to average fairly consistently because we are passing it on. That's our strategy.
Tobey Sommer
- SunTrust Robinson - Analyst
Thank you. And one last question, could you comment on retention within the travel nurse segment and what you are seeing in terms of average length of assignments? Are you having more of your nurses ask to stay on with their current client?
Susan Nowakowski
- AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. - President, CEO
Sure, Tobey. Regarding retention rates, we were very pleased with our fourth quarter. In fact, we believe that we have the highest retention rates in the industry. We tend to run between 70 and 75% meaning when we have somebody coming coming off an assignment in a month, are they rebooking with us on an extension or a new assignment. In the fourth quarter, we saw our largest percentage increase during the year. And overall for the full year 05, we saw those retention rates go up. So we are pleased with where they are. We think we can do better and again in a tight supply market, that becomes even more important. In terms of extensions, that would be a reflection of that, but yes, for a small number we are seeing a small number of people rebook, not necessarily at an existing assignment but just rebook with us in general. We haven't seen a big change in the, what we would call book to start time frame which is from the time you actually confirm them for an assignment to when they start. That's actually within a day of where it was a year ago. So our trends in our assignment durations have been pretty consistent. Now NurseChoice changes that a little bit but that's such a small number that it doesn't really change our aggregate number.

Craig Benkey
- Founders Asset Management - Analyst
Thanks for the detail on the increase in marketing spend. One thing though that just doesn't seem to make intuitive sense, I would like some clarification on it, the G&A which is where all of that spend would fall, was about 17.5%, 17.7 this quarter. And I think, David, you said that kind of maybe around 19% is where that would fall in 06. So 150 basis point change. That's more like a 15 to $16 million difference if I just take the midpoint of the 2006 revenue guide, around 1 billion 35. That seems like a heck of a lot more than just the 2 million that you mentioned on spend. What are some of the items that are really driving that G&A percentage up from 17.5 up to potentially 19?

David Dreyer

That's pretty easy to explain because fourth quarter we only had two months of MHA in that number you are averaging.
Craig Benkey
- Founders Asset Management - Analyst
But you only had two months of the revenue so that pretty much shakes out there.
David Dreyer
- AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. - CFO
Actually not really. When you do the full year pro forma, basically you will get very close to 19%. I know the fourth quarter you are getting probably 17.7%. But actually the spending levels have been fairly consistent. The fourth quarter I think it's kind of a combination of not having that full spend, the two-month spending, but again on a pro forma basis, and I know if you go back to look at basically the 8-K that really the combined rate of about 19% really would be an accurate go forward rate. AMN's been more like 16, 17 but on a combined now with, again I'd say around 22, 23% on a physician MHA basis, that's going to be closer to our 19% average. There is no other incremental spending event that's different causing that.

Joe Dickerson

Hi, how you doing?
Susan Nowakowski
- AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. - President, CEO
Hi. Great.
Joe Dickerson
- Atlantic Equity Research - Analyst
I had a couple of questions around the MHA acquisition and I don't know if you mentioned this earlier but or if I missed it or not. What was their contribution for earnings and revenue in the recently completed fourth quarter?
David Dreyer
- AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. - CFO
We haven't actually broken that out but in the guidance we basically said that we thought that it would contribute accretion of about $0.02 net and that is consistent with what actually did happen. Now in that $0.02 accretion, again that's net of this write off of deferred financing cost that I talked about. That's another equivalent of $0.02. So it is a net $0.02 accretive for the fourth quarter and 2005 and that is net of this $0.02 write off and the deferred financing charges.
Joe Dickerson
- Atlantic Equity Research - Analyst
So in your regular business, Excluding the MHA and Excluding the write off, you did around $0.20 you think in your regular core business?
David Dreyer
- AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. - CFO
I mean basically the $0.21 and the $0.02 accretion and again I'm adding back there so that's basically going to tell you around the $0.19.
Joe Dickerson
- Atlantic Equity Research - Analyst
So you $0.19 in your core business?

Add $0.19 in the core business and also the $0.02 of accretion relative to MHA, yes.
Joe Dickerson
- Atlantic Equity Research - Analyst
Okay. I'm just trying to, really trying to understand how like in the last two quarters your Company has significantly like raised the bar on the earnings delivery on the travel nurse business compared to your competitors, so it was like about six quarters in a row before that you were kind of neck in neck with them, and now it seems like you are out delivering 40, 50% more in earnings per quarter than your largest competitors are. How do you think you are able to do that?
David Dreyer
- AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. - CFO
I really couldn't speak to cross country but I think when you look obviously what we are guiding on a go forward basis, we have really a different mix of business and I think Susan pointed out well that we think we are in the two premium sectors of healthcare staffing. Travel nursing and the physician we believe are the two most profitable business segments, cross country obviously is in the travel nursing but they have other segments which are different and so I believe that's going to contribute to some of the differences.
Joe Dickerson
- Atlantic Equity Research - Analyst
But I'm talking about your business Excluding the physician acquisitions. On the travel nurse, when you are going head to head with them, you are some reason, I don't know how, doing significantly better the last two quarters. You are doing a phenomenal job. I'm wondering how you are putting together this great job.
David Dreyer
- AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. - CFO
I guess the third quarter is the one you are calling reference to was $0.22 earnings per share. Again, we had a good quarter. We had a lot of pricing increase contributing to a very healthy revenue growth. Two, we all year, 2005, have managed our SG&A with great discipline and I think that really showed in the third quarter result as we really leveraged to get a very positive earnings per share. I don't believe there's that much difference in the makeup of the business that would account for a big difference. I think the way we managed for profitability is really what drove those results third quarter and what we continue to do to drive all of the business, the nursing and allied sectors as we are talking about.
Joe Dickerson
- Atlantic Equity Research - Analyst
I just have one more question. As far as the locums tenens business, this recent acquisition, they had 30% revenue growth in the year before you acquired them and I think around 6% the previous year, right, which is a tremendous jump that they had, right? And I'm just wondering that, so they had a 30% jump in revenues last year. Is that something that you are seeing in the whole locums tenens industry where something out of the blue has happened, say in 2005, where all of a sudden the physician placement business is just having these huge jumps? Because that really is a dramatic jump, 30%.
Susan Nowakowski
- AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. - President, CEO
There is not a lot of public data available on the overall market. There is the staffing industry report which has talked about the 12 to 14% growth over the last couple of years and, yes, we do believe that MHA has grown faster than the market and has taken market share because of their team, because of the way that they developed their model. That significant jump for them was I think driven by a couple of factors one, yes, they are in a terrific market. It's a relatively less mature market meaning that it doesn't have the penetration that we see in the nurse staffing business which is great news because it's got a lot of further room to grow and continue to penetrate into the healthcare community. But also it's the way that they have established their model. They made significant investments in 04 to really build and bolster their infrastructure in order to deliver those results. And so that's why you saw the big jump in 05 and it's really positioned them well within the marketplace.

Susan Nowakowski

It's both.
Joe Dickerson
- Atlantic Equity Research - Analyst
Okay. Great.
Susan Nowakowski
- AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. - President, CEO
You definitely want to be in a good market and they are. And I think the projections are that the locum tenens industry will continue to be in a good market, one because of the macro trends, growing demand for physicians and a relatively tight supply. Also the fact that as I said before, physicians are such important revenue generators for the hospitals, as hospitals seek to grow their revenue and their margin and their service reach which is important to building their revenue, they need to make sure they are focused on physician recruitment. I don't know if you read recently Lifepoint came out and talked about how critical physicians are to driving their revenue and margin. In fact, Lifepoint executives have publicly said they expect to drive their profits by sharply boosting their physician recruitment activity. So hospitals recognize that physician recruitment is absolutely critical to meeting not only their patient care goals but also their financial goals.
Joe Dickerson
- Atlantic Equity Research - Analyst
I'm just wondering one thing like while the travel nursing business was a little bit down the last few years, why companies like yours didn't look to this locum tenens business for acquisitions before if it's such a wonderful industry? Why all of a sudden now? Why didn't you do it like before?
David Dreyer
- AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. - CFO
We were trying. I mean. Seriously, we've had it as a strategic goal to pursue acquisitions now for several years. It's a challenging process to have both sides align with the same interest and pricing and et cetera. So believe me, we were trying. It just wasn't just a fluke.

Your next question comes from the line of Billy Day Ammond from Atlas Capital.
Billy Day Ammond
- Atlas Capital - Analyst
Hi, guys, thank you. Great quarter. I had a couple of quick questions. First was if you had the whole three months of MHA in the fourth quarter, what would the margin have been in terms of SG&A as a percentage of revenue? You talked about the 19% for overall for 05 but you had rapidly increasing revenue so I know that there was some leverage to that throughout the year. So if it was 19% for 05, I imagine it ended the year at a lower percentage than it began the year.
David Dreyer -
AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. - CFO
Actually on a pro forma basis in a one, the nine months that we reported in the 8-K and also updating this through December 31, the combined SG&A percentage of revenue for Q4 and for the full year 05 were actually very similar. It's very close to that 19%.
Billy Day Ammond -
Atlas Capital - Analyst
What drove the margin expansion throughout the year, then? Because there was some margin expansion that you had talked about on the EBITDA line.
Susan Nowakowski -
AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. - President, CEO
Well, for us it was gross profit expansion due to pricing expansion.
Billy Day Ammond -
Atlas Capital - Analyst
No, more on the MHA side.
David Dreyer -
AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. - CFO
MHA's gross margin percentage changes were basically, for example, from the nine-month pro forma to the full year pro forma, the fourth quarter and the full year again are a little different but again I think the average on the combined entity pro forma are fairly similar. They have been basically 31, 32, 33% kind of gross margin range on the total physician business. Actually Q4 and the full year 05 pro forma that was fairly consistent.
Billy Day Ammond -
Atlas Capital - Analyst
No, I understand, but just I guess in looking at the fourth quarter, if it was 17.7% as a percentage of revenues for two months, what was it pro forma for three months? I guess I find it just seems to me hard to believe that it would.
Susan Nowakowski -
AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. - President, CEO
A little over 18, I think.
Billy Day Ammond -
Atlas Capital - Analyst
A little over 18, okay. So that's kind of where it was running at least as of the fourth quarter. And so then the question is, is obviously some of the increase in the SG&A as a percentage of revenues for next year, some of the incremental marketing spend that you are talking about, it
F T

sounded like that some of the spend in terms of building of plans, increasing of marketing initiatives, those sounded to me like some of them might be one time.
Susan Nowakowski
- AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. - President, CEO
It's a combination. Some of it is ramping up operations and recruitment efforts and some of it is once you get that pipeline flowing, if you were getting the pipeline then we would expect that we will be spending that going forward, it's a combination of both.
Billy Day Ammond
- Atlas Capital - - Analyst
So some one times, some not. If you looked at it and said it was a little over 18 so it kind of, if you looked for a pretty decent size increase then probably you are looking at 18.5, 18.6% as a percent of revenue on a go forward basis from an SG&A standpoint?
David Dreyer
- AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. - CFO
You are just talking about the nursing segment?
Billy Day Ammond
- Atlas Capital - Analyst
No, I'm talking about overall. If it was at 18.1 in the fourth quarter, overall for the overall business, then going forward with the leverage that you are getting from a growth on the top line perspective, it seems like that leverage should offset some of the additional spend even though I recognize that some of that will go straight through to the nurses.
David Dreyer
- AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. - CFO
Yes, Billy, I know it's a very specific question on our guidance going forward with SG&A and it's really not a level of detail that we have covered. But I think you are making those assumptions that I really feel like we really probably shouldn't be commenting on.
Billy Day Ammond
- Atlas Capital - Analyst
Okay. But just to be clear, was it a little over 18 for the fourth quarter?
David Dreyer
- AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. - CFO
For Q4 on a combined basis, yes. And as I said, it was probably more rounding up towards closer to 19 for both the pro forma Q4 and pro forma full year on a combined basis.
Billy Day Ammond
- Atlas Capital - Analyst
You just said it was a little over 18 pro forma combined for the fourth quarter but 19 for the year?
David Dreyer
- AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. - CFO
I said the 17.7% is again what we reported, that's got two months of MHA. On a pro forma.

Which three months would be a little over 18 is what Susan said, correct?

The Compensation and Stock Plan Committee has full power to select, from among the individuals eligible for awards, the individuals to whom awards will be granted, to make any combination of awards to participants, and to determine the specific terms and conditions of each award, subject to the provisions of the Equity Plan. The Compensation and Stock Plan Committee may delegate to the CEO of the Company the authority to grant awards at fair market value to employees who are not subject to the reporting and other provisions of Section 16 of the Exchange Act.
Plan Administration
. Persons eligible to participate in the Equity Plan will be those officers, employees, non-employee directors and other key persons (including consultants and prospective employees) of the Company and its subsidiaries as selected from time to time by the Compensation and Stock Plan Committee. The maximum award of stock options or stock appreciation rights granted to any one individual will not exceed 500,000 shares (subject to adjustment for stock splits and similar events) for any calendar year period. If any award of restricted stock or restricted stock units granted to an individual is intended to qualify as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code, then the maximum award shall not exceed 500,000 shares (subject to adjustment for stock splits and similar events) to any one such individual in any performance cycle.
Eligibility and Limitations on Grants
. The Equity Plan permits the granting of (1) stock options intended to qualify as incentive stock options under Section 422 of the Code and (2) stock options that do not so qualify. Options granted under the Equity Plan will be non-qualified options if they fail to qualify as incentive options or exceed the annual limit on incentive stock options. Non-qualified options may be granted to any persons eligible to receive incentive options and to non-employee directors and key persons. The option exercise price of each option will be determined by the Compensation and Stock Plan Committee but may not be less than 100% of the fair market value of the Common Stock on the date of grant. The maximum number of shares that can be granted in the form of incentive stock options cannot exceed 250,000 shares. The term of each option will be fixed by the Compensation and Stock Plan Committee and may not exceed ten years from the date of grant. The Compensation and Stock Plan Committee will determine at what time or times each option may be exercised. Options may be made exercisable in installments and the exercisability of options may be accelerated by the Compensation and Stock Plan Committee. Options may be exercised in whole or in part with written notice to the Company. Upon exercise of options, the option exercise price must be paid in full either in cash, by certified or bank check or other instrument acceptable to the Compensation and Stock Plan Committee, or by delivery (or attestation to the ownership) of shares that are beneficially owned by the optionee. Subject to applicable law, the exercise price may also be delivered to the Company by a broker pursuant to irrevocable instructions to the broker from the optionee. To qualify as incentive options, options must meet additional federal tax requirements, including a $100,000 limit on the value of shares subject to incentive options that first become exercisable by a participant in any one calendar year.
Stock Options
. The Compensation and Stock Plan Committee may award a stock appreciation right either as a freestanding award or in tandem with a stock option. The Compensation and Stock Plan Committee may award stock appreciation rights subject to such conditions and restrictions as the Compensation and Stock Plan Committee may determine, provided that (1) upon exercise of a stock appreciation right granted in tandem with an option, the applicable portion of any related option shall be
Stock Appreciation Rights
surrendered and (2) stock appreciation rights granted in tandem with options are exercisable at such time or times and to the extent that the related stock options are exercisable.
. The Compensation and Stock Plan Committee may award shares to participants subject to such conditions and restrictions as the Compensation and Stock Plan Committee may determine. These conditions and restrictions may include the achievement of certain performance goals and/or continued employment with the Company through a specified restricted period. However, in the event these awards have a performance-based goal, the restriction period will be at least one year, and in the event these awards have a time-based restriction, the restriction period will be at least three years, but vesting can occur incrementally over the three-year period.
Restricted Stock
. The Compensation and Stock Plan Committee may award restricted stock units as deferred stock awards to participants. Restricted stock units are ultimately payable in the form of shares and may be subject to such conditions and restrictions as the Compensation and Stock Plan Committee may determine. These conditions and restrictions may include the achievement of certain performance goals and/or continued employment with the Company through a specified vesting period. However, in the event these awards have a performance-based goal, the restriction period will be at least one year, and in the event these awards have a time-based restriction, the restriction period will be at least three years, but vesting can occur incrementally over the three-year period. In the Compensation and Stock Plan Committee's sole discretion and subject to the participant's compliance with the procedures established by the Compensation and Stock Plan Committee and requirements of Section 409A of the Code, it may permit a participant to make an advance election to receive a portion of his or her future cash compensation otherwise due in the form of a restricted stock unit award.
Restricted Stock Units
. The Compensation and Stock Plan Committee may grant shares (at no cost or for a purchase price determined by the Committee) that are free from any restrictions under the Equity Plan. Unrestricted stock may be issued to participants in recognition of past services or other valid consideration, and may be issued in lieu of cash compensation to be paid to such individuals.
Unrestricted Stock
. Participants in the Equity Plan are responsible for the payment of any federal, state or local taxes that the Company is required by law to withhold upon any option exercise or vesting of other awards. Subject to approval by the Compensation and Stock Plan Committee, participants may elect to have the minimum tax withholding obligations satisfied either by authorizing the Company to withhold shares to be issued pursuant to an option exercise or other award, or by transferring to the Company shares having a value equal to the amount of such taxes.
Tax Withholding
. The Equity Plan provides that in the event of a sale event (as defined in the Equity Plan) resulting in a change in control of the Company, all stock options and stock appreciation rights will automatically become fully exercisable and conditions and restrictions relating solely to the passage of time and continued employment on all other awards will automatically be deemed waived, except as the Committee may otherwise provide in the relevant award agreement. Awards with conditions and restrictions relating to the attainment of performance goals may become vested and non-forfeitable in connection with a change in control in the Committee's discretion. In addition, in the event of a sale event in which the Company's stockholders will receive cash consideration, the Company may make or provide for a cash payment to participants holding options and stock appreciation rights equal to the difference between the per share cash consideration and the exercise price of the options or stock appreciation rights.
Change in Control Provisions
. The Board of Directors may at any time amend or discontinue the Equity Plan and the Compensation and Stock Plan Committee may at any time amend or cancel any outstanding award for the purpose of satisfying changes in the law or for any other lawful purpose. However, no such action may adversely affect any rights under any outstanding award without the holder's consent. Any amendments that materially change the terms of the Equity Plan, including any amendments that increase the number of shares reserved for issuance under the Equity Plan, expand the types of awards available, materially expand the eligibility to participate in, or materially extend the term of, the Equity Plan, or materially change the method of determining the fair market value of the Company's common stock, will be subject to approval by stockholders. Amendments shall also be subject to approval by the
Amendments and Termination
Company's stockholders if and to the extent determined by the Compensation and Stock Plan Committee to be required by the Code to preserve the qualified status of incentive options or to ensure that compensation earned under the Equity Plan qualifies as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code. In addition, except in connection with a reorganization or other similar change in the capital stock of the Company or a merger or other transaction, the Compensation and Stock Plan Committee may not reduce the exercise price of an outstanding stock option or stock appreciation right or effect repricing of an outstanding stock option or stock appreciation right through cancellation or regrants.

Neither the Board nor the Committee, nor any member of either or any delegate thereof, shall be liable for any act, omission, interpretation, construction or determination made in good faith in connection with the Plan, and the members of the Board and the Committee (and any delegate thereof) shall be entitled in all cases to indemnification and reimbursement by the Company in respect of any claim, loss, damage or expense (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees) arising or resulting therefrom to the fullest extent permitted by law and/or under any directors' and officers' liability insurance coverage which may be in effect from time to time and/or any indemnification agreement between such individual and the Company.
Indemnification
 
(a) . The maximum number of shares of Stock reserved and available for issuance under the Plan shall be equal to the sum of (i) 721,275 shares (which equals the number of shares of Stock that remain available for grants under the Company's Stock Option Plan, the Company's 1999 Performance Stock Option Plan and the Company's 1999 Super-Performance Stock Option Plan as of March 10, 2006, (the Record Date for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders on April 12, 2006) plus (ii) the number of shares of Stock underlying any grants under the Company's Stock Option Plan that are forfeited, canceled or are terminated (other than by exercise) from March 10, 2006 through the Effective Date, plus (iii) the number of shares of Stock underlying any grants under the Company's Stock Option Plan that are forfeited, canceled or are terminated (other than by exercise) from and after the Effective Date. For purposes of this limitation, the shares of Stock underlying any Awards granted under this Plan that are forfeited, canceled or otherwise terminated (other than by exercise) shall be added back to the shares of Stock available for issuance under the Plan. Shares tendered or held back upon exercise of an Option or settlement of an Award to cover the exercise price or tax withholding shall not be available for future issuance under the Plan. In addition, upon exercise of Stock Appreciation Rights, the gross number of shares exercised shall be deducted from the total number of shares remaining available for issuance under the Plan. Subject to such overall limitations, shares of Stock may be issued up to such maximum number pursuant to any type or types of Award; provided, however, that Stock Options or Stock Appreciation Rights with respect to no more than 500,000 shares of Stock may be granted to any one individual grantee during any one calendar year period. In addition, no more than 250,000 shares of Stock may be issued pursuant to the Plan as Incentive Stock Options. The shares available for issuance under the Plan may be authorized but unissued shares of Stock or shares of Stock reacquired by the Company.
Stock Issuable
. Subject to Section 3(c) hereof, if, as a result of any reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or other similar change in the Company's capital stock, the outstanding shares of Stock are increased or decreased or are exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or other securities of the Company, or additional shares or new or different shares or other securities of the Company or other non-cash assets are distributed with respect to such shares of Stock or other securities, or, if, as a result of any merger or consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, the outstanding shares of Stock are converted into or exchanged for a different number or kind of securities of the Company or any successor entity (or a parent or subsidiary thereof), the Administrator shall make an appropriate or proportionate adjustment in (i) the maximum number of shares reserved for issuance under the Plan (ii) the number of Stock Options or Stock Appreciation Rights that can be granted to any one individual grantee and the maximum number of shares that may be granted under a Performance-based Award, (iii) the number and kind of shares or other securities subject to any then outstanding Awards under the Plan, (iv) the repurchase price, if any, per share subject to each outstanding Restricted Stock Award, and (vi) the price for each share subject to any then outstanding Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights under the Plan, without changing the aggregate exercise price (i.e., the exercise price multiplied by the number of Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights) as to which such Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights remain exercisable. The adjustment by the Administrator shall be final, binding and conclusive. No fractional shares of Stock shall be issued under the Plan resulting from any such adjustment, but the Administrator in its discretion may make a cash payment in lieu of fractional shares.
Changes in Stock
The Administrator may also adjust the number of shares subject to outstanding Awards and the exercise price and the terms of outstanding Awards to take into consideration material changes in accounting practices or principles, extraordinary dividends, acquisitions or dispositions of stock or property or any other event if it is determined by the Administrator that such adjustment is appropriate to avoid distortion in the operation of the Plan, provided that no such adjustment shall be made in the case of a Stock Option or Stock Appreciation Right, without the consent of the grantee, if it would constitute a modification, extension or renewal of the Option within the meaning of Section 424(h) of the Code.
(c) . In the case of and subject to the consummation of (i) the dissolution or liquidation of the Company, (ii) the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company on a consolidated basis to an unrelated person or entity, (iii) a merger, reorganization or consolidation in which the outstanding shares of Stock are converted into or exchanged for a different kind of securities of the successor entity and the holders of the Company's outstanding voting power immediately prior to such transaction do not own a majority of the outstanding voting power of the successor entity immediately upon completion of such transaction, or (iv) the sale of all of the Stock of the Company to an unrelated person or entity (in each case, a "Sale Event"), all Options and Stock Appreciation Rights that are not exercisable immediately prior to the effective time of the Sale Event shall become fully exercisable as of the effective time of the Sale Event and all other Awards shall become fully vested and nonforfeitable as of the effective time of the Sale Event, except as the Administrator may otherwise specify with respect to particular Awards in the relevant Award documentation, and Awards with conditions and restrictions relating to the attainment of performance goals may become vested and nonforfeitable in connection with a Sale Event in the Administrator's discretion. Upon the effective time of the Sale Event, the Plan and all outstanding Awards granted hereunder shall terminate, unless provision is made in connection with the Sale Event in the sole discretion of the parties thereto for the assumption or continuation of Awards theretofore granted by the successor entity, or the substitution of such Awards with new Awards of the successor entity or parent thereof, with appropriate adjustment as to the number and kind of shares and, if appropriate, the per share exercise prices, as such parties shall agree (after taking into account any acceleration hereunder). In the event of such termination, each grantee shall be permitted, within a specified period of time prior to the consummation of the Sale Event as determined by the Administrator, to exercise all outstanding Options and Stock Appreciation Rights held by such grantee, including those that will become exercisable upon the consummation of the Sale Event; provided, however, that the exercise of Options and Stock Appreciation Rights not exercisable prior to the Sale Event shall be subject to the consummation of the Sale Event. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 3(d), in the event of a Sale Event pursuant to which holders of the Stock of the Company will receive upon consummation thereof a cash payment for each share surrendered in the Sale Event, the Company shall have the right, but not the obligation, to make or provide for a cash payment to the grantees holding Options and Stock Appreciation Rights, in exchange for the cancellation thereof, in an amount equal to the difference between (A) the value as determined by the Administrator of the consideration payable per share of Stock pursuant to the Sale Event (the "Sale Price") times the number of shares of Stock subject to outstanding Options and Stock Appreciation Rights (to the extent then exercisable at prices not in excess of the Sale Price) and (B) the aggregate exercise price of all such outstanding Options and Stock Appreciation Rights.
Mergers and Other Transactions
(d) . The Administrator may grant Awards under the Plan in substitution for stock and stock based awards held by employees, directors or other key persons of another corporation in connection with the merger or consolidation of the employing corporation with the Company or a Subsidiary or the acquisition by the Company or a Subsidiary of property or stock of the employing corporation. The Administrator may direct that the substitute awards be granted on such terms and conditions as the Administrator considers appropriate in the circumstances. Any substitute Awards granted under the Plan shall not count against the share limitation set forth in Section 3(a).
Substitute Awards
 
Grantees under the Plan will be such officers and other employees, Non-Employee Directors and key persons (including consultants and prospective employees) of the Company and its Subsidiaries as are selected from time to time by the Administrator in its discretion.
 
(a) . Any Stock Option granted under the Plan shall be in such form as the Administrator may from time to time approve.
Grant of Stock Options
Stock Options granted under the Plan may be either Incentive Stock Options or Non-Qualified Stock Options. Incentive Stock Options may be granted only to employees of the Company or any Subsidiary that is a "subsidiary corporation" within the meaning of Section 424(f) of the Code. To the extent that any Option does not qualify as an Incentive Stock Option, it shall be deemed a Non-Qualified Stock Option. Stock Options granted pursuant to this Section 5 shall be subject to the following terms and conditions and shall contain such additional terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the terms of the Plan, as the Administrator shall deem desirable. If the Administrator so determines, Stock Options may be granted in lieu of cash compensation at the optionee's election, subject to such terms and conditions as the Administrator may establish.
(b) . The exercise price per share for the Stock covered by a Stock Option granted pursuant to this Section 5 shall be determined by the Administrator at the time of grant but shall not be less than 100 percent of the Fair Market Value on the date of grant. In the case of an Incentive Stock Option that is granted to a Ten Percent Owner, the option price of such Incentive Stock Option shall be not less than 110 percent of the Fair Market Value on the grant date.
Exercise Price
(c) . The term of each Stock Option shall be fixed by the Administrator, but no Stock Option shall be exercisable more than ten years after the date the Stock Option is granted. In the case of an Incentive Stock Option that is granted to a Ten Percent Owner, the term of such Stock Option shall be no more than five years from the date of grant.
Option Term
(d) . Stock Options shall become exercisable at such time or times, whether or not in installments, as shall be determined by the Administrator at or after the grant date. The Administrator may at any time accelerate the exercisability of all or any portion of any Stock Option. An optionee shall have the rights of a stockholder only as to shares acquired upon the exercise of a Stock Option and not as to unexercised Stock Options.
Exercisability; Rights of a Stockholder
(e) . Stock Options may be exercised in whole or in part, by giving written notice of exercise to the Company, specifying the number of shares to be purchased. Payment of the purchase price may be made by one or more of the following methods to the extent provided in the Option Award agreement:
Method of Exercise
(i) In cash, by certified or bank check or other instrument acceptable to the Administrator;
(ii) Through the delivery (or attestation to the ownership) of shares of Stock that have been purchased by the optionee on the open market or that are beneficially owned by the optionee and are not then subject to restrictions under any Company plan. Such surrendered shares shall be valued at Fair Market Value on the exercise date. To the extent required to avoid variable accounting treatment under FAS 123R or other applicable accounting rules, such surrendered shares shall have been owned by the optionee for at least six months; or
(iii) By the optionee delivering to the Company a properly executed exercise notice together with irrevocable instructions to a broker to promptly deliver to the Company cash or a check payable and acceptable to the Company for the purchase price; provided that in the event the optionee chooses to pay the purchase price as so provided, the optionee and the broker shall comply with such procedures and enter into such agreements of indemnity and other agreements as the Administrator shall prescribe as a condition of such payment procedure.
Payment instruments will be received subject to collection. The transfer to the optionee on the records of the Company or of the transfer agent of the shares of Stock to be purchased pursuant to the exercise of a Stock Option will be contingent upon receipt from the optionee (or a purchaser acting in his stead in accordance with the provisions of the Stock Option) by the Company of the full purchase price for such shares and the fulfillment of any other requirements contained in the Option Award agreement or applicable provisions of laws (including the satisfaction of any withholding taxes that the Company is obligated to withhold with respect to the optionee). In the event an optionee chooses to pay the purchase price by previously-owned shares of Stock through the attestation method, the number of shares of Stock transferred to the optionee upon the exercise of the Stock Option shall be net of the number of shares attested to.
(f) . To the extent required for "incentive stock option" treatment under Section 422 of the Code, the aggregate Fair Market Value (determined as of the time of grant) of the shares of Stock with respect to which Incentive Stock Options granted under this Plan and any other plan of the Company or its parent and subsidiary corporations become exercisable for the first time by an optionee during any calendar year shall not exceed $100,000. To the extent that any Stock Option exceeds this limit, it shall constitute a Non-Qualified Stock Option.
Annual Limit on Incentive Stock Options
 
(a) . A Stock Appreciation Right is an Award entitling the recipient to receive shares of Stock having a value equal to the excess of the Fair Market Value of the Stock on the date of exercise over the exercise price of the Stock Appreciation Right, which price shall not be less than 100 percent of the Fair Market Value of the Stock on the date of grant (or more than the option exercise price per share, if the Stock Appreciation Right was granted in tandem with a Stock Option) multiplied by the number of shares of Stock with respect to which the Stock Appreciation Right shall have been exercised.
Nature of Stock Appreciation Rights
(b) . Stock Appreciation Rights may be granted by the Administrator in tandem with, or independently of, any Stock Option granted pursuant to Section 5 of the Plan. In the case of a Stock Appreciation Right granted in tandem with a Non-Qualified Stock Option, such Stock Appreciation Right may be granted either at or after the time of the grant of such Option. In the case of a Stock Appreciation Right granted in tandem with an Incentive Stock Option, such Stock Appreciation Right may be granted only at the time of the grant of the Option.
Grant and Exercise of Stock Appreciation Rights
A Stock Appreciation Right or applicable portion thereof granted in tandem with a Stock Option shall terminate and no longer be exercisable upon the termination or exercise of the related Option.
(c) . Stock Appreciation Rights shall be subject to such terms and conditions as shall be determined from time to time by the Administrator, subject to the following:
Terms and Conditions of Stock Appreciation Rights
(i) Stock Appreciation Rights granted in tandem with Options shall be exercisable at such time or times and to the extent that the related Stock Options shall be exercisable.
(ii) Upon exercise of a Stock Appreciation Right, the applicable portion of any related Option shall be surrendered.
 
(a) . A Restricted Stock Award is an Award entitling the recipient to acquire, at such purchase price (which may be zero) as determined by the Administrator, shares of Stock subject to such restrictions and conditions as the Administrator may determine at the time of grant ("Restricted Stock"). Conditions may be based on continuing employment (or other service relationship) and/or achievement of pre-established performance goals and objectives. The grant of a Restricted Stock Award is contingent on the grantee executing the Restricted Stock Award agreement. The terms and conditions of each such agreement shall be determined by the Administrator, and such terms and conditions may differ among individual Awards and grantees.
Nature of Restricted Stock Awards
(b) . Upon execution of a written instrument setting forth the Restricted Stock Award and payment of any applicable purchase price, a grantee shall have the rights of a stockholder with respect to the voting of the Restricted Stock, subject to such conditions contained in the written instrument evidencing the Restricted Stock Award. Unless the Administrator shall otherwise determine, (i) uncertificated Restricted Stock shall be accompanied by a notation on the records of the Company or the transfer agent to the effect that they are subject to forfeiture until such Restricted Stock are vested as provided in Section 7(d) below, and (ii) certificated Restricted Stock shall remain in the possession of the Company until such Restricted Stock is vested as provided in Section 7(d) below, and the grantee shall be required, as a condition of the grant, to deliver to the Company such instruments of transfer as the Administrator may prescribe.
Rights as a Stockholder
(c) . Restricted Stock may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise encumbered or disposed of except as specifically provided herein or in the Restricted Stock Award agreement. Except as may otherwise be provided by the Administrator either in the Award agreement or, subject to Section 15 below, in writing after the Award agreement is issued, if any, if a grantee's employment (or other service relationship) with the Company and its Subsidiaries terminates for any reason, any Restricted Stock that has not vested at the time of termination shall automatically and without any requirement of notice to such grantee from or other action by or on behalf of, the Company be deemed to have been reacquired by the Company at its original purchase price from such grantee or such grantee's legal representative simultaneously with such termination of employment (or other service relationship), and thereafter shall cease to represent any ownership of the Company by the grantee or rights of the grantee as a stockholder. Following such deemed reacquisition of unvested Restricted Stock that are represented by physical certificates, a grantee shall surrender such certificates to the Company upon request without consideration.
Restrictions
(d) . The Administrator at the time of grant shall specify the date or dates and/or the attainment of pre-established performance goals, objectives and other conditions on which the non-transferability of the Restricted Stock and the Company's right of repurchase or forfeiture shall lapse. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any such Restricted Stock shall have a performance-based goal, the restriction period with respect to such shares shall not be less than one year, and in the event any such Restricted Stock shall have a time-based restriction, the total restriction period with respect to such shares shall not be less than three years; provided, however, that Restricted Stock with a time-based restriction may become vested incrementally over such three-year period. Subsequent to such date or dates and/or the attainment of such pre-established performance goals, objectives and other conditions, the shares on which all restrictions have lapsed shall no longer be Restricted Stock and shall be deemed "vested." Except as may otherwise be provided by the Administrator either in the Award agreement or, subject to Section 15 below, in writing after the Award agreement is issued, a grantee's rights in any shares of Restricted Stock that have not vested shall automatically terminate upon the grantee's termination of employment (or other service relationship) with the Company and its Subsidiaries and such shares shall be subject to the provisions of Section 7(c) above.
Vesting of Restricted Stock
(a) . A Deferred Stock Award is an Award of phantom stock units to a grantee, subject to restrictions and conditions as the Administrator may determine at the time of grant. Conditions may be based on continuing employment (or other service relationship) and/or achievement of pre-established performance goals and objectives. The grant of a Deferred Stock Award is contingent on the grantee executing the Deferred Stock Award agreement. The terms and conditions of each such agreement shall be determined by the Administrator, and such terms and conditions may differ among individual Awards and grantees. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any such Deferred Stock Award shall have a performance-based goal, the restriction period with respect to such award shall not be less than one year, and in the event any such Deferred Stock Award shall have a time-based restriction, the total restriction period with respect to such award shall not be less than three years; provided, however, that any Deferred Stock Award with a time-based restriction may become vested incrementally over such three-year period. At the end of the deferral period, the Deferred Stock Award, to the extent vested, shall be paid to the grantee in the form of shares of Stock.
Nature of Deferred Stock Awards
(b) . The Administrator may, in its sole discretion, permit a grantee to elect to receive a portion of future cash compensation otherwise due to such grantee in the form of a Deferred Stock Award. Any such election shall be made in writing and shall be delivered to the Company no later than the date specified by the Administrator and in accordance with Section 409A and such other rules and procedures established by the Administrator. The Administrator shall have the sole right to determine whether and under what circumstances to permit such elections and to impose such limitations and other terms and conditions thereon as the Administrator deems appropriate. Any such deferred compensation shall be converted to a fixed number of phantom stock units based on the Fair Market Value of Stock on the date the compensation would otherwise have been paid to the grantee but for the deferral.
Election to Receive Deferred Stock Awards in Lieu of Compensation
(c) . During the deferral period, a grantee shall have no rights as a stockholder; provided, however, that the grantee may be credited with Dividend Equivalent Rights with respect to the phantom stock units underlying his Deferred Stock Award, subject to such terms and conditions as the Administrator may determine.
Rights as a Stockholder
(d) . Except as may otherwise be provided by the Administrator either in the Award agreement or, subject to Section 15 below, in writing after the Award agreement is issued, a grantee's right in all Deferred Stock Awards that have not vested shall automatically terminate upon the grantee's termination of employment (or cessation of service relationship) with the Company and its Subsidiaries for any reason.
Termination
 
. The Administrator may, in its sole discretion, grant (or sell at par value or such higher purchase price determined by the Administrator) an Unrestricted Stock Award to any grantee pursuant to which such grantee may receive shares of Stock free of any restrictions ("Unrestricted Stock") under the Plan. Unrestricted Stock Awards may be granted in respect of past services or other valid consideration, or in lieu of cash compensation due to such grantee.
Grant or Sale of Unrestricted Stock
 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if any Restricted Stock Award or Deferred Stock Award granted to a Covered Employee is intended to qualify as "Performance-based Compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder (a "Performance-based Award"), such Award shall comply with the provisions set forth below:
(a) . The performance criteria used in performance goals governing Performance-based Awards granted to Covered Employees may include any or all of the following objectives, described as such objectives relate to Company-wide objectives or of the subsidiary, division, department or function with the Company or subsidiary in which the Covered Employee is employed: (i) market value; (ii) book value; (iii) earnings per share; (iv) market share; (v) operating profit; (vi) net income; (vii) cash flow; (viii) return on capital; (ix) return on assets; (x) return on equity; (xi) margins; (xii) shareholder return; (xiii) sales or product volume growth; (xiv) productivity improvement; (xv) costs or expenses; (xvi) net debt reduction; (xvii) earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization; (xviii) unit volume; (xix) net sales; (xx) balance sheet measurements; (xxi) selling, general and administrative expense; or (xxii) revenue.
Performance Criteria
(b) . With respect to each Performance-based Award granted to a Covered Employee, the Committee shall select, within the first 90 days of a Performance Cycle (or, if shorter, within the maximum period allowed under Section 162(m) of the Code) the performance criteria for such grant, and the achievement targets with respect to each performance criterion (including a threshold level of performance below which no amount will become payable with respect to such Award). Each Performance-based Award will specify the amount payable, or the formula for determining the amount payable, upon achievement of the various applicable performance targets. The performance criteria established by the Committee may be (but need not be) different for each Performance Cycle and different goals may be applicable to Performance-based Awards to different Covered Employees.
Grant of Performance-based Awards
(c) . Following the completion of a Performance Cycle, the Committee shall meet to review and certify in writing whether, and to what extent, the performance criteria for the Performance Cycle have been achieved and, if so, to also calculate and certify in writing the amount of the Performance-based Awards earned for the Performance Cycle. The Committee shall then determine the actual size of each Covered Employee's Performance-based Award, and, in doing so, may reduce or eliminate the amount of the Performance-based Award for a Covered Employee if, in its sole judgment, such reduction or elimination is appropriate.
Payment of Performance-based Awards
(d) . The maximum performance-based award payable to any one Covered Employee under the Plan for a performance cycle is 500,000 shares (subject to adjustment as provided in Section 3(b) hereof).
Maximum Award Payable
 
(a) . Except as provided in Section 11(b) below, during a grantee's lifetime, his or her Awards shall be exercisable only by the grantee, or by the grantee's legal representative or guardian in the event of the grantee's incapacity. No Awards shall be sold, assigned, transferred or otherwise encumbered or disposed of by a grantee other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. No Awards shall be subject, in whole or in part, to attachment, execution, or levy of any kind, and any purported transfer in violation hereof shall be null and void.
Transferability
(b) . Notwithstanding Section 11(a), the Administrator, in its discretion, may provide either in the Award agreement regarding a given Award or by subsequent written approval that the grantee (who is an employee or director) may transfer his or her Awards (other than any Incentive Stock Options) to his or her immediate family members, to trusts for the benefit of such family members, or to partnerships in which such family members are the only partners, provided that the transferee agrees in writing with the Company to be bound by all of the terms and conditions of this Plan and the applicable Award.
Committee Action
(c) . For purposes of Section 11(b), "family member" shall mean a grantee's child, stepchild, grandchild, parent, stepparent, grandparent, spouse, former spouse, sibling, niece, nephew, mother-in-law, father-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law, or sister-in-law, including adoptive relationships, any person sharing the grantee's household (other than a tenant of the grantee), a trust in which these persons (or the grantee) have more than 50 percent of the beneficial interest, a foundation in which these persons (or the grantee) control the management of assets, and any other entity in which these persons (or the grantee) own more than 50 percent of the voting interests.
Family Member
(d) . Each grantee to whom an Award has been made under the Plan may designate a beneficiary or beneficiaries to exercise any Award or receive any payment under any Award payable on or after the grantee's death. Any such designation shall be on a form provided for that purpose by the Administrator and shall not be effective until received by the Administrator. If no beneficiary has been designated by a deceased grantee, or if the designated beneficiaries have predeceased the grantee, the beneficiary shall be the grantee's estate.
Designation of Beneficiary
 
(a) . Each grantee shall, no later than the date as of which the value of an Award or of any Stock or other amounts received thereunder first becomes includable in the gross income of the grantee for Federal income tax purposes, pay to the Company, or make arrangements satisfactory to the Administrator regarding payment of, any Federal, state, or local taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld by the Company with respect to such income. The Company and its Subsidiaries shall, to the extent permitted by law, have the right to deduct any such taxes from any payment of any kind otherwise due to the grantee. The Company's obligation to deliver evidence of book entry (or stock certificates) to any grantee is subject to and conditioned on tax withholding obligations being satisfied by the grantee.
Payment by Grantee
(b) . Subject to approval by the Administrator, a grantee may elect to have the Company's minimum required tax withholding obligation satisfied, in whole or in part, by (i) authorizing the Company to withhold from shares of Stock to be issued pursuant to any Award a number of shares with an aggregate Fair Market Value (as of the date the withholding is effected) that would satisfy the withholding amount due, or (ii) transferring to the Company shares of Stock owned by the grantee with an aggregate Fair Market Value (as of the date the withholding is effected) that would satisfy the withholding amount due.
Payment in Stock
 
In the event any Stock Option or Stock Appreciation Right under the Plan is granted with an exercise price of less than 100 percent of the Fair Market Value on the date of grant (regardless of whether or not such exercise price is intentionally or unintentionally priced at less than Fair Market Value), or such grant is materially modified and deemed a new grant at a time when the Fair Market Value exceeds the exercise price, or any other Award is otherwise determined to constitute "nonqualified deferred compensation" within the meaning of Section 409A (a "409A Award"), the following additional conditions shall apply and shall supersede any contrary provisions of this Plan or the terms of any agreement relating to such 409A Award.
(a) . Except as provided in Section 13(b) hereof, no 409A Award shall be exercisable or distributable earlier than upon one of the following:

Unforeseeable Emergency
(vi) . The occurrence of a Change in Control Event (within the meaning of Section 13(c)(i) hereof), including the Company's discretionary exercise of the right to accelerate vesting of such grant upon a Change in Control Event or to terminate the Plan or any 409A Award granted hereunder within 12 months of the Change in Control Event.
Change in Control Event
(b) . A 409A Award may not be accelerated or exercised prior to the time specified in Section 13(a) hereof, except in the case of one of the following events:
No Acceleration
(i) . The 409A Award may permit the acceleration of the exercise or distribution time or schedule to an individual other than the grantee as may be necessary to comply with the terms of a domestic relations order (as defined in Section 414(p)(1)(B) of the Code).
Domestic Relations Order
(ii) . The 409A Award may permit the acceleration of the exercise or distribution time or schedule as may be necessary to comply with the terms of a certificate of divestiture (as defined in Section 1043(b)(2) of the Code).
Conflicts of Interest
(iii) . The Administrator may exercise the discretionary right to accelerate the vesting of such 409A Award upon a Change in Control Event or to terminate the Plan or any 409A Award granted thereunder within 12 months of the Change in Control Event and cancel the 409A Award for compensation.
Change in Control Event
(c) . Solely for purposes of this Section 13 and not for other purposes of the Plan, the following terms shall be defined as set forth below:
Definitions
(i) "Change in Control Event" means the occurrence of a change in the ownership of the Company, a change in effective control of the Company, or a change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the Company (as defined in Section 1.409A-3(g) of the proposed regulations promulgated under Section 409A by the Department of the Treasury on September 29, 2005 or any subsequent guidance).
(ii) "Disabled" means a grantee who (i) is unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months, or (ii) is, by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months, receiving income replacement benefits for a period of not less than three months under an accident and health plan covering employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries.
(iii) "Unforeseeable Emergency" means a severe financial hardship to the grantee resulting from an illness or accident of the grantee, the grantee's spouse, or a dependent (as defined in Section 152(a) of the Code) of the grantee, loss of the grantee's property due to casualty, or similar extraordinary and unforeseeable circumstances arising as a result of events beyond the control of the grantee.
 
For purposes of the Plan, the following events shall not be deemed a termination of employment:
(a) a transfer to the employment of the Company from a Subsidiary or from the Company to a Subsidiary, or from one Subsidiary to another; or
(b) an approved leave of absence for military service or sickness, or for any other purpose approved by the Company, if the employee's right to re-employment is guaranteed either by a statute or by contract or under the policy pursuant to which the leave of absence was granted or if the Administrator otherwise so provides in writing.
 
The Board may, at any time, amend or discontinue the Plan and the Administrator may, at any time, amend or cancel any outstanding Award for the purpose of satisfying changes in law or for any other lawful purpose, but no such action shall adversely affect rights under any outstanding Award without the holder's consent. Except as provided in Section 3(b) or 3(c), in no event may the Administrator exercise its discretion to reduce the exercise price of outstanding Stock Options or Stock Appreciation Rights or effect repricing through cancellation and re-grants. Any material Plan amendments (other than amendments that curtail the scope of the Plan), including any Plan amendments that (i) increase the number of shares reserved for issuance under the Plan, (ii) expand the type of Awards available under, materially expand the eligibility to participate in, or materially extend the term of, the Plan, or (iii) materially change the method of determining Fair Market Value, shall be subject to approval by the Company stockholders entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders. In addition, to the extent determined by the Administrator to be required by the Code to ensure that Incentive Stock Options granted under the Plan are qualified under Section 422 of the Code or to ensure that compensation earned under Awards qualifies as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code, Plan amendments shall be subject to approval by the Company stockholders entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders. Nothing in this Section 15 shall limit the Administrator's authority to take any action permitted pursuant to Section 3(d).
 
With respect to the portion of any Award that has not been exercised and any payments in cash, Stock or other consideration not received by a grantee, a grantee shall have no rights greater than those of a general creditor of the Company unless the Administrator shall otherwise expressly determine in connection with any Award or Awards. In its sole discretion, the Administrator may authorize the creation of trusts or other arrangements to meet the Company's obligations to deliver Stock or make payments with respect to Awards hereunder, provided that the existence of such trusts or other arrangements is consistent with the foregoing sentence.
 
(a) . The Administrator may require each person acquiring Stock pursuant to an Award to represent to and agree with the Company in writing that such person is acquiring the shares without a view to distribution thereof. No shares of Stock shall be issued pursuant to an Award until all applicable securities law and other legal and stock exchange or similar requirements have been satisfied. The Administrator may require the placing of such stop-orders and restrictive legends on certificates for Stock and Awards as it deems appropriate.
No Distribution; Compliance with Legal Requirements
(b) . Stock certificates to grantees under this Plan shall be deemed delivered for all purposes when the Company or a stock transfer agent of the Company shall have mailed such certificates in the United States mail, addressed to the grantee, at the grantee's last known address on file with the Company. Uncertificated Stock shall be deemed delivered for all purposes when the Company or a Stock transfer agent of the Company shall have given to the grantee by electronic mail (with proof of receipt) or by United States mail, addressed to the grantee, at the grantee's last known address on file with the Company, notice of issuance and recorded the issuance in its records (which may include electronic "book entry" records).
Delivery of Stock Certificates
(c) . Nothing contained in this Plan shall prevent the Board from adopting other or additional compensation arrangements, including trusts, and such arrangements may be either generally applicable or applicable only in specific cases. The adoption of this Plan and the grant of Awards do not confer upon any employee any right to continued employment with the Company or any Subsidiary.
Other Compensation Arrangements; No Employment Rights
(d) . Option exercises and other Awards under the Plan shall be subject to such Company's insider trading policy and procedures, as in effect from time to time.
Trading Policy Restrictions
(e) If the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance of the Company, as a result of misconduct, with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, then any grantee who is one of the individuals subject to automatic forfeiture under Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 shall reimburse the Company for the amount of any Award received by such individual under the Plan during the 12-month period following the first public issuance or filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, as the case may be, of the financial document embodying such financial reporting requirement.
Forfeiture of Awards under Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
 
This Plan shall become effective upon approval by the holders of a majority of the votes cast at a meeting of stockholders at which a quorum is present. No grants of Stock Options and other Awards may be made hereunder after the tenth (10
th
) anniversary of the Effective Date and no grants of Incentive Stock Options may be made hereunder after the tenth (10
th
) anniversary of the date the Plan is approved by the Board.
 
This Plan and all Awards and actions taken thereunder shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, applied without regard to conflict of law principles.

liability or by having the Company withhold from the number of shares of Stock otherwise issuable pursuant to the exercise of the SAR a number of shares with a Fair Market Value equal to such withholding liability.

Section 1  Registrant's Business and Operations
 
Common Stock Purchase Agreement
On April 28, 2006, AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. (the "Company") entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the "Stock Purchase Agreement") with Joseph B. Caldwell, Floyd E. Cotham, Jr., Joseph E. Hawkins, James C. Merritt, Ruth M. Merritt and Mark E. Smith (collectively, the "Selling Stockholders"), to purchase from them an aggregate of 1,852,000 shares of the Company's common stock issued in connection with the acquisition of The MHA Group, Inc. and subsidiaries ("MHA"). Certain of the Selling Stockholders are officers of MHA. The share purchase price will be the volume weighted average sales price of the common stock on the New York Stock Exchange for the 20 consecutive trading days immediately preceding the closing date. The Stock Purchase Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and certain closing conditions, such as the Company having received at least $45 million of debt financing and requisite lender approval under its credit facility. For a period of nine months following the closing date, subject to certain exceptions, the Selling Stockholders may not sell or otherwise dispose of any shares of our common stock or enter into similar derivative transactions with respect to our common stock. The shares of common stock being purchased were registered for resale on a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-132371) (the "Form S-3"). The closing is expected to occur on or about May 15, 2006. Following the closing, in accordance with the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Company will deregister 334,785 shares of the remaining common stock owned by the Selling Stockholders included under the Form S-3. After the deregistration, there will be 85,355 shares of common stock registered for resale under the Form S-3 owned by stockholders other than the Selling Stockholders. The foregoing description of the Stock Purchase Agreement is a summary only and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Stock Purchase Agreement, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 99.1 hereto.
First Amendment to Second Amended And Restated Credit Agreement
On May 1, 2006, the Company entered into a First Amendment dated May 1, 2006 to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated November 2, 2005 (the "First Amendment") by and among the Company, AMN Healthcare, Inc., as borrower (the "Borrower"), certain subsidiaries of the Borrower from time to time party thereto as guarantors, the several lenders from time to time party thereto as lenders (the "Lenders") and Bank of America, N.A. as administrative agent for the Lenders. The First Amendment amends the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement"), and provides that the Borrower may request, on a one-time basis and subject to meeting certain conditions, an additional term loan in an amount not to exceed $45 million, subject to obtaining commitments from its existing lenders or other eligible lenders in the amount of such requested increase. The First Amendment also resets the applicable interest rate for the term loans based upon our then current leverage ratio, permits the repurchase of up to $45 million of our capital stock (subject to certain conditions), amends certain covenants requiring us to obtain interest rate hedging agreements for at least 50% of the term loans to allow additional time for compliance and amends certain financial covenants that require the Borrower to maintain a maximum Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) to loosen such requirements in the event the Borrower incurs not less than $30 million of additional term loans from the Lenders.
The foregoing description of the First Amendment is a summary only and does not contain all of the exceptions and qualifications that may apply and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the First Amendment, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 99.2 hereto.
The Lenders and their affiliates have provided, and may in the future provide, various investment banking, commercial banking and other financial services for us for which services they have received, and may in the future receive, customary fees.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF
 

Exhibit 99.3
 
SAN DIEGO  (May 1, 2006)  AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. (NYSE: AHS), the nation's largest healthcare staffing company, today reported financial results for the first quarter of 2006, with revenue of $254.3 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.24, which included a $0.03 benefit from a workers' compensation insurance reserve reduction. First quarter revenue increased 15% as compared to the $221.4 million reported for the fourth quarter of 2005 and 62% as compared to the $156.8 million reported for the first quarter of 2005. The increase in revenue and net income in the first quarter of 2006 as compared to last quarter and the same quarter of last year was primarily attributable to a full quarter's contribution from The MHA Group, Inc. ("MHA"), which was acquired on November 2, 2005, and improved pricing in the nurse and allied healthcare staffing segment. First quarter 2006 diluted earnings per share included a $0.02 charge for stock compensation expense related to the Company's adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 123R ("FAS 123R") on January 1, 2006 and a $0.01 charge for imputed interest expense related to the company's acquisition of MHA.
"We are pleased to report solid first quarter results, which exceeded our guidance range issued last quarter," said Susan R. Nowakowski, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Our physician staffing segment continued to grow at a rapid pace and our nurse and allied staffing segment continued to experience positive trends of strong client demand and higher bill rates," added Nowakowski.
Gross profit for the first quarter of 2006 was $68.3 million, representing a 26.9% gross margin, up from the $57.8 million, or 26.1% gross margin, reported in the fourth quarter of 2005, and the $35.7 million, or 22.8% gross margin, reported in the first quarter of 2005. The increases
 
were due largely to growth in the company's higher margin physician staffing segment and margin improvement due to pricing increases in the nurse and allied healthcare staffing segment. Additionally, the company's first quarter gross margin was higher by 50 basis points due to a $1.4 million benefit to cost of sales from a workers' compensation insurance reserve reduction due to favorable historical claims experience. The company's physician staffing segment generated a gross margin of 31.6% in the first quarter of 2006 while the nurse and allied staffing segment generated a gross margin of 24.8% during the same period.
Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses for the first quarter of 2006 were $46.5 million, as compared to $39.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2005, and $26.2 million in the first quarter of 2005, with the increases mainly due to the inclusion of a full quarter's SG&A expense from MHA. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue for the first quarter of 2006 were 18.3%, as compared to 17.7% for the fourth quarter of 2005, and 16.7% for the first quarter of 2005.
Income from operations was $17.9 million for the first quarter of 2006, as compared to $16.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2005 and $8.4 million for the first quarter of 2005. Income from operations margin for the first quarter of 2006 was 7.1%, as compared to 7.5% for the fourth quarter of 2005 and 5.3% for the first quarter of 2005. The decrease in income from operations margin from last quarter was primarily due to the addition of $1.4 million in stock compensation expense upon the company's adoption of FAS 123R at the beginning of the year.
First quarter 2006 net interest expense was $4.1 million, as compared to $4.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 and $1.8 million in the first quarter of 2005. The decrease from last quarter was mainly due to the $1.2 million write-off of deferred financing costs associated with the company's acquisition of MHA in the prior quarter, partially offset by additional interest expense during the first quarter of 2006 due to the inclusion of a full quarter's interest expense on the acquisition debt. The increase in net interest expense as compared to the same quarter last year was primarily due to the company's $205.0 million term loan used to fund the acquisition of MHA and to repay prior debt, as well as $0.7 million in imputed interest expense also related to the acquisition.
 
The company generated $18.0 million in cash flow from operations during the first quarter of 2006 which in addition to cash on hand, was used to fund payment of the cash portion of the $47.3 million contingent purchase price related to the company's prior acquisition of MHA. Total debt outstanding at March 31, 2006 was $205.0 million. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding during the first quarter of 2006 were 34.7 million.
Share Repurcahse
The company also announced today that it expects to repurchase approximately 1.8 million shares of its common stock held by former shareholders of MHA for an estimated $35 million in cash. The transaction is expected to close on May 15, 2006 and is contingent upon an amendment of AMN's existing credit agreement to allow, among other things, additional borrowing capacity through a new term loan to fund the repurchase. Upon completion of the transaction, 0.4 million shares will remain from the original issuance of 3.0 million shares to the former shareholders of MHA, of which 0.3 million of those shares will be subject to a nine-month lockup period.
"We believe that this stock repurchase is a good means to enhance shareholder value as we expect that the repurchase will become accretive to AMN's earnings per share beginning in 2007," said Nowakowski.
After completion of the stock repurchase, the company's total debt is expected to increase to approximately $240 million.
Revenue and Earnings Guidance for Second Quarter and Full Year 2006
Revenue for the second quarter of 2006 is expected to range from $254 million to $258 million and diluted earnings per share is expected to range from $0.18 to $0.20, which includes an estimated charge of $0.03 for stock compensation expense related to the adoption of FAS 123R. Excluding FAS 123R, second quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to range from $0.21 to $0.23.
Management reaffirmed its full year revenue guidance previously issued on March 8, 2006, with revenue expected to range from $1.025 billion to $1.050 billion. However, based on
 
year to date results, management increased its full year diluted earnings per share guidance to range from $0.78 to $0.82. This updated range reflects the $0.03 benefit from this quarter's workers' compensation insurance reserve reduction offset by a $0.02 increase in the company's estimated annual stock compensation expense, which was revised to $0.12 from the previous full year estimate of $0.10. Full year 2006 diluted earnings per share excluding the $0.12 estimated stock compensation expense and the $0.02 imputed interest expense related to the company's acquisition of MHA is expected to range from $0.92 to $0.96.
"Our estimated second quarter revenue reflects continued strong demand throughout all of our business lines, with the most significant growth coming from our physician staffing segment," said Nowakowski. "We intend to continue making selective investments in marketing and recruiting to enhance the attraction of new nurses as well as increase the placement conversion of current nurse supply," added Nowakowski.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
Date: August 7, 2006

Exhibit 99.1
 
SAN DIEGO  (August 7, 2006)  AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. (NYSE: AHS), the nation's largest healthcare staffing company, today reported financial results for the second quarter of 2006, with revenue of $261.2 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.21. Second quarter revenue increased 3% from the $254.3 million reported for the first quarter of this year and 63% from the $160.7 million reported for the second quarter of last year. The sequential quarterly increase in revenue reflected growth across all of the company's business lines as well as one additional day in the second quarter. The increase in revenue compared to the same quarter last year was due primarily to the company's acquisition of The MHA Group, Inc. ("MHA") in November 2005 and growth in the company's nurse and allied healthcare staffing business.
Diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of 2006 of $0.21 compared to $0.24 reported for the first quarter. The decrease was due to a benefit from a workers' compensation insurance reserve reduction recorded in the first quarter, as well as increased SG&A expenses in the second quarter. Also contributing to the sequential decrease in diluted earnings per share was a $0.04 charge for stock compensation expense recognized in the second quarter in connection with the Company's adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 123R ("FAS 123R") on January 1, 2006, compared to a $0.02 charge for stock compensation expense in the first quarter. Partially offsetting the sequential quarterly decrease in diluted earnings per share was a $0.02 tax benefit recorded in the second quarter of 2006 for an adjustment to deferred income taxes.
"We are very pleased with both the sequential and year-over-year growth of our business," said Susan R. Nowakowski, President and Chief Executive Officer. "We continue to benefit from our leading market position and a continued strength in demand for quality healthcare professionals. All of our business lines are performing well, and we are particularly encouraged by the increase in new nurse candidates who are applying with our brands," added Nowakowski.
Gross profit for the second quarter of 2006 was $70.0 million, representing a 26.8% gross margin, up from the $68.3 million, or 26.9% gross margin, reported in the first quarter of 2006, and the $37.2 million, or 23.1% gross margin, reported in the second quarter of 2005. The increase in second quarter gross profit compared to the prior quarter was due largely to growth in the company's physician staffing businesses. The increase in gross profit compared to the same quarter last year was due primarily to the company's acquisition of MHA. Second quarter gross margins by business line were 24.5% for nurse and allied healthcare staffing, 26.5% for locum tenens staffing and 61.2% for physician permanent placement services.
Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses for the second quarter of 2006 were $52.4 million, including stock compensation expense of $1.8 million resulting from our adoption of FAS 123R, as compared to $47.9 million last quarter and $26.7 million in the second quarter last year. The increase in SG&A expenses in the second quarter as compared to the first quarter of this year was due mainly to focused spending on marketing and recruiting initiatives aimed at expanding nurse supply and placements along with increased spending to support growth in the physician staffing businesses. The increase in SG&A expenses compared to the same quarter last year reflected mainly the addition of MHA. As a percentage of revenue, SG&A expenses excluding stock compensation expense were 19.4%, for the second quarter, compared to 18.3% for last quarter and 16.6% for the same quarter last year.
Income from operations was $15.1 million for the second quarter of 2006, compared to $17.9 million for the first quarter of 2006 and $9.0 million for the second quarter of 2005. Income from operations margin for the second quarter of 2006 was 5.8%, compared to 7.1% for the first quarter of 2006 and 5.6% for the second quarter of 2005.
 
Net interest expense for the second quarter of this year was $4.3 million, compared to $4.1 million in the first quarter and $1.7 million in the second quarter of 2005. The increase in net interest expense from last quarter was attributable to additional interest expense from increased debt used to fund the repurchase of approximately 1.9 million shares of the company's common stock on May 15, 2006. The increase in net interest expense compared to the same quarter last year was primarily attributable to interest expense from additional debt used to fund the company's acquisition of MHA.
AMN Healthcare generated $24.1 million in cash flow from operations during the second quarter of 2006 which, in addition to cash on hand and borrowings, was used to repurchase $37.5 million of the company's common stock in May of this year and pay down debt. Total debt outstanding at June 30, 2006 was $209.6 million. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the second quarter of 2006 were 34.2 million.
Revenue and Earnings Guidance for Third Quarter and Full Year 2006
Revenue for the third quarter of 2006 is expected to range from $275 million to $278 million and diluted earnings per share is expected to range from $0.21 to $0.23, which includes an estimated charge of $0.03 for stock compensation expense related to the adoption of FAS 123R.
Based on strong year to date results and better visibility into the second half of 2006, management increased its guidance for full year revenue and diluted earnings per share previously issued in May of this year. Management expects full year 2006 revenue to range from $1.060 billion to $1.070 billion and full year diluted earnings per share to range from $0.86 to $0.89, which includes an estimated charge of $0.12 for stock compensation expense. Excluding stock compensation expense, full year 2006 adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to range from $0.98 to $1.01.
"Our estimates for the remainder of the year reflect continued strength in demand as well as an improving candidate supply environment in our nurse staffing business. We believe that the strategic investments in marketing and recruiting we initiated at the beginning of the year are beginning to bear results and create positive momentum," said Nowakowski. "Our team
 
members are doing an outstanding job of delivering competitively superior service to our providers and healthcare facility clients every day," added Nowakowski.

Date: November 1, 2006

Exhibit 99.1
 
SAN DIEGO  (November 1, 2006)  AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. (NYSE: AHS), the nation's largest healthcare staffing company, today reported financial results for the third quarter of 2006, with revenue of $282.7 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.28. Third quarter revenue increased 8% from the $261.2 million reported for the second quarter of this year and 69% from the $166.9 million reported for the third quarter of last year. The sequential quarterly increase in revenue was driven primarily by growth in the company's nurse and allied healthcare staffing business and one additional day in the third quarter.
Diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2006 was $0.28, compared to $0.21 last quarter and $0.22 for the third quarter of 2005. The increase compared to last quarter is primarily due to higher revenue and gross profit partially offset by increased selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") and income tax expenses. The increase in revenue and diluted earnings per share compared to the same quarter last year were both due to a combination of the company's acquisition of The MHA Group, Inc. ("MHA") in November 2005 and organic growth in the company's nurse and allied healthcare staffing business.
"We are very pleased with our solid third quarter results, which reflect a continued favorable market environment and excellent performance by our team members across all of our business lines," said Susan R. Nowakowski, President and Chief Executive Officer. "We were most encouraged by the increase in traveler count in the nurse and allied healthcare staffing business, which grew by 7% from last quarter to 7,015, the highest volume level in the last 13 quarters. This growth represents the steady demand for our healthcare staffing services as well as
the success of our focused investments to expand our new candidate supply of nurse and allied healthcare professionals," added Nowakowski.
Gross profit for the third quarter of 2006 was $76.7 million, representing a 27.1% gross margin, up from the $70.0 million, or 26.8% gross margin, reported in the second quarter of 2006, and the $39.5 million, or 23.7% gross margin, reported in the third quarter of 2005. The increase in gross margin compared to last quarter was due largely to lower health insurance claims in the nurse and allied healthcare staffing business. The increase in gross margin compared to the same quarter last year was primarily attributable to an increase in bill rates in the company's nurse and allied healthcare staffing business as well as the addition of the higher gross margin physician staffing businesses gained through the acquisition of MHA. Third quarter gross margins by business line were 25.4% for nurse and allied healthcare staffing, 26.2% for locum tenens staffing and 60.7% for physician permanent placement services.
SG&A expenses for the third quarter of 2006 were $54.1 million, including stock compensation expense of $1.9 million resulting from the adoption of FAS 123R, as compared to $52.4 million in the second quarter of 2006 and $25.2 million in the third quarter last year. The increase in SG&A expenses as compared to last quarter was due mainly to higher employee expenses to support growth in the nurse and allied healthcare and locum tenens staffing businesses. The increase in SG&A expenses compared to the same quarter last year reflected the addition of MHA, increased employee expenses to support growth in the nurse and allied healthcare staffing business and stock compensation expense resulting from the adoption of FAS 123R. As a percentage of revenue, SG&A expenses excluding stock compensation expense were 18.5% for the third quarter (or 19.1% including stock compensation expense), compared to 19.4% last quarter (or 20.0% including stock compensation expense) and 15.1% for the same quarter last year with or without stock compensation expense.
Income from operations for the third quarter of 2006 was $20.0 million, representing 7.1% of revenue, compared to $15.1 million, or 5.8% of revenue, reported in the second quarter of 2006, and $12.9 million, or 7.7% of revenue, reported in the third quarter of 2005. The increase in operating margin compared to last quarter was due primarily to lower SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue. The decrease in operating margin as compared to the same quarter last year was mainly due to reporting stock compensation expense from the adoption of FAS 123R.
Net interest expense for the third quarter of this year was $4.2 million, compared to $4.3 million last quarter and $1.5 million in the third quarter of 2005. The increase in net interest expense over the same quarter last year was primarily attributable to interest expense from additional debt used to fund the company's acquisition of MHA.
The company generated approximately $3.8 million in cash flow from operations and paid down $10.6 million in debt during the third quarter of 2006. Total debt outstanding at September 30, 2006 was $199.0 million. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the third quarter of 2006 were 34.0 million.
Revenue and Earnings Guidance for Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2006
Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2006 is expected to range from $278 million to $281 million and diluted earnings per share is expected to range from $0.21 to $0.23, which includes an estimated charge of $0.03 for stock compensation expense related to the company's adoption of FAS 123R.
Based on strong results in the third quarter of 2006, management increased its guidance for full year revenue and diluted earnings per share previously issued in August of this year. Management expects full year 2006 revenue to range from $1.07 billion to $1.08 billion and full year diluted earnings per share to range from $0.94 to $0.96, which includes an estimated charge of $0.12 for stock compensation expense.
"Our increased revenue and earnings guidance for the full year 2006 reflect mainly our higher than expected third quarter results," said Nowakowski. "For the fourth quarter, we expect some moderation in revenue and earnings compared to the third quarter mainly due to normal year-end seasonality in our temporary healthcare staffing businesses. However, on a year over year basis we anticipate solid revenue growth from all of our business lines as well as continued improvement in the candidate supply environment due to the strategic investments in marketing and recruiting we began earlier this year," added Nowakowski.

On March 1, 2007, we reported our fourth quarter 2006 results. Our fourth quarter 2006 results are discussed in detail in the press release which is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.
The information in this Item 2.02 and Exhibit 99.1 attached hereto shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, nor shall they be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, except to the extent as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
 
(d) Exhibits
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
SAN DIEGO  (March 1, 2007)  AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. (NYSE: AHS), the nation's largest healthcare staffing company, today reported revenue of $283.5 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.29 for the fourth quarter of 2006. Revenue for the fourth quarter increased slightly from the $282.7 million reported for the third quarter of 2006 and 28% from the $221.4 million reported for the fourth quarter of 2005. Fourth quarter 2006 diluted earnings per share of $0.29 included a benefit of $0.05 due to favorable adjustments to the professional liability insurance reserve, and compared to $0.28 reported for the third quarter of 2006 and $0.21 reported for the fourth quarter of 2005.
Full year 2006 revenue increased 53% to a record $1.08 billion from $705.8 million reported in 2005. Diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $1.02, including favorable adjustments aggregating to approximately $0.10 per diluted share. In addition to the insurance reserve adjustments during the fourth quarter of 2006, a favorable workers compensation insurance reserve adjustment of $0.03 and a favorable deferred state income tax adjustment of $0.02 were recorded earlier in the year.
"We are pleased that we were able to exceed our goal of being the first company in the healthcare staffing industry to reach $1 billion in revenue," said Susan R. Nowakowski, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Achievement of this goal is a milestone for AMN, as well as the industry, and reflects our market leadership in the healthcare staffing industry and the value our clients place on the services we provide. All of our business lines performed well in 2006, and we were particularly encouraged by the success of our marketing and recruiting efforts to increase our network of available healthcare professionals," added Nowakowski.
Gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2006 was $74.3 million, representing a 26.2% gross margin. This was down from the $76.7 million, or 27.1% gross margin, reported for the third quarter of 2006, and up from the $57.8 million, or 26.1% gross margin, reported for the fourth quarter of 2005. The decrease in gross margin as compared to the third quarter of 2006 was due in part to higher housing costs and health insurance claims in the nurse and allied healthcare staffing business during the fourth quarter of 2006. Gross margins by business segment for the fourth quarter of 2006 were 23.5% for nurse and allied healthcare staffing, 26.7% for locum tenens staffing and 63.9% for physician permanent placement services.
Selling, general, and administrative ("SG&A") expenses for the fourth quarter of 2006 were $51.2 million, including stock compensation expense of $1.8 million resulting from the adoption of FAS 123R, as compared to $54.1 million for the third quarter of 2006 and $39.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2005. The decrease in SG&A expenses as compared to the third quarter of 2006 was due mainly to favorable adjustments to the professional liability insurance reserve of $2.9 million, primarily relating to the locum tenens staffing segment. The increase in SG&A expenses compared to the fourth quarter of 2005 resulted primarily from the addition of The MHA Group Inc., which was acquired in November 2005, increased employee expenses to support growth in the nurse and allied healthcare staffing segment, and stock compensation expense resulting from the adoption of FAS 123R. As a percentage of revenue, SG&A expenses were 18.1% for the fourth quarter, as compared to 19.1% for the prior quarter and 17.7% for the fourth quarter of 2005.
Income from operations for the fourth quarter of 2006 was $20.4 million, representing 7.2% of revenue, compared to $20.0 million, or 7.1% of revenue, reported in the third quarter of 2006, and $16.5 million, or 7.5% of revenue, reported in the fourth quarter of 2005. The slight increase in operating margin compared to third quarter of 2006 was due primarily to lower SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue in the fourth quarter, partially offset by a lower gross margin.
 
Net interest expense for the fourth quarter of 2006 was $4.0 million, compared to $4.2 million in the third quarter of 2006 and $4.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2005. The decrease in net interest expense from the prior quarter and the same quarter in 2005 was mainly due to the company's continued aggressive debt reduction using excess cash flow.
The company generated $8.6 million in cash flow from operations during the fourth quarter of 2006 which, in addition to $8.8 million in cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options and cash on-hand, was used to reduce debt by $25.7 million. For the full year 2006, the company generated $54.5 million in operating cash flow, as compared to $44.1 million in 2005. Total debt outstanding at December 31, 2006 was $173.4 million, yielding a leverage ratio below 2.0. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the fourth quarter of 2006 were 35.1 million.
Revenue and Earnings Guidance for First Quarter and Full Year 2007
Management expects revenue for the first quarter of 2007 to range from $282 million to $284 million and diluted earnings per share to range from $0.21 to $0.23, which reflects the impact of two fewer billing days in the quarter as compared to the fourth quarter of 2006. Revenue for the full year 2007 is expected to range from $1.18 billion to $1.20 billion and diluted earnings per share is expected to range from $1.10 to $1.14.
"We believe the current market conditions provide opportunity for growth in all of our business segments," said Nowakowski. "Our 2007 guidance reflects a healthy balance of volume growth and increases in our revenue per healthcare professional working. This combined with our continued focus on operational efficiency, innovations in marketing and recruitment, and superior client service should provide a solid foundation for continued future growth," added Nowakowski.

The following factors could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those implied by the forward-looking statements in this press release: the company's ability to continue to recruit qualified temporary and permanent healthcare professionals at reasonable costs; the company's ability to retain qualified temporary healthcare professionals for multiple assignments at reasonable costs; the company's ability to attract and retain sales and operational personnel; the company's ability to enter into contracts with hospitals, healthcare facility clients, affiliated healthcare networks and physician practice groups on terms attractive to the company and to secure orders related to those contracts; the company's ability to demonstrate the value of its services to its healthcare and facility clients; changes in the
 
timing of hospital, healthcare facility and physician practice group clients' orders for temporary healthcare professionals; the general level of patient occupancy at hospital and healthcare facility clients' facilities; the overall level of demand for services offered by temporary and permanent healthcare staffing providers; the ability of hospital, healthcare facility and physician practice group clients to retain and increase the productivity of their permanent staff; the variation in pricing of the healthcare facility contracts under which the company places temporary healthcare professionals; the company's ability to successfully implement its strategic growth, acquisition and integration strategies; the company's ability to leverage its cost structure; access to and undisrupted performance of the company's management information and communication systems; the effect of existing or future government legislation and regulation; the company's ability to grow and operate its business in compliance with legislation and regulations; the challenge to the classification of certain of the company's healthcare professionals as independent contractors; the impact of medical malpractice and other claims asserted against the company; the impact on the company's earnings related to share-based payment awards due to changes in accounting rules; the disruption or adverse impact to the company's business as a result of a terrorist attack; the company's ability to carry out its business strategy and maintain sufficient cash flow and capital structure to support its business; the loss of key officers and management personnel that could adversely affect the company's ability to remain competitive; the effect of recognition by the company of an impairment to goodwill; and the effect of adjustments by the company to accruals for self-insured retentions. Other factors that could cause actual results to differ from those implied by the forward-looking statements contained in this press release are set forth in the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005, its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, its Current Reports on Form 8-K, and Registration Statement on Form S-3. These statements reflect the company's current beliefs and are based upon information currently available to it. Be advised that developments subsequent to this press release are likely to cause these statements to become outdated with the passage of time. The company does not intend, however, to update the guidance provided today prior to its next earnings release.

Section 5 - Corporate Governance and Management
 
Stockholder Approval of AMN Healthcare Equity Plan:
On April 18, 2007, the stockholders of AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. (the "Company") approved the AMN Healthcare Equity Plan, as amended and restated ("Equity Plan"), which had previously been approved by the Company's Board of Directors, subject to stockholder approval. Certain of the Company's stockholders are also directors and executive officers. The following is a summary description of certain features of the Equity Plan. The summary is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the Equity Plan that is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
. The Compensation and Stock Plan Committee has full power to select, from among the individuals eligible for awards, the individuals to whom awards will be granted, to make any combination of awards to participants, and to determine the specific terms and conditions of each award, subject to the provisions of the Equity Plan. The Compensation and Stock Plan Committee may delegate to the CEO of the Company the authority to grant awards at fair market value to employees who are not subject to the reporting and other provisions of Section 16 of the Exchange Act.
Plan Administration
. Persons eligible to participate in the Equity Plan will be those officers, employees, non-employee directors and other key persons (including consultants and prospective employees) of the Company and its subsidiaries as selected from time to time by the Compensation and Stock Plan Committee. Approximately 120 individuals are currently eligible to participate in the Equity Plan.
Eligibility and Limitations on Grants
The maximum award of stock options or stock appreciation rights granted to any one individual will not exceed 500,000 shares (subject to adjustment for stock splits and similar events) for any calendar year period. If any award of restricted stock or restricted stock units granted to an individual is intended to qualify as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code, then the maximum award shall not exceed 500,000 shares (subject to adjustment for stock splits and similar events) to any one such individual in any performance cycle.
. The Equity Plan permits the granting of (1) stock options intended to qualify as incentive stock options under Section 422 of the Code and (2) stock options that do not so qualify. Options granted under the Equity Plan will be non-qualified options if they fail to qualify as incentive options or exceed the annual limit on incentive stock options. Non-qualified options may be granted to any persons eligible to receive incentive options and to non-employee directors and key persons. The option exercise price of each option will be determined by the Compensation and Stock Plan Committee but may not be less than 100% of the fair market value of the Common Stock on the date of grant. The maximum number of shares that can be granted in the form of incentive stock options cannot exceed 250,000 shares.
Stock Options
The term of each option will be fixed by the Compensation and Stock Plan Committee and may not exceed ten years from the date of grant. The Compensation and Stock Plan Committee will determine at what time or times each option may be exercised. Options may be made exercisable in installments and the exercisability of options may be accelerated by the Compensation and Stock Plan Committee. Options may be exercised in whole or in part with written notice to the Company.
Upon exercise of options, the option exercise price must be paid in full either in cash, by certified or bank check or other instrument acceptable to the Compensation and Stock Plan Committee, or by delivery (or attestation to the ownership) of shares that are beneficially owned by the optionee. Subject to applicable law, the exercise price may also be delivered to the Company by a broker pursuant to irrevocable instructions to the broker from the optionee.
To qualify as incentive options, options must meet additional federal tax requirements, including a $100,000 limit on the value of shares subject to incentive options that first become exercisable by a participant in any one calendar year.
. The Compensation and Stock Plan Committee may award a stock appreciation right either as a freestanding award or in tandem with a stock option. The Compensation and Stock Plan Committee may award stock appreciation rights subject to such conditions and restrictions as the Compensation and Stock Plan Committee may determine, provided that (1) upon exercise of a stock appreciation right granted in tandem with an option, the applicable portion of any related option shall be surrendered and (2) stock appreciation rights granted in tandem with options are exercisable at such time or times and to the extent that the related stock options are exercisable.
Stock Appreciation Rights
. The Compensation and Stock Plan Committee may award shares to participants subject to such conditions and restrictions as the Compensation and Stock Plan Committee may determine. These conditions and restrictions may include the achievement of certain performance goals (as summarized above) and/or continued employment with the Company through a specified restricted period. However, in the event these awards have a performance-based goal, the restriction period will be at least one year, and in the event these awards have a time-based restriction, the restriction period will be at least three years, but vesting can occur incrementally over the three-year period.
Restricted Stock
. The Compensation and Stock Plan Committee may award restricted stock units as deferred stock awards to participants. Restricted stock units are ultimately payable in the form of shares and may be subject to such conditions and restrictions as the Compensation and Stock Plan Committee may determine. These conditions and restrictions may include the achievement of certain performance goals (as summarized above) and/or continued employment with the Company through a specified vesting period. However, in the event these awards have a performance-based goal, the restriction period will be at least one year, and in the event these awards have a time-based restriction, the restriction period will be at least three years, but vesting can occur incrementally over the three-year period. In the Compensation and Stock Plan Committee's sole discretion and subject to the participant's compliance with the procedures established by the Compensation and Stock Plan Committee and requirements of Section 409A of the Code, it may permit a participant to make an advance election to receive a portion of his or her future cash compensation otherwise due in the form of a restricted stock unit award.
Restricted Stock Units
. The Compensation and Stock Plan Committee may grant shares (at no cost or for a purchase price determined by the Committee) that are free from any restrictions under the Equity Plan. Unrestricted stock may be issued to participants in recognition of past services or other valid consideration, and may be issued in lieu of cash compensation to be paid to such individuals.
Unrestricted Stock
. The grant of any full value award, i.e. an award other than an option or a stock appreciation right, shall be deemed for purposes of determining the number of shares available for issuance as an Award of 1.85 shares of stock for each such share actually subject to the award. The grant of an option or a stock appreciation right shall be deemed, for purposes of determining the number of shares available for issuance, as an award of one share of stock for each such share actually subject to the award.
Effect of Awards
. Participants in the Equity Plan are responsible for the payment of any federal, state or local taxes that the Company is required by law to withhold upon any option exercise or vesting of other awards. Subject to approval by the Compensation and Stock Plan Committee, participants may elect to have the minimum tax withholding obligations satisfied either by authorizing the Company to withhold shares to be issued pursuant to an option exercise or other award, or by transferring to the Company shares having a value equal to the amount of such taxes.
Tax Withholding
. The Equity Plan provides that in the event of a sale event (as defined in the Equity Plan) resulting in a change in control of the Company, all stock options and stock appreciation rights will automatically become fully exercisable and conditions and restrictions relating solely to the passage of time and continued employment on all other awards will automatically be deemed waived, except as the Committee may otherwise provide in the relevant award agreement. Awards with conditions and restrictions relating to the attainment of performance goals may become vested and non-forfeitable in connection with a change in control in the Committee's discretion. In addition, in the event of a sale event in which the Company's stockholders will receive cash consideration, the Company may make or provide for a cash payment to participants holding options and stock appreciation rights equal to the difference between the per share cash consideration and the exercise price of the options or stock appreciation rights.
Change in Control Provisions
. The Board of Directors may at any time amend or discontinue the Equity Plan and the Compensation and Stock Plan Committee may at any time amend or cancel any outstanding award for the purpose of satisfying changes in the law or for any other lawful purpose. However, no such action may adversely affect any rights under any outstanding award without the holder's consent. Any amendments that materially change the terms of the Equity Plan, including any amendments that increase the number of shares reserved for issuance under the Equity Plan, expand the types of awards available, materially expand the eligibility to participate in, or materially extend the term of, the Equity Plan, or materially change the method of determining the fair market value of the Company's common stock, will be subject to approval by stockholders. Amendments shall also be subject to approval by the Company's stockholders if and to the extent determined by the Compensation and Stock Plan Committee to be required by the Code to preserve the qualified status of incentive options or to ensure that compensation earned under the Equity Plan qualifies as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code. In addition, except in connection with a reorganization or other similar change in the capital stock of the Company or a merger or other transaction, the Compensation and Stock Plan Committee may not reduce the exercise price of an outstanding stock option or stock appreciation right or effect repricing of an outstanding stock option or stock appreciation right through cancellation or regrants.
Amendments and Termination
Effective Date of Equity Plan
The Equity Plan become effective on April 12, 2006, and was amended to increase the number of authorized shares, among other things, with stockholder approval, on April 18, 2007. Awards of incentive options may be granted under the Equity Plan until February 27, 2016. No other awards may be granted under the Equity Plan after the date that is 10 years from April 12, 2006.
Tax Aspects Under the Code
The following is a summary of the principal federal income tax consequences of certain transactions under the Equity Plan. It does not describe all federal tax consequences under the Equity Plan, nor does it describe state or local tax consequences.
. No taxable income is generally realized by the optionee upon the grant or exercise of an incentive option. If shares issued to an optionee pursuant to the exercise of an incentive option are sold or transferred after two years from the date of grant and after one year from the date of exercise, then (1) upon sale of such shares, any amount realized in excess of the option price (the amount paid for the shares) will be taxed to the optionee as a long-term capital gain, and any loss sustained will be a long-term capital loss, and (2) there will be no deduction for the Company for federal income tax purposes. The exercise of an incentive option will give rise to an item of tax preference that may result in alternative minimum tax liability for the optionee.
Incentive Options
If shares acquired upon the exercise of an incentive option are disposed of prior to the expiration of the two-year and one-year holding periods described above (a "disqualifying disposition"), generally (a) the optionee will realize ordinary income in the year of disposition in an amount equal to the excess (if any) of the fair market value of the shares at exercise (or, if less, the amount realized on a sale of such shares ) over the option price thereof, and (b) the Company will be entitled to deduct such amount. Special rules will apply where all or a portion of the exercise price of the incentive option is paid by tendering shares.
If an incentive option is exercised at a time when it no longer qualifies for the tax treatment described above (e.g., if the holding periods described above are not satisfied), the option is treated as a non-qualified option. In addition, an incentive option will not be eligible for the tax treatment described above if it is exercised more than three months following termination of employment (or one year in the case of termination of employment by reason of disability). In the case of termination of employment by reason of death, the three-month rule does not apply.
. No income is realized by the optionee at the time the option is granted. Generally (i) at exercise, ordinary income is realized by the optionee in an amount equal to the difference between the option price and the fair market value of the shares on the date of exercise, and the Company receives a tax deduction for the same amount, and (ii) at disposition, appreciation or depreciation after the date of exercise is treated as either short-term or long-term capital gain or loss depending on how long the shares have been held. Special rules will apply where all or a portion of the exercise price of the non-qualified option is paid by tendering shares. Upon exercise, the optionee will also be subject to Social Security taxes on the excess of the fair market value over the exercise price of the option.
Non-Qualified Options
Restricted Stock
Restricted stock is not taxable to a recipient at the time of grant, but instead is included in ordinary income (at its then fair market value) when the restrictions lapse. A recipient may elect, however, to recognize income at the time of grant, in which case the fair market value of the restricted shares at the time of grant is included in ordinary income and there is no further income recognition when the restrictions lapse. The Company is entitled to a tax deduction in an amount equal to the ordinary income recognized by the recipient.
A recipient's tax basis for restricted shares will be equal to the amount of ordinary income recognized by the recipient. The recipient will recognize capital gain (or loss) on a sale of the restricted stock if the sale price exceeds (or is lower than) such basis. The holding period for restricted shares for purposes of characterizing gain or loss on the sale of any shares as long- or short-term commences at the time the recipient recognizes ordinary income pursuant to an award.
Parachute Payments
The vesting of any portion of an option or other award that is accelerated due to the occurrence of a change in control may cause a portion of the payments with respect to such accelerated awards to be treated as "parachute payments" as defined in the Code. Any such parachute payments may be non-deductible to the Company, in whole or in part, and may subject the recipient to a non-deductible 20% federal excise tax on all or a portion of such payment (in addition to other taxes ordinarily payable).
Limitation on the Company's Deductions
As a result of Section 162(m) of the Code, the Company's deduction for certain awards under the Equity Plan may be limited to the extent that the Chief Executive Officer or other executive officer whose compensation is required to be reported in the summary compensation table receives compensation in excess of $1 million a year (other than performance-based compensation that otherwise meets the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code). The Equity Plan is structured to allow grants to qualify as performance-based compensation.

SAN DIEGO  (April 30, 2007)  AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. (NYSE: AHS), the nation's largest healthcare staffing company, today reported revenue of $283.9 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.23 for the first quarter of 2007. Revenue for the first quarter increased 12% from the $254.3 million reported for the first quarter of 2006 and was up slightly from the $283.5 million reported for the fourth quarter of 2006. First quarter 2007 diluted earnings per share included the impact of two fewer calendar days in the quarter compared to prior quarter, and compared to $0.24 reported for the first quarter of 2006 and $0.29 reported for the fourth quarter of 2006.
"Overall we were pleased with our results, which came in at the upper end of our expectations for revenue and EPS," said Susan R. Nowakowski, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Revenue growth compared to last year was driven by a healthy mix of increases in both volume and revenue per healthcare professional working. Demand was strong in all service segments, and we continued to see growth in our supply of new candidates. While we are facing some direct cost pressures, our team has been able to effectively manage our overall expense structure to deliver on our profitability targets," added Nowakowski.
Gross profit for the first quarter of 2007 was $72.5 million, representing a 25.5% gross margin, compared to $68.3 million, or 26.9% gross margin, reported for the first quarter of 2006, and $74.3 million, or 26.2% gross margin, reported for the fourth quarter of 2006. The gross margin declined on a year over year basis due to higher housing and health insurance claims in the nurse and allied healthcare staffing segment and a shift in the mix of physician specialties in
the locum tenens segment. In addition to these factors, gross margin declined on a sequential basis due to slightly higher wages for healthcare professionals along with a higher mix of lower margin government staffing business in the locum tenens staffing segment. Gross margins by business segment for the first quarter of 2007 were 23.3% for nurse and allied healthcare staffing, 25.2% for locum tenens staffing and 63.2% for physician permanent placement services.
Selling, general, and administrative ("SG&A") expenses for the first quarter of 2007 were $53.1 million, as compared to $47.9 million for the first quarter of 2006 and $51.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2006. The increase in SG&A expenses compared to the prior year first quarter resulted primarily from higher employee and office expenses, which were in part due to recruitment-related investments to drive growth in all segments. The sequential increase in SG&A expenses were mainly a result of the favorable $2.9 million in adjustments to the professional liability insurance reserve recorded last quarter. As a percentage of revenue, SG&A expenses were 18.7% for the first quarter of 2007, 18.8% for the first quarter of 2006, and 18.1% for the fourth quarter of 2006.
Income from operations for the first quarter of 2007 was $16.8 million, representing 5.9% of revenue, as compared to $17.9 million, or 7.1% of revenue, reported in the first quarter of 2006, and $20.4 million, or 7.2% of revenue, reported in the fourth quarter of 2006. The decrease in operating margin as compared to the first and fourth quarters of 2006 was due primarily to a lower gross margin this quarter and relatively higher SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue, as compared to the fourth quarter of 2006.
Net interest expense for the first quarter of 2007 was $3.3 million, as compared to $4.1 million in the first quarter of 2006, and $4.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. The decrease in net interest expense compared to the same quarter last year was due to a combination of reduced debt and lower imputed interest expense related to the acquisition of The MHA Group, Inc. The decrease in net interest expense from the prior quarter was due mainly to a reduction in outstanding debt.
The company generated $20.0 million in cash flow from operations during the first quarter of 2007 which, in addition to cash on-hand, was used in part to reduce debt by $3.9 million. Total
debt outstanding at March 31, 2007 was $169.5 million, yielding a leverage ratio of 1.9 times. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the first quarter of 2007 were 35.3 million. During the quarter, the company implemented FASB Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48), with an immaterial impact to the balance sheet and no impact to the income statement.
Revenue and Earnings Guidance for Second Quarter and Full Year 2007
Management expects revenue for the second quarter of 2007 to range from $289 million to $291 million and diluted earnings per share to range from $0.23 to $0.25. Management reaffirms its full year guidance, with revenue expected to range from $1.18 billion to $1.20 billion and diluted earnings per share expected to range from $1.10 to $1.14.
"Our estimated second quarter revenue reflects continued solid demand in all of our business lines, resulting in revenue growth in all three service segments," said Nowakowski. "We expect gross margin improvement in the second quarter, and further improvements in the second half of the year. We will continue to manage SG&A so as to make investments needed to better serve our clients and continue driving strong revenue growth, while balancing the need to offset direct cost pressures where possible to achieve our full year earnings expectations," added Nowakowski.

the impact of medical malpractice and other claims asserted against the company; the impact on the company's earnings related to share-based payment awards due to changes in accounting rules; the disruption or adverse impact to the company's business as a result of a terrorist attack; the company's ability to carry out its business strategy and maintain sufficient cash flow and capital structure to support its business; the loss of key officers and management personnel that could adversely affect the company's ability to remain competitive; the effect of recognition by the company of an impairment to goodwill; and the effect of adjustments by the company to accruals for self-insured retentions. Other factors that could cause actual results to differ from those implied by the forward-looking statements contained in this earnings release are set forth in the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006, and its Current Reports on Form 8-K.

"We are pleased to report that second quarter revenue and EPS came in slightly above the upper end of our expectations," said Susan R. Nowakowski, President and Chief Executive Officer. "The company generated strong year over year revenue growth, with notable increases coming from our two largest segments of nurse and allied and locum tenens staffing. Although direct cost pressures continued to limit gross margin expansion, our teams did an excellent job of managing our operating expenses in order to achieve our overall earnings targets," added Nowakowski.
Gross profit for the second quarter of 2007 was $75.0 million, representing a 25.5% gross margin, as compared to $70.0 million, or 26.8% gross margin, for the second quarter of 2006 and $72.5 million, or 25.5% gross margin, for the first quarter of 2007. Gross margin declined on a year over year basis due mainly to higher housing and healthcare professional compensation costs. Gross margins by business segment for the second quarter of 2007 were 23.3% for nurse and allied healthcare staffing, 25.6% for locum tenens staffing and 60.0% for physician
permanent placement services. Based on current indicators, the company expects gross margins to improve in the third quarter for all business segments.
Selling, general, and administrative ("SG&A") expenses for the second quarter of 2007 were $53.5 million, or 18.2% of revenue, as compared to $52.4 million, or 20.0% of revenue, for the second quarter of 2006 and $53.1 million, or 18.7% of revenue, for the first quarter of 2007. The reduction in SG&A as a percentage of revenue in part reflects management's continued efforts to further leverage the company's infrastructure in order to increase operating margins.
Income from operations for the second quarter of 2007 was $18.6 million, or 6.3% of revenue, as compared to $15.1 million, or 5.8% of revenue, for the second quarter of 2006, and $16.8 million, or 5.9% of revenue, for the first quarter of 2007. The increase in operating margin on a year over year and sequential basis was due to lower SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue.
Net interest expense for the second quarter of 2007 was $3.1 million, compared to $4.3 million for the second quarter of 2006 and $3.3 million for the first quarter of 2007. The decrease in net interest expense from the same quarter last year and prior quarter was due primarily to a continued reduction in outstanding debt.
The company generated $16.3 million in cash flow from operations during the second quarter of 2007 which, in addition to cash on-hand, was used to reduce debt outstanding by $2.3 million and pay out $5.5 million of cash related to the acquisition of Rx Pro Health on May 21, 2007. Total debt outstanding at June 30, 2007 was $167.3 million, yielding a leverage ratio of 1.8 times. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the second quarter of 2007 were 35.3 million. Additionally, as previously announced, the Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program for up to 1.0 million shares of common stock which will commence during the third quarter of 2007.
Revenue and Earnings Guidance for Third Quarter and Full Year 2007
Management expects revenue for the third quarter of 2007 to range from $295 million to $297 million and diluted earnings per share to range from $0.27 to $0.29.
 
"Within our largest segment of nurse and allied staffing, we are projecting continued favorable pricing trends and growth in revenue per traveler per day for the second half of the year," said Nowakowski. "However, due to lower client demand and utilization of travel nurses in certain key markets during the summer months, we are not expecting the previously anticipated growth in traveler volume on a sequential basis for the third quarter. We believe the lower demand in these regions is being driven primarily by softness in hospital admissions. Also contributing is the continued limited availability of visas for foreign nurses. While we are obviously disappointed in the lack of volume growth at this time, we do believe that the fundamentals of our travel nursing business remain solid and that our supply continues to show healthy trends, which should benefit us as demand increases."
Nowakowski added, "We expect our locum tenens staffing and physician permanent placement segments to grow in line with our original expectations, driven mainly by continued strong demand, excellent recruitment efforts and moderate growth in revenue per day filled. Looking forward, we will continue to focus our efforts on expanding gross margins and controlling our SG&A spending in order to grow earnings."
Due to the lack of anticipated volume growth within the nurse and allied staffing segment in the third quarter, the Company is also updating its full year guidance with revenue expected to range from $1.16 billion to $1.17 billion and diluted earnings per share expected to range from $1.02 to $1.04. While visibility on third quarter performance is clearer than the fourth quarter, management believes it is prudent to cautiously adjust full-year guidance projections until there are more favorable growth trends in client demand within our nurse and allied staffing business.

Date: October 30, 2007

Exhibit 99.1
 
SAN DIEGO  (October 30, 2007)  AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. (NYSE: AHS), the nation's largest healthcare staffing company, today reported revenue of $300.3 million for the third quarter of 2007, an increase of 6% from the $282.7 million reported for the same quarter last year, and 2% higher than the $293.9 million in revenue reported last quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2007 of $0.29 increased 4% compared to last year, and 12% compared to last quarter.
"Our success in executing well on both our short-term initiatives and our long-term strategy has driven growth in each of our business segments," said Susan R. Nowakowski, President and Chief Executive Officer. "While all businesses performed well this quarter, our locum tenens Staff Care team delivered exceptional results, which contributed to AMN Healthcare surpassing our expectations and guidance for revenue," said Nowakowski. She also noted that gross margins improved significantly over the prior quarter because of initiatives put in place over the past several months.
Gross profit for the third quarter of 2007 was $79.7 million, representing a 26.6% gross margin, as compared to $76.7 million, or 27.1% gross margin, for the third quarter of 2006 and $75.0 million, or 25.5% gross margin, for the second quarter of 2007. The decline in gross margin on a year over year basis was due mainly to higher housing and health insurance costs in the nurse and allied segment. The increase in gross margin compared to last quarter was due primarily to a widening pay-to-bill spread in both the nurse and allied and locum tenens staffing segments. Gross margins by business segment for the third quarter of 2007 were 24.2% for nurse and allied healthcare staffing, 27.0% for locum tenens staffing and 60.2% for physician permanent placement services.
Selling, general, and administrative ("SG&A") expenses for the third quarter of 2007 were $55.8 million, or 18.6% of revenue, as compared to $54.1 million, or 19.1% of revenue, for the third quarter of 2006 and $53.5 million, or 18.2% of revenue, for the second quarter of 2007. The reduction in SG&A as a percentage of revenue compared to the prior year period in part reflects management's continued efforts to further leverage the company's infrastructure in order to increase operating margins.
Income from operations for the third quarter of 2007 was $21.0 million, or 7.0% of revenue, as compared to $20.0 million, or 7.1% of revenue, for the third quarter of 2006, and $18.6 million, or 6.3% of revenue, for the second quarter of 2007. The decrease in operating margin compared to the prior year period was due to lower gross margin partially offset by lower SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue. The increase in operating margin compared to last quarter was due mainly to higher gross margin.
Net interest expense for the third quarter of 2007 was $3.1 million, compared to $4.2 million for the third quarter of 2006 and $3.1 million for the second quarter of 2007. The decrease in net interest expense from the same quarter last year was due primarily to a continued reduction in outstanding debt.
Income tax expense as a percentage of pre-tax income for the third quarter of 2007 was 43.7%, compared to 40.1% for the third quarter of 2006 and 40.2% for the second quarter of 2007. The increase was due mainly to a $0.6 million adjustment to the company's income tax reserve which resulted in a $0.02 reduction to this quarter's diluted earnings per share.
The company generated $20.8 million in cash flow from operations during the third quarter of 2007 which, in addition to cash on-hand, was used to repurchase one million shares of the company's common stock in August of this year and pay down debt. Total debt outstanding at September 30, 2007 was $157.1 million, yielding a leverage ratio of 1.6 times. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the third quarter of 2007 were 34.7 million.
Revenue and Earnings Guidance for Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2007
Management expects revenue for the fourth quarter of 2007 to range from $286 million to $288 million and diluted earnings per share to range from $0.24 to $0.26. The moderate decrease in revenue and earnings expected during the fourth quarter is due to the normal year-end seasonal trends in our temporary healthcare staffing businesses. Management reaffirms its full year guidance, with revenue expected to range from $1.16 billion to $1.17 billion and diluted earnings per share expected to range from $1.02 to $1.04.
"As we enter the fourth year executing our diversified service strategy, resulting in nearly doubling both our revenue and earnings from three years ago, we are pleased with the evolution of this strategy and the increased strength of our leading market position. As the largest provider in what we believe are the most attractive segments of the healthcare staffing industry, and with more clients in more locations than any other company, we are well positioned for long-term growth." said Nowakowski. "Looking forward to 2008 and beyond, we believe that our proven ability to execute along with our willingness to remain attuned to market changes and agile in our approach will deliver growth in all of our segments," added Nowakowski.
Ms. Nowakowski added, "Last week, our corporate office in San Diego was closed for two days as a precautionary measure due to wildfires in the area. We are thankful to report that all of our team members are safe, and nearly everyone is back in their homes. While a short period of time, this was a real life test of our disaster recovery and business continuity plans, which I'm pleased to say, worked beautifully. During this time, our teams were able to continue to serve our healthcare professionals and client facilities with minimal sales or service interruption. This success, in the face of such environmental difficulty, is a testament to the incredible dedication and skill of the AMN team in San Diego and at our regional offices who quickly stepped up to execute AMN's business continuity plan and provide immediate and near seamless coverage."

Item 5.02.    Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
 
On February 6, 2008, our Board of Directors unanimously voted to increase the Board to eight members and to appoint Ms. Hala Moddelmog to fill the new directorship, effective February 7, 2008, until her successor is duly elected and qualified, or until she resigns, is removed, or becomes disqualified.
Ms. Moddelmog has been president and chief executive officer of the Susan G. Komen for the Cure since September 2006. Prior to that, she served as founder and CEO of Catalytic Ventures, a private equity firm that consulted and invested in the food service industry. From 1995 to 2004, she was the President of Church's Chicken, a division of AFC Enterprises. She also held executive management and marketing positions at Church's Chicken, Arby's Franchise Association and BellSouth.
As a new, non-employee director, Ms. Moddelmog received 940 restricted stock units (RSUs) and 809 stock appreciation rights (SARs), to p urchase shares of the Company's stock at an exercise price of $14.95, the fair market value, based on the average price on February 6, 2008; and will receive an annual retainer of $50,000. The press release announcing Ms. Moddelmog's appointment is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
Effective February 6, 2008, we entered into new severance agreements with Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer and Treasurer David C. Dreyer; President, Nurse Staffing Ralph Henderson; and Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary Denise L. Jackson; and an amendment to Chief Executive Officer and President Susan R. Nowakowski's employment agreement.
The severance agreements replace the executives' prior agreements and calculate the bonus component of each officer's severance payment based on the average of each officer's bonuses for the three most recent fiscal years ("average bonus"), rather than the termination year's target bonus; and enhance the severance payment to the officers in the event of an involuntary termination within one year of a "change in control" (as defined in the agreements) to two times the sum of the officer's annual salary, plus the average bonus.
Ms. Nowakowski's employment agreement was amended to calculate the bonus component of her severance payment based on the average bonus, rather than the termination year's target bonus as used in the original agreement, and to increase her salary and bonus in the event of a "change in control" from twice the target bonus to three times her salary and average bonus.

THIS SEVERANCE AGREEMENT (the "Agreement"), dated February ____, 2008, between AMN Healthcare, Inc. (the "Company") and ______________ ("Executive").
Employment at Will
.
The Company agrees to employ Executive and Executive hereby agrees to be employed by the Company upon such terms and conditions as are mutually agreed upon. Executive's employment with the Company shall be at the discretion of the Company. Executive hereby agrees and acknowledges that the Company may terminate Executive's employment at any time, for any reason, with or without cause, and without notice. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall (a) confer on Executive any right to continue in the employ of the Company, (b) constitute any contract or agreement ofemployment, or (c) interfere in any way with the at-will nature of Executive's employment with the Company.
2.
Severance Benefits
.
In the event that the Company terminates Executive's employment without "Cause" (as defined below), the Company agrees to pay to Executive severance payments in an amount equal to the sum of twelve (12) months base salary at the rate in effect on the date of the termination of Executive's employment (the "Termination Date"), plus the prorated portion of Executive's "Average Bonus" (an amount equal to the average of the performance bonus payments received by the Executive for the three most recent Fiscal Years (or such fewer number of fiscal years during which Executive was employed)), multiplied by the product of the number of days during the Performance Period that Executive was employed, divided by 365) ("Severance Benefits"). The Severance Benefits shall be payable in a lump sum on the first payroll date after the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 4 below. All withholding taxes and other deductions that the Compa ny is required by law to make from wage payments to employees will be made from such severance payments. If Executive's employment terminates as a result of death or disability, such termination shall not be considered a termination without "Cause" that will entitle Executive to any severance payment.
If Executive makes an election to continue Executive's coverage under the Company's group health plans pursuant to the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended ("COBRA"), during the period beginning on the Termination Date and ending on the earlier of (i) the twelve month anniversary of the Termination Date or (ii) the date upon which Executive becomes eligible for comparable coverage under another employer's group health plans, Executive shall continue to pay premiums with respect to such coverage to the same extent that Executive was paying such premiums immediately prior to such termination. Such period shall run concurrently with the period of Executive's rights under COBRA.
If the Company relocates Executive's position to a locale beyond a 50 mile radius from the Company's headquarters at 12400 High Bluff Drive, Suite 100, San Diego, California 92130, it shall be considered a termination of Executive without "Cause," entitling Executive to resign and receive the Severance Benefits.
Notwithstanding the following, in order to be eligible to receive the Severance Benefits under this subsection 2(c), (i) Executive shall provide notice to the Company no more than 90 days after the occurrence of such relocation, (ii) such notice states the grounds for such voluntary resignation and an effective date no earlier than 30 days after it is given, and (iii) the Company has 30 days from the giving of such notice within which to cure and, in the event of such cure, such notice shall be of no further force or effect.
In the event a termination without "Cause" occurs within one year after a "Change in Control," in lieu of the Severance Benefits payable under subsection 2(a) or (c), as the case may be, Executive shall be entitled to receive a lump sum equal to two (2) times the sum of Executive's twelve (12) months base salary at the rate in effect on the Termination Date plus the Average Bonus. Such amount shall be payable on the first payroll date after the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 4 below.
For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms are defined as follows:
"Cause" for termination of Executive shall mean (A) Executive's failure to perform in any material respect his or her duties as an employee of the Company, (B) violation of the Company's Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers and Principal Executive Officer, and/or Securities Trading Policy, (C) the engaging by Executive in willful misconduct or gross negligence which is injurious to the Company or any of its affiliates, monetarily or otherwise, (D) the commission by Executive of an act of fraud or embezzlement against the Company or any of its affiliates, or (E) the conviction of Executive of a crime which constitutes a felony or any lesser crime that involves Company property or a pleading of guilty or nolo contendere with respect to a crime which constitutes a felony or any lesser crime that involves Company property.
"Change in Control" shall be deemed to occur upon:
The acquisition by any individual, entity or group (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) or 14(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")) (a "Person") of beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of a majority of the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors;
the dissolution or liquidation of the Company;
the sale of all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Company; or
the consummation of a merger, consolidation or similar form of corporate transaction involving the Company that requires the approval of the Company's stockholders, whether for such transaction or the issuance of securities in the transaction (a "Business Combination"), if immediately following such Business Combination: (x) a Person is or becomes the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of a majority of the combined voting power of the outstanding voting securities eligible to elect directors of the Parent Corporation (or, if there is no Parent Corporation, the Surviving Corporation), or (y) the Company's shareholders cease to beneficially own, directly or indirectly, in substantially the same proportion as they owned the then outstanding voting securities immediately prior to the Business Combination, a majority of the combined voting power of the outstanding voting securities eligible to elect directors of the Parent Corporation (or, if there is no Parent Corporation, the Surviving Corporation). "Surviving Corporation" shall mean the corporation resulting from a Business Combination, and "Parent Corporation" shall mean the ultimate parent corporation that directly or indirectly has beneficial ownership of a majority of the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of the Surviving Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors.
3.
No Other Payments
.

Severance Benefits Conditioned Upon Release
.
Executive acknowledges and understands that Executive's eligibility for severance pay and other benefits hereunder is contingent upon Executive's execution and acceptance of the terms and conditions of, and the effectiveness of the Company's standard Covenant and General Release of All Claims (the "Release") as in effect on the Termination Date. The Company's standard Release may be modified from time to time in the Company's discretion as it deems appropriate. If Executive fails to execute a Release within twenty-one (21) days of receipt of such Release (or if Executive revokes such Release in a manner permitted by law or the applicable Release), then Executive shall not be entitled to any severance payments or other benefits to which Executive would otherwise be entitled under this Agreement.
.

If any such delayed cash payment is otherwise payable on an installment basis, the first payment shall include a catch-up payment covering amounts that would otherwise have been paid during the six-month period but for the application of this provi sion, and the balance of the installments shall be payable in accordance with their original schedule. The parties intend that this Agreement will be administered in accordance with Section 409A of the Code. The parties agree that this Agreement may be amended, as reasonably requested by either party, and as may be necessary to fully comply with Section 409A of the Code and all related rules and regulations in order to preserve the payments and benefits provided hereunder without additional cost to either party. The Company makes no representation or warranty and shall have no liability to Executive or any other person if any provisions of this Agreement are determined to constitute deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code but do not satisfy an exemption from, or the conditions of, such Section.

Additional Limitation
(a) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event that any compensation, payment or distribution by the Company to or for the benefit of Executive, whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise (the "Severance Payments"), would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, the following provisions shall apply:
(i) If the Severance Payments, reduced by the sum of (A) the Excise Tax and (B) the total of the Federal, state, and local income and employment taxes payable by Executive on the amount of the Severance Payments which are in excess of the Threshold Amount, are greater than or equal to the Threshold Amount, Executive shall be entitled to the full benefits payable under this Agreement.
(ii) If the Threshold Amount is less than (A) the Severance Payments, but greater than (B) the Severance Payments reduced by the sum of (1) the Excise Tax and (2) the total of the Federal, state, and local income and employment taxes on the amount of the Severance Payments which are in excess of the Threshold Amount, then the benefits payable under this Agreement shall be reduced (but not below zero) to the extent necessary so that the sum of all Severance Payments shall not exceed the Threshold Amount.

Dear Doug:
In 1985, Gayle and I started on a journey with an idea and a commitment to make a difference in the healthcare community.  Our idea was that we could help hospitals improve the quality of care to their patients by providing superior temporary healthcare professionals.  Our commitment led to the formation of a company that 23 years later has grown from two people to more than 2,000 employees around the world.
It is humbling to know that the company we founded is now the nation's largest source of quality nurses, physicians and allied health staff.  AMN Healthcare is widely recognized for contributing the quality of care throughout America.  Gayle and I are extremely proud of AMN Healthcare and very appreciative for the talents of the management and team members who have contributed to the success of the company.  Many of these employees joined AMN Healthcare 10, 15 and even 20 years ago and I know they are committed to continuing to help build a stronger company for the future.  
After 23 years of an evolving career as co-founder, president, chief executive officer, executive chairman and, today, chairman of AMN Healthcare, I have found another cause to which I am just as committed.  I believe that, once again, with the support of my wife, Gayle, we can make a difference in the community of San Diego.  The most effective way we can help in the betterment of San Diego is by becoming Mayor of the city and assembling a first class, committed team like we did at AMN Healthcare.
This commitment to the people of San Diego requires my full and undivided attention.  Therefore I am choosing to not seek reelection in April to the board of directors of AMN Healthcare.  I appreciate the board's recommendation that I continue to be recognized as Chairman Emeritus, a title I will be proud to hold.
Gayle and I remain shareholders and look forward to a very positive future for AMN Healthcare.
Respectfully yours,
 
 
Steven C. Francis

Section 2  Financial Information
 
On February 26, 2008, we reported our fourth quarter 2007 results. Our fourth quarter 2007 results are discussed in detail in the press release which is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.

Date: February 26, 2008

Exhibit 99.1
 
SAN DIEGO  (February 26, 2008)  AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. (NYSE: AHS), the nation's largest healthcare staffing company, today reported revenue for the fourth quarter of 2007 of $285.9 million. This represents an increase of 0.8% from the $283.5 million reported for the same quarter last year, and a 4.8% decline from the $300.3 million in revenue reported in the third quarter. The sequential decline in revenue was due in part to the typical fourth quarter seasonality of fewer clinicians working over the holidays. Diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2007 were $0.26, a decrease of $0.03 compared to last year and last quarter. Fourth quarter 2006 diluted earnings per share included a benefit equating to $0.05 due to favorable actuarial adjustments to the professional liability insurance reserve.
Revenue for the full year 2007 was an industry record $1.16 billion, an increase of 7.6% from the $1.08 billion reported for 2006. While the company was able to produce operating efficiencies throughout the year, these were partially offset by direct cost pressures and lower demand levels in the nurse staffing business that caused diluted earnings per share to grow at a slower rate of 2.9% to $1.05.
"During the fourth quarter we continued to see the benefit of the diversified service strategy we have been implementing over the past three years. While economic and market conditions have impacted our nurse staffing business recently, our locum tenens staffing segment continued to experience strong year-over-year growth. We also saw the sustained benefit of initiatives implemented earlier in the year to improve gross margins and drive efficiencies across
all business segments," said Susan R. Nowakowski, President and Chief Executive Officer. "In 2007, we continued to take steps towards expanding our service offerings by launching new clinical disciplines, selling into new client markets, and completing new acquisitions to further diversify AMN in high-growth, high-margin market niches within the industry. These are small, but important, seeds for us to plant for stronger future growth opportunities."
Gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2007 was $76.0 million, representing a 26.6% gross margin, as compared to $74.3 million, or a 26.2% gross margin, for the fourth quarter of 2006 and $79.7 million, or a 26.6% gross margin, for the third quarter of 2007. The 40 basis points improvement over the prior year was due primarily to an improved pay-to-bill spread in the nurse and allied staffing segment, while gross margin remained relatively stable compared to last quarter. Gross margins by business segment for the fourth quarter of 2007 were 24.4% for nurse and allied healthcare staffing, 26.1% for locum tenens staffing and 61.8% for physician permanent placement services. Consolidated gross margin for the full year 2007 was 26.0% as compared to 26.7% for 2006, a decline caused primarily by higher housing and healthcare insurance expense in the nurse and allied staffing segment.
Selling, general, and administrative ("SG&A") expenses for the fourth quarter of 2007 were $55.9 million, or 19.6% of revenue, as compared to $51.2 million, or 18.1% of revenue, for the fourth quarter of 2006 and $55.8 million, or 18.6% of revenue, for the third quarter of 2007. SG&A in the current quarter also included restructuring costs of $0.7 million associated with the company's O'Grady Peyton International nurse staffing division. The increase in SG&A as a percentage of revenue compared to the previous year was due primarily to a $2.9 million favorable adjustment to the professional liability insurance reserve recorded in the fourth quarter of 2006. SG&A for the full year 2007 was 18.7% as a percentage of revenue as compared to 19.0% for 2006.
Income from operations for the fourth quarter of 2007 was $16.8 million, or 5.9% of revenue, as compared to $20.4 million, or 7.2% of revenue, for the fourth quarter of 2006, and $21.0 million, or 7.0% of revenue, for the third quarter of 2007. The decrease in operating margin compared to the previous year was due mainly to the prior year including the previously noted $2.9 million favorable adjustment. Also contributing to the decrease in operating margin
compared to the previous year and previous quarter was the $0.7 million of OGP restructuring costs recorded this quarter. Operating margin for the full year 2007 was 6.3% of revenue, as compared to 6.8% for 2006.
Net interest expense for the fourth quarter of 2007 was $2.9 million, compared to $4.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2006 and $3.1 million for the third quarter of 2007. The decrease in net interest expense from the previous year and previous quarter reflected the continued reduction in outstanding debt.
The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2007 was 35.3% compared to 38.6% for the fourth quarter of 2006, with both quarters including adjustments required to finalize year-end federal and state tax provisions. The full year effective tax rate was 39.9%, which approximates the 40.2% rate we anticipate for 2008.
Strong cash flow continued with the company generating $25.3 million in cash flow from operations during the fourth quarter of 2007 and $79.6 for the full year 2007. Total debt outstanding at December 31, 2007 was $147.0 million, yielding a leverage ratio of 1.6. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the fourth quarter of 2007 were 34.2 million.
Additionally, on February 15, 2008, as previously announced, the company acquired substantially all of the assets of Platinum Select, L.P. ("Platinum Select"), one of the nation's leading travel allied staffing firms. The purchase price of up to $50.3 million in cash consisted of an initial payment of $32.9 million and a potential additional earn-out payment based on Platinum Select's 2008 financial performance. The company financed the acquisition using both cash on hand and its revolving credit facility. "This addition to the AMN Healthcare family provides an additional channel for helping our clients obtain the scarce and valuable talents of allied professionals, and firmly places the company as the #1 provider in the attractive travel allied healthcare staffing segment of the industry," said Nowakowski.
Revenue and Earnings Guidance for First Quarter and Full Year 2008
Based on the current market conditions and an expectation for typical seasonal improvement in the demand and supply environment during the second half of the year, the
company expects revenue for the full year 2008 to grow 7% to 12% over 2007 and diluted earnings per share to grow at a faster rate of 11% to 16%. Management expects revenue for the first quarter of 2008 to range from $290 million to $293 million, and diluted earnings per share to range from $0.24 to $0.26. These guidance estimates include the company's acquisition of Platinum Select which closed on February 15, 2008.
"Our 2008 guidance anticipates revenue and earnings growth in all of our segments. Our locum tenens staffing segment is expected to produce double digit growth and we expect that our physician permanent placement and allied staffing businesses will grow at faster rates than last year. Our outlook is tempered by caution that the level of growth in the demand environment for travel nurses continues to be at lower than optimal levels," said Nowakowski. "We remain very focused on delivering superior quality and service to our clients every day and are confident that AMN has the right long-term market strategy and the right team in place to advance our leadership position within the fastest growing, most profitable segments of the healthcare staffing industry. With that said, we must continue to make changes and innovate to remain agile in this dynamic and increasingly competitive market. We are excited about several of the new services we will be launching throughout the year," said Nowakowski.

Date: May 7, 2008

Exhibit 99.1
 
SAN DIEGO  (May 7, 2008)  AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. (NYSE: AHS), the nation's largest healthcare staffing company, today reported revenue for the first quarter of 2008 of $293.6 million. This represents an increase of 3% from both the $283.9 million in revenue reported for the same quarter last year and the $285.9 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2007. Diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2008 was $0.28, an increase of $0.05, or 22%, from last year and $0.02, or 8%, from last quarter.
"First quarter results were encouraging with year-over-year revenue growth in all three of our business segments: Nurse & Allied, Locum Tenens and Physician Permanent Placement. Our mix of business and improved direct cost and SG&A expense management enabled us to increase both gross profit margins and EBITDA margins over the prior year," said Susan R. Nowakowski, AMN Healthcare President and Chief Executive Officer. "Even more important was the significant increase we experienced in demand for travel nurse and allied professionals since the beginning of the year. These trends set us up to enter the second quarter on a solid base of placements to deliver growth and achieve our expectations for the year."
Gross profit for the first quarter of 2008 was $77.5 million, representing a 26.4% gross margin, as compared to $72.5 million, or a 25.5% gross margin, for the first quarter of 2007 and $76.0 million, or a 26.6% gross margin, for the fourth quarter of 2007. The 90 basis point improvement in gross margin over the prior year was due primarily to an improved pay-to-bill spread in the nurse and allied and locum tenens staffing segments. Compared to last quarter, gross margin declined slightly due to higher housing and subsidy costs in the nurse and allied staffing segment. This was partially offset by lower provider compensation in the locum tenens staffing
segment in the first quarter where gross margin increased sequentially by 60 basis points. Gross margins by business segment for the first quarter were 24.0% for nurse and allied healthcare staffing, 26.7% for locum tenens staffing and 61.6% for physician permanent placement services.
Selling, general, and administrative ("SG&A") expenses for the first quarter of 2008 were $55.1 million, or 18.8% of revenue, as compared to $53.1 million, or 18.7% of revenue, for the first quarter of 2007 and $55.9 million, or 19.6% of revenue, for the fourth quarter of 2007. The decrease in SG&A compared to last quarter was due primarily to favorable insurance experience in the current quarter and a $0.7 million restructure charge recorded last quarter related to our international division. This was partially offset by additional SG&A expenses from Platinum Select, which we acquired on February 15, 2008.
Income from operations for the first quarter of 2008 was $19.0 million, or 6.5% of revenue, which increased from the $16.8 million, or 5.9% of revenue, for the first quarter of 2007, and $16.8 million, or 5.9% of revenue, for the fourth quarter of 2007. The increase in operating margin compared to last year was due mostly to higher gross margin, while the increase compared to last quarter was due primarily to lower SG&A as a percentage of revenue.
Net interest expense for the first quarter of 2008 was $2.8 million, compared to $3.3 million for the first quarter of 2007 and $2.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2007. The decrease in net interest expense primarily reflected continued reductions in outstanding debt.
Strong cash flow continued with the company generating $16.9 million in cash flow from operations during the first quarter of 2008. Total debt outstanding at March 31, 2008, was $146.5 million, yielding a leverage ratio of 1.5. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the first quarter of 2008 were 34.2 million.
AMN Healthcare also announced today that its Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $38 million of its outstanding common stock in the open market. Under the repurchase program, share purchases may be made from time to time through March 31, 2009, depending on prevailing market conditions and other considerations. The company expects to use available cash on hand and its revolver to fund the purchase of shares.
"While the use of our strong cash flow for acquisitions will continue to be one of our highest priorities, the current market environment makes doing a moderate share repurchase an appropriate investment for the company at this time and underscores our commitment to enhancing stockholder value," Ms. Nowakowski said.
Revenue and Earnings Guidance for Second Quarter and Full Year 2008
Ms. Nowakowski added: "Based on our view of the market conditions and our expectation for seasonal improvement in demand and supply during the second half of the year, we are reaffirming our expectations for revenue growth for the full year 2008 of 7% to 12% over 2007. Diluted earnings per share is expected to grow at a faster rate of 11% to 16%. We expect revenue for the second quarter of 2008 to range from $313 million to $316 million, and diluted earnings per share to range from $0.26 to $0.28.
"We are encouraged by the industry trends and progress we are making in 2008 which will provide us with continued growth opportunities. Our sales and operations teams have made execution improvements which I believe set us up to capture more market share and further expand our leadership position. With that said, we are in a competitive industry and must continue to evolve our business model to meet the changing needs of our clients. In addition to delivering superior service to our clients today, we are also continuing to make investments in innovative solutions and enhancing our diversified strategy to build a stronger company for the future," said Ms. Nowakowski.

Section 2  Financial Information
 
On August 6, 2008, AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. (the "Company") reported its second quarter 2008 results. The Company's second quarter 2008 results are discussed in detail in the press release which is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.
The information in this Item 2.02 and Exhibit 99.1 attached hereto shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, nor shall they be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, except to the extent as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
 
(d) Exhibits
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
Date: August 6, 2008

Exhibit 99.1
 
SAN DIEGO  (August 6, 2008)  AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. (NYSE: AHS), the nation's largest healthcare staffing company and the market leader in all of its business segments today reported revenue of $313 million, a 6% increase from the same quarter last year and a 7% increase from last quarter. Additional highlights include:
 
 
 
Susan R. Nowakowski, President and Chief Executive Officer of AMN Healthcare, remarked, "All of our business lines experienced volume and revenue growth during the second quarter, reflecting the solid fundamentals of our industry and execution by our team. This success is further magnified by our ability to improve gross margins and gain modest pricing improvements, despite relatively flat hospital admissions and an overall soft economic environment. AMN's strategy to offer a diverse product line across a broad client base and our leadership position in the fastest-growing, most profitable segments of the healthcare staffing industry is proving its value to our shareholders."
For the second quarter of 2008, revenue for the Nurse and Allied healthcare staffing segment was $215.3 million, an increase of 7% from the same quarter last year. The Locum Tenens staffing segment generated revenue of $83.9 million, an increase of 5% from the same quarter last year and the Physician Permanent Placement segment provided revenue of $13.5 million, an increase of 7% from the same quarter last year.
Gross profit for the second quarter of 2008 was $82.5 million, an increase of 10% from the same quarter last year. Gross margin this quarter increased 90 basis points to 26.4% from 25.5% in the same quarter last year reflecting mainly an improved pay-to-bill spread in our nurse and allied staffing segment. Housing costs, which had been trending higher for several quarters, remained flat in the second quarter as a percentage of revenue compared to the same quarter last year.
Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses increased to 19.2% of revenue in the second quarter of 2008 from 18.2% in the same quarter last year. The increase was due mostly to higher insurance costs and bad debt expense associated with a client bankruptcy in our locum tenens staffing business as well as expenses in support of strategic initiatives to further diversify and augment our future growth. Despite the increase in SG&A this quarter, diluted earnings per share grew 4% to $0.27 compared to the same quarter last year due to the higher revenue and improvement in gross margin.
Revenue and Earnings Guidance for Third Quarter and Full Year 2008
Based on trends experienced in the first month of the third quarter and taking into account expected seasonal patterns for the third and fourth quarters, the Company reaffirmed its projected earnings per share growth of 11% to 16% over 2007 and revised its projected revenue growth for the full year 2008 to 6% to 8%. For the third quarter of 2008, the Company expects revenue to range from $320 million to $323 million and diluted earnings per share to range from $0.31 to $0.33.
Nowakowski added, "We expect all of our business segments to continue to drive both year-over-year and sequential quarterly revenue growth in the third quarter. Just as important, we also expect gross margins to remain relatively stable and, with continued improvements in operational efficiency, we expect to grow earnings at a stronger pace than revenue."
 
Stock Repurchase Program Update
The Company is authorized to purchase up to $38 million of its outstanding common stock in the open market through March 31, 2009. The Company initiated the share buyback during the second quarter of 2008 and purchased 368,000 shares of its common stock for approximately $6.4 million, or $17.49 per share. Diluted shares outstanding at June 30, 2008 were approximately 34.3 million.

In the event that the Corporation determines to make the list available on an electronic network, the Corporation may take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is available only to Stockholders of the Corporation. If the meeting is to be held at a place, the list shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any Stockholder who is present.
List of Stockholders
 
If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication, then the list shall also be open to the examination of any Stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and the information required to access such list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting. Upon the willful neglect or refusal of the Directors to produce such a list at any meeting for the election of Directors held at a place, or to open such a list to examination on a reasonably accessible electronic network during any meeting for the election of Directors held solely by means of remote communication, they shall be ineligible for election to any office at such meeting.

8.1 . To the extent not prohibited by applicable law, the Corporation shall indemnify any person (a "Covered Person") who is or was made, or threatened to be made, a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding (a "Proceeding"), whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, including, without limitation, an action by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor, by reason of the fact that such person, or a person of whom such person is the legal representative, is or was a Director or officer of the Corporation, or, while a Director or officer of the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director or officer of any other corporation or in a capacity with comparable authority or responsibilities for any partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise (an "Other Entity"), against expenses (including attorneys' fees) in the event of an action by or in the right of the Corporation and against judgments, fines, and amounts paid in settlement and expenses (including attorneys' fees), in the event of any other proceeding, if the person acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interest of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal proceeding, had no reason to believe the person's conduct was unlawful; and except that no indemnification shall be made, in the event of an action by or in the right of the Corporation, if prohibited by the General Corporation Law. Persons who are not Directors or officers of the Corporation (or otherwise entitled to indemnification pursuant to the preceding sentence) may be similarly indemnified in respect of service to the Corporation or to an Other Entity at the request of the Corporation to the extent the Board at any time specifies that such persons are entitled to the benefits of this Article 8.
Indemnity Undertaking
 
8.2 .

Advancement of Expenses
provided
however
8.3 . The rights to indemnification or advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this Article 8 shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which a person seeking indemnification or reimbursement or advancement of expenses may have or hereafter be entitled under applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation, these By-laws, any agreement, any vote of Stockholders or disinterested Directors or otherwise.
Rights Not Exclusive
8.4 . The rights to indemnification or advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this Article 8 shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a Director or officer and shall inure to the benefit of the executors, administrators, legatees and distributees of such person.

8.5 . The Corporation shall have power to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of an Other Entity, against any liability asserted against such person and incurred by such person in any such capacity, or arising out of such person's status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such liability under the provisions of this Article 8, the Certificate of Incorporation or under the General Corporation Law or any other provision of law.

Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board, its independent legal counsel and its Stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that such indemnification or reimbursement or
Procedural Rights
 
advancement of expenses is proper in the circumstances nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board, its independent legal counsel and its Stockholders) that such person is not entitled to such indemnification or reimbursement or advancement of expenses shall constitute a defense to the action or create a presumption that such person is not so entitled. Such a person shall also be indemnified for any expenses incurred in connection with successfully establishing his or her right to such indemnification or advancement of expenses, in whole or in part, in any such proceeding.
8.8 . The Corporation's obligation, if any, to indemnify or to advance expenses to any Covered Person who was or is serving at the Corporation's request as a director, officer, employee or agent of any Other Entity shall be reduced by any amount such Covered Person may collect as indemnification or advancement of expenses from such Other Entity.
Contribution
8.9 . This Article 8 shall not limit the right of the Corporation, to the extent and in the manner permitted by applicable law, to indemnify and advance expenses to persons other than Covered Persons when and as authorized by appropriate corporate action.

Section 2  Financial Information
 
On October 30, 2008, AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. (the "Company") reported its third quarter 2008 results. The Company's third quarter 2008 results are discussed in detail in the press release which is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.
The information in this Item 2.02 and Exhibit 99.1 attached hereto shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, nor shall they be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, except to the extent as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
 
(d) Exhibits
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
Date: October 30, 2008

Exhibit 99.1
 
SAN DIEGO  (October 30, 2008)  AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. (NYSE: AHS) today announced operating results for the third quarter of 2008. Highlights include:
 
 
 
 
"While the healthcare staffing industry is not insulated from the impact of our nation's economic uncertainties, we do believe our industry leadership position and our diversified strategy is enabling AMN to deliver solid results that will translate into an even stronger market position in the future. While we are disappointed to be reporting operating performance slightly below our previous higher growth expectations, we do believe these results are more than respectable given the worsening financial and employment environment and the lower patient admissions and procedures reported by the healthcare industry," said Susan R. Nowakowski, President and Chief Executive Officer of AMN Healthcare. "We were especially pleased with our largest business line of travel nurse staffing, where we experienced year-over-year and sequential revenue growth and likely the most significant market share gains we've seen in several quarters. The lower than expected results came primarily from our allied business and certain specialties within our locum tenens division."
 
For the third quarter of 2008, revenue for the Nurse and Allied staffing segment was $217.1 million, an increase of 6.4% from the same quarter last year. The Locum Tenens staffing segment generated revenue of $85.3 million, an increase of 2.8% from the same quarter last year, and the Physician Permanent Placement segment provided revenue of $12.6 million, decreasing from $13.2 million reported the same quarter last year.
Gross profit for the third quarter of 2008 was $81.1 million, an increase of 1.7% from the same quarter last year. Gross margin this quarter decreased to 25.7% from 26.6% in the same quarter last year mainly reflecting lower gross profit contribution from higher margin business lines such as international nursing and physician permanent placement and a shift in the mix of specialties within our locum tenens staffing segment.
Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses increased to 19.1% of revenue in the third quarter of 2008 from 18.6% in the same quarter last year due primarily to restructuring and legal expenses associated with the Company's pharmacy staffing business which included a change in management, certain headcount reductions, and other non-recurring expenses. Excluding these costs, SG&A expenses would have been 18.6% of revenue, consistent with the same quarter last year.
Income tax expense was 34.4% of taxable income in the third quarter of 2008 as compared to 32.9% in the same quarter last year. During this quarter, the Company identified a tax matter that impacts the travel healthcare staffing industry. Since nearly the inception of the industry over two decades ago, it has been common industry practice for companies to offer lodging per diem payments; however, we recently became aware that a portion of these per diem payments may not be fully deductible for income tax purposes. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements reflect this uncertain tax position under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
Earnings per share were $0.28 in the third quarter which included $0.03 for the restructuring charge and legal expenses, $0.01 for a sales allowance adjustment lowering revenue in the permanent placement segment, offset with $0.04 for the tax benefit. These results came in $0.03 lower than the low end of guidance due mainly to lower than expected volumes in both nurse and allied and locum tenens segments, along with higher income taxes before recognizing the tax benefit mentioned above.
 
Revenue and Earnings Guidance for Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2008
In light of the current slowing economic conditions and negative effects of higher unemployment rates on both demand and supply for flexible healthcare staffing, the Company revised its projected full-year 2008 revenue to $1.22 billion and its fourth quarter 2008 revenue to a range from $295 million to $300 million. Fourth quarter and full-year EPS are estimated to be negatively impacted by $0.03 and $0.04, respectively, as a result of the income tax matter. Fourth quarter EPS is expected to range from $0.20 to $0.23, including an estimated $0.02 negative income tax adjustment, and full year EPS is now expected to range from $0.99 to $1.02. Pro forma EPS for the full year excluding an estimated $0.03 negative effect of the income tax adjustment, $0.03 impact of the restructuring and legal expense and the $0.01 impact of the sales allowance would range from $1.06 to $1.09.
Nowakowski added, "Despite the recent short-term challenges, the long-term fundamentals of our business opportunity have not changed. The demand for clinicians will continue to rise as the population ages and the shortages of physicians, nurses and allied professionals become more severe. We do expect to continue to see an impact from the current uncertain economic and political environment, which limits our short-term growth opportunities. During these times we have rededicated ourselves to focus on three key aspects of our strategy: Continuing to (1) capture more market share, (2) capture efficiency and productivity gains which should drive reductions in our cost structure, and (3) expand and diversify our business to respond to changing modes of healthcare delivery. Two good examples of such expansion are the recent launch of AMN's Recruitment Process Outsourcing and surgical center staffing service offerings. We will utilize this downturn to implement changes that can drive greater profitability through operating leverage when stability returns to the economy and the healthcare sector."
Stock Repurchase Program Update
The Company is authorized to purchase up to $38 million of its outstanding common stock in the open market through March 31, 2009. Since June 2008, the Company has repurchased 1,554,600 shares of its common stock for approximately $28.4 million. Diluted shares outstanding at September 30, 2008 were approximately 33.9 million.

Other factors that could cause actual results to differ from those implied by the forward-looking statements contained in this earnings release are set forth in the
 
Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007, and its Current Reports on Form 8-K. These statements reflect the Company's current beliefs and are based upon information currently available to it.

Unless otherwise provided by applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-laws, the notice of any meeting shall be given, not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting, to each Stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting. If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be given when deposited in the United States mail, with postage prepaid, directed to the Stockholder at his or her address as it appears on the records of the Corporation.

Notice of Meetings of Stockholders
2.6 . Whenever the giving of any notice to Stockholders is required by applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-laws, a waiver thereof, in writing, signed by the person entitled to said notice, or a waiver by electronic transmission by the person entitled to notice, whether before or after the event as to which such notice is required, shall be deemed equivalent to notice.

Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the Stockholders need be specified in any written waiver of notice or any waiver by electronic transmission unless so required by applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-laws.
Waivers of Notice
2.7 . The Secretary shall prepare and make, at least ten (10) days before every meeting of Stockholders, a complete list of the Stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each Stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each Stockholder.

In the event that the Corporation determines to make the list available on an electronic network, the Corporation may take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is available only to Stockholders of the Corporation. If the meeting is to be held at a place, the list shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any Stockholder who is present. If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication, then the list shall also be open to the examination of any Stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and the information required to access such list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting. Upon the willful neglect or refusal of the Directors to produce such a list at any meeting for the election of Directors held at a place, or to open such a list to examination on a reasonably accessible electronic network during any meeting for the election of Directors held solely by means of remote communication, they shall be ineligible for election to any office at such meeting. The stock ledger shall be the only evidence as to who are the Stockholders entitled to examine the stock ledger, the list of Stockholders or the books of the Corporation, or to vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of Stockholders.

2.8 . Except as otherwise provided by applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-laws, at each meeting of Stockholders, the presence in person or by proxy of the holders of a majority of all outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote at the meeting of Stockholders shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of any business at such meeting, except that, where a separate vote by a class or series or classes or series is required, a quorum shall consist of no less than a majority of the shares of such class or series or classes or series. When a quorum is present to organize a meeting of Stockholders and for purposes of voting on any matter, the quorum for such meeting or matter is not broken by the subsequent withdrawal of any Stockholders. In the absence of a quorum, the chairman of the meeting or the holders of a majority of the shares of stock

present in person or represented by proxy at any meeting of Stockholders, including an adjourned meeting, whether or not a quorum is present, may adjourn such meeting to another time and place. Shares of its own stock belonging to the Corporation or to another corporation, if a majority of the shares entitled to vote in the election of Directors of such other corporation is held, directly or indirectly, by the Corporation, shall neither be entitled to vote nor be counted for quorum purposes; , , that the foregoing shall not limit the right of the Corporation to vote stock, including but not limited to its own stock, held by it in a fiduciary capacity.
provided
however
2.9 . Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, every Stockholder entitled to vote at any meeting of Stockholders shall be entitled to one vote for each share of stock held by such Stockholder which has voting power upon the matter in question. If the Certificate of Incorporation provides for more or less than one (1) vote for any share on any matter, each reference in the By-laws or the General Corporation Law to a majority or other proportion of stock shall refer to such majority or other proportion of the votes of such stock. The General Corporation Law shall apply in determining whether any shares of stock may be voted and the persons, if any, entitled to vote such shares; but the Corporation shall be protected in assuming that the persons in whose names shares of stock stand on the stock ledger of the Corporation are entitled to vote such shares. At any meeting of Stockholders (at which a quorum was present to organize the meeting), all matters, except as otherwise provided by applicable law, pursuant to any regulation applicable to the Corporation or its securities or by the Certificate of Incorporation or by these By-laws, including Section 3.3, shall be decided by the affirmative vote of a majority in voting power of shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote thereon.
Voting; Proxies
Except as otherwise provided by the Certificate of Incorporation, each Stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of Stockholders or to express consent or dissent to corporate action in writing without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for such Stockholder by proxy. The validity and enforceability of any proxy shall be determined in accordance with the General Corporation Law. A Stockholder may revoke any proxy that is not irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting in person or by delivering to the Secretary an instrument in writing revoking the proxy or by delivering a proxy in accordance with applicable law bearing a later date to the Secretary.
All voting, including on the election of Directors, shall be by written ballot. Each ballot shall state the name of the stockholder or proxy voting and such other information as may be required under the procedure established for the meeting.
2.10 . The Board, in advance of any meeting of Stockholders, may, and shall, if required by applicable law, appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting and make a written report thereof. The Board may designate one or more persons as alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act. If required by applicable law, if no inspector or alternate is able to act at a meeting, the person presiding at the meeting shall appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting. Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of his or her duties, shall take and

At the meeting the inspectors shall (a) ascertain the number of shares outstanding and the voting power of each, (b) determine the shares represented at the meeting and the validity of proxies and ballots, (c) count all votes and ballots, (d) determine and retain for a reasonable period a record of the disposition of any challenges made to any determination by the inspectors, and (e) certify their determination of the number of shares represented at the meeting and their count of all votes and ballots. The inspectors may appoint or retain other persons or entities to assist the inspectors in the performance of their duties. Unless otherwise provided by the Board, the date and time of the opening and the closing of the polls for each matter upon which the Stockholders will vote at a meeting shall be determined by the person presiding at the meeting and shall be announced at the meeting. No ballot, proxies or votes, or any revocation thereof or change thereto, shall be accepted by the inspectors after the closing of the polls unless the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware upon application by a Stockholder shall determine otherwise. In determining the validity and counting of proxies and ballots cast at any meeting of Stockholders, the inspectors may consider such information as is permitted by applicable law. No person who is a candidate for office at an election may serve as an inspector at such election.
2.11

For purposes of this Section 2.11, "Public Disclosure" shall be deemed to be first made when disclosure of such date of the annual or special meeting of Stockholders, as the case may be, is first made in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Services, Associated Press or comparable national news service, or in a document publicly filed by the Corporation with the SEC pursuant to Sections 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act or any successor statute thereto.

Every written consent shall bear the date of signature of each Stockholder who signs the consent and no written consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless, within sixty (60) days of the earliest dated consent delivered in the manner required by this Section 2.13, written consents signed by a sufficient number of holders to take action are delivered to the Corporation as aforesaid. Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall, to the extent required by applicable law, be given to those Stockholders who have not consented in writing and who, if the action had been taken at a meeting, had been Stockholders the date that written consents signed by a sufficient number of holders to take the action were delivered to the Corporation. Written consent may take the form of a cablegram, telegram or other electronic transmission to the extent such written consent complies with the applicable provisions of the General Corporation Law.
Written Consent of Stockholders Without a Meeting
In the event of the delivery to the Corporation of a written consent, the Secretary shall provide for the safe-keeping of such written consent and shall promptly conduct such ministerial review of the sufficiency of the written consent and of the validity of the action to be taken by written consent as he deems necessary or appropriate, including, without limitation, whether the holders of a number of shares having the requisite voting power to authorize or take the action specified in the written consent have given consent; , , that if the corporate action to which the written consent relates is the removal or replacement of one or more members of the Board, the Secretary shall promptly designate two persons, who shall not be members of the Board, to serve as inspectors with respect to such written consent and such inspectors shall discharge the functions of the Secretary under this Section 2.13. If after such investigation the Secretary or the inspectors, as the case may be, shall determine that the written consent is valid and that the action therein specified has been validly authorized, that fact shall forthwith be certified on the records of the Corporation kept for the purpose of recording the proceedings of meetings of Stockholders, and the written consent shall be filed in such records, at which time the written consent shall become effective as Stockholder action. In conducting the investigation required by this Section 2.13, the Secretary or the inspectors, as the case may be, may, at the expense of the Corporation, retain special legal counsel and any other necessary or appropriate professional advisors, and such other personnel as they may deem necessary or appropriate to assist them, and shall be fully protected in relying in good faith upon the opinion of such counsel or advisors.
provided
however
The record date for determining Stockholders entitled to express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be as fixed by the Board or as otherwise established under this Section 2.13. Any person seeking to have the Stockholders authorize or take corporate action by written consent without a meeting shall, by written notice addressed to the Secretary and delivered to the Corporation, request that a record date be fixed for such purpose. The Board may fix a record date for such purpose which shall be no more than ten (10) days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board and shall not precede the date such resolution is adopted. If the Board fails, within ten (10) days after the Corporation receives such notice, to fix a record date for such purpose, the record date shall be the day on which the first written consent is delivered to the Corporation in the manner described above unless prior action by the Board is required under the General Corporation Law, in which event the record date shall be at the close of business on the Business Day on which the Board adopts the resolution taking such prior action.
3.1 . Except as otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, the business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of the Board.

General Powers
3.2 . The Board shall consist of one or more members, the number thereof to be determined from time to time by resolution of the Board. Directors need not be Stockholders.

For purposes of this Section 3.3, a majority of the votes cast means that the number of shares voted "for" a Director exceeds the number of votes cast "against" that Director. The following shall not be votes cast: (a) a share whose ballot is marked as withheld; (b) a share otherwise present at the meeting but for which
Election
there is an abstention; and (c) a share otherwise present at the meeting as to which a shareholder gives no authority or direction. If a Director then serving on the Board of Directors does not receive the required majority, the Director shall tender his or her resignation to the Board. Within ninety (90) days after the date of the certification of the election results, the Corporate Governance Committee or other committee that may be designated by the Board will make a recommendation to the Board on whether to accept or reject the resignation, or whether other action should be taken and the Board will act on such committee's recommendation and publicly disclose its decision and the rationale behind it.
If the Chairman of the Board is an officer of, or is employed in an executive or any other capacity by, the Corporation, or if there is an Executive Chairman, the Board shall annually elect a Presiding Director and shall fill any vacancies in the position of Presiding Director at such time and in such manner as the Board shall determine.
3.4 .

No decrease in the number of Directors constituting the Board shall shorten the term of any incumbent Director. When any Director shall give notice of resignation effective at a future date, the Board may fill such vacancy to take effect when such resignation shall become effective in accordance with the General Corporation Law.
Newly Created Directorships and Vacancies
3.5 . Any Director may resign at any time upon notice given in writing or by electronic transmission to the Corporation. Such resignation shall take effect at the time therein specified, and, unless otherwise specified in such resignation, the acceptance of such resignation shall not be necessary to make it effective.

3.10 . Directors or members of any committee designated by the Board may participate in a meeting of the Board or of such committee by means of conference telephone or other communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and participation in a meeting pursuant to this Section 3.10 shall constitute presence in person at such meeting.
Telephone Meetings

Whenever the giving of any notice to Directors is required by applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-laws, a waiver thereof, in writing, signed by the person or persons entitled to said notice, whether before or after the event as to which such notice is required, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance by a Director at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting except when the Director attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business on the ground that the meeting has not been lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the Directors or a committee of Directors need be specified in any written waiver of notice unless so required by applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-laws.

Unless otherwise restricted by the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-laws, any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board or of any committee thereof may be taken without a meeting if all Directors or members of such committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing or by electronic transmission, and the writing or writings or electronic transmission or transmissions are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the Board or committee. Such filing shall be in paper form if the minutes are maintained in paper form and shall be in electronic form if the minutes are maintained in electronic form.
Action Without Meeting
The Board may designate one or more committees, each committee to consist of one or more of the Directors. The Board may remove any Director from any committee at any time, with or without cause. The Board may designate one or more Directors as alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of such committee. If a member of a committee shall be absent from any meeting, or disqualified from voting thereat, the remaining member or members

In the absence of such rules each committee shall conduct its business in the same manner as the Board conducts its business pursuant to Article 3 of these By-laws.

8.1 . To the extent not prohibited by applicable law, the Corporation shall indemnify any person (a "Covered Person") who is or was made, or threatened to be made, a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding (a "Proceeding"), whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, including, without limitation, an action by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor, by reason of the fact that such person, or a person of whom such person is the legal representative, is or was a Director or officer of the Corporation, or, while a Director or officer of the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director or officer of any other corporation or in a capacity with comparable authority or responsibilities for any partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise (an "Other Entity"), against expenses (including attorneys' fees) in the event of an action by or in the right of the Corporation and against judgments, fines, and amounts paid in settlement and expenses (including attorneys' fees), in the event of any other proceeding, if the person acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interest of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal proceeding, had no reason to believe the person's conduct was unlawful; and except that no indemnification shall be made, in the event of an action by or in the right of the Corporation, if prohibited by the General Corporation Law.

Advancement of Expenses
provided
however
8.3 . The rights to indemnification or advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this Article 8 shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which a person seeking indemnification or reimbursement or advancement of expenses may have or hereafter be entitled under applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation, these By-laws, any agreement, any vote of Stockholders or disinterested Directors or otherwise.
Rights Not Exclusive
8.4 . The rights to indemnification or advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this Article 8 shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a Director or officer and shall inure to the benefit of the executors, administrators, legatees and distributees of such person.

Insurance
8.6 . Any repeal or modification of the provisions of this Article 8 shall not adversely affect any right or protection hereunder of any Covered Person in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to the time of such repeal or modification.
Binding Effect

Procedural Rights
nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board, its independent legal counsel and its Stockholders) that such person is not entitled to such indemnification or reimbursement or advancement of expenses shall constitute a defense to the action or create a presumption that such person is not so entitled. Such a person shall also be indemnified for any expenses incurred in connection with successfully establishing his or her right to such indemnification or advancement of expenses, in whole or in part, in any such proceeding.
8.8 . The Corporation's obligation, if any, to indemnify or to advance expenses to any Covered Person who was or is serving at the Corporation's request as a director, officer, employee or agent of any Other Entity shall be reduced by any amount such Covered Person may collect as indemnification or advancement of expenses from such Other Entity.
Contribution
8.9 . This Article 8 shall not limit the right of the Corporation, to the extent and in the manner permitted by applicable law, to indemnify and advance expenses to persons other than Covered Persons when and as authorized by appropriate corporate action.

On December 23, 2008, the Board of Directors of AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. (AHS) unanimously voted to increase the Board to eight members and to appoint Dr. Michael Johns to fill the new directorship, effective December 23, 2008, until his successor is duly elected and qualified, or until he resigns, is removed, or becomes disqualified.
Dr. Johns has been the Chancellor of Emory University since October 2007. Prior to that, from 1996 through September 2007, Dr. Johns led Woodruff Health Sciences Center at Emory University, which includes the School of Medicine, the Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing, the Rollins School of Public Health, and Emory Healthcare. Until September 2007, Dr. Johns was the Executive Vice President of Health Affairs for Emory University, as well as the Chief Executive Officer of Woodruff Health Sciences Center and the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Emory Healthcare, both subsidiaries of Emory University. From 1990 to 1996, Dr. Johns was Dean of the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and Vice President of the Medical Faculty at Johns Hopkins University.

"Dr. Johns brings a wealth of knowledge and experience in leading complex administrative and academic organizations to new levels of excellence and service," said Douglas D. Wheat, Chairman of the Board of AMN Healthcare. "Dr. Johns is widely renowned as a catalyst of new thinking in many areas of health policy and education of healthcare professionals. We look forward to him bringing his valuable perspective to AMN Healthcare's board."
"As healthcare providers and our nation's legislative leadership escalate their exploration of innovative ways to improve the quality of care and the cost of care, this is an exciting time to join the AMN Healthcare board," Dr. Johns said.

From 1990 to 1996, Dr. Johns was Dean of the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and Vice President of the Medical Faculty at Johns Hopkins University. Under his leadership, the medical school moved into first place among all medical schools in sponsored research, completely revamped its curriculum to meet the challenges of a new era in healthcare, and developed a technology transfer program, which is considered a model of its kind.

Forward Looking Statements
This presentation contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Company based these forward-looking statements on its current expectations and projections about future events. Actual results could differ materially from those discussed in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are identified by words such as believe, anticipate, expect, intend, plan, will, may and other similar expressions. In addition, any statements that refer to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. The following factors could cause the Companys actual results to differ materially from those implied by the forward-looking statements in this earnings release: the Companys ability to continue to recruit qualified temporary and permanent healthcare professionals at reasonable costs; the Companys ability to retain qualified temporary healthcare professionals for multiple assignments at reasonable costs; the Companys ability to attract and retain sales and operational personnel; the Companys ability to enter into contracts with hospitals, healthcare facility clients, affiliated healthcare networks and physician practice groups on terms attractive to the Company and to secure orders related to those contracts, which ability is affected by many factors, including increasingly the role of vendor management companies; the Companys ability to demonstrate the value of its services to its healthcare and facility clients, which may be impacted by the role of intermediaries such as vendor management companies; the Companys ability to maintain and enhance the brand identities it has developed, at reasonable costs; changes in the timing of hospital, healthcare facility and physician practice group clients orders for temporary healthcare professionals; the general level of patient occupancy and utilization of services at hospital and healthcare facility clients facilities, including the potential impact on such utilization caused by adoption of alternative modes of healthcare delivery, which utilization may influence demand for the Companys services; the overall level of demand for services offered by temporary and permanent healthcare staffing providers; the ability of hospital, healthcare facility and physician practice group clients to retain and increase the productivity of their permanent staff; the variation in pricing of the healthcare facility contracts under which the Company places temporary healthcare professionals; the Companys ability to successfully design its strategic growth, acquisition and integration strategies and to implement those strategies, which includes our ability to obtain credit at reasonable terms to complete acquisitions, integrate acquired companies accounting, management information, human resource and other administrative systems, and implement or remediate controls, procedures and policies at acquired companies; the Companys ability to leverage its cost structure; access to and undisrupted performance of the Companys management information and communication systems, including use of the Internet, and candidate and client databases and payroll and billing software systems; the Companys ability to keep its web sites operational at a reasonable cost and without service interruptions; the effect of existing or future government legislation and regulation; the Companys ability to grow and operate its business in compliance with legislation and regulations, including regulations that may affect the Companys clients and, in turn, affect demand for the Companys services, such as Medicare reimbursement rates which may negatively affect both orders and client receivables; the challenge to the classification of certain of the Companys healthcare professionals as independent contractors; the impact of medical malpractice and other claims asserted against the Company; the disruption or adverse impact to the Companys business as a result of a terrorist attack or breach of security of our data systems; the Companys ability to carry out its business strategy and maintain sufficient cash flow and capital structure to support its business; the Companys ability to meet its financial covenants, which if not met, could adversely affect the Companys liquidity; the loss of key officers and management personnel that could adversely affect the Companys ability to remain competitive; the effect of recognition by the Company of an impairment to goodwill; and the effect of adjustments by the Company to accruals for self-insured retentions. Other factors that could cause actual results to differ from those implied by the forward-looking statements contained in this earnings release are set forth in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007, and its Current Reports on Form 8-K. These statements reflect the Companys current beliefs and are based upon information currently available to it. Be advised that developments subsequent to this presentation are likely to cause these statements to become outdated with the passage of time.

Exhibit 1: 2008 Projected Proforma EPS Reconciliation
* Proforma EPS represents GAAP EPS plus income tax adjustments, certain restructuring and legal expenses, and sales allowances. Management presents proforma EPS because it believes that proforma EPS is a useful supplement to net income as an indicator of operating performance. Management believes such a measure provides a picture of the companys results that is more comparable among periods since it excludes the impact of items that may recur occasionally, but tend to be irregular as to timing, thereby distorting comparisons between periods. However, investors should note that this non-GAAP measure involves judgment by management (in particular, judgment as to what is classified as a special item to be excluded from proforma EPS) . As defined, proforma EPS is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation. While management believes that some of the items excluded from proforma EPS are not indicative of the Companys operating performance, these items do impact the income statement, and management therefore utilizes proforma EPS as an operating performance measure in conjunction with GAAP measures such as GAAP EPS.
Exhibit 2: Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Items                    
(unaudited)
represents net income (loss) plus interest expense (net of interest income), income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation                   expense, transactions costs, and losses on extinguishment of debt. Management presents adjusted EBITDA because it believes that adjusted EBITDA is a                      useful  supplement to net income as an indicator of operating performance. Management believes that adjusted EBITDA is an industry-wide financial measure that is                   useful both to management and investors when evaluating the Company's performance. Management also uses adjusted EBITDA for planning purposes. Management                   uses adjusted EBITDA to evaluate the Company's performance because it believes that adjusted EBITDA more accurately reflects the Company's results, as it excludes                   certain items, in particular stock-based compensation charges that management believes are not indicative of the Company's operating performance. However,                   adjusted EBITDA is not intended to represent cash flows for the period, nor has it been presented as an alternative to operating or net income as an indicator of                   operating performance, and it should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. As defined,                   adjusted EBITDA is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation. While                   management believes that some of the items excluded from adjusted EBITDA are not indicative of the Company's operating performance, these items do impact the                   income statement, and management therefore utilizes adjusted EBITDA as an operating performance measure in conjunction with GAAP measures such as net income.

Date: February 26, 2009

Exhibit 99.1
 
SAN DIEGO  (February 26, 2009)  AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. (NYSE: AHS) today announced operating results within guidance for the fourth quarter and full-year 2008. Highlights include:
 
 
 
 
 
 
"Today, AMN Healthcare is growing market share, making investments in the future, and maintaining our strong cash flow and a healthy balance sheet in the economic downturn," said Susan R. Nowakowski, President and Chief Executive Officer of AMN Healthcare. "Our strategy of leveraging the advantages of our size, leadership position, differentiated business model and diversified service lines will allow us to continue outperforming our competitors. It was the execution of this strategy and the dedication of our employees that allowed AMN to increase market share and achieve record revenue and EBITDA results in 2008.
"While not as impacted as many other sectors, the slowing economic conditions and higher unemployment have negatively impacted demand for our services, most notably in nurse staffing," Nowakowski added. "During the first quarter of 2009, we have taken several steps to align our business infrastructure accordingly, focusing on maximizing operating efficiencies and reducing overhead costs, while still preserving our ability to deliver the superior quality and service levels our clients expect from AMN Healthcare."
For the full year 2008, Nurse and Allied revenue was $844 million, up 5% over last year including acquisitions, Locum Tenens revenue was $322 million, up 4%, and Physician Permanent Placement revenue was $51 million, flat with prior year.
For the fourth quarter of 2008, revenue for the Nurse and Allied staffing segment was $207 million, an increase of 5% from the same quarter last year including acquisitions. The Locum Tenens staffing segment generated revenue of $76 million, an increase of 0.3% from the same quarter last year, and the Physician Permanent Placement segment provided revenue of $12 million, a decrease of 7% from the same quarter last year primarily due to a sales reserve adjustment.
Full year gross margin of 26.0% for 2008 remained unchanged from the prior year. Gross margin during the fourth quarter was 25.7% compared to 26.6% for the same quarter last year, mainly reflecting the lower revenue mix from our higher margin business lines such as international nursing and physician permanent placement.
Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses for the full year 2008 were 18.9% as a percentage of revenue, as compared to 18.7% for 2007. SG&A decreased to 18.6% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2008 from 19.6% in the same quarter last year due mainly to the effects of cost saving initiatives the company began implementing during the quarter, combined with lower bad debt expense and a favorable actuarial-based insurance reserve adjustment.
 
For the full year 2008, income tax expense was 43.9% of taxable income as compared to 40.1% for 2007. Income tax expense was 47.5% of taxable income in the fourth quarter as compared to 39.5% in the same quarter last year. These higher effective tax rates reflect the tax matter we identified in the third quarter of 2008.
Full year GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.02 and included the negative impacts of $0.02 for sales reserve adjustments, $0.03 for restructuring charges and legal expenses associated with our pharmacy staffing business, and $0.04 for the tax matter. Fourth quarter GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.23 included $0.01 for the sales reserve adjustment, and $0.03 expense for the tax matter.
Total debt outstanding at December 31, 2008 was $146.3 million, yielding a leverage ratio of 1.5. Total average diluted shares outstanding for the fourth quarter of 2008 were 32.9 million.
Revenue and Earnings Guidance
The current economic environment is making it more difficult to forecast annual financial performance and to provide meaningful guidance. Therefore, management will continue to share general business trends but will no longer provide specific financial guidance. During the first few months of 2009, the general business trends have been as follows: demand has slowed for most of our business lines, most significantly for nursing, where volumes declined by double-digit percentage amounts both sequentially and year over year. There has also been a moderation in the rate of price increases, though pricing erosion is not expected. Based on these trends, first quarter consolidated revenue is expected to decline in the low- to mid-teens, in percentage terms, over the prior year.
Nowakowski added, "Our team has been proactively reducing external vendor and internal costs to better align the business infrastructure with the recent and expected lower demand levels to preserve profit margins and cash flow. We are confident that our leadership position combined with our seasoned management, sales and service team along with our focus on solid financial fundamentals will allow us to continue building market share and successfully weather the challenging economic conditions."

Forward-Looking Statements
This earnings release contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Such statements include anticipated first quarter consolidated revenues and expectations and Ms. Nowakowski's comments, including those regarding the company growing
 
market share, outperforming competitors, not expecting price erosion, and preserving profit margins and cash flow. We based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are identified by words such as "believe," "anticipate," "expect," "intend," "plan," "will," "may" and other similar expressions. In addition, any statements that refer to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. The following factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those implied by the forward-looking statements in this earnings release: our ability to sustain our business in a significant economic downturn; our ability to continue to recruit qualified temporary and permanent healthcare professionals at reasonable costs; our ability to retain qualified temporary healthcare professionals for multiple assignments at reasonable costs; our ability to attract and retain sales and operational personnel; our ability to enter into contracts with hospitals, healthcare facility clients, affiliated healthcare networks and physician practice groups on terms attractive to us and to secure orders related to those contracts; our ability to demonstrate the value of our services to our healthcare and facility clients, which may be impacted by the role of intermediaries such as vendor management companies; the general level of patient occupancy and utilization of services at our hospital and healthcare facility clients' facilities, including the potential impact on such utilization caused by adoption of alternative modes of healthcare delivery, which utilization may influence demand for our services; the overall level of demand for services offered by temporary and permanent healthcare staffing providers; the ability of our hospital, healthcare facility and physician practice group clients to retain and increase the productivity of their permanent staff; the variation in pricing of the healthcare facility contracts under which we place temporary healthcare professionals; our ability to successfully design our strategic growth, acquisition and integration strategies and to implement those strategies, which includes our ability to obtain credit at reasonable terms to complete acquisitions, integrate acquired companies' accounting, management information, human resource and other administrative systems, and implement or remediate controls, procedures and policies at acquired companies; our ability to leverage our cost structure; access to and undisrupted performance of our management information and communication systems, including use of the Internet, and our candidate and client databases and payroll and billing software systems; our ability to keep our web sites operational at a reasonable cost and without service interruptions; the effect of existing or future government legislation and regulation; our ability to grow and operate our business in compliance with legislation and regulations, including regulations that may affect our clients and, in turn, affect demand for our services, such as Medicare reimbursement rates which may negatively affect both orders and client receivables; the challenge to the classification of certain of our healthcare professionals as independent contractors; the impact of medical malpractice and other claims asserted against us; the disruption or adverse impact to our business as a result of a terrorist attack or breach of security of our data systems; our ability to carry out our business strategy and maintain sufficient cash flow and capital structure to support our business; our ability to meet our financial covenants, which if not met, could adversely affect our liquidity; the loss of key officers and management personnel that could adversely affect our ability to remain competitive; the effect of recognition by us of an impairment to goodwill; our ability to maintain and enhance the brand identities we have developed, at reasonable costs; and the effect of adjustments by us to accruals for self-insured retentions. Other factors that could cause actual results to differ from those implied by the forward-looking statements contained in this earnings release are set forth in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007, its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and its Current Reports on Form 8-K. These statements reflect the Company's current beliefs and are based upon information currently available to it. Be advised that developments subsequent to this earnings release are likely to cause these statements to become outdated with the passage of time. The Company does not intend, however, to update the guidance provided today prior to its next earnings release.

SAN DIEGO  (May 7, 2009)  AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. (NYSE: AHS) today announced operating results for the first quarter 2009, which were in line with managements expectations. Financial highlights include:
* See Supplemental Financial and Operating Data for a reconciliation of non-GAAP items.
NM  Not meaningful
The strength of our differentiated business model, our focus on quality and our customer loyalty is becoming even more evident in this tight market environment. Over the last year, we have been able to grow market share and strengthen our leading position.  At the same time, we continue to expand our market opportunity and make investments in our future through progress with new service lines, We remain disciplined in streamlining our cost structure to deal with short-term volume trends and are prudently deleveraging our balance sheet by taking advantage of our strong cash flow generation.
said Susan R. Nowakowski, President and Chief Executive Officer of AMN Healthcare.
 
 
Key business highlights include:
For the
first
quarter of 200

, revenue for the Nurse and Allied staffing segment was $
164
million,
a decrease of 20
% from the same quarter last year
and 21% sequentially
. The Locum Tenens staffing segment generated revenue of $
75
million,
a decrease of 2
% from the same quarter last year
and sequentially. T
he Physician Permanent Placement segment provided revenue of $1
1
million
, a
decreas
e
 
of
 
17%
 
from
the same quarter last year
and 10% sequentially
.
Gross margin
during the first
quarter
of 2009 was
25.
6
%
, generally unchanged from the previous quarter, but down 75 bps
 
as compared to
26.
4
%
for
the same quarter last year
. The year over year decline
 
mainly reflect
ed
continued lower revenue mix from the relatively high margin business line of international nursing
and
narrower margins in the travel nursing business
.
Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses
for the first quarter of 2009, excluding $0.9 million in non-recurring legal expenses, were 19.7% as a percentage of revenue as compared to 18.8%
in the same quart
er last year
.
 
While SG&A increased as a percentage of revenue
due
to negative operating leverage, SG&A excluding the non-recurring legal expenses declined in absolute terms by $5.9 million, or 11%, over prior year and by $6.0 million, or 11%, sequentially, as
cost-saving initiatives
begun in the previous quarter took hold
.
 
he company incurred $176 million in non-cash impairment charges relating to goodwill and certain other intangible assets resulting from a combination of the companys depressed equity market value and lower projected near-term growth rates for the healthcare staffing industry. These trends reflect the current downturn in the U.S. economy in general and, in particular, the continued deterioration in labor markets since the beginning of 2009. These impairment charges are non-cash expenses and will not have any impact on the company's cash position, future cash flows or debt covenants.
As a result of certain cost-reduction actions, the company recorded $2.9 million in restructuring charges, consisting mainly of severance payments related to workforce reductions as well as lease-related charges associated with facility consolidations. Also, in accordance with accounting rule FAS 142 t

First quarter GAAP net loss per diluted share was (
$
3.74) and
included
the negative impacts of

of non-cash goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges,
$

.

of
restruc
turing charges and $0.02 of non-recurring legal costs
.
Total debt outstanding at March 31, 2009 was $119.5 million, yielding a leverage ratio of 1.3.  Total average diluted shares outstanding for the first quarter of 2009 were 32.6 million.
Credit Facility
Update
The company has secured an amendment to its credit agreement that increases the maximum allowable leverage ratio and extends the revolver tenor one year to match that of the term loan. The interest rate on the term debt remains unchanged at LIBOR plus 1.75% and the rate on the revolver increases 2.0%.
Business Trends and Outlook
During the first quarter of 2009 and first month of the second quarter, the general business trends have been as follows: demand for travel nurse professionals declined significantly during the first part of the year but has recently begun to show signs of stabilization, and demand for allied professionals has been growing, but both are still at levels considerably lower than prior year.  Locum tenens volume (days filled) has been relatively flat but is expected to increase as we continue through the year. The volume of new retained searches for physicians is down year-over-year and sequentially. Pricing, overall, has continued to trend slightly higher over prior year and gross margins are expected to expand slightly as bill-to-pay spreads widen. Based on these trends, second quarter consolidated revenue is expected to decline sequentially by approximately 20%. The majority of this decline is driven by volume trends in nurse staffing resulting from the earlier drop in demand levels.

Though it is too early to call a bottom in our market, we are starting to see signs of stabilization in some of our key leading indicators, Nowakowski added. We are continuing to focus on adjusting our cost structure and maintaining strong relationships with both our clients and healthcare professionals.

AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. (the "Company") reaffirms its previously issued guidance that the Company's consolidated revenue for the quarter ended June 30, 2009 is expected to decline sequentially by approximately 20%.
The information in this Item 2.02 shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, nor shall they be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, except to the extent as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
 
As previously disclosed during the second quarter of 2009, the Company closed certain office locations, reorganized back office and corporate functions and consolidated its nursing brands as part of its long term strategic planning and to reduce its cost structure. On July 14, 2009, the Company committed to closing additional office locations by the end of the year to continue its goal of gaining efficiency in operations by further centralizing the Company's primary operations in San Diego, California and Irving, Texas.
As a result of these changes and other potential actions, the Company estimates that it will incur restructuring costs of approximately $7 million to $8 million in the second half of 2009, consisting primarily of lease termination and employee severance costs. The majority of these restructuring costs will require cash expenditures. The Company anticipates recognizing total pre-tax restructuring charges in 2009 of approximately $12 million to $13 million.

They are based on management's assumptions, beliefs and expectations, all of which involve a number of business risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.

SAN DIEGO  (August 6, 2009)  AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. (NYSE: AHS) today announced operating results for the second quarter 2009, which were in line with managements expectations. Financial highlights for the three months ended June 30, 2009 include:
 
* See Supplemental Financial and Operating Data for a reconciliation of non-GAAP items.
NM  Not meaningful
Our focus on client relationships and quality as well as our diversified service offerings have enabled AMN Healthcare to maintain our leading market position, improve gross margins and strengthen our balance sheet through the prolonged economic downturn, said Susan R. Nowakowski, President and Chief Executive Officer of AMN Healthcare. We continue to take an aggressive and disciplined approach in streamlining and right-sizing our infrastructure, enabling us to adjust to short-term volume trends, while operating with an improved cost structure going forward. At the same time, we are also maintaining our long-term strategy of investing in our future through progress with new service lines.
 
Key business highlights include:
For the second quarter of 2009, revenue for the Nurse and Allied staffing segment was $111 million, a decrease of 48% from the same quarter last year and 32% sequentially. The Locum Tenens staffing segment generated revenue of $79 million, a decrease of 6% from the same quarter last year and an increase of 6% sequentially.
Gross margin in the second quarter of 2009 was 27.0%, an increase of 140 bps as compared to 25.6% for the previous quarter and an increase of 60 bps as compared to 26.4% for the same quarter last year. The year over year and sequential increase mainly reflected a shift in business mix and tight management of direct costs.
Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses (excluding restructuring costs) for the second quarter of 2009 were 19.0% as a percentage of revenue as compared to 19.2% in the same quarter last year. SG&A declined by $22.3 million, or 37%, over the same period in the prior year and by $12.2 million, or 24%, sequentially, due to cost-saving initiatives taking hold as well as $3.5 million in favorable insurance reserve adjustments.
As a result of certain cost-reduction actions, the company recorded $2.2 million in restructuring charges, consisting mainly of severance payments and lease-related charges associated with various facility, branding and back-office consolidations.
2
Second quarter GAAP net earnings per diluted share was $0.13, including a $0.04 negative impact from restructuring charges, reflecting a decrease compared to $0.25 in the same period in the prior year.
As of June 30, 2009 cash and cash equivalents totaled $23.5 million, compared to $11.3 million as of December 31, 2008. Total debt outstanding was $90.0 million as of June 30, 2009, reflecting a reduction in debt of $56.3 million since December 31, 2008. Total average diluted shares outstanding for the second quarter of 2009 were 32.9 million.
Business Trends and Outlook
During the second quarter of 2009, Nursing and Allied orders continued to show signs of stabilization, although still at levels significantly lower than prior year. Locum Tenens volume (days filled) increased slightly over the first quarter. Pricing and gross margins remained relatively stable overall.
Nowakowski noted continued signs of stabilization and some recent improvement in orders for travel nurse and allied professionals which should translate into stabilizing volumes during the third quarter. Locum Tenens volume and physician permanent placements are expected to be steady compared with the prior quarter. Based on these trends, third quarter consolidated revenue is expected to decline sequentially by approximately 15%. The majority of this decline is driven by volume trends in nurse staffing resulting from the earlier drop in demand levels. Overall gross margins are anticipated to remain consistent.
We are continuing to focus on maintaining strong relationships and securing preferred contracts with our clients, as well as nurturing our recent new service offerings such as Emergency Medicine staffing, Home Health staffing, and Recruitment Process Outsourcing, added Nowakowski. At the same time, we are prudently managing our cost structure and balance sheet in order to position ourselves for future investments in new market opportunities that contribute strategic synergies to our core service lines. Despite the uncertainty of when economic recovery will occur, we remain confident in the long-term fundamentals of our industry and focused on laying the groundwork for innovation and growth in future years to drive shareholder value.

SAN DIEGO  (October 29, 2009)  AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. (NYSE: AHS) today announced operating results for the third quarter 2009. Financial highlights for the three months ended September 30, 2009 include:
* Excludes restructuring and stock based compensation costs. See Supplemental Financial and Operating Data for a reconciliation of non-GAAP items.
NM  Not meaningful
The unprecedented market contraction experienced by the healthcare staffing industry over the past year is a direct reflection of the rapid rise to historically high levels of general unemployment. The decline in volumes we experienced during the first nine months of 2009 have certainly highlighted the importance of our ability to remain agile and disciplined in our execution. We continue to de-lever our balance sheet, maintain strong gross margins, and reduce SG&A through tight cost management and further improvements to our cost structure, said Susan R. Nowakowski, President and Chief Executive Officer of AMN Healthcare. This environment has also created opportunities for AMN to further differentiate our service capabilities and strengthen our client relationships.  This has been demonstrated by our three-fold increase in preferred provider arrangements and winning key managed services contracts, which will benefit us in 2010 and beyond.
 
 
Key business highlights for the third quarter are as follows:
 
Revenue for the third quarter of 2009 was $166 million, a decrease of 47% from prior year and 16% from prior quarter. Third quarter revenue for the Nurse and Allied staffing segment was $82 million, a decrease of 62% from the same quarter last year and down 26% sequentially. The Locum Tenens staffing segment generated revenue of $75 million, a decrease of 12% from prior year and down 5% sequentially. Third quarter Physician Permanent Placement revenue was $9 million, a decrease of 31% from prior year and 2% from prior quarter.
Gross margin in the third quarter of 2009 was 27.4%, an increase of 170 bps from prior year and an increase of 40 bps compared to the previous quarter. The increase was due to the Locum Tenens and Physician Permanent Placement segments representing a greater portion of our business mix.
Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses (excluding restructuring costs) for the third quarter of 2009 were 22.2% as a percentage of revenue compared to 19.1% in the same quarter last year. SG&A declined by $23 million, or 39%, over the same period in the prior year, and sequentially by $1 million, or 2%, due largely to cost-saving initiatives taking hold.
As a result of continued streamlining of our cost and operational structure, the company recorded $6 million of restructuring charges in the third quarter, consisting mainly of lease-related charges associated with facility consolidations and severance payments.
 
 
For the third quarter, the company recorded a GAAP net loss per share of $0.06 which includes a $0.11 negative impact from restructuring charges. Earnings per diluted share were $0.28 in the prior year and $0.13 in the prior quarter.
As of September 30, 2009, cash and cash equivalents totaled $23 million, compared to $11 million as of December 31, 2008. Total debt outstanding was $77 million as of September 30, 2009, reflecting a reduction in debt of $13 million since prior quarter and $69 million since December 31, 2008. Average shares outstanding for the third quarter of 2009 were 32.6 million. Average diluted shares outstanding for the third quarter used in the calculation of adjusted diluted earnings per share were 33.1 million.
Business Trends and Outlook
 
Nursing orders continue to show signs of improvement, with increased momentum occurring in September and October.  However, orders still remain at levels lower than prior year due to high general unemployment and uncertain economic conditions. In Locum Tenens, we experienced lower sequential demand (days available) in the third quarter, primarily due to market weakness in anesthesia staffing.  This trend is likely to continue into the fourth quarter.  The increase in new retained searches in the Physician Permanent Placement business experienced during the third quarter is expected to result in improved placements over the coming months. Overall, pricing and gross margins are expected to remain consistent. Based on these trends and the normal holiday seasonal decline, fourth quarter consolidated revenue is expected to decline sequentially by 10-15%.
The improving order trends in Nurse staffing are encouraging for AMN and our industry. While it is difficult to predict the trajectory of resulting volume growth, we believe that our unique breadth of service offerings and success in securing more preferred provider and managed services clients positions AMN extremely well to build market share as the trends continue to improve,  added Nowakowski. Our solid balance sheet enables us to focus on our long-term strategy, invest in our newer service lines, and assess new synergistic opportunities to expand and diversify our business.

December 23, 2009
 
 
 
Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions (
see
General Instruction A.2. below):
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
On December 23, 2009, AMN Healthcare, Inc. (the Company) entered into a Credit Agreement (the New Credit Agreement) by and among the Company, AMN Healthcare, Inc., as borrower (the Borrower), certain subsidiaries of the Borrower from time to time party thereto as guarantors, the several lenders from time to time party thereto as lenders (the Lenders) and Bank of America, N.A. as administrative agent for the Lenders, to provide for certain credit facilities (the Credit Facilities) of up to $150 million consisting of a $40 million secured revolving credit facility and a $110 million secured term loan facility.  The Company and each domestic subsidiary of the Borrower (the Guarantors) have guaranteed the obligations of the Borrower under the New Credit Agreement. The proceeds from the initial drawdown under the Credit Facilities were used to repay in full all outstanding indebtedness under a prior credit agreement to which the Company was a party, to cash collateralize certain letters of credit issued thereunder and to pay related transaction costs. The Credit Facilities are available for working capital, capital expenditures, permitted acquisitions and general corporate purposes of the Company and its subsidiaries.
Borrowings under the New Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Borrower and the Guarantors. The maturity date of the Credit Facilities is in December 2012 for the secured revolving credit facility portion of the Credit Facilities and December 2013 for the secured term loan facility portion of the Credit Facilities.
The secured revolving credit facility portion of the Credit Facilities currently carries an unused fee of between 0.5% and 0.75% per annum based upon the Companys current Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as defined in the New Credit Agreement), and there are no mandatory reductions in the revolving commitment under the secured revolving credit facility portion of the Credit Facilities. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility portion of the Credit Facilities bear interest at floating rates based upon either a LIBOR or a prime interest rate option selected by the Borrower, plus a spread of 3.00% to 4.50% and 2.00% to 3.50%, respectively, to be determined based on the Companys current Consolidated Leverage Ratio.
The secured term loan facility portion of the Credit Facilities is subject to quarterly amortization of principal (in equal installments), with an amount equal to 5% of the initial aggregate principal amount of the secured term loan facility in December 31, 2010, 10% of the initial aggregate principal amount of the secured term loan facility in December 31, 2011 and 15% of the initial aggregate principal amount of the secured term loan facility in December 31, 2012 with any remaining amounts payable in 2013. Borrowings under the secured term loan facility portion of the Credit Facilities bear interest at floating rates based upon either a LIBOR or a prime interest rate option selected by the Borrower, plus a spread of 4.00% and 3.00%, respectively.
The Borrower is required to make additional customary mandatory prepayments of the Credit Facilities with the proceeds of certain asset dispositions, extraordinary receipts, debt issuances and equity issuances.
The Borrower is also required to make mandatory prepayments of the Credit Facilities within ninety days after the end of each fiscal year, commencing with the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010, in an amount equal to 75% (or, commencing with the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011, 50% or 75%, to be determined based on our Consolidated Leverage Ratio) of the Companys Excess Cash Flow (as defined in the Credit Agreement), less any voluntary prepayments of the secured term loan facility portion of the Credit Facilities made during the fiscal year.
 
 
The New Credit Agreement contains various customary affirmative and negative covenants and also contains financial covenants that require the Borrower to maintain a maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio and a minimum Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (each as defined in the New Credit Agreement). The payment obligations under the New Credit Agreement may also be accelerated upon the occurrence of customary events of default.
The foregoing description of the New Credit Agreement is a summary and does not contain all of the exceptions and qualifications that may apply. The foregoing description of the New Credit Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual agreement which will be filed within the time period prescribed by the SEC rules and regulations.
The Lenders and their affiliates have provided, and may in the future provide, various investment banking, commercial banking and other financial services for us for which services they have received, and may in the future receive, customary fees.
 
On December 23, 2009, the Company used approximately $77.9 million of the proceeds from the initial drawdown under the Credit Facilities to repay in full all outstanding indebtedness under the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as amended effective May 7, 2009), by and among AMN Healthcare, Inc., as borrower, certain subsidiaries of the borrower from time to time party thereto as guarantors, the several lenders from time to time party thereto as lenders and Bank of America, N.A. as administrative agent for the lenders (the Existing Credit Facility). The Existing Credit Facility was terminated upon the repayment of the outstanding indebtedness. In addition, the Company settled its outstanding interest rate swaps associated with cash flows under the Existing Credit Facility resulting in a pre-tax loss of approximately $1.8 million.

In the case of a request for an initial issuance of a Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit Application shall specify in form and detail reasonably satisfactory to the Issuing Lender: (A) the proposed issuance date of the requested Letter of Credit (which shall be a Business Day); (B) the amount thereof; (C) the expiry date thereof; (D) the name and address of the beneficiary thereof; (E) the documents to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; (F) the full text of any certificate to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; and (G) such other matters as the Issuing Lender may reasonably require.

(ii)       Promptly after receipt of any Letter of Credit Application, the Issuing Lender will confirm with the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) that the Administrative Agent has received a copy of such Letter of Credit Application from the Borrower and, if not, the Issuing Lender will provide the Administrative Agent with a copy thereof. Unless the Issuing Lender has received written notice from any Lender, the Administrative Agent or any Credit Party, at least one Business Day prior to the requested date of issuance or amendment of the applicable Letter of Credit, that one or more applicable conditions contained in
Section 5
shall not then be satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Issuing Lender shall, on the requested date, issue a Letter of Credit for the account of the Borrower or any other Credit Party or enter into the applicable amendment, as the case may be, in each case in accordance with the Issuing Lenders usual and customary business practices. Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit, each Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the Issuing Lender a risk participation in such Letter of Credit in an amount equal to the product of such Lenders Commitment Percentage
times

Non-Extension Notice Date
) in each such twelve-month period to be agreed upon at the time such Letter of Credit is issued. Unless otherwise directed by the Issuing Lender, the Borrower shall not be required to make a specific request to the Issuing Lender for any such extension. Once an Auto-Extension Letter of Credit has been issued, the Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not require) the Issuing Lender to permit the extension of such Letter of Credit at any time to an expiry date not later than the Letter of Credit Expiration Date;
provided
,
however
, that the Issuing Lender shall not permit any such extension if (A) the Issuing Lender has determined that it would not be permitted, or would have no obligation, at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its revised form (as extended) under the terms hereof (by reason of the provisions of clause (ii) or (iii) of
Section 2.2(a)
or otherwise), or (B) it has received notice (which may be by telephone or in writing) on or before the day that is five Business Days before the Non-Extension Notice Date (1) from the Administrative Agent that the Required Lenders have elected not to permit such extension or (2) from the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Borrower that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in

Auto-Reinstatement Letter of Credit
). Unless otherwise directed by the Issuing Lender, the Borrower shall not be required to make a specific request to the Issuing Lender to permit such reinstatement. Once an Auto-Reinstatement Letter of Credit has been issued, except as provided in the following sentence, the Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not require) the Issuing Lender to reinstate all or a portion of the stated amount thereof in accordance with the provisions of such Letter of Credit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if such Auto-Reinstatement Letter of Credit permits the Issuing Lender to decline to reinstate all or any portion of the stated amount thereof after a drawing thereunder by giving notice of such non-reinstatement within a specified number of days after such drawing (the 
Non-Reinstatement Deadline
), the Issuing Lender shall not permit such reinstatement if it has received a notice (which may be by telephone or in writing) on or before the day that is five Business Days before the Non-Reinstatement Deadline (A) from the Administrative Agent that the Required Lenders have elected not to permit such reinstatement or (B) from the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Borrower that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in
Section 5.2
is not then satisfied (treating such reinstatement as an LOC Credit Extension for purposes of this clause) and, in each case, directing the Issuing Lender not to permit such reinstatement.
 
(v)       Promptly after its delivery of any Letter of Credit or any amendment to a Letter of Credit to an advising bank with respect thereto or to the beneficiary thereof, the Issuing Lender will also deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent a true and complete copy of such Letter of Credit or amendment.

Not later than 12:00 Noon on the date of any payment by the Issuing Lender under a Letter of Credit (each such date, an 
Honor Date
), the Borrower shall reimburse the Issuing Lender through the Administrative Agent in an amount equal to the amount of such drawing and in Dollars. If the Borrower fails to so reimburse the Issuing Lender by such time, the Issuing Lender shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent of the Honor Date, the amount of the unreimbursed drawing (expressed in Dollars) and the amount of the unreimbursed drawing shall become the unreimbursed amount (the 
Unreimbursed Amount
). The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Revolving Lender of the Honor Date, the Unreimbursed Amount and the amount of such Revolving Lenders Commitment Percentage of the Unreimbursed Amount. Any notice given by the Issuing Lender or the Administrative Agent pursuant to this
Section 2.2(c)(i)
may be given by telephone if immediately
 
41
 
 
 
confirmed in writing;
provided
that the lack of such an immediate confirmation shall not affect the conclusiveness or binding effect of such notice.

Section 2.2(c)(i)

Schedule 2.1(a)
, in an amount equal to its Commitment Percentage of the Unreimbursed Amount not later than 1:00 P.M. on the Business Day specified in such notice by the Administrative Agent, whereupon, subject to the provisions of
Section 2.2(c)(iii)
, each Revolving Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made a Base Rate Loan to the Borrower in such amount. The Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the Issuing Lender.
 
(iii)      With respect to any Unreimbursed Amount that is not fully refinanced by a Base Rate Loan because the conditions set forth in
Section 5.2
cannot be satisfied or for any other reason, the Borrower shall be deemed to have incurred from the Issuing Lender an LOC Borrowingin the amount of the Unreimbursed Amount that is not so refinanced, which LOC Borrowingshall be due and payable on demand (together with interest) and shall bear interest at the Default Rate. In such event, each Revolving Lenders payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Lender pursuant to
Section 2.2(c)(ii)
shall be deemed payment in respect of its participation in such LOC Borrowing and shall constitute a Participation Interest from such Revolving Lender in satisfaction of its participation obligation under this
Section 2.2
.

Section 2.2
to reimburse the Issuing Lender for any amount drawn under any Letter of Credit, interest in respect of such Revolving Lenders Commitment Percentage of such amount shall be solely for the account of the Issuing Lender.
 
(v)       Each Revolving Lenders obligation to make Revolving Loans or Participation Interests to reimburse the Issuing Lender for amounts drawn under Letters of Credit, as contemplated by this
Section 2.2(c)
, shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Revolving Lender may have against the Issuing Lender, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing;
provided
,
however
, that each Revolving Lenders obligation to make Revolving Loans pursuant to this
Section 2.2(c)
is subject to the conditions set forth in
Section 5.2
(other than delivery by the Borrower of a Notice of Borrowing). No such making of a Participation Interestshall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the Borrower to reimburse the Issuing Lender for the amount of any payment made by the Issuing Lender under any Letter of Credit, together with interest as provided herein.

by the time specified in
Section 2.2(c)(ii)
, the Issuing Lender shall be entitled to recover from such Revolving Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the Issuing Lender at a rate per annum equal to the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Issuing Lender in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Issuing Lender in connection with the foregoing. A certificate of the Issuing Lender submitted to any Revolving Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (vi) shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
 
 
(i)        At any time after the Issuing Lender has made a payment under any Letter of Credit and has received from any Revolving Lender such Lenders Participation Interest in respect of such payment in accordance with
Section 2.2(c)
, if the Administrative Agent receives for the account of the Issuing Lender any payment in respect of the related Unreimbursed Amount or interest thereon (whether directly from the Borrower or otherwise, including proceeds of cash collateral applied thereto by the Administrative Agent), the Administrative Agent will distribute to such Revolving Lender its Commitment Percentage thereof (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the period of time during which such Revolving Lenders Participation Interest was outstanding) in the same funds as those received by the Administrative Agent.
 
(ii)       If any payment received by the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Lender pursuant to
Section 2.2(c)(i)
is required to be returned under any of the circumstances described in
Section 11.2
(including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Issuing Lender in its discretion), each Revolving Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Lender its Commitment Percentage thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned by such Revolving Lender, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect. The obligations of the Revolving Lenders under this clause shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement.
 
(e)

(ii)       the existence of any claim, counterclaim, setoff, defense or other right that the Borrower or any Subsidiary may have at any time against any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), the Issuing Lender or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or by such Letter of Credit or any agreement or instrument relating thereto, or any unrelated transaction;
 
(iii)      any draft, demand, certificate or other document presented under such Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient (unless the Issuing Lender has actual knowledge of such forgery, fraud or insufficiency) in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect; or any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under such Letter of Credit;
 
(iv)      any payment by the Issuing Lender under such Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or certificate that does not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit; or any payment made by the Issuing Lender under such Letter of Credit to any Person purporting to be a trustee in bankruptcy, debtor-in-possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors, liquidator, receiver or other representative of or successor to any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit, including any arising in connection with any proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code; or
 
(v)       any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, including any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the Borrower or any Subsidiary.
 
The Borrower shall promptly examine a copy of each Letter of Credit and each amendment thereto that is delivered to it and, in the event of any claim of noncompliance with the Borrowers instructions or other irregularity, the Borrower will promptly notify the Issuing Lender.

None of the Issuing Lender, the Administrative Agent, any of their respective Related Parties nor any correspondent, participant or assignee of the Issuing Lender shall be liable to any Revolving Lender for (i) any action taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request or with the approval of the Lenders or the Required Lenders, as applicable; (ii) any action taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (iii) the due execution, effectiveness,
 
44

provided
,
however
, that this assumption is not intended to, and shall not, preclude the Borrowers pursuing such rights and remedies as it may have against the beneficiary or transferee at law or under any other agreement. None of the Issuing Lender, the Administrative Agent, any of their respective Related Parties nor any correspondent, participant or assignee of the Issuing Lender shall be liable or responsible for any of the matters described in clauses (i) through (v) of
Section 2.2(e)

however
, that anything in such clauses to the contrary notwithstanding, the Borrower may have a claim against the Issuing Lender, and the Issuing Lender may be liable to the Borrower, to the extent, but only to the extent, of any direct, as opposed to consequential or exemplary, damages suffered by the Borrower which the Borrower proves were caused by the Issuing Lenders willful misconduct or gross negligence or the Issuing Lenders willful failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it by the beneficiary of a sight draft and certificate(s) strictly complying with the terms and conditions of a Letter of Credit. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Issuing Lender may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, and the Issuing Lender shall not be responsible for the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason.

Administrative Fees
. The Borrower promises to pay to the Administrative Agent, for its own account, the fees referred to in the Administrative Agents Fee Letter (without duplication).

Each determination by any such Lender of amounts owing under this Section shall, absent manifest error, be conclusive and binding on the parties hereto. Notwithstanding any other provision in this
Section 3.6
, none of the Lenders shall be entitled to demand compensation pursuant to this
Section 3.6
, if it shall not be the general practice of such Lender to demand such compensation in similar circumstances under comparable provisions of other comparable credit agreements.
 
 
 
(a)        the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive) that by reason of circumstances affecting the relevant market, adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period; or
 
(b)        the Requisite Lenders determine (which determination shall be conclusive) and notify the Administrative Agent that the Eurodollar Rate will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to the Lenders of funding Eurodollar Loans for such Interest Period;
 
then the Administrative Agent shall give the Borrower prompt notice thereof, and so long as such condition remains in effect, the Lenders shall be under no obligation to make additional Eurodollar Loans, Continue Eurodollar Loans, or to Convert Base Rate Loans into Eurodollar Loans and the Borrower shall, on the last day(s) of the then current Interest Period(s) for the outstanding Eurodollar Loans, either prepay such Eurodollar Loans or Convert such Eurodollar Loans into Base Rate Loans in accordance with the terms of this Credit Agreement.
 
57
 
 
 
 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Credit Agreement, in the event that it becomes unlawful for any Lender or its Applicable Lending Office to make, maintain, or fund Eurodollar Loans hereunder, then such Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower thereof and such Lenders obligation to make or Continue Eurodollar Loans and to Convert Base Rate Loans into Eurodollar Loans shall be suspended until such time as such Lender may again make, maintain, and fund Eurodollar Loans (in which case the provisions of
Section 3.10
shall be applicable).
 
 
If, after the date hereof, the adoption of any applicable law, rule, or regulation, or any change in any applicable law, rule, or regulation, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority, central bank, or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office) with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such Governmental Authority, central bank, or comparable agency:
 
(i)         shall subject such Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office) to any tax, duty, or other charge with respect to any Eurodollar Loans, its Notes, or its obligation to make Eurodollar Loans, or change the basis of taxation of any amounts payable to such Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office) under this Credit Agreement or its Notes in respect of any Eurodollar Loans (except for Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes covered by
Section 3.11
and the imposition of, or change in the rate of, any Excluded Tax payable by such Lender);
 
(ii)        shall impose, modify, or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, assessment, or similar requirement (other than the Eurodollar Reserve Requirement utilized in the determination of the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate) relating to any extensions of credit or other assets of, or any deposits with or other liabilities or commitments of, such Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office), including the Commitment of such Lender hereunder; or
 
(iii)      shall impose on such Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office) or the London interbank market any other condition affecting this Credit Agreement or its Notes or any of such extensions of credit or liabilities or commitments;
 
and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office) of making, Converting into, Continuing, or maintaining any Eurodollar Loans or to reduce any sum received or receivable by such Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office) under this Credit Agreement or its Notes with respect to any Eurodollar Loans, then the Borrower shall pay to such Lender within 5 Business Days following demand such amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such increased cost or reduction; provided that such increases or reductions shall not include any increased costs or reductions in respect of taxes that are governed by the provisions of Section 3.11, and the provisions of this Section 3.9 shall not be interpreted to cause a duplication in payment or treatment of any taxes in a manner inconsistent with the provisions of Section 3.11. If any Lender requests compensation by the Borrower under
 
58
 
 
 
this Section 3.9, the Borrower may, by notice to such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), suspend the obligation of such Lender to make or Continue Eurodollar Loans, or to Convert Base Rate Loans into Eurodollar Loans, until the event or condition giving rise to such request ceases to be in effect (in which case the provisions of Section 3.10 shall be applicable); provided that such suspension shall not affect the right of such Lender to receive the compensation so requested. Each Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of any event of which it has knowledge, occurring after the date hereof, which will entitle such Lender to compensation pursuant to this Section 3.9 and will designate a different Applicable Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation and will not, in the judgment of such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to it. Any Lender claiming compensation under this Section 3.9 shall furnish to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent a statement setting forth the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder which shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. In determining such amount, such Lender may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods.
 
 
If the obligation of any Lender to make any Eurodollar Loan or to Continue, or to Convert Base Rate Loans into, Eurodollar Loans shall be suspended pursuant to
Section 3.7
,
3.8
or
3.9
hereof, such Lenders Eurodollar Loans shall be automatically Converted into Base Rate Loans on the last day(s) of the then current Interest Period(s) for such Eurodollar Loans (or, in the case of a Conversion, on such earlier date as such Lender may specify to the Borrower with a copy to the Administrative Agent) and, unless and until such Lender gives notice as provided below that the circumstances specified in
Section 3.7
,
3.8
or
3.9
hereof that gave rise to such Conversion no longer exist:
 
(a)        to the extent that such Lenders Eurodollar Loans have been so Converted, all payments and prepayments of principal that would otherwise be applied to such Lenders Eurodollar Loans shall be applied instead to its Base Rate Loans; and
 
(b)        all Loans that would otherwise be made or Continued by such Lender as Eurodollar Loans shall be made or Continued instead as Base Rate Loans, and all Base Rate Loans of such Lender that would otherwise be Converted into Eurodollar Loans shall remain as Base Rate Loans.
 
If such Lender gives notice to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) that the circumstances specified in
Section 3.7
,
3.8
or
3.9
hereof that gave rise to the Conversion of such Lenders Eurodollar Loans pursuant to this
Section 3.10
no longer exist (which such Lender agrees to do promptly upon such circumstances ceasing to exist) at a time when Eurodollar Loans made by other Lenders are outstanding, such Lenders Base Rate Loans shall be automatically Converted, on the first day(s) of the next succeeding Interest Period(s) for such outstanding Eurodollar Loans, to the extent necessary so that, after giving effect thereto, all Loans held by the Lenders holding Eurodollar Loans and by such Lender are held pro rata (as to principal amounts, interest rate basis, and Interest Periods of Revolving Loans) in accordance with their respective Commitments of Revolving Loans and/or Tranche B Loans, as the case may be.

to be satisfied) to borrow, Convert, Continue, or prepay a Eurodollar Loan on the date for such borrowing, Conversion, Continuation, or prepayment specified in the relevant notice of borrowing, prepayment, Continuation, or Conversion under this Credit Agreement.
 
With respect to Eurodollar Loans, such indemnification may include an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (a) the amount of interest which would have accrued on the amount so prepaid, or not so borrowed, Converted or Continued, for the period from the date of such prepayment or of such failure to borrow, Convert or Continue to the last day of the applicable Interest Period (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, Convert or Continue, the Interest Period that would have commenced on the date of such failure) in each case at the applicable rate of interest for such Eurodollar Loans provided for herein (excluding, however, the Applicable Percentage included therein, if any) over (b) the amount of interest (as reasonably determined by such Lender) which would have accrued to such Lender on such amount by placing such amount on deposit for a comparable period with leading banks in the interbank Eurodollar market. The covenants of the Borrower set forth in this
Section 3.12
shall survive the repayment of the Loans, LOC Obligations and other obligations under the Credit Documents and the termination of the Commitments hereunder.
 
 
Except to the extent otherwise provided herein:
 
(a)        
Loans
. Each Loan, each payment or (subject to the terms of
Section 3.3
) prepayment of principal of any Loan or reimbursement obligations arising from drawings under Letters of Credit, each payment of interest on the Loans or reimbursement obligations arising from drawings under Letters of Credit, each payment of Unused Fees, each payment of the Letter of Credit Fee, each reduction of the Revolving Committed Amount and each conversion or extension of any Loan, shall be allocated pro rata among the Lenders in accordance with the respective principal amounts of their outstanding Loans of the applicable type and Participation Interests in Loans of the applicable type and Letters of Credit.
 
(b)        
Advances
. No Lender shall be responsible for the failure or delay by any other Lender in its obligation to make its ratable share of a borrowing hereunder;
provided
,
however
, that the failure of any Lender to fulfill its obligations hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligations hereunder. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified by any Lender prior to the date of any requested borrowing that such Lender does not intend to make available to the Administrative Agent its ratable share of such borrowing to be made on such date, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such amount available to the Administrative Agent on the date of such borrowing, and the Administrative Agent in reliance upon such assumption, may (in its sole discretion but without any obligation to do so) make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. If such corresponding amount is not in fact made available to
 
64
 
 
 
the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent shall be able to recover such corresponding amount from such Lender. If such Lender does not pay such corresponding amount forthwith upon the Administrative Agents demand therefor, the Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Borrower, and the Borrower shall within 3 Business Days after demand pay such corresponding amount to the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to recover from the Lender or the Borrower, as the case may be, interest on such corresponding amount in respect of each day from the date such corresponding amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower to the date such corresponding amount is recovered by the Administrative Agent at a per annum rate equal to (i) from the Borrower at the applicable rate for the applicable borrowing pursuant to the Notice of Borrowing and (ii) from a Lender at the Federal Funds Rate.
 
 
Except with respect to Cash Collateral held by the Issuing Lender or the Swingline Lender, the Lenders agree among themselves that, in the event that any Lender shall obtain payment in respect of any Loan, LOC Obligations or any other obligation owing to such Lender under this Credit Agreement through the exercise of a right of setoff, bankers lien or counterclaim, or pursuant to a secured claim under Section 506 of Title 11 of the United States Code or other security or interest arising from, or in lieu of, such secured claim, received by such Lender under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law or otherwise, or by any other means, in excess of its pro rata share of such payment as provided for in this Credit Agreement, such Lender shall promptly purchase from the other Lenders a Participation Interest in such Loans, LOC Obligations and other obligations in such amounts, and make such other adjustments from time to time, as shall be equitable to the end that all Lenders share such payment in accordance with their respective ratable shares as provided for in this Credit Agreement. The Lenders further agree among themselves that if payment to a Lender obtained by such Lender through the exercise of a right of setoff, bankers lien, counterclaim or other event as aforesaid shall be rescinded or must otherwise be restored, each Lender which shall have shared the benefit of such payment shall, by repurchase of a Participation Interest theretofore sold, return its share of that benefit (together with its share of any accrued interest payable with respect thereto) to each Lender whose payment shall have been rescinded or otherwise restored. The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing such a Participation Interest may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all rights of payment, including setoff, bankers lien or counterclaim, with respect to such Participation Interest as fully as if such Lender were a holder of such Loan, LOC Obligations or other obligation in the amount of such Participation Interest. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Credit Agreement, if any Lender shall fail to remit to the Administrative Agent or any other Lender an amount payable by such Lender to the Administrative Agent or such other Lender pursuant to this Credit Agreement on the date when such amount is due, such payments shall be made together with interest thereon for each date from the date such amount is due until the date such amount is paid to the Administrative Agent or such other Lender at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate. If under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, any Lender receives a secured claim in lieu of a setoff to which this
Section 3.14
applies, such Lender shall, to the extent practicable, exercise its rights in respect of such secured claim in a manner consistent with the rights of the Lenders under this
Section 3.14
to share in the benefits of any recovery on such secured claim.

Payments, Computations, Retroactive Adjustments of Applicable Percentage, Administrative Agents Clawback, Etc
.
 
(a)
    
Generally
. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, all payments hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent in Dollars in immediately available funds, without setoff, deduction, counterclaim or withholding of any kind, at the Administrative Agents office specified in
Schedule 2.1(a)
not later than 2:00 P.M. (Charlotte, North Carolina time) on the date when due unless such day is not a Business Day in which case such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day. Payments received after such time shall be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day. The Borrower shall, at the time it makes any payment under this Credit Agreement, specify to the Administrative Agent the Loans, LOC Obligations, Fees, interest or other amounts payable by the Borrower hereunder to which such payment is to be applied (and in the event that it fails so to specify, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payments
first
to Swingline Loans,
second
to Revolving Loans (first to Base Rate Loans and then to Eurodollar Loans in direct order of Interest Period maturities),
third
to the Tranche B Loan, ratably to the remaining Principal Amortization Payments (in each case first to Base Rate Loans and then to Eurodollar Loans in direct order of Interest Period maturities) and
fourth
after all Revolving Loans and the Tranche B Loan have been repaid, to Cash Collateralize the LOC Obligations. The Administrative Agent will distribute such payments to such Lenders, if any such payment is received prior to 2:00 P.M. (Charlotte, North Carolina time) on a Business Day in like funds as received prior to the end of such Business Day and otherwise the Administrative Agent will distribute such payment to such Lenders on the next succeeding Business Day. Whenever any payment hereunder shall be stated to be due on a day which is not a Business Day, the due date thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day (subject to accrual of interest and Fees for the period of such extension), except that in the case of Eurodollar Loans, if the extension would cause the payment to be made in the next following calendar month, then such payment shall instead be made on the next preceding Business Day. Except as expressly provided otherwise herein, all computations of interest and fees shall be made on the basis of actual number of days elapsed over a year of 360 days, except with respect to computation of interest on Base Rate Loans which shall be calculated based on a year of 365 or 366 days, as appropriate. Interest shall accrue from and include the date of borrowing, but exclude the date of payment.
 
(b)        
Allocation of Payments After Event of Default
. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Credit Agreement to the contrary, after acceleration of the Credit Party Obligations pursuant to
Section 9.2
, all amounts collected or received by the Administrative Agent or any Lender on account of the Credit Party Obligations or any other amounts outstanding under any of the Credit Documents or in respect of the Collateral shall be paid over or delivered as follows:
 
FIRST, to the payment of all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including without limitation reasonable attorneys fees) of the Administrative Agent in connection with enforcing the rights of the Lenders under the Credit Documents and any protective advances made by the Administrative Agent with respect to the Collateral under or pursuant to the terms of the Collateral Documents;
 
66
 
 
 
 
SECOND, to payment of any fees owed to the Administrative Agent, in its capacity as such;
 
THIRD, to the payment of all of the Credit Party Obligations consisting of accrued fees and interest on the Loans, LOC Obligations and Hedging Agreements and Cash Management Agreements between any Consolidated Party and any Lender or Affiliate of a Lender;
 
FOURTH, to the payment of the outstanding principal amount of the Credit Party Obligations (including the payment or Cash Collateralization of the outstanding LOC Obligations and Hedging Agreements and Cash Management Agreements between any Consolidated Party and any Lender or Affiliate of a Lender);
 
FIFTH, to the payment of all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including without limitation, reasonable attorneys fees) of each of the Lenders in connection with enforcing its rights under the Credit Documents or otherwise with respect to the Credit Party Obligations owing to such Lender;
 
SIXTH, to all other Credit Party Obligations and other obligations which shall have become due and payable under the Credit Documents or otherwise and not repaid pursuant to clauses FIRST through FIFTH above; and
 
SEVENTH, to the payment of the surplus, if any, to whomever may be lawfully entitled to receive such surplus.
 
In carrying out the foregoing, (i) amounts received shall be applied in the numerical order provided until exhausted prior to application to the next succeeding category; (ii) each of the Lenders shall receive an amount equal to its pro rata share (based on the proportion that the then outstanding Loans and LOC Obligations held by such Lender bears to the aggregate then outstanding Loans and LOC Obligations) of amounts available to be applied pursuant to clauses THIRD, FOURTH, FIFTH and SIXTH above; and (iii) to the extent that any amounts available for distribution pursuant to clause FOURTH above are attributable to the issued but undrawn amount of outstanding Letters of Credit, such amounts shall be held by the Administrative Agent in a cash collateral account and applied (A) first, to reimburse the Issuing Lender(s) from time to time for any drawings under such Letters of Credit and (B) then, following the expiration of all Letters of Credit, to all other obligations of the types described in clauses FIFTH and SIXTH above in the manner provided in this
Section 3.15(b)
.
 
(c)       If, as a result of any restatement of or other adjustment to the financial statements of the Parent or for any other reason, (i) the Consolidated Leverage Ratio as calculated by the Borrower as of any applicable date proves to have been inaccurate and (ii) a proper calculation of the Consolidated Leverage Ratio would have resulted in higher pricing for such period, the Borrower shall immediately and retroactively be obligated to pay to the Administrative Agent for
 
67
 
 
 
the account of the applicable Lenders or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, promptly on demand by the Administrative Agent (or, after the occurrence of an actual or deemed entry of an order for relief with respect to the Borrower under the Bankruptcy Code of the United States, automatically and without further action by the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Issuing Lender), an amount equal to the excess of the amount of interest and fees that should have been paid for such period over the amount of interest and fees actually paid for such period. This paragraph shall not limit the rights of the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, under Section
2.2(c)(iii)
,
3.1
or
3.5(b)
or under
Section 9
. The Borrowers obligations under this paragraph shall survive the termination of the aggregate Revolving Commitments and the repayment of all other Credit Party Obligations hereunder.
 
(d)       (i)        
Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Administrative Agent
. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Eurodollar Loans (or, in the case of any Base Rate Loans, prior to 12:00 noon on the date of such Loans) that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lenders share of such Loan, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with
Section 2.1
(or, in the case of a Base Rate Loans, that such Lender has made such share available in accordance with and at the time required by
Section 2.4
) and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Loan available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing, and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Base Rate Loans. If the Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Loan to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lenders Loan. Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.
 
(ii)       
Payments by Borrower; Presumptions by Administrative Agent
. Unless the Administra-tive Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the time at which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the Issuing Lender hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the
 
68
 
 
 
Lenders or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or the Issuing Lender, in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.
 
A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this subsection (d) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.
 
 
(a)        Each Lender shall maintain an account or accounts evidencing each Loan made by such Lender to the Borrower from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time under this Credit Agreement. Each Lender will make reasonable efforts to maintain the accuracy of its account or accounts and to promptly update its account or accounts from time to time, as necessary.
 
(b)        The Administrative Agent shall maintain the Register pursuant to
Section 11.3(c)
, and a subaccount for each Lender, in which Register and subaccounts (taken together) shall be recorded (i) the amount, type and Interest Period of each such Loan hereunder, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder from or for the account of any Credit Party and each Lenders share thereof. The Administrative Agent will make reasonable efforts to maintain the accuracy of the subaccounts referred to in the preceding sentence and to promptly update such subaccounts from time to time, as necessary.
 
(c)        The entries made in the accounts, Register and subaccounts maintained pursuant to clause (b) of this
Section 3.16
(and, if consistent with the entries of the Administrative Agent, clause (a)) shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations of the Credit Parties therein recorded;
provided
,
however
, that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain any such account, such Register or such subaccount, as applicable, or any error therein, shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Credit Parties to repay the Credit Party Obligations owing to such Lender.
 
 
(a)       If any Lender having a Revolving Commitment becomes a Defaulting Lender or an Impacted Lender or otherwise defaults in its Revolving Commitment or if any Lender is owed increased costs under
Section 3.6
,
Section 3.8
or
Section 3.9
, or the Borrower is required to make any payments under
Section 3.11
to any Lender in excess of those to the other Lenders or if any Lender elects not to enter into any amendment, modification, consent or waiver with respect to
 
69
 
 
 
the Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document requested by the Borrower, which amendment, modification, consent or waiver cannot become effective without the consent of such Lender, the Borrower shall have the right, if no Event of Default then exists, to replace such Lender (the 
Replaced Lender
) with one or more other Eligible Assignee or Eligible Assignees, none of whom shall constitute an Impacted Lender at the time of such replacement (collectively, the 
Replacement Lender
),
provided
that (i) at the time of any replacement pursuant to this
Section 3.17
, the Replaced Lender and Replacement Lender shall enter into an Assignment and Assumption in the form of
Exhibit 11.3(b)
and in accordance with
Section 11.3(b)(iv)
, pursuant to which the Replacement Lender shall acquire all or a portion, as the case may be, of the Commitments and outstanding Loans of, and participation in Letters of Credit by, the Replaced Lender and (ii) all obligations of the Borrower owing to the Replaced Lender relating to the Loans so replaced (including, without limitation, such increased costs and excluding those specifically described in clause (i) above in respect of which the assignment purchase price has been, or is concurrently being paid) shall be paid in full to such Replaced Lender concurrently with such replacement. Upon the execution of the assignment documentation, the payment of amounts referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) above and, if so requested by the Replacement Lender, delivery to the Replacement Lender of the appropriate Note or Notes executed by the Borrower, the Replacement Lender shall become a Lender hereunder and the Replaced Lender shall cease to constitute a Lender hereunder with respect to such replaced Loans, except with respect to indemnification provisions under this Credit Agreement, which shall survive as to such Replaced Lender. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained above, (1) any Lender that acts as an Issuing Lender may not be replaced hereunder at any time that it has Letters of Credit outstanding hereunder unless arrangements satisfactory to such Lender (including the furnishing of a back-up standby letter of credit in form and substance, and issued by an issuer satisfactory to such Lender or the depositing of cash collateral into a cash collateral account maintained with the Administrative Agent in amounts and pursuant to arrangements satisfactory to such Lender) have been made with respect to such outstanding Letters of Credit and (2) the Lender that acts as the Administrative Agent may not be replaced hereunder except in accordance with the terms of
Section 10.6
. The Replaced Lender shall be required to deliver for cancellation its applicable Notes to be canceled on the date of replacement, or if any such Note is lost or unavailable, such other assurances or indemnification therefor as the Borrower may reasonably request.
 
(b)       During any period that a Lender is a Defaulting Lender, the Borrower may terminate in full the Commitments of such Defaulting Lender by giving notice to such Defaulting Lender and the Administrative Agent (such termination, a 
Defaulting Lender Termination
) so long as on the effective date of such Defaulting Lender Termination and after giving effect thereto and to any repayment of Revolving Loans in connection therewith: (A) no Default or Event of Default exists (unless the Required Lenders otherwise consent to such Defaulting Lender Termination), (B) no Revolving Loans of such Defaulting Lender shall be outstanding, and (C) the sum of (1) the LOC Obligations and (2) the outstanding principal amount of Revolving Loans and Swingline Loans shall not exceed the aggregate Commitments of all Lenders that are not Defaulting Lenders. Each such notice shall specify the effective date of such Defaulting Lender Termination (the 
Defaulting Lender Termination Date
), which shall be not less than 5 Business Days (or such shorter period as agreed to by the Administrative Agent and such Defaulting Lender) after the date on which such notice is delivered to such Defaulting
 
70
 
 
 
Lender and the Administrative Agent. On each such Defaulting Lender Termination Date, (A) the Commitments of such Defaulting Lender shall be reduced to zero, (B) such Defaulting Lender shall cease to be a Lender hereunder (provided that any Defaulting Lender shall continue to be entitled to the indemnification provisions contained herein, but only with respect to matters arising prior to the applicable Defaulting Lender Termination Date), (C) the Commitments of all other Lenders shall remain unchanged, (D) the Commitment Percentages will be reallocated by the Administrative Agent among the Lenders (other than the Defaulting Lender) in accordance with their Commitment Percentages after giving effect to the Defaulting Lender Termination and (E) at the option of the Issuing Lender and the Swingline Lender, respectively, the LOC Committed Amount and the Swingline Committed Amount, as applicable, shall be reduced by an amount equal to such Defaulting Lenders Commitment Percentage thereof so long as, after giving effect to such reduction, the aggregate amount of LOC Obligations outstanding shall not exceed such reduced LOC Committed Amount and the aggregate principal amount of Swingline Loans outstanding shall not exceed such reduced Swingline Committed Amount, as applicable.
 
SECTION 4
 
GUARANTY
 
 
Each of the Guarantors hereby jointly and severally guarantees to each Lender, each Affiliate of a Lender that enters into a Hedging Agreement or Cash Management Agreement, and the Administrative Agent as hereinafter provided, as primary obligor and not as surety, the prompt payment of the Credit Party Obligations in full when due (whether at stated maturity, as a mandatory prepayment, by acceleration, as a mandatory cash collateralization or otherwise) strictly in accordance with the terms thereof. The Guarantors hereby further agree that if any of the Credit Party Obligations are not paid in full when due (whether at stated maturity, as a mandatory prepayment, by acceleration, as a mandatory cash collateralization or otherwise), the Guarantors will, jointly and severally, promptly pay the same, without any demand or notice whatsoever, and that in the case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any of the Credit Party Obligations, the same will be promptly paid in full when due (whether at extended maturity, as a mandatory prepayment, by acceleration, as a mandatory cash collateralization or otherwise) in accordance with the terms of such extension or renewal.
 
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein or in any other of the Credit Documents, Hedging Agreements or Cash Management Agreements, the obligations of each Guarantor under this Credit Agreement and the other Credit Documents shall be limited to an aggregate amount equal to the largest amount that would not render such obligations subject to avoidance under Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provisions of any applicable state law.
 
71
 
 
 
 
The obligations of the Guarantors under
Section 4.1
are joint and several, absolute and unconditional, irrespective of the value, genuineness, validity, regularity or enforceability of any of the Credit Documents, Hedging Agreements or Cash Management Agreements, or any other agreement or instrument referred to therein, or any substitution, release, impairment or exchange of any other guarantee of or security for any of the Credit Party Obligations, and, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, irrespective of any other circumstance whatsoever which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a surety or guarantor, it being the intent of this
Section 4.2
that the obligations of the Guarantors hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances. Each Guarantor agrees that such Guarantor shall have no right of subrogation, indemnity, reimbursement or contribution against the Borrower or any other Guarantor for amounts paid under this
Section 4
until such time as the Credit Party Obligations have been Fully Satisfied. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is agreed that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the occurrence of any one or more of the following shall not alter or impair the liability of any Guarantor hereunder which shall remain absolute and unconditional as described above:
 
(a)        at any time or from time to time, without notice to any Guarantor, the time for any performance of or compliance with any of the Credit Party Obligations shall be extended, or such performance or compliance shall be waived;
 
(b)        any of the acts mentioned in any of the provisions of any of the Credit Documents, any Hedging Agreement or Cash Management Agreement between the Borrower and any Lender, or any Affiliate of a Lender, or any other agreement or instrument referred to in the Credit Documents or such Hedging Agreements or Cash Management Agreements shall be done or omitted;
 
(c)        the maturity of any of the Credit Party Obligations shall be accelerated, or any of the Credit Party Obligations shall be modified, supplemented or amended in any respect, or any right under any of the Credit Documents, any Hedging Agreement or Cash Management Agreement between the Borrower and any Lender, or any Affiliate of a Lender, or any other agreement or instrument referred to in the Credit Documents or such Hedging Agreements or Cash Management Agreements shall be waived or any other guarantee of any of the Credit Party Obligations or any security therefor shall be released, impaired or exchanged in whole or in part or otherwise dealt with;
 
(d)        any Lien granted to, or in favor of, the Administrative Agent or any Lender or Lenders as security for any of the Credit Party Obligations shall fail to attach or be perfected; or
 
(e)        any of the Credit Party Obligations shall be determined to be void or voidable (including, without limitation, for the benefit of any creditor of any Guarantor) or shall be subordinated to the claims of any Person (including, without limitation, any creditor of any Guarantor).
 
72
 
 
 
With respect to its obligations hereunder, each Guarantor hereby expressly waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment, protest and all notices whatsoever, and any requirement that the Administrative Agent or any Lender exhaust any right, power or remedy or proceed against any Person under any of the Credit Documents, any Hedging Agreement or Cash Management Agreement between the Borrower and any Lender, or any Affiliate of a Lender, or any other agreement or instrument referred to in the Credit Documents or such Hedging Agreements or Cash Management Agreements, or against any other Person under any other guarantee of, or security for, any of the Credit Party Obligations.
 
 
The obligations of the Guarantors under this
Section 4
shall be automatically reinstated if and to the extent that for any reason any payment by or on behalf of any Person in respect of the Credit Party Obligations is rescinded or must be otherwise restored by any holder of any of the Credit Party Obligations, whether as a result of any proceedings in bankruptcy or reorganization or otherwise, and each Guarantor agrees that it will indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender on demand for all reasonable costs and expenses (including, without limitation, fees and expenses of counsel) incurred by the Administrative Agent or such Lender in connection with such rescission or restoration, including any such costs and expenses incurred in defending against any claim alleging that such payment constituted a preference, fraudulent transfer or similar payment under any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law.
 
 
In the event that North Carolina law is determined to be controlling in any legal action or proceeding with respect to this
Section 4
notwithstanding the parties contractual choice of New York law pursuant to
Section 11.10(a)
, each Guarantor hereby specifically waives the benefits of N.C. Gen. Stat.  26-7 through 26-9, inclusive, to the extent applicable. Each Guarantor further agrees that such Guarantor shall have no right of recourse to security for the Credit Party Obligations, except through the exercise of rights of subrogation pursuant to
Section 4.2
and through the exercise of rights of contribution pursuant to
Section 4.6
.
 
 
The Guarantors agree that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, as between the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, on the other hand, the Credit Party Obligations may be declared to be forthwith due and payable as provided in
Section 9.2
(and shall be deemed to have become automatically due and payable in the circumstances provided in said
Section 9.2
) for purposes of
Section 4.1
notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such declaration (or preventing the Credit Party Obligations from becoming automatically due and payable) as against any other Person and that, in the event of such declaration (or the Credit Party Obligations being deemed to have become automatically due and payable), the Credit Party Obligations (whether or not due and payable by any other Person) shall forthwith become due and payable by the Guarantors for purposes of
Section 4.1
. The Guarantors acknowledge and agree that their obligations hereunder are secured in accordance with the terms of
 
73
 
 
 
the Collateral Documents and that the Lenders may exercise their remedies thereunder in accordance with the terms thereof.
 
 
The Guarantors hereby agree as among themselves that, if any Guarantor shall make an Excess Payment (as defined below), such Guarantor shall have a right of contribution from each other Guarantor in an amount equal to such other Guarantors Contribution Share (as defined below) of such Excess Payment. The payment obligations of any Guarantor under this
Section 4.6
shall be subordinate and subject in right of payment to the Credit Party Obligations until such time as the Credit Party Obligations have been Fully Satisfied, and none of the Guarantors shall exercise any right or remedy under this
Section 4.6
against any other Guarantor until such Credit Party Obligations have been Fully Satisfied. For purposes of this
Section 4.6
, (a) 
Excess Payment
 shall mean the amount paid by any Guarantor in excess of its Pro Rata Share of any Credit Party Obligations; (b) 
Pro Rata Share
 shall mean, for any Guarantor in respect of any payment of Credit Party Obligations, the ratio (expressed as a percentage) as of the date of such payment of Credit Party Obligations of (i) the amount by which the aggregate present fair salable value on a going concern basis of all of its assets and properties exceeds the amount of all debts and liabilities of such Guarantor (including contingent, subordinated, unmatured, and unliquidated liabilities, but excluding the obligations of such Guarantor hereunder) to (ii) the amount by which the aggregate present fair salable value on a going concern basis of all assets and other properties of all of the Credit Parties exceeds the amount of all of the debts and liabilities (including contingent, subordinated, unmatured, and unliquidated liabilities, but excluding the obligations of the Credit Parties hereunder) of the Credit Parties;
provided
,
however
, that, for purposes of calculating the Pro Rata Shares of the Guarantors in respect of any payment of Credit Party Obligations, any Guarantor that became a Guarantor subsequent to the date of any such payment shall be deemed to have been a Guarantor on the date of such payment and the financial information for such Guarantor as of the date such Guarantor became a Guarantor shall be utilized for such Guarantor in connection with such payment; and (e) 
Contribution Share
 shall mean, for any Guarantor in respect of any Excess Payment made by any other Guarantor, the ratio (expressed as a percentage) as of the date of such Excess Payment of (i) the amount by which the aggregate present fair salable value on a going concern basis of all of its assets and properties exceeds the amount of all debts and liabilities of such Guarantor (including contingent, subordinated, unmatured, and unliquidated liabilities, but excluding the obligations of such Guarantor hereunder) to (ii) the amount by which the aggregate present fair salable value on a going concern basis of all assets and other properties of the Credit Parties other than the maker of such Excess Payment exceeds the amount of all of the debts and liabilities (including contingent, subordinated, unmatured, and unliquidated liabilities, but excluding the obligations of the Credit Parties) of the Credit Parties other than the maker of such Excess Payment;
provided
,
however
, that, for purposes of calculating the Contribution Shares of the Guarantors in respect of any Excess Payment, any Guarantor that became a Guarantor subsequent to the date of any such Excess Payment shall be deemed to have been a Guarantor on the date of such Excess Payment and the financial information for such Guarantor as of the date such Guarantor became a Guarantor shall be utilized for such Guarantor in connection with such Excess Payment. This
Section 4.6

Sections 11.6
and

except that in the case of any collateral security held by the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders or the Issuing Lender under any of the Credit Documents, the retiring Administrative Agent shall continue to hold such collateral security until such time as a successor

SAN DIEGO  (March 4, 2010)  AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. (NYSE: AHS) today announced operating results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2009. Financial highlights are as follows:
(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)
* See notes (2) and (3) under Supplemental Financial and Operating Data for a reconciliation of non-GAAP items.
NM  Not meaningful
Im certain most would agree that 2009 represented the most challenging year in the history of the healthcare staffing industry. The unprecedented rise in unemployment and severe economic contraction wreaked havoc and resulted in precipitous drops in demand volumes unlike any other time.   However, amidst the turbulence, AMN took a proactive, disciplined and forward-looking approach to build stronger relationships with our customers and streamline our operating model and cost structure.  These efforts have resulted in strong adjusted EBITDA margins, improved gross margins and a healthy balance sheet, said Susan R. Nowakowski, President and Chief Executive Officer of AMN Healthcare. As we enter 2010, the industry is experiencing a period of stabilization, and AMN is poised to benefit from the managed services and preferred provider relationships we expanded over the past year, in addition to the operational synergies and agility we have achieved.
 
 
Full Year Business Highlights
For the fourth quarter of 2009, revenue was $145 million, a decrease of 51% from prior year and 13% from prior quarter. Fourth quarter revenue for the Nurse and Allied staffing segment was $74 million, a decrease of 64% from the same quarter last year and down 10% sequentially. The Locum Tenens staffing segment generated revenue of $63 million, a decrease of 18% from prior year and 17% from prior quarter. Fourth quarter Physician Permanent Placement revenue was $8 million, a decrease of 32% from prior year and 5% from prior quarter.
For the full year 2009, revenue was $760 million, a decrease of 38% from prior year. Nurse and Allied staffing segment revenue was $431 million, a decrease of 49% from prior year, Locum Tenens staffing segment revenue was $292 million, a decrease of 9% from prior year, and
Physician Permanent Place
ment segment revenue was $37 million, a decrease of 28% from prior year.
Gross margin in the fourth quarter of 2009 was 28.4%, an increase of 270 bps from prior year and an increase of 100 bps compared to the previous quarter, driven primarily by an increase in gross margin in the Nurse and Allied segment. Full year gross margin was 26.9%, as compared to 26.0% for prior year due to the Locum Tenens and Physician Permanent Placement segments representing a greater portion of our business mix, along with increases in gross margin across all business segments.

Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses for the fourth quarter of 2009 were 22% as a percentage of revenue compared to 19% in the same quarter last year. For the full year, SG&A expenses (excluding restructuring costs of $11.3 million) were 21% as a percentage of revenue, as compared to 19% for 2008. Fourth quarter SG&A declined by $23 million, or 41%, over the same period in the prior year, and sequentially by $5 million, or 12%, due largely to cost-saving initiatives taking hold.
The fourth quarter tax provision reflects a true-up of the effective state tax rates, which reduced the full year 2009 effective income tax benefit rate from 28% reported in the third quarter to 26%. This had the impact of reducing the full year 2009 income tax benefit to $43 million, as compared to income tax expense of $27 million for prior year, reflecting effective income tax rates of 26% and 44% for these periods, respectively. The year-over-year change in the effective income tax rate was primarily attributable to the goodwill impairment charges recorded during 2009, a portion of which were permanently nondeductible for tax purposes.
For the fourth quarter, the company recorded a GAAP loss per share of $0.08 which includes $0.06 related to debt refinancing charges. Full year GAAP loss per share was $3.75, including the negative impacts of $3.78 for impairment charges, $0.21 for restructuring charges, and $0.02 for non-recurring legal expenses, in addition to the $0.06 for refinancing related charges. Average shares outstanding for the fourth quarter and full year 2009 were 32.6 million.
As of December 31, 2009, cash and cash equivalents totaled $27 million, compared to $11 million as of December 31, 2008. On December 23, 2009, the company entered into a new credit agreement, which includes a $40.0 million secured revolving credit facility maturing in December 2012 and a $110.0 million secured term loan maturing in December 2013. As of December 31, 2009, total term debt outstanding, net of discount, was $106 million, with zero outstanding on the revolver.
Business Trends and Outlook
During the fourth quarter and going into the first quarter, Nurse and Allied traveler count began to show consistent, modest week-over-week increases, and demand was above prior year levels. In Locum Tenens, volume and demand experienced declines going into the fourth quarter, but future demand appears to have stabilized since November. In Physician Permanent Placement, fourth quarter search activity was sequentially lower, in line with typical seasonal trends. Despite the stabilizing trends across the business segments, overall demand is still at relatively low levels. The primary drivers continuing to constrain demand remain the high national unemployment rate, continued overall economic weakness, and stagnant admissions levels. Based on these factors, first quarter consolidated revenue is expected to be flat compared with the prior quarter. As we look at the sequential revenues and volumes in each of our three segments, Nurse & Allied appears to be the strongest with slight sequential growth expected, and the other business lines are projected to be flat to slightly down sequentially.

While the trajectory of the recovery continues to be difficult to predict, we believe that our comprehensive breadth of service offerings, our stronger client contractual relationships and operational agility leave AMN poised to capture market share and deliver better profitability as the trends improve, added Nowakowski. In addition, with our healthy balance sheet and recent debt refinancing, the company is well-positioned to focus on building future growth through long-term strategic investments in new synergistic opportunities to expand and diversify our business.

SAN DIEGO  (May 6, 2010)  AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. (NYSE: AHS) today announced operating results for the first quarter of 2010. Financial highlights are as follows:
(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)
* See note (2) under Supplemental Financial and Operating Data for a reconciliation of non-GAAP items.
NM  Not meaningful
Key business highlights for the first quarter are as follows:
During the first quarter, our Nurse and Allied segment delivered its first sequential revenue increase since 2008. This growth was offset by sequential decreases in our Locum Tenens and Physician Permanent Placement revenues, said Susan R. Nowakowski, President and Chief Executive Officer of AMN Healthcare. We spent considerable efforts during the last year building stronger client relationships, bolstering our vendor managed services offering and delivering innovative solutions. We believe these efforts are resonating with clients.
 
 
 
  
Despite these improved results,  to keep healthcare attrition rates and job openings at historically low levels, creating a temporary preference by clinicians  to work in full-time, permanent positions.  We remain cautious regarding the short-term growth trajectory and focused on leveraging the operational improvements we have made. We continue to prudently manage our margins and balance sheet, while still making investments in strategic opportunities to fuel our long-term growth.
factors such as high general unemployment continue
For the first quarter of 2010, revenue was $143 million, a decrease of 43% from prior year and 1% from prior quarter. First quarter revenue for the Nurse and Allied staffing segment was $75 million, a decrease of 54% from the same quarter last year and up 2% sequentially. The Locum Tenens staffing segment generated revenue of $60 million, a decrease of 19% from prior year and 3% from prior quarter. First quarter Physician Permanent Placement revenue was $8 million, a decrease of 30% from prior year and 7% from prior quarter.
Gross margin in the first quarter of 2010 was 27.9%, an increase of 230 bps from prior year and a decrease of 50 bps compared to the previous quarter. The increase as compared to prior year was driven primarily by an increase in gross margin in the Nurse and Allied segment. The decrease as compared to prior quarter was attributable to the anticipated slight sequential decrease in Nurse and Allied gross margin and the lower revenue mix from the relatively high margin physician business lines.
Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses for the first quarter of 2010 were 22% as a percentage of revenue compared to 20% in the same quarter last year. First quarter SG&A declined by $18 million, or 36%, over the same period in the prior year, and decreased slightly as compared to prior quarter, due largely to cost-saving initiatives taken during the past year.
As of March 31, 2010, cash and cash equivalents totaled $37 million, compared to $27 million as of December 31, 2009. Total term debt outstanding, net of discount, as of March 31, 2010  was $105 million, with zero outstanding on the revolver.

Business Trends and Outlook
 
Going into the second quarter, consolidated revenue is expected to be up 1-3% compared with the first quarter. While Nurse and Allied traveler count volume experienced a 5% sequential increase in the first volume is anticipated to be down slightly in the second quarter. In Locum Tenens, we expect an improvement in days filled, and in Physician Permanent Placement we are anticipating an increase in placements.

News Release Announcing Acquisition
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
SAN DIEGO, CA  July 28, 2010  AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. (NYSE: AHS), the nation's largest healthcare staffing and workforce solutions company, entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the parent company of Arlington, Texas-based Nursefinders, Inc. (dba Medfinders), one of the nation's leading providers of clinical workforce managed services programs. Through its multi-brand strategy, Medfinders also provides travel nurse and allied staffing, locum tenens, physician search services, and home healthcare services, as well as local nurse and allied staffing in support of its managed services programs.
"Bringing together the experience and diverse capabilities of both companies in healthcare staffing and managed services will create significant short and long-term benefits for our clients," said Susan Nowakowski, President and CEO of AMN Healthcare. "The expansion of our service lines resulting from this combination will substantially improve our ability to deliver an innovative, total workforce management and staffing solution to our broad and growing client base. This is a strategic opportunity for two leaders in healthcare staffing to come together to achieve additional sales and operating efficiencies while immediately enhancing and expanding our service offerings."
"This is an ideal combination for our clients, healthcare professionals, and team members," said Bob Livonius, CEO of Medfinders. "As an integrated and increasingly diverse company, we will be even more effective and efficient in delivering high quality and innovative workforce management solutions to our clients across the full spectrum of clinical specialties and services."
Under the terms of the agreement, AMN will acquire all of the outstanding equity of Medfinders' parent company for approximately 6.3 million shares of AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. common stock, and approximately 5.7 million shares of AMN Series A Conditional Convertible Preferred Stock with a liquidation preference of $10.00 per share and, a dividend rate of 11% per annum. Initially, the preferred stock will be non-voting and will not be convertible into shares of AMN common stock. Following the closing of the transaction, AMN shareholders will be asked to approve at a shareholders' meeting the voting rights of the preferred stock and the convertibility on a one-for-one basis. AMN expects to file a proxy statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission following the closing. If AMN's shareholders approve the conversion and the voting features of the preferred stock within 180 days of the closing of the transaction, the preferred stock shall cease to accrue dividends and any accrued dividends will be forgiven.
In connection with the transaction, AMN Healthcare is expect to refinance its existing Term B facility of approximately $107 million and pay off Medfinders' existing debt facilities totaling approximately $132 million. AMN Healthcare expects to amend and extend its current Term B loan and increase its balance by an estimated $68 million to $175 million and issue a second lien term loan of $50 million. In addition, AMN Healthcare expects to amend and extend its existing revolving credit facility, which is expected to be undrawn at closing.
Valuing all of the equity securities to be issued in the transaction using AMN Healthcare's closing share price on the day immediately preceding the execution of the definitive agreement, and assuming conversion of the preferred securities to be issued by AMN Healthcare, the transaction has a value of approximately $220 million (including approximately $132 million of Medfinders' indebtedness to be refinanced). Upon consummation of the transaction, former Medfinders' shareholders will own approximately 26% of AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. (on an as-converted, fully-diluted basis). The transaction, which is expected to be accretive to full year earnings in 2011, is expected to close in the third quarter of 2010, and is subject to customary closing conditions, regulatory approvals and receipt of debt financing.
"Our clients are seeking new, more sophisticated, value-added workforce solutions, and they desire a partner who can deliver a broad suite of offerings with their changing needs," noted Ms. Nowakowski. "The combined capabilities of AMN Healthcare and Medfinders will provide immediate benefit to our clients and position us to be a more capable, innovative partner.
"Expanding into home healthcare also represents an opportunity to capitalize on future growth in a fragmented industry that we anticipate, similar to our core staffing businesses, will be fueled by the long-term dynamics of an aging population. This acquisition advances our long-term strategy of leveraging our core competencies, operational infrastructure, and extensive network of clinicians seeking career opportunities at a local and national level. We believe the value, breadth and depth of services we can offer to our clients will be unparalleled within the industry."
Conference Call on July 29, 2010

RE:          AMN to Acquire Medfinders
AMN Announces Plan to Acquire Medfinders
Dear Team Members,
We have exciting news! This afternoon, we announced that AMN has signed a definitive agreement to purchase Nursefinders, Inc., (dba Medfinders). This acquisition marks yet another strategic milestone for us. Combining Medfinders, a leading national provider of clinical workforce managed services programs, nurse per diem staffing, physician locums and search, and travel allied staffing with AMN improves our ability to deliver an innovative, total solution to our diverse client base. Medfinders has also been developing a successful home healthcare division, which will enable AMN to achieve another long-term strategic goal of expanding into this important and growing patient care segment.
You will be hearing a lot more about the acquisition, integration plan and our more diverse sales strategy as we move toward closing the transaction during the third quarter.
As you can imagine, many leaders and team members have been working extremely hard to make this acquisition possible and I want to thank them again for their contributions to get us to this point. We do, however, have more work to do as we complete additional diligence before closing and as we begin the integration planning process; so I want to thank all of you who will be contributing to this endeavor in advance for what I know will be a rewarding, but busy next several months. We look forward to keeping you all posted as we reach milestones in this process.

Talking Points for AMN Healthcare Client Representatives
Was There an Acquisition Made by AMN Healthcare?
On July 28, 2010, AMN Healthcare entered into an agreement to acquire Medfinders, a leading national provider of clinical workforce managed services programs and healthcare staffing. Medfinders has multiple brands through which it provides travel nurse and allied staffing, per diem nurse staffing, locum tenens, physician search and home health services.

Why Are You Acquiring Medfinders?
Bringing together the experience of both companies will provide AMN Healthcare with the ability to provide more quality clinicians and broader solutions to our clients.

At the same time, Medfinders' clients will also have expanded access to our Physician Retained Search and Recruitment Process Outsourcing capabilities.

We hope to be able to help you and our other clients reach more of your patient care, quality and cost goals as a result of this strategic acquisition. Throughout this acquisition process and beyond, we will continue to provide you with the same high-quality, personalized service you have come to expect from AMN Healthcare.

Will I have Access to More Services or Healthcare Professionals?
The combined capabilities of AMN Healthcare and Medfinders will give you access to more candidates and enable us to be a more innovative partner with you. We will have more details about services and solutions for our clients once the acquisition is complete.
How Can I Learn More About This?
You can visit the AMN Healthcare Web site to read the news release about the definitive agreement. We also have an archived investor call about the agreement, which is accessible via our Investor page on the AMN Healthcare Web site.
What are the Next Steps?
The transaction is expected to close August 31, 2010, and will be subject to the customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. Until closing, AMN and Medfinders will continue to function as two separate entities. We will communicate more information to you and all of our clients in the coming weeks as it becomes available.
In the meantime, we are conducting business as usual and want to do everything possible to meet your current and future needs. How can I help in that capacity?

Key business highlights for the second quarter are as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
The industry appears to be entering a modest recovery phase, with second quarter consolidated revenues growing sequentially for the first time in seven quarters, and exceeding our expectations due to better than anticipated volumes, said Susan R. Nowakowski, President and Chief Executive Officer of AMN Healthcare. Although we are experiencing positive indicators and steady progress, we retain a conservative view of the near-term trajectory for healthcare staffing due to the continued high general unemployment and apprehension in the economic environment. We continue to be positive about the industrys long-term growth prospects and are positioning our service offerings to meet the strategic needs of our clients and their growth and financial objectives.
 
 
In support of its long-term strategy, AMN Healthcare announced earlier today that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the parent company of Nursefinders, Inc. (dba Medfinders), the nations leading provider of clinical workforce managed services programs. Through its multi-brand strategy, Medfinders also provides travel nurse and allied staffing, locum tenens, physician search services, and home healthcare services, as well as local nurse and allied staffing in support of its managed services programs. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2010, and additional details of the agreement can be found in a separate press release issued today.
This acquisition is a natural step in our long-term growth strategy as it directly contributes to the delivery of greater value and innovative workforce solutions to our clients. In addition to enhancing the capabilities of our existing businesses and expanding into new complementary service lines, we will also be able to achieve immediate sales and operating efficiencies.  We believe this is the perfect addition to AMN to enhance shareholder value in both the short and long term, added Nowakowski.
Second Quarter 2010 Results
 
For the second quarter of 2010, revenue was $149 million, a decrease of 25% from prior year and up 4% from prior quarter. Second quarter revenue for the Nurse and Allied staffing segment was $76 million, a decrease of 32% from the same quarter last year and up 1% sequentially. The Locum Tenens staffing segment generated revenue of $65 million, a decrease of 17% from prior year and up 8% sequentially. Second quarter Physician Permanent Placement revenue was $8 million, a decrease of 7% from prior year and up 8% sequentially.
Gross margin in the second quarter of 2010 was 27.6%, an increase of 60 bps from prior year and a decrease of 30 bps compared to the previous quarter. The improvement as compared to the prior year was driven primarily by an increase in gross margin in the Nurse and Allied segment and the increased revenue mix from the higher margin Physician Permanent Placement segment. The decrease as compared to prior quarter was mainly attributable to a decrease in Nurse and Allied gross margin.
 
2
 
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses for the second quarter of 2010 were 23% as a percentage of revenue compared to 19% in the same quarter last year. Second quarter SG&A declined by $3 million, or 9%, over the same period in the prior year, and increased by $3 million, or 8%, as compared to the prior quarter, due in part to acquisition-related costs incurred during the quarter.
As of June 30, 2010, cash and cash equivalents totaled $41 million, compared to $27 million as of December 31, 2009. Total term debt outstanding, net of discount, as of June 30, 2010 was $104 million, with no borrowings on the revolver portion of the credit facility.
Business Trends and Outlook
 
Going into the third quarter, demand continues to trend up slightly across all business lines. With all business segments anticipating sequential improvement in volumes, consolidated revenue is expected to be up 4-6% compared with the second quarter, excluding the impact of any acquisitions. Gross margin is anticipated to remain sequentially steady.

INDEX TO EXHIBITS
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
Since we have not closed the transaction yet, we cannot comment on the specific debt interest rates we contemplate, but we can update you on the proposed debt structure which has changed slightly from our press release announcing the transaction. Initially, we proposed to amend and extend our current senior facilities to increase the Term B facility to $175 million and permit the issuance of $50 million in a second lien. As a result of the syndication process, we have increased the Term B facility to $185 million and lowered the second lien to $40 million. With regard to the rates, preliminary indications from potential lenders have been consistent with our original expectations on a weighted average basis. With respect to the underlying covenants, the room contemplated relative to the overall debt is consistent with the covenants of our recent refinancing.
 
 
 
Part of Medfinders' success has been its strategic approach of selectively establishing local offices only in locations where they have managed services contracts. This practice met the specific preference some healthcare facilities have of selecting a provider with a local per diem presence as their MSP vendor. At the same time, Medfinders differentiated itself from pure-play per diem companies by keeping its infrastructure from being overburdened with local offices that do not benefit from the synergistic demand created by MSP contracts.
 
 
 
 
Throughout the acquisition process, we engaged the New York Stock Exchange and advised them of the acquisition structure and terms, notably, the terms and conditions of the preferred securities, including the liquidation preference, dividend rate and convertibility, and have not received any expressions of concern or objection.

On September 1, 2010, AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. ("AMN") completed its acquisition of NF Investors, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("NFI"), the parent company of Nursefinders, Inc. (dba Medfinders), one of the nation's leading providers of clinical workforce managed services programs. As contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated July 28, 2010, by and among AMN, Nightingale Acquisition, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of AMN ("Merger Sub"), Nightingale Acquisition, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly owned subsidiary of AMN ("LLC Sub"), NFI and GSUIG, L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company "GSUIG") (in its capacity as the representative of the NFI stockholders), as amended by Amendment No. 1 (as defined below) (the "Merger Agreement"), Merger Sub merged with and into NFI, with NFI continuing as the surviving corporation (the "Merger") and, immediately thereafter, NFI (as the surviving corporation of the Merger) merged with and into LLC Sub, with LLC Sub continuing as the surviving company and as a wholly owned subsidiary of AMN.
(
On August 29, 2010, AMN, Merger Sub, LLC Sub, NFI and GSUIG entered in Amendment No. 1 to Agreement and Plan of Merger ("Amendment No. 1") to provide that NFI shall indemnify AMN and its affiliates from any and all losses based upon, relating to, arising out of or resulting from a certain settlement agreement entered into by NFI and certain of its then-existing stockholders. The foregoing description of Amendment No. 1 does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to Amendment No. 1, which is filed as Exhibit 2.2 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.
Registration Rights Agreement
On September 1, 2010, in connection with the consummation of the Merger, AMN and certain former NFI stockholders and affiliates who received AMN common stock and Series A Conditional Convertible Preferred Stock of AMN (the "Preferred Stock"), in connection with the Merger entered into a registration rights agreement (the "Registration Rights Agreement") pursuant to which AMN granted to such persons and their permitted assignees and pledgees certain registration rights with respect to the shares of AMN common stock issued as consideration for the Merger and issuable upon conversion of the shares of Preferred Stock.
Under the Registration Rights Agreement, no later than December 30, 2010, if AMN is eligible to use Form S-3 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), AMN will use Form S-3 to register all of the shares of common stock issued to, and all of the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock issued to, certain former NFI stockholders and affiliates in connection with the Merger. If AMN is not eligible to use Form S-3 at any time after March 1, 2011, certain former NFI stockholders and affiliates who received common stock and Preferred Stock in connection with the Merger are entitled to two demand registrations provided
that any such demand registration must have an anticipated aggregate offering price to the public of at least $20,000,000, or less than $20,000,000 if such demand registration includes the remainder of the securities covered by the Registration Rights Agreement. Beginning on March 1, 2011, certain former NFI stockholders and affiliates who received common stock and Preferred Stock in connection with the Merger are also entitled to unlimited piggyback rights on any registrations by AMN for its own account or the account of another stockholder, subject to certain exceptions. The foregoing registration rights are subject to customary limitations and exceptions, including AMN's right to defer the registration in certain circumstances and certain cutbacks by the underwriters if the offering would have a material adverse effect on the distribution or the sales price of the common stock in the offering.
In connection with the registrations described above, AMN has agreed to indemnify any selling stockholders, and AMN will bear all fees, costs and expenses (except underwriting discounts and selling commissions).
The foregoing description of the Registration Rights Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Registration Rights Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 4.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.
Amendment to Credit Agreement
On September 1, 2010, AMN Healthcare, Inc. (the "Borrower"), AMN, certain subsidiaries of AMN, as guarantors, Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and certain lenders (the "First Lien Lenders") entered into a First Amendment (the "First Amendment") to the Credit Agreement dated December 23, 2009 of the Borrower and AMN (the "First Lien Credit Agreement"). The First Amendment, among other things, (a) extends the maturity date of the revolver portion of the First Lien Credit Agreement from December 23, 2012 to August 31, 2014, (b) extends the maturity date with respect to the Tranche B term loan portion of the First Lien Credit Agreement from December 23, 2013 to June 23, 2015, (c) increases the Tranche B term loan portion of the First Lien Credit Agreement by an additional $77,750,000, resulting in an aggregate principal amount of the Tranche B term loan portion of the First Lien Credit Agreement of $185,000,000, (d) changes the pricing of both the revolver portion and the Tranche B term loan portion of the First Lien Credit Agreement as described below, (e) adjusts the scheduled amortization of the Tranche B term loan portion of the First Lien Credit Agreement as described below, (e) adjusts certain of the financial covenants and adds a Minimum Liquidity and a Consolidated First Lien Leverage Ratio covenant and (f) permits the incurrence of indebtedness under the Second Lien Credit Agreement (as defined below).
On September 1, 2010, the Borrower borrowed $77,750,000 under the First Lien Credit Agreement, which represents the increase in the Tranche B term loan portion of the First Lien Credit Agreement. The proceeds from such increase, along with the proceeds from the Second Lien Credit Facility, were used to repay all outstanding indebtedness of NFI and to pay transaction costs relating to the Merger Agreement.
The revolver portion of the First Lien Credit Agreement, which can be drawn up to an amount of $40,000,000, will carry an unused fee of 0.75% per annum. Borrowings under the revolver portion of the First Lien Credit Agreement will bear interest at floating rates based upon either a LIBOR or a prime interest rate option selected by the Borrower, plus a spread of 5.50% and 4.50%, respectively. As part of the transaction, the Company is not planning to draw upon the revolver portion of the First Lien Credit Agreement. Borrowings under the Tranche B term loan portion of the First Lien Credit Agreement will bear interest at floating rates based upon either a LIBOR (with a LIBOR floor of 1.75%) or a prime interest rate option selected by the Borrower, plus a spread of 5.50% and 4.50%, respectively.
There are no mandatory reductions in the revolving commitment under the revolver portion of the First Lien Credit Agreement. The Tranche B term loan portion of the First Lien Credit Agreement will be subject to quarterly amortization of principal (in equal installments), with an amount equal to 5% of the initial aggregate principal amount of the Tranche B term loan in the first year, 10% of the initial aggregate principal amount of the Tranche B term loan in the second year and 15% of the Tranche B term loan in the third and forth years with any remaining amounts payable quarterly thereafter until the maturity date on June 23, 2015. The Borrower is required to make additional customary mandatory prepayments with the proceeds of certain asset dispositions, extraordinary receipts, debt issuances and equity issuances, as well as a percentage of the annual excess cash flow. Additionally, pursuant to the First Amendment, in connection with any prepayment of the Tranche B term loan with the proceeds of certain indebtedness consummated prior to the first anniversary of the effective date, the Borrower will pay a premium in an amount equal to 1.0% of the aggregate principal amount of the Tranche B term loans prepaid.
The foregoing description of the First Amendment is a summary and does not contain all of the exceptions and qualifications that may apply. The foregoing description of the First Amendment is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual agreement which will be filed with the SEC with AMN's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2010.
Certain of the First Lien Lenders and their affiliates have provided, and may in the future provide, various investment banking, commercial banking and other financial services for us for which services they have received, and may in the future receive, customary fees.
Second Lien Credit Agreement
On September 1, 2010, the Borrower, AMN and certain subsidiaries of AMN entered into a Second Lien Credit Agreement (the "Second Lien Credit Agreement") with certain lenders (the "Second Lien Lenders") and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent for the Second Lien Lenders, to provide for a $40,000,000 second lien secured term loan facility (the "Second Lien Credit Facility"). AMN and each domestic subsidiary of AMN (collectively, the "Guarantors") have guaranteed the obligations of the Borrower under the Second Lien Credit Agreement.
On September 1, 2010, the Borrower borrowed the full amount of the term loan under the Second Lien Credit Facility and used the proceeds along with the proceeds from Tranche B term loan to repay all outstanding indebtedness of NFI and to pay transaction costs relating to the Merger Agreement.
Borrowings under the Second Lien Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Borrower and the Guarantors. The liens securing the Second Lien Credit Agreement are subject to the provisions of an intercreditor agreement, which provides different rights as to lien priority, enforcement, procedural provisions and other similar matters for the benefit of the First Lien Lenders and Second Lien Lenders.
The maturity date of the Second Lien Credit Facility is September 1, 2016. The full principal amount of the Second Lien Credit Facility is payable on the maturity date.
Borrowings under the Second Lien Credit Facility bear interest at floating rates based upon either a LIBOR (with a LIBOR floor of 1.75%) or a prime interest rate option selected by the Borrower, plus a spread of 10.00% and 9.00%, respectively.
The Borrower is required to make customary mandatory prepayments of the Second Lien Credit Facility with the proceeds of certain asset dispositions, extraordinary receipts, debt issuances and equity issuances. The Borrower is also required to make excess cash flow mandatory prepayments of the Second Lien Credit Facility within ninety days after the end of each fiscal year, commencing with the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011, in an amount to be determined based on AMN's Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Second Lien Credit Agreement), less any voluntary prepayments of the Second Lien Credit Facility or any loans under the First Lien Credit Agreement made during the fiscal year. All such mandatory prepayments are only required to the extent all obligations under the First Lien Credit Agreement have been paid in full and the commitments to make additional credit extensions thereunder have been terminated.
No voluntary prepayments, or mandatory prepayments with the proceeds of certain debt issuances, of the Second Lien Credit Facility are permitted during the first 18 months following the closing date. Thereafter, prepayments are permitted subject to a premium, which initially is 103% of the principal amount of loans prepaid and decreases over time.
The Second Lien Credit Agreement contains various customary affirmative and negative covenants and also contains financial covenants that require the Borrower to maintain a maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio and a minimum Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (each as defined in the Second Lien Credit
Agreement). The payment obligations under the Second Lien Credit Agreement may also be accelerated upon the occurrence of customary events of default. During the continuation of an event of default, the Borrower must pay interest at a default rate that is 2% greater than the rate that would otherwise be applicable.
The foregoing description of the Second Lien Credit Agreement is a summary and does not contain all of the exceptions and qualifications that may apply. The foregoing description of the Second Lien Credit Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual agreement which will be filed with the SEC with AMN's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2010.
Certain of the Second Lien Lenders and their affiliates have provided, and may in the future provide, various investment banking, commercial banking and other financial services for us for which services they have received, and may in the future receive, customary fees.
 
As noted in Item 1.01 to this Current Report on Form 8-K, on September 1, 2010, AMN completed its acquisition of NFI. As contemplated by the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub merged with and into NFI, with NFI continuing as the surviving corporation and, immediately thereafter, NFI (as the surviving corporation of the Merger) merged with and into LLC Sub, with LLC Sub continuing as the surviving company and as a wholly owned subsidiary of AMN. A copy of the press release issued by AMN describing the completion of the Merger is attached as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
As consideration for the Merger, NFI stockholders received (i) 6,300,000 newly issued shares of AMN common stock and (ii) 5,432,570.9 shares of the newly created Preferred Stock, subject to adjustments for certain post-closing purchase price adjustments and indemnification obligations, the terms of which are described below. Collectively, the shares of common stock and Preferred Stock (assuming conversion thereof into common stock) issued in connection with the Merger represent approximately 26% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of AMN.
At the closing, an amount equal to a determined amount that for calculation purposes is assumed to be $16,000,000 (represented by 1,454,545 shares of Preferred Stock) was deposited in escrow to satisfy any indemnification claims by AMN against NFI with respect to breaches of representations, warranties and covenants by NFI. Any shares of Preferred Stock remaining in escrow (net of any shares of Preferred Stock returned to AMN in satisfaction of any indemnification claims by AMN against NFI) will be released to former NFI stockholders two years after the closing of the Merger. Additionally, an amount that for calculation purposes is assumed to be equal to $3,000,000 (represented by 272,727 shares of Preferred Stock) was also deposited in escrow until settlement of certain post-closing purchase price adjustments and any outstanding appraisal claims by NFI stockholders. Any shares of Preferred Stock
remaining in escrow following the resolution of any and all post-closing purchase price adjustments and outstanding appraisal claims will be released to former NFI stockholders.
Under the Merger Agreement, AMN agreed to pay certain obligations of NFI at the closing of the Merger (including the fees and expenses related to the Merger) in exchange for a corresponding reduction in the merger consideration payable to NFI's stockholders in the Merger. Included in these obligations were a transaction fee equal to $2,500,000 that NFI owed to certain of its stockholders or affiliates of certain stockholders for advisory services rendered to NFI in connection with the Merger, and a fee equal to $916,667 that NFI owed to certain of its stockholders or affiliates of certain stockholders for management services provided to NFI prior to the Merger pursuant to a management services agreement, which was terminated at the closing of the Merger. Both of the fees were payable by NFI in consideration for services rendered to NFI prior to the closing of the Merger. These fees were not for services provided to AMN. Furthermore, there are no continuing obligations owed by Haas Wheat & Partners Incorporated, GSUIG or any other stockholder to NFI or AMN under these services arrangements following the closing of the Merger. As a result, at the closing of the Merger, AMN issued 227,272 shares of Preferred Stock in satisfaction of NFI's obligations to pay the transaction fee that for purposes of the calculation is assumed to equal $2,500,000, and AMN also paid $916,667 in cash in satisfaction of NFI's obligations pursuant to the management services agreement. As part of these payments, GSUIG, which owned approximately 48% of the stock of NFI prior to the Merger, and Haas Wheat & Partners Incorporated, an affiliate of a stockholder that owned approximately 23% of NFI prior to the Merger, each received $305,555.67 and 102,272.4 shares of Preferred Stock.
Preferred Stock
AMN's certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share. On August 31, 2010, in connection with the Merger, AMN filed a Certificate of Designations of Series A Conditional Convertible Preferred Stock (the "Certificate of Designations") with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, which set forth the terms, rights, obligations and preferences of the shares of Preferred Stock.
The Preferred Stock is entitled to receive any dividends payable on AMN common stock. In addition, the Preferred Stock accrues dividends at a rate of 11.00% per annum, commencing on September 1, 2010, until AMN's stockholders approve the conversion and voting rights of the Preferred Stock (the "Preferred Stock Proposal"). At the option of AMN, such accrued dividends can be paid in cash or added to the liquidation preference of the Preferred Stock. If AMN stockholder approval is obtained within 180 days following the closing of the Merger, all dividends on the Preferred Stock that previously accrued at the rate of 11.00% per annum will be forgiven.
With respect to dividend rights and distribution rights upon liquidation, winding-up or dissolution of AMN, the Preferred Stock ranks (i) senior to AMN common stock and any other class or series of capital stock of AMN that ranks junior to the Preferred Stock and (ii) pari passu with each other class or series of preferred stock established after the date of issuance of the Preferred Stock, the terms of which do not expressly provide that such class or series will rank senior or junior to the Preferred Stock as to dividend rights and distribution rights upon liquidation, winding-up or dissolution of AMN (in each case, without regard to whether dividends accrue cumulatively or non-cumulatively).
In the event (i) AMN, voluntarily or involuntarily, liquidates, dissolves, or winds up or (ii) an event of change of control occurs with respect to AMN, holders of the Preferred Stock issued in connection with the Merger will be entitled to receive, for each share of Preferred Stock, an amount equal to the greater of (x) $10.00 (as adjusted to reflect fully the appropriate effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into AMN common stock), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or similar change with respect to AMN common stock or Preferred Stock) plus an amount per share equal to accrued but unpaid dividends and (y) the per share amount of all cash or property to be distributed in respect of AMN common stock that such holder would have been entitled to receive had such holder converted such Preferred Stock immediately prior to such liquidation, dissolution, winding-up or change of control.
If, in connection with any distribution described above, the assets of AMN or proceeds thereof are not sufficient to pay the liquidation preferences in full to all holders of Preferred Stock and all holders of parity stock, the amounts paid to the holders of Preferred Stock and to the holders of all such other parity stock will be paid pro rata in accordance with the respective aggregate liquidation preferences of the holders of Preferred Stock and the holders of all such other parity stock.
Prior to the approval of the Preferred Stock Proposal, the Preferred Stock is not entitled to vote except as required by applicable law. At any time after the approval of the Preferred Stock Proposal, the holders of the Preferred Stock are entitled to vote with the holders of AMN common stock on an as-converted basis. Notwithstanding whether or not the Preferred Stock Proposal has been approved, the holders of the Preferred Stock are entitled to receive notice of any stockholders meeting delivered to the holders of AMN common stock in accordance with AMN's by-laws and to otherwise receive all other notices and information made available or delivered by AMN to the holders of AMN common stock.
If the Preferred Stock Proposal has not been approved by the tenth anniversary of the closing of the Merger, the shares of Preferred Stock may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at any time on or after such date, at the option of AMN, at a redemption price per share of Preferred Stock equal to the greater of (x) the sum of (a) $10.00 (as adjusted to reflect fully the appropriate effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into
AMN common stock), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or similar change with respect to AMN common stock or Preferred Stock) plus (b) an amount per share of Preferred Stock equal to the accrued and unpaid dividends, if any, with respect to the shares of Preferred Stock to but excluding the date fixed for such redemption, and (y) the product of (a) the Market Price per share of AMN common stock and (b) the number of shares of AMN common stock that such holder of Preferred Stock would have been entitled to receive had it converted each such share of Preferred Stock (whether or not such holder of Preferred Stock had been eligible to convert its shares of Preferred Stock on such redemption date). The term "Market Price" means the average closing price of AMN common stock for the 10 consecutive trading days immediately preceding, but not including, the date as of which the Market Price is to be determined.
In compliance with the New York Stock Exchange rules and regulations, the Preferred Stock is not convertible prior to the approval of the Preferred Stock Proposal. If the Preferred Stock Proposal is approved, then each share of the Preferred Stock will be convertible into one share of AMN common stock at the option of the holder.
The conversion rate of the shares of Preferred Stock is subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. Subject to certain exceptions, these anti-dilution adjustments, which are further described in the Certificate of Designations, will apply if: (i) AMN issues capital stock as a dividend or makes a distribution (other than ordinary course of dividend on shares of common stock) on the outstanding shares of common stock or if AMN effects a share split or share combination in respect of shares of common stock; (ii) AMN distributes cash, evidence of indebtedness of AMN or another issuer, securities of AMN or another issuer, other assets or rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase securities of AMN (excluding those in respect of which as adjustment is made pursuant to (i) above) to all holders of common stock; or (iii) AMN takes any action affecting the common stock similar to or having an effect similar to the actions described in (i) or (ii) above and the board of directors of AMN determines in good faith that it would be equitable in the circumstances to adjust the conversion rate. However, no adjustments will be made unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 1.00% of the conversion rate then in effect.
Furthermore, if stockholder approval is obtained, each share of Preferred Stock will automatically convert into shares of AMN common stock if the trading price of AMN common stock is greater than or equal to $10.00 (as adjusted to reflect fully the appropriate effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into AMN common stock), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or similar change with respect to AMN common stock or Preferred Stock) per share for 30 consecutive trading days following the stockholder approval. In such case, each share of Preferred Stock will be converted into the number of shares of common stock equal to the quotient of (x) the sum of (A) $10.00 (as adjusted to reflect fully the appropriate effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into AMN common stock), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or similar change with respect to AMN common stock or Preferred Stock) plus (B) except to the extent
paid in cash at the time of the conversion, an amount per share of Preferred Stock equal to the accrued but unpaid dividends, if any, to which such holder of shares of Preferred Stock is entitled to receive through, but excluding, the conversion date, divided by (y) 10 (as adjusted to reflect fully the appropriate effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into AMN common stock), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or similar change with respect to AMN common stock or Preferred Stock).
The foregoing description of the Preferred Stock set forth in the Certificate of Designations does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Certificate of Designations, which is filed as Exhibit 3.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.
 
The information set forth in Item 1.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is incorporated into this Item 2.03 by reference.
 
The information set forth in Item 2.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is incorporated into this Item 3.02 by reference.
In connection with the Merger, AMN issued employment inducement awards in the form of grants of 88,553 restricted stock units ("RSUs") in the aggregate and 152,311 stock appreciation rights ("SARs") in the aggregate to eleven key employees of Medfinders. The RSUs are subject to a three year cliff vesting, except that they may vest on an accelerated basis if AMN achieves certain operating plan targets. The SARs vest ratably over three years.
The issuance and sale of the securities described above and in Item 2.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K were made in reliance on exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act pursuant to Section 4(2) thereof. AMN has not and will not engage in a general solicitation or general advertising with regard to the issuance and sale of such securities and has not and will not offer securities to the public in connection with the issuance and sale of such securities.
 
In connection with the Merger described above and as contemplated by that certain stockholders agreement entered into on July 28, 2010 in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement and previously filed with the SEC, on September 1, 2010, the board of directors of AMN appointed each of Messrs. Wyche H. Walton and Martin Chavez to serve as directors of AMN.
As new, non-employee directors, Messrs. Walton and Chavez each received 6,275 restricted stock units and 5,397 stock appreciation rights, to purchase shares of AMN common stock at an exercise price of $4.55, the fair market value, based on the average price on August 31, 2010, and will receive a pro-rated annual retainer of $29,167.
At this time, the directors have not been appointed to serve on any committees.
Pursuant to the stockholders agreement, certain former NFI stockholders who received common stock and Preferred Stock in connection with the Merger had the right to nominate, at the effective time of the Merger, two directors to AMN's board of directors to serve until the first annual or special meeting of stockholders of AMN at which directors are to be elected. Mr. Walton and Mr. Chavez were appointed as the initial directors. However, (i) if HWP Capital Partners II, L.P. (one of such former NFI stockholders) holds less than 5% (on an as-converted basis) of AMN's issued and outstanding capital stock at any time prior to such special or annual meeting of stockholders, then AMN has the right to remove Mr. Walton from the board of directors and (ii) if GSUIG (one of such former NFI stockholders) holds less than 10% (on an as-converted basis) of AMN's issued and outstanding capital stock at any time prior to such special or annual meeting of stockholders, then AMN has the right to remove Mr. Chavez from the board of directors. Furthermore, for as long as GSUIG holds 10% or more of AMN's issued and outstanding capital stock (on an as-converted basis), GSUIG has the right to nominate one director to AMN's board of directors.
Mr. Chavez is a managing director of Goldman, Sachs & Co., an affiliate of GSUIG. Mr. Walton is a managing director of HWP Capital Partners II, L.P. in which he has an equity interest, and a managing director of Haas Wheat & Partners Incorporated, which is an affiliate of HWP Capital Partners II, L.P. HWP Capital Partners II, L.P. was a significant stockholder of NFI, and Haas Wheat & Partners, Inc. received a management and transaction fee from NFI under the Merger Agreement. For a description of the merger transaction and certain related transactions, see Item 2.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K.
 
As more fully described in Item 2.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K, on August 31, 2010, AMN filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a Certificate of Designations Series A Conditional Convertible Preferred Stock, designating six million shares of previously authorized preferred stock as Series A Conditional Convertible Preferred Stock. The terms of the Preferred Stock are described in Item 2.01 of this
Current Report on Form 8-K and such information is incorporated herein by reference. This description does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Certificate of Designations of the Preferred Stock, which is filed as Exhibit 3.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.

Exhibit 99.1
SAN DIEGO, September 1 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/  AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. (NYSE: AHS), the nation's largest healthcare staffing and workforce solutions company, announced the completion of the acquisition of the parent company of Arlington, Texas-based Nursefinders, Inc. (dba Medfinders), one of the nation's leading providers of clinical workforce managed services programs. Medfinders also provides local and travel nurse and allied staffing, locum tenens, physician search services, and home healthcare services.
"This is an exciting milestone in the continuing evolution of AMN Healthcare as a leading provider of innovative, total workforce management and staffing solutions to our healthcare clients," said Susan Salka (formerly Nowakowski), President and CEO of AMN Healthcare. "In addition to leveraging and building on our capabilities in our core businesses of travel healthcare staffing, locum tenens, and physician permanent placement, we are able to immediately bolster our managed services capabilities, which are increasingly preferred by clients today. This acquisition also gives us the instant ability to enter into home healthcare services, in sync with our long-term strategy of diversification into new synergistic healthcare service segments.
"We believe this acquisition enhances our shareholder value due to the considerable cost synergies projected to be achieved through leveraging the existing infrastructure of our organization and the benefit of immediate opportunity to directly fill existing demand at our collective MSP clients. We expect this transaction to be accretive in 2011 with annualized cost synergies in excess of $8 million and revenue synergies with an EBITDA benefit in excess of $2 million by the fourth quarter of 2011."
"Our sales and operations teams are excited to be in the marketplace, serving our clients with the strength of the combined companies behind them," said Bob Livonius, former CEO of Medfinders and newly named AMN President of Strategic Workforce Solutions. "We are better
 
equipped to provide the full spectrum of clinical specialties and innovative workforce solutions to help our clients meet their patient care and efficiency goals. Both companies have experience and solid track records of successfully integrating acquisitions, and our teams are working very collaboratively to achieve the synergies and benefits of the combination.
"As the leading clinical managed services provider (MSP) for hospitals in the United States, Medfinders will instantly expand AMN's capabilities and presence in this increasingly important outsourcing option. In the short-term, the combination will significantly increase the company's ability to directly fulfill the needs of existing MSP clients. Longer-term, AMN Healthcare will be able to share, implement and leverage best practices across the newly combined organization to innovate and deliver more MSP and workforce management solutions as demand for such services continues to grow."
Mr. Livonius is assuming responsibility for the combined organization's Workforce Management Solutions and will be overseeing all of AMN's MSP and local/per diem staffing operations and development while also continuing to lead the support and expansion of the Home Healthcare Services division. Among other key Medfinders employees who are assuming leadership positions in the combined company are Denise Deans-Graf, President of Local Staffing, and Linda Sheffield, President of Home Healthcare Services.
In connection with the transaction, AMN Healthcare amended and extended its current Term B senior facility, increasing its balance to $185 million with a new maturity in 2015, and issued a second lien term loan of $40 million that will mature in 2016. The company also amended and extended its existing revolving credit facility, which remained undrawn at closing. The amended and extended Term B senior facility is priced with a LIBOR rate plus 5.50% and the second lien term loan facility is priced with a LIBOR rate plus 10.00%, each with a 1.75% LIBOR floor.
At the close of the transaction, AMN acquired all of the outstanding equity of Medfinders in exchange for approximately 6.3 million shares of AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. common stock and approximately 5.7 million shares of non-voting Series A Conditional Convertible Preferred Stock with a liquidation preference of $10.00 per share and a dividend rate of 11% per annum.
 
AMN will file a proxy statement with the SEC with respect to a special meeting of its stockholders that will be called to obtain stockholder approval of the conversion and voting rights provisions of the preferred stock. If AMN's stockholders approve the conversion and the voting rights provisions of the preferred stock within 180 days following the closing of the transaction, the preferred stock will cease to accrue dividends and all previously accrued dividends will be forgiven. Valuing all of the equity securities issued in the transaction using AMN Healthcare's closing share price on the day immediately preceding the closing of the acquisition, and assuming conversion of the preferred stock issued by AMN Healthcare into common stock (on a one-for-one basis), the transaction has a value of approximately $186 million (including the approximately $133 million of refinanced Medfinders' indebtedness). Assuming a conversion of the preferred stock, the former Medfinders stockholders will own approximately 26% of AMN Healthcare Services, Inc.
In connection with the acquisition, AMN issued employment inducement awards in the form of grants of restricted stock units (RSUs) and stock appreciation rights (SARs) to eleven key employees of Medfinders in the aggregate amount of 241,000 shares. The RSUs will vest in three years, except that they may vest on an accelerated basis if the company achieves certain financial targets. The SARs vest ratably over three years.

The Stockholders
NF Investors, Inc.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of NF Investors, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Successor Company) as of January 3, 2010 and December 28, 2008, and the related consolidated statements of operations, cash flows, and stockholders' equity and comprehensive income (loss) for the operating periods from December 29, 2008 through January 3, 2010, December 31, 2007 through December 28, 2008, and August 8, 2007 through December 30, 2007 (the Operating Periods) for the Successor Company. We have also audited the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and cash flows for Nursefinders, Inc. (the Predecessor Company) for the operating period from January 1, 2007 through August 9, 2007 (the Predecessor Operating Period). These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the NF Investors, Inc.'s and Nursefinders, Inc.'s (the Company's) management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of NF Investors, Inc., and subsidiaries at January 3, 2010, and December 28, 2008, and the consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the Operating Periods then ended and the Operating Period ended December 30, 2007, and the consolidated results of operations and cash flows of Nursefinders, Inc. for the Predecessor Operating Period from January 1, 2007 through August 9, 2007, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

1. Organization and Business
NF Investors, Inc. (NFI) (the Successor Company), a Delaware corporation, was formed on August 8, 2007, in connection with the acquisition of the outstanding stock of NFAC on August 9, 2007, by NFI's wholly owned subsidiary, NF Holdings, Inc. (Holdings). Holdings directly or indirectly owns 100% of Nursefinders, Inc.; Club Staffing, Inc.; Linde Healthcare Staffing, Inc. (Linde); National Healthcare Staffing, L.L.C.; Radiologic Enterprises, Inc. (ROC); B.C.P. Inc.; and NF Services, Inc.
Nursefinders, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Predecessor Company), a Texas corporation, was a wholly owned subsidiary of Nursefinders Acquisition Corporation (NFAC), which was a wholly owned subsidiary of NF Acquisition Corporation (NAC). The Predecessor Company owned 100% of B.C.P., Inc., NF Services, Inc., Linde Healthcare Staffing, Inc. and Jim Kendall & Associates, LLC (collectively Linde) and Staffco Holdings, Inc (Club Staffing).
The Company refers to the operations of the Successor and Predecessor Companies.
Effective August 9, 2007, the stock of NAC was sold to NF Holdings Corporation (NHC) for the purchase price of $236,470,000 and all of the existing long-term debt was paid off (the Sale). The financial statements of the Predecessor Company reflect the results of operations and cash flows for the Predecessor Company on a historical cost basis for the period from January 1, 2007 through August 9, 2007, prior to the Sale. Costs incurred by NAC in connection with the Sale are reflected as transaction-related expense in the consolidated statement of operations. These costs include the following:
 
The purchase price of NAC consisted of approximately $233,343,000 in cash, direct expenses of approximately $2,719,000, 846.986 shares of NFI Series A Convertible Preferred Stock valued at $846,986, and a grant of fully vested options to purchase 2,710.415 shares of NFI Series B Preferred Stock valued at approximately $2,280,167. The value of the NFI Series A Preferred Stock and the options to purchase Series B Preferred Stock were based on the amounts received
 
 
1. Organization and Business (continued)
 
from the issuance of stock in connection with the formation of NFI. The cash portion of the purchase price was financed through the issuance of 99,516.188 shares of NFI Series A Preferred Stock and the proceeds of $138,000,000 from a senior secured credit facility.
Simultaneously with the acquisition of NAC, the ownership interest of National Healthcare Staffing, LLC (NHS) was contributed by its investors (which included a minority investor in NFI) to Holdings and was subsequently merged into a subsidiary of NFI. The investor group received a total of 33,390.306 shares of NFI Series A Preferred Stock valued at $1,000 per share, which is the same value received by NFI in its initial issuance of equity (see Note 12). Also in connection with the contribution of NHS, the Company granted options to acquire 85.57 shares of Series A Preferred Stock at an exercise price of $1,471 per share.
The total consideration was $275,079,000, which consisted of $230,000,000 of purchase price, $6,470,000 of working capital adjustments, $2,719,000 of transaction costs, and $35,890,000 of value related to the contribution of NHS.
As of December 30, 2007, the preliminary allocation of the purchase price was as follows:
 
Certain adjustments, which reduced goodwill by $573,650, were made to the preliminary allocation in 2008, as discussed in Note 7.
Following these transactions, NFI directly or indirectly owns NF Holdings, Inc., Nursefinders, Inc., Club Staffing, Inc., Linde Healthcare, Inc., B.C.P. Inc., NHS and its wholly owned subsidiary M&E Affiliates, and NF Services, Inc. (collectively, the Company). The Company's fiscal operating period ends on the Sunday nearest to December 31. The periods covered under
 
 
1. Organization and Business (continued)
 
this report are comprised of the periods from January 1, 2007 through August 9, 2007 (which relates to the Predecessor Operating Period), August 8, 2007 through December 30, 2007, December 31, 2007 through December 28, 2008, and December 29, 2008 through January 3, 2010 (the Successor Operating Period).
The Company is a national provider of per diem nurse, allied, and physician (locum tenens) staffing services to hospitals, nursing homes, physician practices, medical clinics, outpatient surgery centers, corporations, insurers, and individuals. The Company also provides home health care services to individuals with acute care illness, long-term chronic health conditions, permanent disabilities, terminal illnesses, and post-procedural needs. The Company's home health care services are subject to extensive federal, state, and local laws and regulations. Such laws and regulations include federal Medicare and state licensing requirements, periodic audits by government agencies, and mandatory compliance with federal and state antifraud, anti-abuse, and anti-kickback statutes and regulations. The Company operates through a network of Company-owned and franchised offices.
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements of the Successor Company include the accounts of NFI and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. The consolidated financial statements of the Predecessor Company include the accounts of Nursefinders, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries.
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Recognition of Revenue
Staffing and patient services revenue is recognized upon the performance of services. Physician placement fee revenue is recognized when employment candidates accept offers of permanent employment. Allowances are established to estimate losses due to a placed candidate not fulfilling the required employment period. The Company recognizes reimbursements received for out-of-pocket expenses incurred as revenue. Revenue also includes royalties and fees for services provided pursuant to the specific terms of franchise agreements.
 
 
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
 
Under franchise agreements, the Company provides general training, operating assistance, site selection, and marketing programs. In exchange for these services, the Company receives an initial fee and royalty revenue generally based on 5% of the franchisees' patient and staffing services revenue. Franchise royalty revenue is recognized upon performance of patient or staffing service by the franchisee. Franchise agreements have a five-year operating term with renewal provisions. As of January 3, 2010 and December 28, 2008, 17 offices were operating under franchise agreements, while at December 30, 2007 and August 9, 2007, 16 offices were operating under franchise agreements.
For sales arrangements in which the Company acts as a principal in the transaction and has risks and rewards of ownership, the Company reports gross revenues and gross direct costs. Under arrangements where the Company acts as an agent, the revenues are reported on a net basis.
Restricted Cash
At January 3, 2010 and December 28, 2008, restricted cash of approximately $54,000 and $612,000, respectively, is held as collateral for escrow amounts payable to former shareholders of NHS and an outstanding letter of credit.
Advertising Costs
Costs related to advertising are expensed as incurred. Advertising costs charged to expense for the Operating Periods ended January 3, 2010, December 28, 2008, December 30, 2007, and August 9, 2007, were approximately $1,322,000, $1,995,000, $571,000, and $757,000, respectively.
Income Taxes
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are provided to account for the difference between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect for the period in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are recorded to offset the net deferred tax assets until it is determined that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized. Beginning in 2008, the Company provides related reserves, where applicable, in accounting for uncertain tax positions. Interest and penalties associated with reserves for uncertain tax positions are classified in income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations.
 
 
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
 
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company expenses the estimated fair value of share-based awards over the requisite employee service period. Accordingly, stock-based compensation cost is measured at grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized as expense over the employee's requisite service period. The measurement of stock-based compensation cost is based on several criteria including, but not limited to, input factors to the valuation model such as expected term of the award, stock price volatility, expected forfeiture rates, and risk-free interest rates. The input factors used in the valuation model are based on subjective future expectations combined with management judgment. The Company estimates the fair value of stock options granted using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The Company records stock-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest. The fair value of equity awards granted is amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which are the vesting periods. No excess tax benefit has been recognized related to stock-based compensation because none was realized due to the Company's loss carryforwards.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which generally range from three to seven years. Leasehold improvements are stated at cost and amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the useful lives of the improvements. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.
Certain software development costs for internally developed software are capitalized. These capitalized costs include software purchased for internal use, consulting services, and costs for personnel associated with programming, coding, and testing such software during the application development stage. Amortization of capitalized software costs begins when the software is placed into service and is included in depreciation and amortization expense. Software development costs are amortized using the straight-line method over three to seven years.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Goodwill is recorded when the cost of an acquired company exceeds the fair value of the identified net assets acquired. The Company does not amortize goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, but instead tests for impairment at least annually. Identifiable intangible
 
 
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
 
assets comprise customer lists, databases, noncompete agreements, and trade names. Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from five to seven years.
The Company has two reporting units: nursing and allied staffing services (NAS), and physician staffing services (PSS). The Company allocated goodwill to each reporting unit based on the estimated relative fair value at date of acquisition. The Company conducts an annual review for impairment during the fourth quarter of its fiscal year by performing a fair value analysis of each reporting unit. Impairment for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives exists if the net book value of the goodwill or intangible asset exceeds its fair value.
Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets, including intangible assets with definite useful lives, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. The Company does not perform a periodic assessment of assets for impairment in the absence of such information or indicators. Conditions that would necessitate an impairment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, or a significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets is not recoverable. For long-lived assets to be held and used, the Company recognizes an impairment loss only if an impairment is indicated by its carrying amount not being recoverable through undiscounted cash flows. The impairment loss is the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset estimated using discounted cash flows. There were no indicators of impairment in the Company's long-lived assets during the Operating Periods.
New Accounting Pronouncements
The Company adopted the FASB pronouncement under ASC 820-10 (formerly SFAS No. 157, ) relating to fair value measurements for nonfinancial assets and liabilities on December 29, 2008. This pronouncement provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities and only applies when other pronouncements require or permit the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities. It does not expand the use of fair value measurement. The adoption of this pronouncement did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

Use of Estimates
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
 
 
3. Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable as of January 3, 2010 and December 28, 2008, consist of the following:
 
Trade accounts receivable comprises outstanding billings for staffing services and patient receivables due from hospitals and health systems, physician groups, Medicare, Medicaid, nongovernmental third-party payers, and private payers. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses based on historical trends. Bad debt expense for the Operating Periods ended January 3, 2010, December 28, 2008, December 30, 2007, and August 9, 2007, was approximately $343,000, $1,233,000, $605,000, and $584,000, respectively, and is included in selling, general, and administrative expense.
4. Property and Equipment
Property and equipment as of January 3, 2010 and December 28, 2008, consist of the following:
 
 
 
4. Property and Equipment (continued)
Depreciation and amortization expense of property and equipment totaled approximately $2,552,000, $2,153,000, $723,000, and $1,199,000 for the Operating Periods ended January 3, 2010, December 28, 2008, December 30, 2007, and August 9, 2007.
5. Investment in THSS
In June 2009, Nursefinders, Inc. entered into a joint venture agreement with Texas Health Resources (THR) and created Texas Health SingleSource Staffing, L.L.C. (THSS) for the purpose of recruiting and managing contract nurse and allied health care professionals for THR's system of hospitals. Nursefinders owns 40% of the member interests of THSS and records its investment using the equity method. The Company's share of losses during the Operating Period ended January 3, 2010, totaled $100,000, representing its maximum annual loss, and is included in selling, general, and administrative expense. The Company's investment in THSS is included in other assets.
6. Acquisition Activity
Effective March 31, 2008, Nursefinders, Inc. acquired the stock of Radiologic Enterprises, Inc. d/b/a Resources On Call. Resources On Call (ROC) was acquired to expand the Company's allied staffing business. The purchase price consisted of approximately $43,731,000 in cash and approximately $672,000 in direct acquisition costs. The purchase price was financed through the issuance of 23,849.536 shares of NFI Series A Preferred Stock and 10,000 shares of NFI Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock and the proceeds of $6,000,000 from the Company's senior line of credit. ROC's results of operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements since March 31, 2008.
Under the purchase method of accounting, the total purchase price was allocated to ROC's net tangible and intangible assets based upon their estimated fair values as of March 31, 2008. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of net tangible and intangible assets is recorded as goodwill.
 
 
6. Acquisition Activity (continued)
 
The allocation of the purchase price of $44,403,000 was as follows:
 
The $25,000,000 in goodwill has been assigned to the NAS reporting unit and none of the goodwill is deductible for tax purposes.
7. Goodwill and Intangible Assets
As of January 3, 2010, goodwill and other intangible assets consisted of the following:
 
 
 
7. Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued)
 
As of December 28, 2008, goodwill and other intangible assets consisted of the following:
 
Aggregate amortization expense for amortizable intangible assets totaled approximately $7,863,000, $7,255,000, $2,307,000, and $1,509,000 for the Operating Periods ended January 3, 2010, December 28, 2008, December 30, 2007, and August 9, 2007, respectively. Amortization of deferred financing costs of approximately $277,000, $242,000, $92,000, and $501,000 for the Operating Periods ended January 3, 2010, December 28, 2008, December 30, 2007, and August 9, 2007, respectively, is recorded using the effective interest method as interest expense in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. See Note 8, Long-Term Debt.
The estimated annual aggregate amortization expense for amortizable intangible assets for each of the five succeeding years is as follows:
 
 
 
7. Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued)
 
In the fourth quarter of 2008, in connection with the annual goodwill impairment test, the Company recorded an impairment to its NAS reporting unit goodwill of approximately $51,408,000, which is included in impairment charges on the Company's consolidated statement of operations for the Operating Period ended December 28, 2008. The impairment test was performed using a combination of discounted cash flow methods, comparable public company analysis and comparable acquisitions analysis. The market comparables component of the impairment test was negatively impacted by the current economic crisis and depressed equity market values. Contributing to the impairment charge, to a lesser extent, was the reduction in projected growth rates within the NAS reporting unit compared to prior projections based on management's current assessment of the healthcare staffing industry.
The Company performs an annual review for impairment of intangible assets with indefinite lives. An analysis of the trade name value was performed for the NAS reporting unit in connection with the goodwill impairment testing procedures and resulted in an impairment charge of $16,800,000, which is included in impairment charges on the Company's consolidated statement of operations for the Operating Period ended December 28, 2008.
The following reflects the changes to goodwill for the Operating Period ended December 28, 2008:
 
Adjustments related to the acquisition of NFAC reflect the final allocation of purchase price based on final determination of assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
 
 
8. Long-Term Debt
Long-term debt at January 3, 2010 and December 28, 2008, consists of the following:
 
 
 
8. Long-Term Debt (continued)
 
The senior term loans include a provision requiring mandatory prepayments based on a calculation of excess cash flow as defined. For the Operating Periods ended January 3, 2010 and December 28, 2008, the excess cash flow payment requirement is approximately $0 and $1,224,000, and is reflected in the current maturities of long-term debt.
In November 2009, the Company amended its credit agreements to modify, among other things, the margins on Eurodollar and base rate loans, the amount available under the revolving credit facility, and certain covenant requirements. Pursuant to debt modification accounting guidance, modifications that result in substantially different terms require that the original loan be accounted for as an extinguishment of debt and the amended loan recorded at fair value with the difference, along with certain related fees, recognized as a gain or loss on extinguishment. Based on this guidance, the second lien term loan was determined to be substantially different from the original loan and is therefore accounted for similarly to an extinguishment of debt. The Company recorded the second lien term loan at estimated fair value of $37,350,000 at amendment date and recognized the discount of $7,650,000 as a gain on loan modification reflected in the consolidated statements of operations. The discount will be amortized over the life of the loan using the effective interest method. Amortization of approximately $149,000 is recorded as interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations. The effective interest rate on the second lien term loan is approximately 19%.
The Company incurred costs totaling approximately $4,252,000 related to the loan amendments, including a noncash charge of $2,360,000 related to the issuance of Series A Preferred Stock and warrants. The stock issuance charge and other costs totaling approximately $2,697,000 related to the modifications of the second lien term loan and unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the original second lien term loan of approximately $294,000 were expensed during the Operating Period ended January 3, 2010, and are reflected as a reduction to the gain on loan modification in the consolidated statement of operations. Legal fees of approximately $207,000 were expensed during the Operating Period ended January 3, 2010, and are included in selling, general, and administrative expense.
Costs totaling approximately $1,348,000 were capitalized as deferred financing costs and amortized over the term of the second lien term loan.
Deferred financing costs of approximately $2,808,000 and $1,461,000, less accumulated amortization of approximately $904,000 and $333,000, are recorded in intangible assets at January 3, 2010 and December 28, 2008, respectively.
 
 
8. Long-Term Debt (continued)
 
The debt instruments contain restrictive covenants which, among other things, restrict payment of dividends, limit additional debt, and require the Company to maintain certain leverage ratios and debt service ratios, as defined. As of January 3, 2010, the Company is in compliance with the restrictive covenants of the debt instruments and expects to be in compliance in fiscal 2010. The credit facility also provides for the issuance of up to $12,200,000 in letters of credit and up to $5,000,000 in additional revolving loans. At January 3, 2010 and December 28, 2008, there were $11,997,400 and $11,414,400, respectively, in letters of credit outstanding related to the Company's professional liability and workers' compensation insurance policies. The borrowing capacity on the senior line of credit is limited by a borrowing base comprising a multiple of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, as defined, less term loan debt. Availability for additional borrowings was approximately $5,000,000 at January 3, 2010, and $8,585,000 at December 28, 2008.
Cash maturities of debt as of January 3, 2010, are as follows:
 
9. Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities
Accrued liabilities as of January 3, 2010 and December 28, 2008, consisted of the following:
 
 
 
9. Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities (continued)
 
Included in accounts payable is approximately $3,912,000 and $726,000, at January 3, 2010 and December 28, 2008, which represents bank overdrafts reclassified from cash, as no right-of-offset exists with the financial institution.
10. Other Long-Term Liabilities
Other long-term liabilities as of January 3, 2010 and December 28, 2008, consisted of the following:
 
11. Income Taxes
The income tax benefit consists of the following for the Operating Periods ended January 3, 2010, December 28, 2008, December 30, 2007, and August 9, 2007:
 
 
 
The Company's loss for each Operating Period presented did not generate a tax benefit at the statutory rate of 34%, primarily due to unbenefitted losses for all Operating Periods presented.
 
 
11. Income Taxes (continued)
 
Deferred taxes are comprised primarily of the difference in the tax and book bases of assets and liabilities, including goodwill and other intangible assets, reserves for self-insured claims, deferred compensation, and net operating tax loss carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities consisted of the following at January 3, 2010 and December 28, 2008:
 
The Successor Company has net operating loss tax carryforwards of approximately $68,000,000 and $63,400,000 as of January 3, 2010 and December 28, 2008, respectively, which expire at various dates through 2029. The net operating loss tax carryforwards are subject to limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. As a result of this limitation, the Successor Company believes that approximately $20,100,000 will expire unused. The Successor Company records a full valuation allowance, as it is uncertain whether the deferred tax asset will be realized in future periods. The net deferred tax liability of $25,042,000 at January 3, 2010 and December 28, 2008, relates to tradenames. The Successor Company does not have tax basis in these intangibles and the intangibles have indefinite lives and are not amortized.
The Successor Company recorded a non-cash deferred income tax benefit of approximately $766,000 and $6,384,000 during the Operating Periods ended January 3, 2010 and December 28, 2008, respectively. Under current accounting rules, the Successor Company is required to consider all items, including items recorded in other comprehensive income, in determining the amount of tax benefit that results from a loss from continuing operations and that should be allocated to continuing operations. As a result, the Successor Company recorded a tax benefit on
 
 
11. Income Taxes (continued)
 
the loss from continuing operations for each Operating Period, which will be exactly offset by income tax expense on other comprehensive income for each Operating Period. However, while the income tax benefit from continuing operations is reported on the statement of operations, the income tax expense on other comprehensive income is recorded directly to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), which is a component of stockholders' equity. Because the income tax expense on other comprehensive income is equal to the income tax benefit from continuing operations, the Successor Company's net deferred tax position in all Operating Periods presented is not impacted by this tax allocation.
The Successor Company has a liability for uncertain tax positions of approximately $483,000 and $1,048,000 at January 3, 2010 and December 28, 2008, respectively, which is reflected in other long-term liabilities and includes interest of approximately $76,000 and $0 as of January 3, 2010 and December 28, 2008, respectively. During the Operating Periods ended January 3, 2010 and December 28, 2008, the Successor Company reduced this liability and recorded a current federal tax benefit of approximately $565,000 and $466,000, respectively, related to expiration under the statute of limitations. The Successor Company adopted the FASB pronouncement under ASC 740-10 (formerly FASB Interpretation No. 48, ) on December 29, 2008. The Successor Company recorded no additional liabilities for uncertain tax positions as a result of the adoption and therefore recorded no adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. No federal or state tax returns are currently under examination. The Successor Company has unused federal and state net operating losses for years 1999 through 2009. As such, these years remain subject to examination by the relevant tax authorities.
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes
The Successor Company has a net tax basis in goodwill of approximately $47,600,000 and $54,400,000 at January 3, 2010 and December 28, 2008, respectively. A portion of the amortization deductions related to goodwill and other intangibles is subject to limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. Approximately $6,000,000 of amortization deductions may be permanently lost as a result of this limitation.
 
 
12. Capital Stock
Series A Convertible Preferred Stock
In connection with the formation of NFI and the acquisition of ROC, NFI issued 157,603.016 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (Series A Preferred). These shares accrued cash dividends through June 22, 2009, at 13% of the per share face amount of $1,000, compounded annually. Effective June 22, 2009, the accumulating dividend preference on the Series A preferred was eliminated by resolution of the Series A Preferred Stockholders. The dividends are payable, when, as, and if declared by the Board of Directors. The shares are convertible into shares of common stock at a conversion rate based on a formula, which currently would result in the conversion of one share of Series A Preferred into one share of common stock. Upon conversion of the Series A Preferred into common stock, all accrued dividends with respect to such converted shares shall be cancelled. In the event of a sale or liquidation of the Company, the holder of the Series A Preferred is entitled to receive the greater of the per share face amount and the accumulated, unpaid dividends, or the amount received upon conversion into common stock, whichever is greater. The Series A Preferred can be converted at any time at the option of the holder. The Series A Preferred is mandatorily convertible in the event of certain public offerings, or sale or merger of the Company with specific terms.
Redeemable Series C Preferred Stock
Also in connection with the acquisition of ROC in 2008, NFI issued 10,000 shares of Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock (Series C Preferred). These shares accrue cash dividends at 17% of the per share face amount, currently $1,000, compounded annually. Dividends accrue daily and are payable upon exercise of specified redemption rights of either the Company or the holder.
The holder may require the redemption at any time on or after August 9, 2014, provided that such redemption is not otherwise prohibited under the credit facilities, or at any time that the Company obtains consent of the lenders under the credit facilities for the redemption. Based upon the redemption rights of the holder, the Series C Preferred is classified outside of permanent equity. The shares are recorded at redemption amount, reflecting dividends not currently declared or paid but which will be payable under the redemption features, or for which ultimate payment is not solely within the control of the Company. Dividends accrued and included in the redemption amount of the shares total $3,191,750 and $1,275,000 as of January 3, 2010 and December 28, 2008, respectively. In the event of a sale or liquidation of the Company, the holder of the Series C Preferred is entitled to receive the per share face amount plus the accumulated, unpaid dividends.
 
 
12. Capital Stock (continued)
 
Stock Incentive Plans
2007 Rollover Stock Incentive Plan
In connection with the acquisition of NFAC, NFI's Board of Directors approved the plan and grant of fully vested options to purchase 2,710.415 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (Series B Preferred). The terms of the Series B Preferred are essentially the same as Series A Preferred except that it does not have a dividend requirement. There is, however, a deferred compensation arrangement that provides for payment of additional compensation on terms comparable to the dividends on the Series A Preferred. At January 3, 2010, 2,710.415 shares of Series B Preferred have been reserved. No additional shares are available for grant under the 2007 Rollover Stock Incentive Plan.
A summary of option activity for the 2007 Rollover Stock Incentive Plan is as follows:
 
 
 
12. Capital Stock (continued)
 
The options to purchase the Series B Preferred were granted in connection with the acquisition of NFI and were considered in the initial purchase price allocation. There are no further options available for future grant.
2007 Incentive Compensation Plan
On August 8, 2007, the Board of Directors approved the 2007 Incentive Compensation Plan (the Plan) pursuant to which 15,175 shares of common stock have been reserved. The Plan was established to permit employees of the Company to acquire shares of common stock of NFI. Options to issue 15,175 shares have been authorized under the Plan. All options have a ten-year life. At January 3, 2010, NFI had 9,049 shares available for future grants under the Plan.
NFI has granted options with two vesting methods:
 
 
No options were granted in 2007. The Company did not meet the minimum performance criteria for 2008 or 2009 and therefore all 2008 and 2009 Performance Options are considered to have been forfeited at December 28, 2008 and January 3, 2010, respectively. There were no options exercisable at January 3, 2010.
 
 
12. Capital Stock (continued)
 
A summary of option activity is presented below:
 
 
 
12. Capital Stock (continued)
 
The fair value of employee stock options was calculated using the Black-Scholes method based on the following assumptions:
 
The Company recognized approximately $69,000 and $51,600 in stock-based compensation cost for the Operating Periods ended January 3, 2010 and December 28, 2008, respectively. No stock compensation expense was recorded during the Operating Period ended December 30, 2007, as the options to purchase the Series B Preferred were granted in connection with the acquisition of NFI and were considered in the initial purchase price allocation. No other options were granted in the Operating Period ended December 30, 2007.
In connection with the Sale, all vested stock options and restricted stock were paid in cash. For the Predecessor Operating Period, the Predecessor Company recorded stock-based compensation expense of approximately $7,256,000 based on payments made for vested options and restricted stock of approximately $7,493,000 less amounts expensed in prior periods of approximately $237,000.
13. Derivatives
All derivative instruments are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value. Gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives are accounted for depending upon the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting. The Company uses derivative instruments to manage the fluctuations in cash flows resulting from interest rate risk on variable-rate debt financing.
 
 
13. Derivatives (continued)
 
In August 2007, in connection with the senior first and second lien term loans, the Company entered into an interest rate swap arrangement to minimize exposure to interest rate fluctuations on $46,000,000 of outstanding variable rate debt under the new credit facility, where the Company pays a fixed rate of 4.815%. This agreement expires in August 2010, and no initial investment was made to enter into this arrangement. In June 2008, the Company entered into an interest rate swap arrangement to minimize exposure to interest rate fluctuations on an additional $30,000,000 of outstanding variable rate debt under the credit facility, where the Company pays a fixed rate of 4.1%. This agreement expires in May 2011, and no initial investment was made to enter into this arrangement. The Company executed the derivatives with a counterparty that is a well-known major financial institution. The Company has assessed the creditworthiness of its counterparty and, based on this analysis, has included a credit valuation adjustment in the fair value estimate of the derivative as of January 3, 2010. At December 28, 2008, the Company considered nonperformance to be unlikely, and had no such adjustment. The Company has formally documented the hedging relationships and accounts for the arrangements as cash flow hedges.
At January 3, 2010 and December 28, 2008, the interest rate swap agreements had a fair value of approximately $2,450,000 and $4,467,000, respectively, net of a credit valuation adjustment for counterparty risk of $97,000 and $0 at January 3, 2010 and December 28, 2008, and are reflected as a net liability in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. The Company recognizes all derivatives on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value, based on dealer quotes. Gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of these arrangements are recorded in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings.
14. Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Company's cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, insurance collateral, other than current portion of self-insurance estimates, long-term debt and long-term liabilities, other than self-insurance estimates, constitute financial instruments. Based on management's estimates, the carrying value of these financial instruments, excluding long-term debt, approximates their fair value as of the end of all periods presented.
The Company estimates the fair value of its variable fixed-rate, senior term loans and line of credit based on quoted market prices. The estimated fair value of the debt instruments was approximately $110,800,000 and $109,100,000 at January 3, 2010 and December 28, 2008, respectively, with a carrying value of approximately $122,000,000 and $136,800,000, respectively.
 
 
14. Fair Value of Financial Instruments (continued)
 
The fair value accounting guidance establishes a hierarchal disclosure framework, which ranks the level of market price observability used in measuring financial instruments at fair value. Market price observability is impacted by a number of factors, including the type of instrument and the characteristics specific to the instrument. The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels:
Level 1  quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
Level 2  directly or indirectly observable inputs other than quoted prices
Level 3  unobservable inputs
An entity is required to maximize the use of quoted market prices and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. An asset or liability's level is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
The Company's deferred compensation plan assets are invested in registered investment companies, which are valued based on published rates. The Company utilized these Level 1 inputs to value its deferred compensation asset and liability. The Company utilizes third-party valuations to assist in the determination of fair value of its two interest rate swaps and considers these derivatives instrument valuations to be Level 2 fair value measurements.
 
 
14. Fair Value of Financial Instruments (continued)
 
The following tables set forth the Company's financial assets and liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis at January 3, 2010 and December 28, 2008, by level within the fair value hierarchy (in thousands):
January 3, 2010
 
December 28, 2008
 
15. Concentration of Credit Risk
The Company maintains cash with various financial institutions. The Company's policy is designed to limit exposure with any one financial institution.
Credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable is dispersed due to the nature of the business, the large number of customers, and the diversity of industries served, except for one customer that makes up 15.1% and 14.2% of the trade accounts receivable balance as of January 3, 2010 and December 28, 2008, respectively. The Company routinely performs credit evaluations of its customers.
 
 
16. Commitments and Contingencies
Employee 401(k) Plan
The Company sponsors a 401(k) plan for the provision of retirement and incidental benefits to its employees. The Nursefinders Inc. 401(k) Plan (the 401(k) Plan) covers substantially all employees who meet minimum age requirements. As allowed under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, the 401(k) Plan allows employees to contribute from 1% to 100% of their annual compensation, limited to a maximum amount as set by the Internal Revenue Service. Participants who are over the age of 50 can contribute an additional amount of their salary per year, as defined annually by the Internal Revenue Service. The Company matches employee contributions for a select class of employees at a rate of $0.25 per each $1.00 contributed, up to an annual maximum of $1,250.
The Club Staffing, Inc. 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan and Trust covers all employees that meet minimum age requirements and allows participants to defer up to 25% of their annual compensation, limited to a maximum amount as set by the Internal Revenue Service. There were no matching employer contributions made during the Operating Periods presented.
The ROC 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan covers all employees that meet minimum age requirements and have completed 6 months of service in which a minimum of 500 hours have been worked. The Company matches 50% of employee contributions up to 6% of the employees' contribution.
The NHS 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan covers all employees that meet minimum age requirements and complete a minimum of three months of employment. The Company matches employee contributions at a discretionary percentage up to 6% of the employees' contribution.
Company matching contributions to the 401(k) Plans totaled approximately $161,000, $403,000, 98,000, and $92,000 for the Operating Periods ended January 3, 2010, December 28, 2008, December 30, 2007, and August 9, 2007, respectively.
Deferred Compensation
The Company sponsors a nonqualified deferred compensation plan for its highly compensated employees. Plan assets of approximately $2,059,000 and $1,343,000, as of January 3, 2010 and December 28, 2008, are invested in registered investment companies. The short-term portion of $100,000 for each year is reflected in prepaid expenses and other current assets, and the remaining long-term portion is included in other assets.

liability of approximately $2,059,000 and $1,343,000, as of January 3, 2010 and December 28, 2008, has been recognized by the Company, with the short-term portion reflected in accrued liabilities and the long-term portion reflected in other long-term liabilities as of each year. The asset includes contributions by employees. During the Operating Periods ended January 3, 2010, December 28, 2008, and December 30, 2007, and August 9, 2007, employees contributed approximately $367,000, $387,000, $104,000, and $217,000 respectively. The Company matches contributions for Linde employees at a rate based on certain financial performance measures. The match ranges from $0.25 to $0.30 per each $1.00 contributed, up to an annual maximum ranging from $2,500 to $4,500. Company matching contributions to the deferred compensation plan totaled approximately $19,000, $14,000, and $17,000 for the Operating Periods ended January 3, 2010, December 28, 2008, and December 30, 2007, respectively.
Leases
The Company leases real estate under operating agreements. Certain of these leases include options to renew, as well as rent escalation clauses based on inflation.
Future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases as of January 3, 2010, are as follows:
 
Total rent expense was approximately $5,296,000, $5,056,000, $1,963,000, and $2,301,000 for the Operating Periods ended January 3, 2010, December 28, 2008, December 30, 2007, and August 9, 2007, respectively.
 
 
16. Commitments and Contingencies (continued)
 
Reserves for Self-Insured Claims
Workers' compensation, health care benefits, and professional liability coverage are provided under partially self-insured plans. The Company has purchased stop-loss coverage in order to limit its exposure. The Company records its estimate of the ultimate cost of, and reserves for, workers' compensation and professional liability based on actuarial computations and the Company's loss history, as well as industry statistics. Furthermore, in determining its reserves, the Company includes reserves for estimated claims incurred but not reported. The ultimate cost of workers' compensation, health care benefits, and professional liability will depend on actual costs incurred to settle the claims, and may differ from the amounts reserved by the Company for those claims.
Contingencies
On August 3, 2007, the Predecessor Company received correspondence from legal counsel representing a group of its franchisees. The group alleged that Nursefinders violated the terms of its franchise agreements in connection with the acquisitions of certain affiliated companies. In February 2008, this group filed suit against Nursefinders. The Predecessor Company settled the litigation with four of the five participants in 2008, and with the remaining participant in 2009. Estimated settlement costs were recorded by the Predecessor Company and actual costs were not significantly different from the estimate.
Regulatory Compliance
The health care industry is subject to numerous laws and regulations of federal, state, and local governments. The Company's home health care services are subject to extensive federal, state, and local laws and regulations. Such laws and regulations include federal Medicare and state licensing requirements, periodic audits by government agencies, and mandatory compliance with federal and state antifraud, anti-abuse, and anti-kick back statutes and regulations. Management believes that the Company is in compliance with fraud and abuse policies, as well as other applicable government laws and regulations. While no material regulatory inquiries have been made, compliance with such laws and regulations can be subject to future government review and interpretation, as well as regulatory actions unknown or unasserted at this time.
 
 
17. Related-Party Transactions
The Company expensed approximately $1,011,000, $1,000,000, and $1,384,000 during the Operating Periods ended January 3, 2010, December 28, 2008, and December 30, 2007, respectively, in consulting fees to stockholders of NFI, of which approximately $250,000 and $0 is included in accrued liabilities at January 3, 2010 and December 28, 2008, respectively. In addition, during the Predecessor Operating Period ended August 9, 2007, the Predecessor paid approximately $751,000 in consulting fees to stockholders of NAC and provided approximately $8,954,000 in medical staffing services to entities affiliated with an NAC stockholder.
In addition, the Company incurred approximately $170,000, $212,000, $77,000, and $108,000 during the Operating Periods ended January 3, 2010, December 28, 2008, December 30, 2007, and August 9, 2007, respectively, in office lease expense, from a partnership composed of certain former owners of Linde. Certain of these partners were employed by the Company and are stockholders of NFI. The Company also paid approximately $7,000 and $13,000 during the Operating Periods ended January 3, 2010 and December 28, 2008, respectively, to an advertising firm owned by an employee and stockholder of the Company.
18. Subsequent Events
The Company has evaluated events and transactions subsequent to January 3, 2010 through March 29, 2010, the date that the financial statements were available to be issued. Based on requirements of the subsequent event guidance, the Company has not identified any events that require disclosure.

1. Organization and Business
NF Investors, Inc. (NFI), a Delaware corporation, was formed on August 8, 2007, in connection with the acquisition of the outstanding stock of NF Acquisition Corporation on August 9, 2007, by NFI's wholly owned subsidiary, NF Holdings, Inc. Holdings directly or indirectly owns 100% of Nursefinders, Inc., Club Staffing, Inc., Linde Healthcare Staffing, Inc., National Healthcare Staffing, L.L.C., Radiologic Enterprises, Inc., B.C.P. Inc., and NF Services, Inc. (collectively, the Company).
The Company is a national provider of per diem nurse, allied and physician (locum tenens) staffing services to hospitals, nursing homes, physician practices, medical clinics, outpatient surgery centers, corporations, insurers, and individuals. The Company also provides home health care services to individuals with acute care illness, long-term chronic health conditions, permanent disabilities, terminal illnesses, and post-procedural needs. The Company's home health care services are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations. Such laws and regulations include federal Medicare and state licensing requirements, periodic audits by government agencies, and mandatory compliance with federal and state antifraud, anti-abuse, and anti-kickback statutes and regulations. The Company operates through a network of Company-owned and franchised offices.
The Company's fiscal operating period ends on the Sunday nearest to June 30. The operating periods covered under this report are the periods from January 4, 2010 through July 4, 2010 and December 29, 2008 through July 5, 2009.
Basis of Presentation
The consolidated balance sheet and related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity and comprehensive income and cash flows contained in this report, which are unaudited, include the accounts of NFI and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) for interim financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in
 
 
1. Organization and Business (continued)
 
conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring items, necessary for a fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements have been included. Operating results for the six months ended July 4, 2010, are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any other interim period or for the fiscal year ending January 2, 2011.
These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto for the year ended January 3, 2010.
2. Accounting Standards Updates
In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update 2010-06, (ASU 2010-06), which requires new disclosures about (1) significant amounts transferred between Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements and the reasons for the transfer and (2) sales, issuance, and settlement activity in Level 3 fair value measurements. ASU 2010-06 also clarifies existing disclosures regarding the level of disaggregation for each class of assets and liabilities and valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements. The disclosure about purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements relating to Level 3 measurements is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2010. Early adoption is permitted. All other requirements in ASU 2010-06 are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009. The Company adopted this guidance beginning January 4, 2010, and the adoption did not have a material effect on its consolidated financial condition and results of operations.
Improving Disclosure about Fair Value Measurements
 
 
3. Derivatives
All derivative instruments are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value. Gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives are accounted for depending upon the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting. The Company uses derivative instruments to manage the fluctuations in cash flows resulting from interest rate risk on variable-rate debt financing.
In August 2007, in connection with the senior first and second lien term loans, the Company entered into an interest rate swap arrangement to minimize exposure to interest rate fluctuations on $46,000,000 of outstanding variable-rate debt under the new credit facility, where the Company pays a fixed rate of 4.815%. This agreement expires in August 2010, and no initial investment was made to enter into this arrangement. In June 2008, the Company entered into an interest rate swap arrangement to minimize exposure to interest rate fluctuations on an additional $30,000,000 of outstanding variable-rate debt under the credit facility, where the Company pays a fixed rate of 4.1%. This agreement expires in May 2011, and no initial investment was made to enter into this arrangement. The Company executed the derivatives with a counterparty that is a well-known major financial institution. The Company has formally documented the hedging relationships and accounts for the arrangements as cash flow hedges.
At July 4, 2010, the interest rate swap agreements had a fair value of approximately $1,115,000, net of a credit valuation adjustment for counterparty risk of approximately $37,000, and are reflected as a net liability in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. The Company recognizes all derivatives on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value, based on dealer quotes. Gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of these arrangements are recorded in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. No excess tax benefit has been recognized related to the hedge because valuation allowances are recorded to offset net deferred tax assets.
4. Fair Value Measurements
The Company's cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, insurance collateral, other than the current portion of self-insurance estimates, long-term debt and long-term liabilities other than self-insurance estimates, constitute financial instruments. Based on management's estimates, the carrying value of these financial instruments, excluding long-term debt, approximates their fair value as of July 4, 2010.
 
 
4. Fair Value Measurements (continued)
 
The Company estimates the fair value of its variable rate, senior term loans and line of credit based on quoted market prices for similar loans. The estimated fair value of the debt instruments at July 4, 2010, was approximately $114,000,000, with a carrying value of approximately $122,500,000.
The fair value accounting guidance establishes a hierarchal disclosure framework, which ranks the level of market price observability used in measuring financial instruments at fair value. Market price observability is impacted by a number of factors, including the type of instrument and the characteristics specific to the instrument. The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels:
Level 1  quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
Level 2  directly or indirectly observable inputs other than quoted prices
Level 3  unobservable inputs
An entity is required to maximize the use of quoted market prices and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. An asset or liability's level is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
The Company's deferred compensation plan assets are invested in registered investment companies, which are valued based on published rates. The Company utilized these Level 1 inputs to value its deferred compensation asset and liability. The Company utilizes third-party valuations to assist in the determination of fair value of its two interest rate swaps and considers these derivatives instrument valuations to be Level 2 fair value measurements.
 
 
4. Fair Value Measurements (continued)
 
The following table sets forth the Company's financial assets and liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis at July 4, 2010, by level within the fair value hierarchy (in thousands):
 
 
 
4. Fair Value Measurements (continued)
 
The Company applies fair value techniques on a nonrecurring basis associated with valuing potential impairment losses related to goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. There were no fair value measurements of nonfinancial assets and liabilities during the operating period ended July 4, 2010.
5. Income Taxes
The Company's income tax benefit consists of the following:
 
The Company recorded a noncash deferred income tax benefit of approximately $507,000 for the operating period ended July 4, 2010, and approximately $332,000 for the operating period ended July 5, 2009. Under current accounting rules, the Company is required to consider all items, including items recorded in other comprehensive income, in determining the amount of tax benefit that results from a loss from continuing operations and that should be allocated to continuing operations. As a result, the Company recorded a tax benefit on the loss from continuing operations for the operating period ended July 4, 2010 and July 5, 2009, which will be exactly offset by income tax expense on other comprehensive income. However, while the income tax benefit from continuing operations is reported on the income statement, the income tax expense on other comprehensive income is recorded directly to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), which is a component of stockholders' equity. Because the income tax expense on other comprehensive income is equal to the income tax benefit from continuing operations, the Company's net deferred tax position at July 4, 2010 and July 5, 2009, is not impacted by this tax allocation.
 
 
5. Income Taxes (continued)
 
The Company's effective tax benefit rate is 8.2% for the operating period ended July 4, 2010, and 9.3% for the operating period ended July 5, 2009. The effective tax rate differs from the statutory tax rate primarily due to unbenefited losses and the tax allocation described above.
6. Subsequent Events
On July 28, 2010, the Company entered into a definitive agreement with AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. (AMN), in which AMN will acquire 100% of the stock of the Company. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2010 and is subject to customary closing conditions, regulatory approvals and receipt of debt financing.
The Company has evaluated events and transactions subsequent to July 4, 2010 through September 15, 2010, the date that the financial statements were available to be issued.
 

EXHIBIT 99.3
AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. ("AMN", the "Company", "our" or "we") acquired NF Investors, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("NFI"), the parent company of Nursefinders, Inc. (dba Medfinders) on September 1, 2010. The acquisition of NFI has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting and, accordingly, the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition. As of the date of this Form 8-K/A, AMN has not completed the detailed valuations necessary to finalize the estimate of the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed from NFI and the related allocations of purchase price, nor has AMN identified all adjustments necessary to conform NFI's accounting policies to AMN's accounting policies. Additionally, a final determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed from NFI will be based on the actual net tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of NFI that existed as of the date of the acquisition. Thus, the pro forma purchase price adjustments are preliminary, are subject to further adjustments as additional information becomes available and as additional analyses are performed, and have been made solely for the purpose of providing the unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, there may be material adjustments to the allocation of the purchase price.
Our estimate of the total purchase price of NFI, excluding assumed NFI then-existing debt of $132,918, is summarized as follows:
 
The acquisition agreement includes a holdback of approximately 1,727 shares of preferred stock with an estimated fair value of $8,740. Such shares were deposited in escrow to satisfy any indemnification claims by AMN against NFI with respect to breaches of representations, warranties and covenants by NFI and post closing purchase price adjustments. An initial distribution of approximately 273 shares of preferred shares, subject to certain adjustments, will be released to the selling shareholders upon occurrence of certain events set forth in the agreement approximately 90 days after closing, with the remainder of the holdback, net of any indemnified claims made, released in September 2012.
Intangible assets include amounts recognized for the fair value of tradenames and trademarks, customer relationships, non-compete agreements and staffing databases. Based on a preliminary valuation, two tradenames and trademarks have an indefinite life, and the remaining intangible assets have a weighted average useful life of approximately 12 years. Because this valuation is preliminary, the valuation of intangible assets and their useful lives may change upon completion of the final valuation. The excess of the purchase price over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets is recorded as goodwill and is estimated to be approximately $117,705. In accordance with current accounting standards, the goodwill will not be amortized and will be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually and whenever circumstances occur indicating that goodwill might be impaired.
Our fiscal year ends on December 31 of each year. NFI's fiscal year ended on the Sunday nearest to December 31 of each year. The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated financial statements have been prepared to assist you in your analysis of the financial effects of the acquisition of NFI, and are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2009 combines the historical results for AMN for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 and the historical results for NFI for the twelve months ended January 3, 2010, as if the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2009. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated statement of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2010, combines the historical results for AMN for the six months ended June 30, 2010 and the historical results for NFI for the six months ended July 4, 2010, as if the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2009. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2010 combines the historical results for AMN as of June 30, 2010 and the historical results for NFI as of July 4, 2010, as if the acquisition had occurred on June 30, 2010.
The pro forma information is being furnished solely for informational purposes and is not necessarily indicative of the combined financial position or results of operations that might have been achieved for the periods or dates indicated, nor is it necessarily indicative of the future results of the combined company. The pro forma information does not reflect cost savings expected to be realized from the elimination of certain expenses and from synergies expected to be created or the costs to achieve such cost savings or synergies. No assurance can be given that cost savings or synergies will be realized. Income taxes do not reflect the amounts that would have resulted had AMN and NFI filed consolidated income tax returns during the periods presented. The pro forma adjustments are based upon information and assumptions available at the time of the filing of this Form 8-K/A. You should read our pro forma condensed combined consolidated financial information in conjunction with (i) our consolidated financial statements and the related notes, our "Selected Consolidated Financial and Operating Data," and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," which all appear in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, (ii) our consolidated unaudited financial statements and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," which appear in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as of June 30, 2010, and for the three and six months then ended, and (iii) the historical audited financial statements and notes thereto of NFI (Successor Company) as of January 3, 2010 and December 28, 2008, and for each of the three operating periods ended January 3, 2010, December 28, 2008 and December 30, 2007, and Nursefinders, Inc. and subsidiaries (Predecessor Company) for the period from January 1, 2007 through August 9, 2007, and the unaudited financial statements and notes thereto of NFI as of July 4, 2010 and for the six month periods ended July 4, 2010 and July 5, 2009, which are included as Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2, respectively, to this Current Report on Form 8-K/A.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. Basis of Presentation
The accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated financial statements present the pro forma results of operations and financial position of AMN and NFI on a combined basis based on the historical financial information of each company and after giving effect to the acquisition of NFI by AMN. The acquisition was recorded using the acquisition method of accounting.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2009 combines the historical results for AMN for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 and the historical results for NFI for the twelve months ended January 3, 2010, as if the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2009. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated statement of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2010, combines the historical results for AMN for the six months ended June 30, 2010 and the historical results for NFI for the six months ended July 4, 2010, as if the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2009. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2010 combines the historical results for AMN as of June 30, 2010 and the historical results for NFI as of July 4, 2010, as if the acquisition had occurred on June 30, 2010.
2. Pro Forma Adjustments
(a) To reflect the following cash transactions:
 
On September 1, 2010, AMN borrowed $77,750 under the existing first lien credit agreement (the "First Lien Credit Agreement"), which represents the increase in the Tranche B term loan portion of the First Lien Credit Agreement. Borrowings under the Tranche B term loan portion of the First Lien Credit Agreement bear interest at floating rates based upon either a LIBOR (with a LIBOR floor of 1.75%) or a prime interest rate option selected by AMN, plus a spread of 5.50% and 4.50%, respectively. On September 1, 2010, AMN also borrowed $40,000 under a second lien credit agreement (the "Second Lien Credit Agreement"). Borrowings under the Second Lien Credit Agreement bear interest at floating rates based upon either a LIBOR (with a LIBOR floor of 1.75%) or a prime interest rate option selected by the Borrower, plus a spread of 10.00% and 9.00%, respectively. A 1/8% change in the floating rate would result in a $277 change in interest expense annually.
(b) To reflect the elimination of intercompany balances between AMN and NFI on net subcontractor accounts receivable.
(c) To reflect an adjustment to net current deferred income tax assets of $1,137 and net long-term deferred income tax liabilities of $20,242 primarily related to NFI's net operating loss carry forward and amortizable intangible assets recorded as part of the acquisition method of accounting. The amounts allocated are preliminary and subject to adjustment pending further analysis including the finalization of the Company's Section 382 limitation analysis.
(d) To reflect the step up in fair value for the acquired developed software.
(e) To reflect the estimated amount of $117,705 of goodwill resulting from the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired, net of the reversal of $146,754 of goodwill recorded on NFI's historical financial statements.
(f) To reflect the estimated amount of identifiable intangible assets of $63,486 based on preliminary valuation, which is offset by the amount of identifiable intangible assets recorded on NFI's historical financial statements. Identifiable intangible assets include customer relationships, tradenames and trademarks, non-compete agreements and staffing databases. Based on the preliminary valuation, two tradenames and trademarks have an indefinite life, and the remaining intangible assets have a weighted average useful life of approximately 12 years. In addition, the adjustment includes a $1,639 elimination of deferred financing costs on NFI's then-existing debt.
(g) To reflect the elimination of intercompany balances of $925 between AMN and NFI on the subcontractor payable recorded in accounts payable and accrued expenses. Additional adjustments reflect the elimination of accrued interest expense of $1,537 on NFI's historical financial statements, offset by $419 additional acquisition related transaction costs added to accounts payable and accrued expenses.
(h) To reflect the elimination of accrued management fees based on a then-existing NFI agreement.
(i) To reflect the notes payable balance, net of discount of $6,210, in accordance with the First Lien Credit Agreement and Second Lien Credit Agreement offset by the settlement of NFI then-existing debt, which was $122,548 at July 4, 2010.
(j) To reflect incremental capitalized financing costs incurred to finance the acquisition.
(k) To reflect elimination of the interest rate swap liability of $1,115 and other liabilities related to NFI then-existing debt on NFI's historical financial statements.
(l) To reflect elimination of the shareholders' equity accounts of NFI and to reflect issuance of AMN preferred stock and common stock as partial consideration for the purchase of NFI. Additional adjustments of $27,846 in additional paid-in capital reflect fair value of the 6,300 shares of common stock issued in excess of the par value. Additional adjustments in accumulated deficit reflect $8,523 of acquisition related transaction costs.
(m) To reflect a $1,000 and $500 reduction in management fee, a $441 and $23 reduction in compensation expense related to non-recurring executive salary expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 and the six months ended June 30, 2010, respectively. Additional adjustment of $1,094 for the six months ended June 30, 2010 relates to non-recurring acquisition related expenses.
(n) To reflect additional depreciation and amortization expense of $4,299 and $1,987 related to the fair value of identifiable amortizable intangible assets and certain developed software, offset by $8,107 and $3,994 related to the depreciation and amortization of NFI's then-existing identifiable amortizable intangible assets and certain developed software for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 and six months ended June 30, 2010, respectively.
(o) To reflect incremental interest expense related to additional AMN borrowings and deferred financing cost amortization of $4,061 and $309 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 and six months ended June 30, 2010, respectively.
(p) Pro forma income tax benefit and expense for the year ended December 31, 2009 and the six months ended June 30, 2010, respectively, reflects the statutory rate applicable to pro forma adjustments. Pro forma income tax expense for the six months ended June 30, 2010 exceeds pretax income due primarily to the impact of permanent tax items which do not vary in proportion to pretax income.
(q) To reflect the dividend on preferred stock based on the merger agreement.
(r) To reflect the issuance of 6,300 shares of common stock on the date of acquisition.

AMN Healthcare Announces Third Quarter 2010 Results
SAN DIEGO, Nov. 4, 2010 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. (NYSE: AHS) today announced operating results for the third quarter of 2010. Financial highlights are as follows:
Key business highlights for the third quarter are as follows:
The closing of the Medfinders acquisition expanded AMN's market share in temporary healthcare staffing by over 30%
Consolidated revenues were up 18% sequentially. Excluding the impact of the acquisition, consolidated revenues were up 4% sequentially
Nurse and Allied staffing revenues were up 5% sequentially and Locum Tenens and Physician Permanent Placement revenues were each up 3% sequentially, excluding the impact of the acquisition  
Our focus on Managed Services Programs is translating into industry-leading growth in Nurse and Allied staffing volumes
SG&A levels as a percentage of revenues remain steady, excluding acquisition-related costs
EPS was impacted by a $49.8 million non-cash impairment charge related to goodwill and certain other intangible assets from acquisitions prior to Medfinders, in addition to $5 million in financing costs and $6 million in integration costs related to the Medfinders acquisition during the quarter.
"All of our business segments delivered sequential organic growth for a second consecutive quarter. Contributing the most was our Nurse and Allied staffing business which posted a third consecutive quarter of growth. Our continued strategy of becoming a stronger partner with our clients through our Managed Services Programs is enabling AMN to deliver industry-leading growth amidst a modest economic and market recovery environment," said Susan R. Salka, President and Chief Executive Officer of AMN Healthcare.
"We are also very excited about the short and long-term benefits added from the Medfinders acquisition.  In addition to the strengthening of our core staffing and recruitment businesses, we are now also the leader in providing clinical Managed Services Programs, which continues to be a capability increasingly desired by our clients.  Our ability to provide key strategic workforce solutions, which help healthcare organizations meet both their financial and patient care delivery goals, is a central part of our growth strategy.  Combining with Medfinders also allows AMN to achieve further cost efficiencies, revenue synergies and leverage best practices through the consolidation of operational functions," added Salka.
Third Quarter 2010 Results
For the third quarter of 2010 (which includes one month of financial results from the Medfinders acquisition), combined revenue was $176 million, an increase of 6% from prior year and up 18% from prior quarter. Revenue from one month performance of the acquisition contributed $21 million to the quarter.  Third quarter revenue for the Nurse and Allied staffing segment was $93 million, an increase of 13% from the same quarter last year and up 23% sequentially. Excluding the impact of the acquisition for the month of September, the Nurse and Allied segment third quarter revenue was $79 million reflecting a 5% sequential increase.  The Locum Tenens staffing segment generated revenue of $70 million, a decrease of 8% from prior year but up 6% sequentially. Third quarter Physician Permanent Placement revenue was $9 million, a decrease of 1% from prior year and up 4% sequentially.  Excluding the acquisition, the Locum Tenens and the Physician Permanent Placement segments reflected sequential increases of 3%.  Through the acquisition, the company introduced the new segment of Home Healthcare services in the third quarter, which generated revenue of $5 million in the month of September.
Gross margin in the third quarter of 2010 was 27.4%, consistent with prior year and a decrease of 20 bps compared to the previous quarter. The decrease as compared to prior quarter was mainly attributable to a decrease in Locum Tenens staffing gross margin offset by a higher gross margin from the acquired businesses which contributed 50 bps gross margin improvement in the quarter.
Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses for the third quarter of 2010 were 26.5% as a percentage of revenue compared to 22.2% in the same quarter last year. Third quarter SG&A increased by $10 million over the same period in the prior year and increased by $12 million as compared to the prior quarter, due primarily to additional acquisition and integration related costs totaling $6 million and the  SG&A costs of the acquired business for the month of September which also totaled $6 million. Acquisition and integration related costs for the quarter include charges consisting mainly of severance payments related to workforce reductions and professional services fees incurred to assist with due diligence, accounting, tax, legal and other advisory services associated  with the acquisition and the related integration efforts.
In connection with the acquisition and the associated additional financing, the company incurred additional financing costs of which $5 million were charged directly to interest expense in the period.
Unrelated to the transaction, in accordance with accounting guidance on goodwill and other intangible assets, the company incurred $49.8 million in non-cash impairment charges relating to goodwill and certain other intangible assets resulting from prior acquisitions. These impairment charges are non-cash expenses and will not have any impact on the company's cash position, future cash flows or debt covenants.
Third quarter GAAP net loss per diluted common share was ($1.48) and included the negative impacts of ($1.25) of non-cash goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges, ($0.13) of acquisition related charges and ($0.09) for the write off of financing costs. Third quarter GAAP net loss per diluted common share for the quarter also includes the impact of assumed accumulated dividends on the preferred securities issued in connection with the acquisition having an impact of ($0.01) per common share.
As of September 30, 2010, cash and cash equivalents totaled $2 million, compared to $27 million as of December 31, 2009. Total term debt outstanding, net of discount, as of September 30, 2010 was $217 million, with no borrowings on the revolver portion of the credit facility.
Business Trends and Outlook
Going into the fourth quarter, the Nursing and Allied staffing business continues to experience positive momentum overall. The strength of our Managed Services business is expected to help deliver slight sequential growth in the fourth quarter, overcoming the typical seasonal declines. The Physician businesses are expected to decline sequentially, in line with the typical seasonal trends. The Home Healthcare business is expected to experience a slight sequential decrease compared to historic levels. Consolidated revenues in the fourth quarter are expected to be between $215 million and $220 million, which is essentially flat on a pro forma basis compared with the third quarter. Gross margin is anticipated to increase nominally due to the inclusion of Medfinders for a full quarter.

Non-GAAP Measures
This earnings release contains certain non-GAAP financial information. These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP"), and may be different from non-GAAP measures reported by other companies. From time to time, additional information regarding non-GAAP financial measures may be made available on the company's website at http://www.amnhealthcare.com/investors.
Forward-Looking Statements
This press release contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Such statements include expectations regarding fourth quarter demand, revenue and gross margin, and the benefits of the Medfinders acquisition including its impact on operating efficiencies and revenue synergies. The company based these forward-looking statements on its current expectations and projections about future events. Actual results could differ materially from those discussed in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are identified by words such as "believe," "anticipate," "expect," "intend," "plan," "will," "may" and other similar expressions. In addition, any statements that refer to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statement s. Factors that could cause actual results to differ from those implied by the forward-looking statements contained in this press release are set forth in the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009 and its other quarterly and periodic reports filed with the SEC. These statements reflect the company's current beliefs and are based upon information currently available to it. Be advised that developments subsequent to this press release are likely to cause these statements to become outdated with the passage of time.
Segment Operating Income represents net income (loss) plus interest expense (net of interest income), income taxes, depreciation and amortization, impairment and restructuring charges, unallocated corporate expenses, and stock-based compensation expense. Management believes that Segment Operating Income is an industry wide financial measure that is useful both to management and investors when evaluating the company's performance. Management also uses Segment Operating Income for planning purposes. Segment Operating Income is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation and allocation of costs.
Adjusted EBITDA represents net income (loss) plus interest expense (net of interest income), income taxes, depreciation and amortization, acquisition related costs, impairment and restructuring charges, and stock-based compensation expense. Management presents adjusted EBITDA because it believes that adjusted EBITDA is a useful supplement to net income as an indicator of operating performance. Management believes that adjusted EBITDA is an industry wide financial measure that is useful both to management and investors when evaluating the company's performance. Management also uses adjusted EBITDA for planning purposes. Management uses adjusted EBITDA to evaluate the company's performance because it believes that adjusted EBITDA provides an effective measure of the company's results, as it excludes certain items that management believes are not indicative of the company's operating performance and considers measures used in credit facilities. However, adjusted EBITDA is not intended to represe nt cash flows for the period, nor has it been presented as an alternative to income (loss) from operations or net income (loss) as an indicator of operating performance, and it should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. As defined, adjusted EBITDA is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation. While management believes that some of the items excluded from adjusted EBITDA are not indicative of the company's operating performance, these items do impact the income statement, and management therefore utilizes adjusted EBITDA as an operating performance measure in conjunction with GAAP measures such as net income.
For purposes of calculating the loss per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010, the calculation assumes the accrual of dividends on the preferred shares issued in connection with the Mefinders acquisition regardless of whether such dividends are declared or accrued. The impact of the dividend in the quarter from the date of the acquisition was to increase the loss per common share by $0.01 per share for the three months then ended.
Adjusted EPS represents GAAP EPS excluding the impact of acquisition related costs, restructuring and impairment charges, financing costs, non-recurring legal expenses and accumulated preferred stock dividends. In addition, for purpose of the calculation it is assumed that shareholders have approved the conversion feature of the preferred stock. Management presents adjusted EPS because it believes that adjusted EPS is a useful supplement to diluted net loss per share as an indicator of operating performance. Management believes such a measure provides a picture of the company's results that is more comparable among periods since it excludes the impact of items that may recur occasionally, but tend to be irregular as to timing, thereby distorting comparisons between periods. However, investors should note that this non-GAAP measure involves judgment by management (in particular, judgment as to what is classified as a special item to be excluded from adjusted EPS). As defined, adjusted EPS is not necessari ly comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation. While management believes that some of the items excluded from adjusted EPS are not indicative of the company's operating performance, these items do impact the income statement, and management therefore utilizes adjusted EPS as an operating performance measure in conjunction with GAAP measures such as GAAP EPS.
Average healthcare professionals on assignment represents the average number of nurse and allied healthcare professionals on assignment during the period presented.
Revenue per healthcare professional per day and gross profit per healthcare professional per day represent the revenue and gross profit of the company's nurse and allied healthcare staffing segment divided by average healthcare professionals on assignment, divided by the number of days in the period presented.
Days filled is calculated by dividing the locum tenens hours filled during the period by 8 hours. Revenue per day filled and gross profit per day filled represent revenue and gross profit of the company's locum tenens staffing segment divided by days filled for the period presented.

Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
As previously reported on September 1, 2010, AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. closed its acquisition of NF Investors, Inc., a Delaware corporation, the parent company of Nursefinders, Inc. (dba Medfinders). The purpose of this Current Report on Form 8-K is to file the unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated statement of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2010, including the accompanying notes.
 
(b) Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information.
The following unaudited pro forma financial information is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1:
 
 
(d) Exhibits.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. ("AMN", the "Company", "our" or "we") acquired NF Investors, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("NFI"), the parent company of Nursefinders, Inc. (dba Medfinders) on September 1, 2010. The acquisition of NFI has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting and, accordingly, the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition. As of the date of this Form 8-K, AMN has not completed the detailed valuations necessary to finalize the estimate of the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed from NFI and the related allocations of purchase price. Thus, the purchase price allocation below is preliminary, and is subject to further adjustment. The final purchase price allocation is pending the completion of the Company's internal review of the valuation work and the finalization of the Company's Section 382 limitation analysis, which is expected to be completed during the fourth quarter of 2010. The provisional items pending finalization are the valuation of the acquired intangible assets, goodwill, property and equipment and income tax related matters. The adjustments may be material resulting in a retrospective change to our consolidated financial statements.
Our estimate of the total purchase price of NFI, excluding assumed NFI then-existing debt of $132,918, is summarized as follows:
 
The acquisition agreement includes a holdback of approximately 1,727 shares of series A conditional convertible preferred stock with an estimated fair value of $8,740, which were included in the 5,660 shares of preferred stock issued as part of the purchase price. Such shares were deposited in escrow to satisfy any indemnification claims by AMN against NFI with respect to breaches of representations, warranties and covenants by NFI and post closing purchase price adjustments. An initial distribution of approximately 273 shares of preferred shares, subject to certain adjustments, will be released to the former NFI stockholders upon the occurrence of certain events set forth in the agreement approximately 90 days after closing, with the remainder of the holdback, net of any indemnified claims made, released in September 2012.
Intangible assets include amounts recognized for the fair value of tradenames and trademarks, customer relationships, non-compete agreements and staffing databases. Based on a preliminary valuation, two tradenames and trademarks have an indefinite life, and the remaining intangible assets have a weighted average useful life of approximately 12 years. Because this valuation is preliminary, the valuation of intangible assets and their useful lives may change upon completion of the final valuation. The excess of the purchase price over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets is recorded as goodwill and is estimated to be approximately $118,365. In accordance with current accounting standards, the goodwill will not be amortized and will be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually and whenever circumstances occur indicating that goodwill might be impaired.
Our fiscal year ends on December 31 of each year. NFI's fiscal year ended on the Sunday nearest to December 31 of each year. The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated financial statement has been prepared to assist you in your analysis of the financial effects of the acquisition of NFI, and is presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated statement of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2010, combines the historical results for AMN for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 and the historical results for NFI for the eight months ended August 31, 2010, as if the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2010.
The pro forma information is being furnished solely for informational purposes and is not necessarily indicative of the combined results of operations that might have been achieved for the period indicated, nor is it necessarily indicative of the future results of the combined company. The pro forma information does not reflect cost savings expected to be realized from the elimination of certain expenses and from synergies expected to be created or the costs to achieve such cost savings or synergies. No assurance can be given that cost savings or synergies will be realized. Income taxes do not reflect the amounts that would have resulted had AMN and NFI filed consolidated income tax returns during the period presented. The pro forma adjustments are based upon information and assumptions available at the time of the filing of this Form 8-K. You should read our pro forma condensed combined consolidated financial information in conjunction with (i) our consolidated financial statements and the related notes, our "Selected Consolidated Financial and Operating Data," and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," which all appear in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, (ii) our condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," which appear in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as of September 30, 2010, and for the three and nine months then ended, and (iii) the historical audited financial statements and notes thereto of NFI (Successor Company) as of January 3, 2010 and December 28, 2008, and for each of the three operating periods ended January 3, 2010, December 28, 2008 and December 30, 2007, and Nursefinders, Inc. and subsidiaries (Predecessor Company) for the period from January 1, 2007 through August 9, 2007, the unaudited financial statements and notes thereto of NFI as of July 4, 2010 and for the six month periods ended July 4, 2010 and July 5, 2009, and the unaudited pro forma financial statements and notes thereto of the combined company as of June 30, 2010 and for the year ended December 31, 2009 and for the six month period ended June 30, 2010, which were included as Exhibits 99.1, 99.2 and 99.3, respectively, to the Current Report on Form 8-K/A filed on October 4, 2010.
 
1. Basis of Presentation
The accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated statement of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2010, combines the historical results for AMN for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 and the historical results for NFI for the eight months ended August 31, 2010, as if the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2010. The acquisition was recorded using the acquisition method of accounting.
2. Pro Forma Adjustments
(a) To reflect a $667 reduction in management fee, a $590 reduction in compensation expense related to non-recurring executive salary expense, and an adjustment of $7,364 relates to non-recurring acquisition related expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2010.
(b) To reflect additional depreciation and amortization expense of $2,186 related to the fair value of identifiable amortizable intangible assets and certain developed software, offset by $5,262 related to the depreciation and amortization of NFI's then-existing identifiable amortizable intangible assets and certain developed software for the nine months ended September 30, 2010.
(c) To reflect incremental interest expense related to additional AMN borrowings and deferred financing cost amortization of $8,291 for the nine months ended September 30, 2010, offset by the $19,351 interest expense incurred by NFI for the eight months ended August 31, 2010.
(d) Pro forma income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 reflects the statutory rate applicable to pro forma adjustments, adjusted for the permanent tax items which do not vary in proportion to pre-tax loss.
(e) To reflect the accumulated dividends on preferred stock based on the merger agreement.
(f) To reflect the issuance of 6,300 shares of common stock on the date of acquisition in the weighted average common shares outstanding as if the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2010.

Exhibit 99.2
 
Dear Susan,
It is with some sadness that I submit my resignation as CFO of AMN Healthcare to be effective on a date we mutually agree upon during the next two months. While I did originally plan to be with AMN longer, I have been offered an exciting opportunity with Cressey & Co., a private equity firm, as an operating partner. This is a firm I have worked with in the past and am excited by the opportunity and potential this role offers. This is a role I have looked at over the years with a great deal of interest that offers significant diversity in the healthcare arena and leverages my experience in both the provider and payer space.
I believe now is also an appropriate time to make this move as the finance team is very capable and the emphasis over the next year will be on expense management and efficiency while the company assimilates the recent Medfinders acquisition. While it is certainly the ultimate judgment of you and the Board, I am very confident that Brian Scott is ready and able to fulfill the CFO needs of the company under your leadership. Brian has been very involved in investor and lender activities, the integration of Medfinders and the planning for 2011. Brian's knowledge of the current business of AMN and his quick study on areas such as Home Health are recognized by everyone and I have relied on him in this regard.
More broadly, while I have been with AMN for only a year and a half, I have been impressed with the team here and the emphasis on delivering value and quality. It is this characteristic that will return the value to our shareholders, of which I am one and expect to remain. From the outset, we have talked about effective cost management, particularly given the economic environment, while not forsaking the need to ensure the organization is positioned to capture the greatest market share as the economy returns. I believe that AMN is so positioned. It is clear to me that you and the Board of Directors have these same views and values and are unwavering in accomplishing the objectives set out and delivering shareholder value. I have enjoyed being part of the AMN family and value the relationships I have built here and look forward to keeping in touch as AMN flourishes.
Thank you again for the opportunity to work with you and the AMN team.

THIS SEVERANCE AGREEMENT (the "Agreement"), dated effective as of January 24, 2011, is entered into by and between AMN Healthcare, Inc. (the "Company") and Brian M. Scott ("Executive"), in connection with Executive's employment by the Company in the position of Chief Financial Officer.
1. .
Employment at Will
The Company agrees to employ Executive and Executive hereby agrees to be employed by the Company upon such terms and conditions as are mutually agreed upon. Executive's employment with the Company shall be at the discretion of the Company. Executive hereby agrees and acknowledges that the Company may terminate Executive's employment at any time, for any reason, with or without cause, and without notice. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall (a) confer on Executive any right to continue in the employ of the Company, (b) constitute any contract or agreement of employment, or (c) interfere in any way with the at-will nature of Executive's employment with the Company.
2.
Severance Benefits.
(a) In the event that the Company terminates Executive's employment without "Cause" (as defined below), the Company agrees to pay to Executive severance payments in an amount equal to the sum of twelve (12) months base salary at the rate in effect on the date of the termination of Executive's employment (the "Termination Date"), plus the prorated portion of Executive's "Average Bonus" (an amount equal to the average of the performance bonus payments received by the Executive for the three most recent Fiscal Years (or such fewer number of fiscal years during which Executive was employed)), multiplied by the product of the number of days during the Performance Period that Executive was employed, divided by 365) ("Severance Benefits"). The Severance Benefits shall be payable in a lump sum on the first payroll date after the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 4 below. All withholding taxes and other deductions that the Company is required by law to make from wage payments to employees will be made from such severance payments. If Executive's employment terminates as a result of death or disability, such termination shall not be considered a termination without "Cause" that will entitle Executive to any severance payment.
(b) If Executive makes an election to continue Executive's coverage under the Company's group health plans pursuant to the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended ("COBRA"), during the period beginning on the Termination Date and ending on the earlier of (i) the twelve month anniversary of the Termination Date or (ii) the date upon which Executive becomes eligible for comparable coverage under another employer's group health plans, Executive shall continue to pay premiums with respect to such coverage to the same extent that Executive was paying such premiums immediately prior to such termination. Such period shall run concurrently with the period of Executive's rights under COBRA.
(c) If the Company relocates Executive's position to a locale beyond a 50 mile radius from the Company's headquarters at 12400 High Bluff Drive, Suite 100, San Diego, California 92130, it shall be considered a termination of Executive without "Cause," entitling Executive to resign and receive the Severance Benefits.
Notwithstanding the following, in order to be eligible to receive the Severance Benefits under this subsection 2(c), (i) Executive shall provide notice to the Company no more than 90 days after the occurrence of such relocation, (ii) such notice states the grounds for such voluntary resignation and an effective date no earlier than 30 days after it is given, and (iii) the Company has 30 days from the giving of such notice within which to cure and, in the event of such cure, such notice shall be of no further force or effect.
(d) In the event a termination without "Cause" occurs within one year after a "Change in Control," in lieu of the Severance Benefits payable under subsection 2(a) or (c), as the case may be, Executive shall be entitled to receive a lump sum equal to two (2) times the sum of Executive's twelve (12) months base salary at the rate in effect on the Termination Date plus the Average Bonus. Such amount shall be payable on the first payroll date after the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 4 below.
(e) For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms are defined as follows:
(i) "Cause" for termination of Executive shall mean (A) Executive's failure to perform in any material respect his or her duties as an employee of the Company, (B) violation of the Company's Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers and Principal Executive Officer, and/or Securities Trading Policy, (C) the engaging by Executive in willful misconduct or gross negligence which is injurious to the Company or any of its affiliates, monetarily or otherwise, (D) the commission by Executive of an act of fraud or embezzlement against the Company or any of its affiliates, or (E) the conviction of Executive of a crime which constitutes a felony or any lesser crime that involves Company property or a pleading of guilty or nolo contendere with respect to a crime which constitutes a felony or any lesser crime that involves Company property.
(ii) "Change in Control" shall be deemed to occur upon:
(A) The acquisition by any individual, entity or group (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) or 14(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")) (a "Person") of beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of a majority of the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors;
 
(B) the dissolution or liquidation of the Company;
(C) the sale of all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Company; or
(D) the consummation of a merger, consolidation or similar form of corporate transaction involving the Company that requires the approval of the Company's stockholders, whether for such transaction or the issuance of securities in the transaction (a "Business Combination"), if immediately following such Business Combination: (x) a Person is or becomes the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of a majority of the combined voting power of the outstanding voting securities eligible to elect directors of the Parent Corporation (or, if there is no Parent Corporation, the Surviving Corporation), or (y) the Company's shareholders cease to beneficially own, directly or indirectly, in substantially the same proportion as they owned the then outstanding voting securities immediately prior to the Business Combination, a majority of the combined voting power of the outstanding voting securities eligible to elect directors of the Parent Corporation (or, if there is no Parent Corporation, the Surviving Corporation). "Surviving Corporation" shall mean the corporation resulting from a Business Combination, and "Parent Corporation" shall mean the ultimate parent corporation that directly or indirectly has beneficial ownership of a majority of the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of the Surviving Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors.
3. .
No Other Payments
Executive understands and agrees that the payments and benefits described above are in lieu of, and discharge, any obligations of the Company to Executive for compensation, incentive or performance payments, or any other expectation or form of remuneration or benefit to which Executive may be entitled, including severance benefits under any Company plan or program, except for: (i) any unpaid wages due for work performed during any pay period(s) prior to the Termination Date; (ii) any unused vacation which is duly recorded on the Company's payroll records as of the Termination Date; (iii) the continuation of Executive's coverage under the Company's group health plans pursuant to COBRA, and (iv) any amounts payable to Executive under any retirement or savings plan of the Company in accordance with the terms of any such plan as in effect on the Termination Date.
 
4. .
Severance Benefits Conditioned Upon Release
Executive acknowledges and understands that Executive's eligibility for severance pay and other benefits hereunder is contingent upon Executive's execution and acceptance of the terms and conditions of, and the effectiveness of the Company's standard Covenant and General Release of All Claims (the "Release") as in effect on the Termination Date. The Company's standard Release may be modified from time to time in the Company's discretion as it deems appropriate. If Executive fails to execute a Release within twenty-one (21) days of receipt of such Release (or if Executive revokes such Release in a manner permitted by law or the applicable Release), then Executive shall not be entitled to any severance payments or other benefits to which Executive would otherwise be entitled under this Agreement.
5. .
Section 409A
Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, if at the time of Executive's separation from service, the Company determines Executive is a "specified employee" within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and if any payment that Executive becomes entitled to under this Agreement would be considered deferred compensation subject to interest and additional tax imposed pursuant to Section 409A(a) of the Code as a result of the application of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, then no such payment shall be payable prior to the date that is the earlier of (1) six months and one day after Executive's separation from service, or (2) Executive's death. If any such delayed cash payment is otherwise payable on an installment basis, the first payment shall include a catch-up payment covering amounts that would otherwise have been paid during the six-month period but for the application of this provision, and the balance of the installments shall be payable in accordance with their original schedule. The parties intend that this Agreement will be administered in accordance with Section 409A of the Code. The parties agree that this Agreement may be amended, as reasonably requested by either party, and as may be necessary to fully comply with Section 409A of the Code and all related rules and regulations in order to preserve the payments and benefits provided hereunder without additional cost to either party. The Company makes no representation or warranty and shall have no liability to Executive or any other person if any provisions of this Agreement are determined to constitute deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code but do not satisfy an exemption from, or the conditions of, such Section.
 
(6) .
Additional Limitation
(a) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event that any compensation, payment or distribution by the Company to or for the benefit of Executive, whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise (the "Severance Payments"), would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, the following provisions shall apply:
(i) If the Severance Payments, reduced by the sum of (A) the Excise Tax and (B) the total of the Federal, state, and local income and employment taxes payable by Executive on the amount of the Severance Payments which are in excess of the Threshold Amount, are greater than or equal to the Threshold Amount, Executive shall be entitled to the full benefits payable under this Agreement.
(ii) If the Threshold Amount is less than (A) the Severance Payments, but greater than (B) the Severance Payments reduced by the sum of (1) the Excise Tax and (2) the total of the Federal, state, and local income and employment taxes on the amount of the Severance Payments which are in excess of the Threshold Amount, then the benefits payable under this Agreement shall be reduced (but not below zero) to the extent necessary so that the sum of all Severance Payments shall not exceed the Threshold Amount.
(b) For the purposes of this Section 6, "Threshold Amount" shall mean three times Executive's "base amount" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder less one dollar ($1.00); and "Excise Tax" shall mean the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, and any interest or penalties incurred by Executive with respect to such excise tax.
(c) The determination as to which of the alternative provisions of Section 6(a) shall apply to Executive shall be made by a nationally recognized accounting firm selected by the Company (the "Accounting Firm"), which shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to the Company and the Executive within 15 business days of the Termination Date, if applicable, or at such earlier time as is reasonably requested by the Company or Executive. For purposes of determining which of the alternative provisions of Section 6(a) shall apply, Executive shall be deemed to pay federal income taxes at the highest marginal rate of federal income taxation applicable to individuals for the calendar year in which the determination is to be made, and state and local income taxes at the highest marginal rates of individual taxation in the state and locality of the Executive's residence on the Date of Termination, net of the maximum reduction in federal income taxes which could be obtained from deduction of such state and local taxes. Any determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon the Company and Executive.
 
7.
Term of Agreement.
Except for the provisions set forth in Paragraph 1 above relating to Executive's at will employment, the provisions of the Agreement including Executive's entitlement to Severance Benefits as described herein apply only to Executive's employment by the Company in the position of Chief Financial Officer. In the event Executive is offered and accepts a change in position (employment with the Company in a position other than Chief Financial Officer), this Agreement and Executive's entitlement to Severance Benefits hereunder automatically terminate.
8. .
Miscellaneous Provisions
(a) This Agreement contains the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and may be amended, modified or changed only by a written instrument executed by Executive and the Company. No provision of this Agreement may be waived except by a writing executed and delivered by the party sought to be charged. Executive acknowledges that this Agreement replaces any prior severance agreement entered into by and between the Company and Executive.

Section 8 - Other Events
Item 8.01 Other Events
Effective January 26, 2011, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), upon the request of AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. ("AMN" or the "Company"), declared effective the Registration Statement ("Shelf Registration Statement") on Form S-3 of the Company relating to the registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, of up to 10,718,486 shares of AMN common stock ("Registrable Securities") that may be offered by certain stockholders of the Company. The stockholders received capital stock of the Company in connection with the Company's acquisition of NF Investors, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("NFI"), the parent company of Nursefinders, Inc. (dba Medfinders) (the "Merger"). The 10,718,486 shares of common stock that constitute Registrable Securities include (i) the shares of common stock issuable to the Preferred Stockholders upon the conversion of the Company's Series A Conditional Convertible Preferred Stock ("Preferred Stock") that was issued to them in connection with the Merger; (ii) the shares of common stock issued to the Preferred Stockholders in connection with the Merger; and (iii) the shares of common stock otherwise owned by the Preferred Stockholders as of the time of the Merger. As of January 26, 2011, 5,585,870 shares of common stock that comprise the Registrable Securities are outstanding.
In connection with the Merger, the Company entered into a stockholders agreement (the "Stockholders Agreement") and registration rights agreement (the "Registration Rights Agreement") with certain former stockholders of NFI, including GSUIG, L.L.C. ("GSUIG") and HWP Capital Partners II, L.P. ("HWP"), and certain of their affiliates (collectively, the "Preferred Stockholders") that impose certain transfer restrictions on the capital stock of AMN held by the Preferred Stockholders as detailed below.
Pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement, subject to certain exceptions and notwithstanding the Shelf Registration Statement, (i) prior to March 1, 2011, the Preferred Stockholders are prohibited from transferring any shares of Preferred Stock (or shares of common stock issued upon conversion of such shares of Preferred Stock) without the Company's consent and (ii) the Preferred Stockholders are prohibited from transferring shares of Preferred Stock (or shares of common stock issued upon conversion of such shares of Preferred Stock) to a competitor of AMN without the Company's prior consent or otherwise transferring such shares in an amount constituting 5% or more of the voting capital stock of AMN then outstanding to a third party or any such shares to a third party who, immediately following such transfer, would beneficially own more than 15% of the voting capital stock of AMN then outstanding.
The Stockholders Agreement also limits the timing and amount of common stock that the Preferred Stockholders may publicly sell pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement. Specifically, before March 1, 2011, the Preferred Stockholders cannot make any public sales of our common stock pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement. During the period from March 1, 2011 to September 1, 2011, each Preferred Stockholder may only publicly sell up to 20% of the common stock owned by such Preferred Stockholder as of September 1, 2010. In addition, during each six-month period after September 1, 2011, each Preferred Stockholder may publicly sell an additional 20% of the common stock owned by such Preferred Stockholder (with each additional 20% being cumulative and in addition to the amount such Preferred Stockholder and its affiliates was otherwise permitted to sell but did not sell during the prior periods). These restrictions do not apply to private sales of common stock by the Preferred Stockholders.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

AMN Healthcare Announces Fourth Quarter 2010 Results
SAN DIEGO, March 8, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. (NYSE: AHS) today announced operating results for the fourth quarter and full year 2010. Financial highlights are as follows:
Key business highlights for the fourth quarter are as follows:
Consolidated revenues were up 25% sequentially and 52% year-over-year, meeting the upper range of guidance.
On an organic, same-store basis, consolidated revenues were up 1% sequentially and 9% year-over-year.
Revenues for the largest segment, Nurse and Allied staffing, were up 9% sequentially and 17% year-over-year, on an organic, same-store basis.
The company is on track to achieve the projected $10 million in annualized incremental EBITDA by the fourth quarter of 2011 from revenue and cost synergies associated with the Medfinders acquisition.
Demand is rising in our temporary staffing segments.
GAAP net loss and EPS includes $2 million during the quarter for integration costs related to the Medfinders acquisition.
"Faced with the approaching challenges of the new world of healthcare, increased patient access coupled with the need to gain cost efficiency without sacrificing quality of care, healthcare organizations are increasingly seeking comprehensive solutions to manage their temporary and permanent staffing needs in a more streamlined way through one supply chain manager and workforce expert. This noticeable change in the needs and buying behavior of our clients has highlighted the value delivered through an MSP arrangement," said Susan R. Salka, President and Chief Executive Officer of AMN Healthcare. "Clients are recognizing the value and differentiation of our comprehensive MSP offering, and since announcing the acquisition, AMN has been awarded 20 new MSP contracts of varying sizes with estimated annual gross spend under management of over $45 million. This positive reaction from our existing and new clients is evidence that we are indeed better together.
"We continue to experience positive signs of market recovery in our largest service line, Travel Nurse Staffing, which delivered organic, same-store revenue increases of 11% sequentially and 25% over prior year," added Salka. "This represents four consecutive quarters of organic, same-store sequential revenue growth, and the second consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. We are also encouraged by the improving trends we are seeing in our Locum Tenens business."
Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2010 Results
For the fourth quarter of 2010, consolidated revenue was $220 million, which represented an increase of 52% from prior year and 25% from prior quarter. Fourth quarter revenue for the Nurse and Allied Healthcare Staffing segment was $127 million, an increase of 72% from the same quarter last year and 37% sequentially. The Locum Tenens Staffing segment generated revenue of $69 million, an increase of 11% from prior year but a slight decrease sequentially. Fourth quarter Physician Permanent Placement Services revenue was $9 million, an increase of 13% from prior year and 7% sequentially. Through the acquisition, the company introduced the new Home Healthcare Services segment in the third quarter. Fourth quarter revenue for Home Healthcare Services was $14 million, which reflected the first full quarter performance since the acquisition.
For the full year 2010, revenue was $689 million, a decrease of 9% from prior year. Nurse and Allied Healthcare Staffing segment revenue was $371 million, a decrease of 14% from prior year, Locum Tenens Staffing segment revenue was $265 million, a decrease of 9% from prior year, and Physician Permanent Placement Services segment revenue was $34 million, a decrease of 8% from prior year. Home Healthcare Services segment revenue was $19 million, representing four months of revenue for this segment for 2010.
Gross margin in the fourth quarter of 2010 was 28.1%, a decrease of 30 bps from prior year and an increase of 70 bps compared to the previous quarter. Full year gross margin was 27.8%, as compared to 26.9% for prior year. The increase in gross margin was due to an improvement in gross margin within the Nurse and Allied Healthcare Staffing segment, as well as the addition of the higher-margin Medfinders business.
Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses as a percentage of revenue for the fourth quarter were 24.9%, compared to 22.4% in the same quarter last year and 26.5% in the prior quarter. SG&A expenses included a $1.2 million bad debt expense related to a locum tenens client in the fourth quarter, as well as acquisition and integration costs of $2 million and $6 million for the fourth and third quarters, respectively. For the full year, SG&A expenses were 24.4% as a percentage of revenue compared to 20.7% for prior year. Full year SG&A expenses increased by $11 million due primarily to acquisition and integration related costs which totaled approximately $9 million.
During the fourth quarter, the company recorded a charge of $1.1 million associated with the finalization of the goodwill impairment analysis that was initiated in the prior quarter. This charge, along with that taken in the prior quarter, relate to pre-acquisition goodwill.
Fourth quarter GAAP net loss per diluted common share was ($0.03) and included the negative impacts of ($0.01) for the non-cash goodwill asset impairment and the ($0.02) impact of acquisition-related costs, along with a $0.01 benefit from forgiving accumulated dividends as a result of the stockholder approval of certain provisions on the preferred securities issued in connection with the acquisition. Full year GAAP net loss per diluted common share was ($1.49) and included the negative impacts of ($1.26) of non-cash goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges, ($0.17) of acquisition-related charges and ($0.09) for the write off of financing costs.
As of December 31, 2010, cash and cash equivalents totaled $2 million, compared to $27 million as of December 31, 2009. Total term debt outstanding, net of discount, as of December 31, 2010 was $215 million, with no borrowings on the revolver portion of the credit facility.
Business Trends and Outlook
Going into the first quarter of 2011, the Nursing and Allied Healthcare Staffing segment continues to experience positive momentum overall with 2% to 4% sequential revenue growth anticipated.  This is being led by an expected increase in travel nurse volumes of at least 40% above prior year levels in March. The Physician businesses are expected to show a slight sequential improvement in first quarter revenues, and the Home Healthcare Services segment is expected to experience a slight sequential decline. On a consolidated basis, first quarter revenues are expected to be between $223 million and $227 million. Gross margin is anticipated to remain steady with the prior quarter.  
While the Company does not intend to provide annual guidance on revenue and EPS, on the earnings call today the management team will be providing full year estimates for depreciation and amortization, interest expense, share count and capital expenditures.

AMN Healthcare Announces First Quarter 2011 Results
SAN DIEGO, May 5, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. (NYSE: AHS) today announced operating results for the first quarter of 2011. Financial highlights are as follows:
Key business highlights for the first quarter are as follows:
Revenues for our largest segment, Nurse and Allied staffing, were up 6% sequentially, due primarily to a 13% sequential and 44% year-over-year increase in travel nurse staffing.
Revenues from Locum Tenens staffing were sequentially up by 1%.
Demand continues to rise in our temporary staffing segments.
We continue to be successful in winning new managed services program (MSP) contracts in the marketplace.
"We continue to experience a steady market recovery, as represented by a fourth consecutive quarter of sequential, consolidated revenue growth. A healthy indicator of the improved underlying market demand is that it has been broad-based across many clients, specialties and geographies," said Susan R. Salka, President and Chief Executive Officer of AMN Healthcare. "We are also seeing our acquisition of Medfinders continue to pay off. Our stronger, combined managed services program offering has brought value and differentiation to our healthcare clients, and this has helped our travel nurse staffing business to grow at a faster pace.
"The integration of Medfinders has also exceeded our expectations, as we are ahead of schedule to achieve the $10 million of targeted annualized incremental EBITDA from revenue and cost synergies. With the major integration projects now completed, we believe we can achieve this target by the third quarter, one quarter early," added Salka. "This is a great example of the value an organization can create when talented and dedicated team members come together with the purpose of achieving common goals to serve their clients."
First Quarter 2011 Results
For the first quarter of 2011, consolidated revenue was $229 million, which represented an increase of 4% from prior quarter and 60% from prior year. First quarter revenue for the Nurse and Allied Healthcare Staffing segment was $135 million, an increase of 6% sequentially and 79% from the same quarter last year. The Locum Tenens Staffing segment generated revenue of $70 million, an increase of 1% sequentially and 16% from prior year. First quarter Physician Permanent Placement Services revenue was $11 million, an increase of 16% sequentially and 41% from prior year, and included the recognition of $2.1 million of revenue associated with the adoption of a new FASB revenue recognition standard. First quarter revenue for the Home Healthcare Services segment, which was added in the third quarter of 2010 through the acquisition, was $14 million, a decrease of 5% from the prior quarter.
Gross margin in the first quarter of 2011 was 29.6%, an increase of 150 bps compared to the previous quarter and 170 bps from prior year. The increase was due primarily to a $1.9 million actuarial-based workers compensation benefit and the adoption of the revenue recognition standard previously noted.
Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses as a percentage of revenue for the first quarter were 23.1%, compared to 24.9% in the prior quarter and 22.3% in the same quarter last year. Included in SG&A expenses in the first quarter were $1.3 million of integration-related expenses. The sequential decrease was due to lower integration-related costs in the first quarter, the inclusion in fourth quarter SG&A expenses of a $1.2 million bad debt expense related to a locum tenens client, and the leveraging of the improved cost infrastructure and acquisition synergies.
First quarter 2011 GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.05 and included the ($0.02) impact of integration-related costs.
As of March 31, 2011, cash and cash equivalents totaled $4 million, compared to $2 million as of December 31, 2010. Total term debt outstanding, net of discount, as of March 31, 2011 was $213 million.
Business Trends and Outlook
Going into the second quarter of 2011, the Nursing and Allied Healthcare Staffing segment continues to experience positive momentum overall with 2% to 4% sequential revenue growth anticipated. This is being led by an expected increase in pro-forma travel nurse volumes of at least 30% above prior year levels. The Locum Tenens segment is expected to show a sequential improvement with a 2% to 4% increase in second quarter revenues. Physician Permanent Placement revenues are anticipated to be stable, excluding the impact of the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard. The Home Healthcare Services segment is expected to be up approximately 5%. On a consolidated basis, second quarter revenues are expected to be between $234 million and $238 million. Gross margin is anticipated to be between 27.5% and 28.0%. SG&A expenses are expected to be steady with the prior quarter.

AMN Healthcare Announces Second Quarter 2011 Results
SAN DIEGO, Aug. 4, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. (NYSE: AHS) today announced operating results for the second quarter of 2011. Financial highlights are as follows:
(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)
Key business highlights for the second quarter are as follows:
In our temporary staffing segments, revenues were up sequentially and demand continues to rise.
Revenues for our largest segment, Nurse and Allied Staffing, were up 4% sequentially, due primarily to a 5% sequential and 36% year-over-year pro forma increase in travel nurse staffing.
Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses were flat versus prior quarter, an improvement as a percentage of revenues of 70 bps sequentially and 80 bps year-over-year.
Our momentum in winning new managed services program (MSP) contracts continues, with 30 new MSP clients added during the last 12 months representing approximately $75 million in annualized gross spend under management.
"We continue to experience a steady market recovery, as represented by a fifth consecutive quarter of sequential, consolidated revenue growth. This performance has been driven primarily by the overall health and improvement in the travel nursing business, as well as the continued addition of new clients who have chosen AMN Healthcare as their MSP partner," said Susan R. Salka, President and Chief Executive Officer of AMN Healthcare. "We are also experiencing the performance improvement and cost savings benefits from the Medfinders acquisition, which we closed almost a year ago."
Second Quarter 2011 Results
For the second quarter of 2011, consolidated revenue was $235 million, which represented an increase of 2% from prior quarter and 57% from the same quarter last year. Second quarter revenue for the Nurse and Allied Healthcare Staffing segment was $140 million, an increase of 4% sequentially and 85% from the same quarter last year. The Locum Tenens Staffing segment generated revenue of $71 million, an increase of 1% sequentially and 9% from the same quarter last year. Second quarter Physician Permanent Placement Services segment revenue was $9 million, a decrease of 13% sequentially and an increase of 14% from the same quarter last year. This sequential decline was due primarily to the adoption of a new revenue recognition standard in the first quarter. Second quarter revenue for the Home Healthcare Services segment, which was added in the third quarter of 2010 through the Medfinders acquisition, was $14 million, an increase of 2% from the prior quarter.
Gross margin in the second quarter of 2011 was 27.7%, a decrease of 190 bps compared to the previous quarter and an increase of 10 bps from the same quarter last year. The sequential decrease was due primarily to a first quarter $1.9 million actuarial-based workers compensation benefit and the new revenue recognition standard mentioned previously.
SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue for the second quarter were 22.4%, compared to 23.1% in the prior quarter and 23.2% in the same quarter last year. The decrease was due to the leveraging of an improved cost infrastructure and acquisition synergies. Included in SG&A expenses in the second quarter were $1.2 million of integration-related expenses. Without the integration costs, SG&A expenses were 21.9% of revenues.
Second quarter 2011 GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.02. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.03 excluding integration-related costs.
As of June 30, 2011, cash and cash equivalents totaled $8 million, and total debt outstanding, net of discount, was $216 million.
Business Trends and Outlook
Going into the third quarter of 2011, the Nurse and Allied Healthcare Staffing segment continues to experience positive momentum overall with 2% to 4% sequential revenue growth anticipated. This is being led by an expected increase in travel nurse volumes of at least 30% above prior year pro forma levels. The Locum Tenens Staffing segment is expected to show a sequential improvement of 3% to 5% in third quarter revenues. Physician Permanent Placement Services segment revenues are anticipated to remain stable sequentially. The Home Healthcare Services segment revenues are expected to be up 1% to 3% from the prior quarter. On a consolidated basis, third quarter revenues are expected to be between $241 million and $245 million. Gross margin is anticipated to be between 27.0% and 27.5%. SG&A expenses are expected to be approximately 22% of revenues.

Exhibit 99.1
 
SAN DIEGO  (November 3, 2011)  AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. (NYSE: AHS) today announced operating results for the third quarter of 2011. Financial highlights are as follows:
(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)
 
 
NM  Not meaningful
Key business highlights for the third quarter are as follows:
 
 
 
 
"We continue to experience a steady market recovery, with sequential revenue growth across our largest business segments of Nursing and Allied Healthcare Staffing and Locum Tenens," said Susan R. Salka, President and Chief Executive Officer of AMN Healthcare. "We have been successful in adding new managed services program (MSP) clients and expanding our leadership position in this important service offering, which is increasingly preferred by clients. Since July of this year, we have executed new MSP contracts with an expected annualized gross revenue opportunity of over $35 million in 2012 and beyond."
Third Quarter 2011 Results
For the third quarter of 2011, consolidated revenue was $242 million, an increase of 3% sequentially and 37% from the same quarter last year. Third quarter revenue for the Nurse and Allied Healthcare Staffing segment was $148 million, an increase of 6% sequentially and 59% from the same quarter last year. The Locum Tenens Staffing segment generated revenue in the third quarter of $72 million, an increase of 1% sequentially and 4% from the same quarter last year. Third quarter Physician Permanent Placement Services segment revenue was $9 million, a decrease of 3% sequentially and an increase of 6% from the same quarter last year. This sequential decline was due to the adoption of a new revenue recognition standard on January 1, 2011, which had a larger positive impact in the second quarter. Third quarter revenue for the Home Healthcare Services segment, which was added in the third quarter of 2010 through the Medfinders acquisition, was $13 million, a decrease of 5% from the prior quarter.
"The Nurse and Allied Healthcare Staffing results exceeded our expectations, and we are encouraged by the steady improvement in the underlying gross margins and continued opportunity for market share gains through our MSP clients. While the Locum Tenens segment showed sequential growth, the results were below our previous expectations. This shortfall was driven primarily by lower fill rates, which we believe can be improved upon in the coming months," added Salka.
Gross margin in the third quarter of 2011 was 28.4%, an increase of 70 basis points compared to the previous quarter and an increase of 100 basis points from the same quarter last year. The sequential increase was due primarily to $1.1 million of positive workers' compensation adjustments along with an improvement in bill-pay spreads in our temporary staffing segments. Without the workers' compensation adjustments, gross margin was up 20 basis points sequentially and 50 basis points year-over-year.
 
SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue for the third quarter were 22.2%, compared to 22.4% in the prior quarter and 26.5% in the same quarter last year. The decrease compared to both periods was due primarily to lower integration-related expenses associated with the Medfinders acquisition, with $0.2 million in the third quarter, compared to $1.2 million last quarter and $6.3 million of acquisition-related costs in the third quarter of last year. Excluding integration costs, SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenues were 22.1%, which was up 20 basis points from the prior quarter and down 90 basis points from the same quarter last year.
Third quarter 2011 GAAP net loss per diluted share was ($0.67), which included $31.2 million of non-cash goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges associated with the Home Healthcare Services segment. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.05, excluding impairment costs, integration-related costs, and credit agreement amendment fees of $1.1 million charged to interest expense. The impairment was driven by the future outlook of the home healthcare industry, which is being impacted primarily by adverse federal and state reimbursement rate and funding pressures.
In October, the Company signed a non-binding letter of intent with a strategic buyer to acquire our 19 home healthcare offices. Although not assured, we intend to execute a purchase agreement with this buyer during the fourth quarter, with a target close date during the first quarter of 2012.
As of September 30, 2011, cash and cash equivalents totaled $5 million, and total debt outstanding, net of discount, was $210 million.
Business Trends and Outlook
Going into the fourth quarter of 2011, most of our business segments will experience typical seasonal declines, with the exception of the Nurse and Allied Healthcare Staffing segment, which is expected to be flat sequentially. On a consolidated basis, fourth quarter
 
revenues are expected to be between $232 million and $236 million. Gross margin is anticipated to be between 27.5% and 28.0%. SG&A expenses are expected to be approximately 22.5% of revenues. Adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be approximately 6.0%. The anticipated year-over-year improvement in consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin reflects our ability to gain operating leverage as the business grows. Based on these expectations, full year consolidated revenues are projected to be approximately $940 million, an increase over 2010 of approximately 36% and 9% as reported and pro forma, respectively.

SAN DIEGO  (January 30, 2012)  AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. (NYSE: AHS) announced it has completed the sale of its home healthcare business to BAYADA Home Health Care, Inc. effective January 30, 2012. As a result of the sale, AMN will receive cash proceeds of $9.65 million and retain working capital of approximately $4 million.

"Our primary strategy of evolving our innovative healthcare workforce solutions offerings and improving profitability through growth and leverage of our leadership position in managed services programs continues to be on track." Salka noted. "We have our sights set on another year of industry leading revenue and profitability growth and continuing to build our market share in 2012."
As a result of the sale, the home healthcare segment will be reported in for all applicable periods presented in our consolidated financial statements. Due to this presentation, fourth quarter revenues from are now expected to be between $219 million and $223 million, which is consistent with previous guidance excluding approximately $13 million of revenue associated with the home healthcare segment. Gross margin is expected to be at the high end of the previous range provided of 27.5% to 28.0% and adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be above the prior target of 6%. The sale of this segment is not expected to have a meaningful impact to fourth quarter income from . The Company's 19 franchisee-owned Nursefinders offices were not included in the transaction.

Exhibit 99.1
 
SAN DIEGO  (March 8, 2012)  AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. (NYSE: AHS), the nation's innovator in healthcare workforce solutions, today announced financial results for the full year and fourth quarter 2011. The results were at the upper end of management's expectations, the Company said. Financial highlights are as follows:
(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts. Amounts have been adjusted to reflect the impact of the discontinued operations associated with the disposal of the Home Healthcare Services segment in January 2012.)
 
 
NM  Not meaningful
Key business highlights for the full year and fourth quarter of 2011 are as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
"Going into 2012, we are focused on fulfilling our clients' desire for more workforce solutions and innovative service offerings. AMN's leading position and differentiated value proposition in workforce solutions has put us at the forefront of growth and thought leadership in our industry," said Susan R. Salka, President and Chief Executive Officer of AMN Healthcare. "An indicator of the positive client reaction to our differentiated capabilities was the 20 new MSP contracts won during the year with an estimated $80 million in annualized gross spend under management. We expect these growth trends in MSP and other workforce solutions to continue."
Full Year and Fourth Quarter 2011 Results
Full year 2011 consolidated revenue was $887 million, an increase of 32% from prior year. Nurse and Allied Healthcare Staffing segment revenue was $571 million, a year-over-year increase of 54%. Locum Tenens Staffing segment revenue was $278 million, a year-over-year increase of 5%. Physician Permanent Placement Services segment revenue was $39 million, a year-over-year increase of 14%.
For the fourth quarter of 2011, consolidated revenue was $222 million, a decrease of 3% sequentially and an increase of 8% from the same quarter last year. The sequential decline was due to typical seasonality from fewer clinicians on assignment and overall fewer hours worked
 
over the holidays. Fourth quarter revenue for the Nurse and Allied Healthcare Staffing segment was $148 million, flat sequentially and up 16% from the same quarter last year. The Locum Tenens Staffing segment generated revenue in the fourth quarter of $65 million, a decrease of 10% sequentially and 7% from the same quarter last year. Fourth quarter Physician Permanent Placement Services segment revenue was $9 million, an increase of 2% sequentially and flat from the same quarter last year.
Full year gross margin was 28.1% as compared to 27.5% for prior year. The increase in 2011 gross margin was due primarily to favorable workers compensation adjustments and improved performance within the Nurse and Allied Healthcare Staffing segment, the impact from the adoption of a new revenue recognition accounting standard on January 1, 2011 in the Physician Permanent Placement Services segment, as well as the addition of the higher margin Medfinders businesses. Gross margin in the fourth quarter of 2011 was 28.3%, an increase of 50 basis points compared to the previous quarter and an increase of 80 basis points from the same quarter last year.
For the full year, SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue were 22.0% compared to 24.3% for the prior year, due primarily to improved operating leverage and the cost synergies achieved through the integration of Medfinders. SG&A expenses for the fourth quarter of 2011 were $49.0 million, representing 22.1% as a percent of revenue, compared to 21.6% in the prior quarter and 24.6% in the same quarter last year. The decrease compared to the same quarter last year was due primarily to lower integration-related expenses associated with the Medfinders acquisition and the resulting improved SG&A leverage. Excluding acquisition and integration related costs, SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenues were 21.9% in the fourth quarter of 2011, which was up 40 basis points from the prior quarter and down 170 basis points from the same quarter last year.
Full year and fourth quarter 2011 net loss per diluted common share was ($0.57) and ($0.05), respectively. Full year and fourth quarter 2011 loss per share was impacted by $31.2 million and $7.7 million, respectively, in non-cash goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges. Excluding the discontinued Home Healthcare Services segment and associated non-cash goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, integration-related costs, and credit agreement amendment fees charged to interest expense, adjusted earnings per share for the full year and fourth quarter 2011 was $0.16 and $0.04, respectively.
 
As of December 31, 2011, cash and cash equivalents totaled $4 million, compared to $2 million as of December 31, 2010. Total debt outstanding, net of discount, as of December 31, 2011 was $205 million, compared to $215 million as of December 31, 2010. Subsequent to year-end, the Company made a voluntary debt payment of $5 million and paid off its $3 million revolver balance.
Business Trends and Outlook
On a consolidated basis, first quarter revenues are expected to be between $224 million and $228 million, which represents a 1% to 3% sequential increase. This anticipated sequential increase is driven by continued growth in the Nurse and Allied Healthcare Staffing segment, with flat revenues in the Locum Tenens segment. Gross margin is anticipated to be between 27.5% and 28.0%. SG&A expenses are expected to be approximately 22.0% of revenues. Adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be approximately 6.5%.
While the Company does not intend to provide annual guidance on revenue and EPS, on the earnings call today management will provide full year estimates for depreciation and amortization, interest expense, share count and capital expenditures.

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On April 5, 2012, AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. (the "Company") entered into a Credit Agreement (the "New Credit Agreement") by and among (1) the Company, as a guarantor, (2) AMN Healthcare, Inc., as borrower (the "Borrower"), (3) certain subsidiaries of the Borrower, as guarantors, (4) the several lenders from time to time party thereto, as lenders (the "Lenders"), and (5) SunTrust Bank, as administrative agent for the Lenders (the "Administrative Agent"), to provide for two credit facilities (the "Credit Facilities"), including (A) a $50 million secured revolving credit facility (the "Revolver") that includes a $20 million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit and a $15 million sublimit for swingline loans and (B) a $200 million secured term loan credit facility (the "Term Loan"). In addition, the New Credit Agreement provides that the Borrower may from time to time obtain an increase in the Revolver or the Term Loan in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $75 million (with a $37.5 million sublimit for the Revolver) subject to, among other conditions, the arrangement of additional commitments with financial institutions reasonably acceptable to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent.
The Company and each domestic subsidiary of the Borrower (the "Guarantors") have guaranteed the obligations of the Borrower under the New Credit Agreement. The obligations of the Borrower and the Guarantors under the New Credit Agreement and the Credit Facilities are secured by substantially all of their assets.
The proceeds from the initial drawdown under the Credit Facilities included (1) a drawdown of the entire $200 million under the Term Loan and (2) a drawdown of approximately $3.0 million under the Revolver. The proceeds were used to repay in full all outstanding indebtedness under the Borrower's existing credit facilities (the "Existing Credit Facilities") under two existing credit agreements to which the Company, the Borrower and certain of the Borrower's subsidiaries were a party, and to pay related transaction costs. In addition, approximately $10 million of standby letters of credit issued under the Existing Credit Facilities have been rolled under and deemed issued under the Revolver.
The Revolver is available for working capital, capital expenditures, permitted acquisitions and general corporate purposes of the Company and its subsidiaries. The maturity date of the Revolver is April 5, 2017; the maturity date of the Term Loan is April 5, 2018.
The Revolver carries an unused fee of 0.5% per annum. There are no mandatory reductions in the Revolver. Borrowings under the Revolver bear interest at floating rates based upon either a LIBOR or a prime interest rate option selected by the Borrower, plus a spread of 3.75% to 4.25% and 2.75% to 3.25%, respectively, in each case, as specifically determined quarterly based upon the Borrower's then-existing Consolidated Leverage Ratio.
The Term Loan is subject to amortization of principal of 1.00% per year of the original Term Loan amount, payable in equal quarterly installments. Borrowings under the Term Loan bear interest at floating rates based upon either a LIBOR (with a floor of 1.25%) or a prime interest rate option selected by the Borrower, plus a spread of 4.50% to 4.75% and 3.50% to 3.75%, respectively, in each case, as specifically determined quarterly based upon the Borrower's then-existing Consolidated Leverage Ratio.
The New Credit Agreement requires the Borrower to make additional customary mandatory prepayments of the Credit Facilities with the proceeds of certain asset dispositions, extraordinary receipts, debt issuances and equity issuances. Unless the Borrower's Consolidated Leverage Ratio
falls below a certain threshold, the New Credit Agreement also requires the Borrower to make mandatory prepayments of the Credit Facilities within ninety days after the end of each fiscal year, commencing with the fiscal year ending December 31, 2012, in an amount equal to 25% or 50% (as specifically determined based on the Borrower's Consolidated Leverage Ratio) of the Company's Excess Cash Flow, less any voluntary prepayments made during the fiscal year of the (1) Term Loan or (2) the Revolver to the extent any prepayment of the Revolver is accompanied by a permanent reduction in the amount of the Revolver. Finally, the New Credit Agreement contains a prepayment penalty of 1.00% if the Term Loan is repaid or otherwise refinanced in the first year following the closing date with a new term loan with a lower all in yield than the existing Term Loan.
The New Credit Agreement contains various customary affirmative and negative covenants. It also contains financial covenants that require the Borrower (1) not to exceed a certain maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio and (2) to maintain a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio. The payment obligations under the New Credit Agreement may be accelerated upon the occurrence of defined events of default.
The foregoing description of the New Credit Agreement is a summary and does not contain all of the exceptions and qualifications that may apply. The foregoing description of the New Credit Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual agreement, which we intend to file within the time period prescribed by the SEC rules and regulations. Unless the context otherwise indicates, capitalized terms used in this Item 1.01 without definition have the meanings given to them in the New Credit Agreement.
The Lenders and the Administrative Agent and their affiliates have provided, and may in the future provide, various investment banking, commercial banking and other financial services for us for which services they have received, and may in the future receive, customary fees.
Item 1.02 Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement.
On April 5, 2012, the Company used all of the proceeds from the initial drawdown under the Credit Facilities to (1) repay in full all outstanding indebtedness under the Existing Credit Facilities, which were governed by (A) the Credit Agreement dated as of December 23, 2009 by and among the Company, as a guarantor, the Borrower, as borrower, certain subsidiaries of the Borrower, as guarantors, certain lenders and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent for the lenders (as amended or modified, the "First Lien Credit Agreement"), and (B) the Credit Agreement dated as of September 1, 2010 by and among the Company, as a guarantor, the Borrower, as borrower, certain subsidiaries of the Borrower, as guarantors, certain lenders and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent for the lenders (as amended or modified, the "Second Lien Credit Agreement"), and (2) pay related transactions costs. The First Lien Credit Agreement and the Second Lien Credit Agreement were terminated upon the repayment of the outstanding indebtedness.
In connection with the termination of the Second Lien Credit Agreement, the Borrower paid a prepayment premium of $1.2 million in the aggregate to the lenders thereunder pursuant to the terms of the Second Lien Credit Agreement.
The lenders and the administrative agent under the First Lien Credit Agreement and the Second Lien Credit Agreement and their affiliates have provided, and may in the future provide, various investment banking, commercial banking and other financial services for us for which services they have received, and may in the future receive, customary fees.
Item 2.03. Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
The information set forth in Item 1.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is incorporated into this Item 2.03 by reference.

Add-Back of Certain Shares
(c) .
Intentionally Omitted
(d) . Shares of Stock may be issued up to such maximum number pursuant to any type or types of Award; provided, however, that Stock Options or Stock Appreciation Rights with respect to no more than 1,000,000 shares of Stock may be granted to any one individual grantee during any one calendar year period. In addition, no more than 1,000,000 shares of Stock may be issued pursuant to the Plan as Incentive Stock Options.
Individual Limitations
(e) . Any shares of Stock issued hereunder may consist, in whole or in part, of authorized and unissued shares, treasury shares or shares purchased in the open market or otherwise.
Character of Shares
(f) . Subject to Section 3(g) hereof, if, as a result of any reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or other similar change in the Company's capital stock, the outstanding shares of Stock are increased or decreased or are exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or other securities of the Company, or additional shares or new or different shares or other securities of the Company or other non-cash assets are distributed with respect to such shares of Stock or other securities, or, if, as a result of any merger or consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, the outstanding shares of Stock are converted into or exchanged for a different number or kind of securities of the Company or any successor entity (or a parent or subsidiary thereof), the Administrator shall make an appropriate or proportionate adjustment in (i) the maximum number of shares reserved for issuance under the Plan, (ii) the number of Stock Options or Stock Appreciation Rights that can be granted to any one individual grantee and the maximum number of shares that may be granted under a Performance-based Award or as Incentive Stock Options, (iii) the number and kind of shares or other securities subject to any then outstanding Awards under the Plan, (iv) the repurchase price, if any, per share subject to each outstanding Restricted Stock Award, and (v) the price for each share subject to any
Changes in Stock
 
then outstanding Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights under the Plan, without changing the aggregate exercise price (i.e., the exercise price multiplied by the number of Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights) as to which such Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights remain exercisable. The adjustment by the Administrator shall be final, binding and conclusive. No fractional shares of Stock shall be issued under the Plan resulting from any such adjustment, but the Administrator in its discretion may make a cash payment in lieu of fractional shares.
The Administrator shall also adjust the number of shares subject to outstanding Awards and the exercise price and the terms of outstanding Awards in a proportionate manner to take into consideration material changes in accounting practices or principles, extraordinary dividends, acquisitions or dispositions of stock or property or any other similar event to avoid distortion in the operation of the Plan, provided that no such adjustment shall be made in the case of a Stock Option or Stock Appreciation Right, without the consent of the grantee, if it would constitute a modification, extension or renewal of the Option within the meaning of Section 424(h) of the Code.
(g) . In the case of and subject to the consummation of (i) the dissolution or liquidation of the Company, (ii) the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company on a consolidated basis to an unrelated person or entity, (iii) a merger, reorganization or consolidation in which the outstanding shares of Stock are converted into or exchanged for a different kind of securities of the successor entity and the holders of the Company's outstanding voting power immediately prior to such transaction do not own a majority of the outstanding voting power of the successor entity immediately upon completion of such transaction, or (iv) the sale of all of the Stock of the Company to an unrelated person or entity (in each case, a "Sale Event"), all Options and Stock Appreciation Rights that are not exercisable immediately prior to the effective time of the Sale Event shall become fully exercisable as of the effective time of the Sale Event and all other Awards shall become fully vested and nonforfeitable as of the effective time of the Sale Event, except as the Administrator may otherwise specify with respect to particular Awards in the relevant Award documentation, and Awards with conditions and restrictions relating to the attainment of performance goals may become vested and nonforfeitable in connection with a Sale Event in the Administrator's discretion. Upon the effective time of the Sale Event, the Plan and all outstanding Awards granted hereunder shall terminate, unless provision is made in connection with the Sale Event in the sole discretion of the parties thereto for the assumption or continuation of Awards theretofore granted by the successor entity, or the substitution of such Awards with new Awards of the successor entity or parent thereof, with appropriate adjustment as to the number and kind of shares and, if appropriate, the per share exercise prices, as such parties shall agree (after taking into account any acceleration hereunder). In the event of such termination, each grantee shall be permitted, within a specified period of time prior to the consummation of the Sale Event as determined by the Administrator, to exercise all outstanding Options and Stock Appreciation Rights held by such grantee, including those that will become exercisable upon the consummation of the Sale Event; provided, however, that the exercise of Options and Stock Appreciation Rights not exercisable prior to the Sale Event shall be subject to the consummation of the Sale Event. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 3(g), in the event of a Sale Event pursuant to which holders of the Stock of the Company will receive upon consummation thereof a cash payment for each share surrendered in the Sale Event, the Company shall have the right, but not the obligation, to make or provide for a cash payment to the grantees holding Options and Stock Appreciation Rights, in exchange for the cancellation thereof, in an amount equal to the difference between (A) the value as determined by the Administrator of the consideration payable per share of Stock pursuant to the Sale Event (the "Sale Price") times the number of shares of Stock subject to outstanding Options and Stock Appreciation Rights (to the extent then exercisable at prices not in excess of the Sale Price) and (B) the aggregate exercise price of all such outstanding Options and Stock Appreciation Rights.
Mergers and Other Transactions
(h) . The Administrator may grant Awards under the Plan in substitution for stock and stock based awards held by employees, directors or other key persons of another corporation in connection with the merger or consolidation of the employing corporation with the Company or a Subsidiary or the acquisition by the Company or a Subsidiary of property or stock of the employing corporation. The Administrator may direct that the substitute awards be granted on such terms and conditions as the Administrator considers appropriate in the circumstances. Substitute Awards shall not reduce the shares authorized for grant under the Plan or the applicable limitations for grant to a grantee under Section 3(d) or 10(d), nor shall shares subject to a Substitute Award again be available for Awards under the Plan to the extent of any forfeiture, expiration or cash settlement as provided in paragraph (b) above.
Substitute Awards
 
SECTION 4.
ELIGIBILITY
Grantees under the Plan will be such officers and other employees, Non-Employee Directors and key persons (including consultants and prospective employees) of the Company and its Subsidiaries as are selected from time to time by the Administrator in its discretion.
SECTION 5.
STOCK OPTIONS
(a) . Any Stock Option granted under the Plan shall be in such form as the Administrator may from time to time approve.
Grant of Stock Options
Stock Options granted under the Plan may be either Incentive Stock Options or Non-Qualified Stock Options. Incentive Stock Options may be granted only to employees of the Company or any Subsidiary that is a "subsidiary corporation" within the meaning of Section 424(f) of the Code. To the extent that any Option does not qualify as an Incentive Stock Option, it shall be deemed a Non-Qualified Stock Option. Stock Options granted pursuant to this Section 5 shall be subject to the following terms and conditions and shall contain such additional terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the terms of the Plan, as the Administrator shall deem desirable. If the Administrator so determines, Stock Options may be granted in lieu of cash compensation at the optionee's election, subject to such terms and conditions as the Administrator may establish.
(b) . The exercise price per share for the Stock covered by a Stock Option granted pursuant to this Section 5 shall be determined by the Administrator at the time of grant but shall not be less than 100 percent of the Fair Market Value on the date of grant. In the case of an Incentive Stock Option that is granted to a Ten Percent Owner, the option price of such Incentive Stock Option shall be not less than 110 percent of the Fair Market Value on the grant date.
Exercise Price
(c) . The term of each Stock Option shall be fixed by the Administrator, but no Stock Option shall be exercisable more than ten years after the date the Stock Option is granted. In the case of an Incentive Stock Option that is granted to a Ten Percent Owner, the term of such Stock Option shall be no more than five years from the date of grant.
Option Term
(d) . Stock Options shall become exercisable at such time or times, whether or not in installments, as shall be determined by the Administrator at or after the grant date. The Administrator may at any time accelerate the exercisability of all or any portion of any Stock Option. An optionee shall have the rights of a stockholder only as to shares acquired upon the exercise of a Stock Option and not as to unexercised Stock Options.
Exercisability; Rights of a Stockholder
(e) . Stock Options may be exercised in whole or in part, by giving written notice of exercise to the Company, specifying the number of shares to be purchased. Payment of the purchase price may be made by one or more of the following methods to the extent provided in the Option Award agreement:
Method of Exercise
(i) In cash, by certified or bank check or other instrument acceptable to the Administrator;
(ii) Through the delivery (or attestation to the ownership) of shares of Stock that have been purchased by the optionee on the open market or that are beneficially owned by the optionee and are not then subject to restrictions under any Company plan. Such surrendered shares shall be valued at Fair Market Value on the exercise date. To the extent required to avoid variable accounting treatment under FAS 123R or other applicable accounting rules, such surrendered shares shall have been owned by the optionee for at least six months; or
(iii) By the optionee delivering to the Company a properly executed exercise notice together with irrevocable instructions to a broker to promptly deliver to the Company cash or a check payable and acceptable to the Company for the purchase price; provided that in the event the optionee chooses to pay the purchase price as so provided, the optionee and the broker shall comply with such procedures and enter into such agreements of indemnity and other agreements as the Administrator shall prescribe as a condition of such payment procedure.
Payment instruments will be received subject to collection. The transfer to the optionee on the records of the Company or of the transfer agent of the shares of Stock to be purchased pursuant to the exercise of a Stock Option will be contingent upon receipt from the optionee (or a purchaser acting in his stead in accordance with the provisions of the Stock Option) by the Company of the full purchase price for such shares and the fulfillment of any other requirements contained in the Option Award agreement or applicable provisions of laws (including the
 
satisfaction of any withholding taxes that the Company is obligated to withhold with respect to the optionee). In the event an optionee chooses to pay the purchase price by previously-owned shares of Stock through the attestation method, the number of shares of Stock transferred to the optionee upon the exercise of the Stock Option shall be net of the number of shares attested to.
(f) . To the extent required for "incentive stock option" treatment under Section 422 of the Code, the aggregate Fair Market Value (determined as of the time of grant) of the shares of Stock with respect to which Incentive Stock Options granted under this Plan and any other plan of the Company or its parent and subsidiary corporations become exercisable for the first time by an optionee during any calendar year shall not exceed $100,000. To the extent that any Stock Option exceeds this limit, it shall constitute a Non-Qualified Stock Option.
Annual Limit on Incentive Stock Options
SECTION 6.
STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS
(a) . A Stock Appreciation Right is an Award entitling the recipient to receive shares of Stock having a value equal to the excess of the Fair Market Value of the Stock on the date of exercise over the exercise price of the Stock Appreciation Right, which price shall not be less than 100 percent of the Fair Market Value of the Stock on the date of grant (or more than the option exercise price per share, if the Stock Appreciation Right was granted in tandem with a Stock Option) multiplied by the number of shares of Stock with respect to which the Stock Appreciation Right shall have been exercised.
Nature of Stock Appreciation Rights
(b) . Stock Appreciation Rights may be granted by the Administrator in tandem with, or independently of, any Stock Option granted pursuant to Section 5 of the Plan. In the case of a Stock Appreciation Right granted in tandem with a Non-Qualified Stock Option, such Stock Appreciation Right may be granted either at or after the time of the grant of such Option. In the case of a Stock Appreciation Right granted in tandem with an Incentive Stock Option, such Stock Appreciation Right may be granted only at the time of the grant of the Option.
Grant and Exercise of Stock Appreciation Rights
A Stock Appreciation Right or applicable portion thereof granted in tandem with a Stock Option shall terminate and no longer be exercisable upon the termination or exercise of the related Option.
(c) . Stock Appreciation Rights shall be subject to such terms and conditions as shall be determined from time to time by the Administrator, subject to the following:
Terms and Conditions of Stock Appreciation Rights
(i) The exercise price of a Stock Appreciation Right shall not be less than Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on the date of grant.
(ii) Stock Appreciation Rights granted in tandem with Options shall be exercisable at such time or times and to the extent that the related Stock Options shall be exercisable.
(iii) Upon exercise of a Stock Appreciation Right, the applicable portion of any related Option shall be surrendered.
(iv) No Stock Appreciation Right shall be exercisable more than ten years after the date the Stock Appreciation Right is granted.
SECTION 7.
RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS
(a) . A Restricted Stock Award is an Award entitling the recipient to acquire, at such purchase price (which may be zero) as determined by the Administrator, shares of Stock subject to such restrictions and conditions as the Administrator may determine at the time of grant ("Restricted Stock"). Conditions may be based on continuing employment (or other service relationship) and/or achievement of pre-established performance goals and objectives. The grant of a Restricted Stock Award is contingent on the grantee executing the Restricted Stock Award agreement. The terms and conditions of each such agreement shall be determined by the Administrator, and such terms and conditions may differ among individual Awards and grantees.
Nature of Restricted Stock Awards
(b) . Upon execution of a written instrument setting forth the Restricted Stock Award and payment of any applicable purchase price, a grantee shall have the rights of a stockholder with respect to the voting of the Restricted Stock, subject to such conditions contained in the written instrument evidencing the Restricted Stock Award.
Rights as a Stockholder
Unless the Administrator shall otherwise determine, (i) uncertificated Restricted Stock shall be accompanied by a notation on the records of the Company or the transfer agent to the effect that they are subject to forfeiture until
 
such Restricted Stock are vested as provided in Section 7(d) below, and (ii) certificated Restricted Stock shall remain in the possession of the Company until such Restricted Stock is vested as provided in Section 7(d) below, and the grantee shall be required, as a condition of the grant, to deliver to the Company such instruments of transfer as the Administrator may prescribe.
(c) . Restricted Stock may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise encumbered or disposed of except as specifically provided herein or in the Restricted Stock Award agreement. Except as may otherwise be provided by the Administrator either in the Award agreement or, subject to Section 15 below, in writing after the Award agreement is issued, if any, if a grantee's employment (or other service relationship) with the Company and its Subsidiaries terminates for any reason, any Restricted Stock that has not vested at the time of termination shall automatically and without any requirement of notice to such grantee from or other action by or on behalf of, the Company be deemed to have been reacquired by the Company at its original purchase price from such grantee or such grantee's legal representative simultaneously with such termination of employment (or other service relationship), and thereafter shall cease to represent any ownership of the Company by the grantee or rights of the grantee as a stockholder. Following such deemed reacquisition of unvested Restricted Stock that are represented by physical certificates, a grantee shall surrender such certificates to the Company upon request without consideration.
Restrictions
(d) . The Administrator at the time of grant shall specify the date or dates and/or the attainment of pre-established performance goals, objectives and other conditions on which the non-transferability of the Restricted Stock and the Company's right of repurchase or forfeiture shall lapse. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any such Restricted Stock shall have a performance-based goal, the restriction period with respect to such shares shall not be less than one year, and in the event any such Restricted Stock shall have a time-based restriction, the total restriction period with respect to such shares shall not be less than three years; provided, however, that Restricted Stock with a time-based restriction may become vested incrementally over such three-year period. Subsequent to such date or dates and/or the attainment of such pre-established performance goals, objectives and other conditions, the shares on which all restrictions have lapsed shall no longer be Restricted Stock and shall be deemed "vested." Except as may otherwise be provided by the Administrator either in the Award agreement or, subject to Section 15 below, in writing after the Award agreement is issued, a grantee's rights in any shares of Restricted Stock that have not vested shall automatically terminate upon the grantee's termination of employment (or other service relationship) with the Company and its Subsidiaries and such shares shall be subject to the provisions of Section 7(c) above.
Vesting of Restricted Stock
(e) . A grantee shall have the right to receive dividends paid with respect to his shares of Restricted Stock; provided, however, if the vesting of the Restricted Stock Award is subject to the attainment of performance goals, any dividends paid by the Company with respect to the Restricted Stock Award prior to the attainment of such performance goals shall accrue and shall not be paid to the grantee until and only to the extent the performance goals are attained and the Restricted Stock Award is earned.
Dividends
SECTION 8.
DEFERRED STOCK AWARDS
(a) . A Deferred Stock Award is an Award of phantom stock units to a grantee, subject to restrictions and conditions as the Administrator may determine at the time of grant. Conditions may be based on continuing employment (or other service relationship) and/or achievement of pre-established performance goals and objectives. The grant of a Deferred Stock Award is contingent on the grantee executing the Deferred Stock Award agreement. The terms and conditions of each such agreement shall be determined by the Administrator, and such terms and conditions may differ among individual Awards and grantees. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any such Deferred Stock Award shall have a performance-based goal, the restriction period with respect to such award shall not be less than one year, and in the event any such Deferred Stock Award shall have a time-based restriction, the total restriction period with respect to such award shall not be less than three years; provided, however, that any Deferred Stock Award with a time-based restriction may become vested incrementally over such three-year period. The minimum restriction period requirements of the preceding sentence shall not apply to Deferred Stock Awards granted to Non-Employee Directors or consultants. At the end of the deferral period, the Deferred Stock Award, to the extent vested, shall be paid to the grantee in the form of shares of Stock.
Nature of Deferred Stock Awards
(b) . The Administrator may, in its sole discretion, permit a grantee to elect to receive a portion of future cash compensation otherwise due to such grantee in the form of a Deferred Stock Award. Any such election shall be made in writing and shall be delivered to the
Election to Receive Deferred Stock Awards in Lieu of Compensation
 
Company no later than the date specified by the Administrator and in accordance with Section 409A and such other rules and procedures established by the Administrator. The Administrator shall have the sole right to determine whether and under what circumstances to permit such elections and to impose such limitations and other terms and conditions thereon as the Administrator deems appropriate. Any such deferred compensation shall be converted to a fixed number of phantom stock units based on the Fair Market Value of Stock on the date the compensation would otherwise have been paid to the grantee but for the deferral.
(c) . During the deferral period, a grantee shall have no rights as a stockholder; provided, however, that the grantee may be credited with dividend equivalent rights with respect to the phantom stock units underlying his Deferred Stock Award, subject to such terms and conditions as the Administrator may determine. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the vesting of the Deferred Stock Award is subject to the attainment of performance goals, any Dividend Equivalent Rights accrued with respect to the Deferred Stock Award prior to the attainment of such performance goals shall not be paid to the grantee until and only to the extent the performance goals are attained and the Deferred Stock Award is earned.
Rights as a Stockholder
(d) . Except as may otherwise be provided by the Administrator either in the Award agreement or, subject to Section 15 below, in writing after the Award agreement is issued, a grantee's right in all Deferred Stock Awards that have not vested shall automatically terminate upon the grantee's termination of employment (or cessation of service relationship) with the Company and its Subsidiaries for any reason.
Termination
SECTION 9.
UNRESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS
. The Administrator may, in its sole discretion, grant (or sell at par value or such higher purchase price determined by the Administrator) an Unrestricted Stock Award to any grantee pursuant to which such grantee may receive shares of Stock free of any restrictions ("Unrestricted Stock") under the Plan. Unrestricted Stock Awards may be granted in respect of past services or other valid consideration, or in lieu of cash compensation due to such grantee.
Grant or Sale of Unrestricted Stock
SECTION 10.
PERFORMANCE-BASED AWARDS TO COVERED EMPLOYEES
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if any Restricted Stock Award or Deferred Stock Award granted to a Covered Employee is intended to qualify as "Performance-based Compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder (a "Performance-based Award"), such Award shall comply with the provisions set forth below:
(a) . The performance criteria ("Performance Criteria") used in performance goals governing Performance-based Awards granted to Covered Employees may include any or all of the following objectives, described as such objectives relate to Company-wide objectives or of the subsidiary, division, department or function with the Company or subsidiary in which the Covered Employee is employed: (i) market value; (ii) book value; (iii) earnings per share; (iv) market share; (v) operating profit; (vi) net income; (vii) cash flow; (viii) return on capital; (ix) return on assets; (x) return on equity; (xi) margins; (xii) total shareholder return; (xiii) sales or product volume growth; (xiv) productivity improvement; (xv) costs or expenses; (xvi) net debt reduction; (xvii) earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization; (xviii) unit volume; (xix) net sales; (xx) balance sheet measurements; (xxi) selling, general and administrative expense; (xxii) revenue or (xxiii) any other objective value-based performance measure. Performance Criteria may be measured in absolute terms or as compared to the results of a peer group or index.
Performance Criteria
(b) . With respect to each Performance-based Award granted to a Covered Employee, the Committee shall select, within the first 90 days of a Performance Cycle (or, if shorter, within the maximum period allowed under Section 162(m) of the Code) the Performance Criteria for such grant, and the achievement targets with respect to each performance criterion (including a threshold level of performance below which no amount will become payable with respect to such Award). Each Performance-based Award will specify the amount payable, or the formula for determining the amount payable, upon achievement of the various applicable performance targets. The Performance Criteria established by the Committee may be (but need not be) different for each Performance Cycle and different goals may be applicable to Performance-based Awards to different Covered Employees.
Grant of Performance-based Awards
(c) . Following the completion of a Performance Cycle, the Committee shall meet to review and certify in writing whether, and to what extent, the Performance Criteria for the Performance Cycle have been achieved and, if so, to also calculate and certify in writing the amount of the

(c) . Nothing contained in this Plan shall prevent the Board from adopting other or additional compensation arrangements, including trusts, and such arrangements may be either generally applicable or applicable only in specific cases. The adoption of this Plan and the grant of Awards do not confer upon any employee any right to continued employment with the Company or any Subsidiary.
Other Compensation Arrangements; No Employment Rights
(d) . Option exercises and other Awards under the Plan shall be subject to such Company's insider trading policy and procedures, as in effect from time to time.
Trading Policy Restrictions

The information in this Item 2.02 and Exhibit 99.1 attached hereto shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, except to the extent as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.
(d) Exhibits
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
SAN DIEGO  (May 3, 2012)  AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. (NYSE: AHS), the nation's innovator in healthcare workforce solutions, today announced its financial results for the first quarter of 2012, reflecting continued growth in revenue and profitability. Financial highlights are as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
"AMN Healthcare continues to differentiate itself in the marketplace as the innovator in healthcare workforce solutions. We experienced continued momentum adding new MSP clients as well as growing our traditional client business," said Susan R. Salka, President and Chief Executive Officer of AMN Healthcare. "The efficiency inherent in our MSP operations model, with strong fill-rates and productivity by our sales and operations team, continues to provide improvements in operating leverage."
"With a solid and improving demand environment, we are keenly focused on our recruitment strategies to enable us to continue delivering superior service to our clients. This focus on growing our quality clinician candidates will also position us well for the significantly stronger demand market conditions expected in the next two to three years," added Salka.
First Quarter 2012 Results
For the first quarter of 2012, consolidated revenue was $226 million, an increase of 2% sequentially and 5% from the same quarter last year. First quarter revenue for the Nurse and Allied Healthcare Staffing segment was $154 million, up 4% sequentially and 14% from the same quarter last year. The increase was due to increased clinicians on assignment and increased bill rates. The Locum Tenens Staffing segment generated revenue in the first quarter of $64 million, a decrease of 2% sequentially and 10% from the same quarter last year. First quarter Physician Permanent Placement Services segment revenue was $9 million, a decrease of 4% sequentially and 17% from the same quarter last year. Excluding the impact of the prior year adoption of a new revenue recognition accounting standard, revenues for this segment increased 4% year-over-year.
Gross margin in the first quarter of 27.9%, at the upper end of the Company's expectations, was lower by 40 basis points compared to the previous quarter and 120 basis points from the same quarter last year. The year-over-year decrease was due primarily to the prior year benefits from an actuarial-based workers compensation reserve adjustment and the adoption of a new revenue recognition accounting standard. Excluding these items, the yearover-year gross margin was higher by 30 basis points due to improved gross margins in both physician segments.
 
SG&A expenses for the first quarter of 2012 were $47 million, representing 20.8% as a percent of revenue, compared to 22.1% in the prior quarter and 22.6% in the same quarter last year. The decrease compared to the same quarter last year was due primarily to the absence of integration-related expenses associated with the Medfinders acquisition, the resulting improved SG&A leverage from the acquisition synergies, and a refund received in connection with the settlement of a prior period assessment from the California Employment Development Department. Compared to the prior quarter, the decrease was due to continued operating leverage improvement and the favorable settlement, offset partly by higher professional liability costs.
First quarter 2012 GAAP net income per diluted common share was $0.09. Excluding the $0.02 discontinued operations impact from the divested home healthcare business, earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.07.
As of March 31, 2012, cash and cash equivalents totaled $5 million and total debt outstanding, net of discount, was $193 million. First quarter 2012 cash flow from operations was $10 million and capital expenditures were $1.0 million.
On April 5, 2012, the Company replaced its existing credit facilities with a new $250 million credit agreement. The new credit agreement consists of a $200 million secured term loan and $50 million secured revolving line of credit, maturing in April 2018 and April 2017, respectively. The term loan will initially bear interest at LIBOR plus 475 basis points, with a 1.25% LIBOR floor, and the revolving line of credit will initially bear interest at LIBOR plus 425 basis points. Both facilities have interest rate step downs based on the Company's financial leverage. Approximately $5.9 million of transaction related costs were capitalized and will be amortized over the term of the new agreement. In addition, $8.6 million of non-cash deferred financing costs and original issue discount and a $1.2 million pre-payment penalty associated with the previous credit facilities will be charged to interest expense in the second quarter.
 
Business Trends and Outlook
Second quarter consolidated revenues are expected to be between $229 million and $233 million, with sequential growth anticipated across all business segments. Gross margin is expected to remain steady between 27.5% and 28.0%. SG&A expenses are anticipated to be approximately 21.5% to 22.0% of revenues. Adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be approximately 7.0%.

SAN DIEGO  (August 2, 2012)  AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. (NYSE: AHS), healthcare's innovator in workforce solutions and staffing services, today announced second quarter 2012 financial results which exceeded the Company's guidance. Second quarter financial highlights are as follows:

"AMN Healthcare continues to further differentiate itself with clients through our innovative healthcare workforce solutions and staffing services which help providers cost effectively achieve excellence in patient care. Our clients are seeing the value in these services, as we continue to win and implement new managed services programs and other workforce solutions contracts," said Susan R. Salka, President and Chief Executive Officer of AMN Healthcare.
"In the second quarter, we experienced solid performance with revenues and gross margins up sequentially across all business segments as a result of the improved demand environment and solid everyday execution by our sales and operations team. With the impact of healthcare reform and the aging population, severe healthcare workforce shortages are expected to materialize over the next few years resulting in more significant demand for recruitment and staffing services. To meet our clients' needs and deliver continued industry-leading performance, we are increasing our investment in our strategic workforce solutions and new candidate recruitment initiatives," added Salka.
Second Quarter 2012 Results
For the second quarter of 2012, the Company generated consolidated revenue of $236 million, an increase of 7% from the same quarter last year and 4% sequentially. Second quarter revenue for the Nurse and Allied Healthcare Staffing segment was $159 million, up 13% from the same quarter last year and 3% sequentially. The Locum Tenens Staffing segment generated revenue in the second quarter of $68 million, a decrease of 5% from the same quarter last year and an increase of 6% sequentially. Second quarter Physician Permanent Placement Services
 
segment revenue was $10 million, an increase of 1% from the same quarter last year and 6% sequentially. Excluding the impact of the prior year adoption of a new revenue recognition accounting standard, revenue for this segment increased 10% year-over-year.
Gross margin in the second quarter of 28.4% was higher by 110 basis points from the same quarter last year and 50 basis points compared to the previous quarter. The increase in gross margin was due primarily to higher bill to pay spreads in the Locum Tenens Staffing and Nurse and Allied Healthcare Staffing segments.
SG&A expenses for the second quarter of 2012 were $50 million, representing 21.3% of revenue compared to 21.8% of revenue in the same quarter last year and 20.8% of revenue in the prior quarter. The decrease compared to the same quarter last year was due primarily to the absence of integration-related expenses associated with the Medfinders acquisition and improved SG&A leverage, offset by increased spending in support of revenue growth and candidate recruitment and workforce solutions initiatives. The increase compared with the prior quarter was due primarily to a refund received in the prior quarter from the California Employment Development Department.
In the second quarter, the Company refinanced its debt and charged to interest expense $8.6 million of non-cash deferred costs associated with the previous credit facilities and a $1.2 million pre-payment penalty.
Second quarter 2012 GAAP net income per diluted common share from continuing operations was $0.00. Excluding the one-time costs associated with the debt refinancing, adjusted earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations was $0.11.
As of June 30, 2012, cash and cash equivalents totaled $15 million and total debt outstanding, net of discount, was $194 million. Second quarter 2012 cash flow from operations was $21 million and capital expenditures were $1 million. The Company made $4 million in voluntary debt prepayments during second quarter 2012, and made an additional $20 million in voluntary debt prepayments thus far during the third quarter.
 
Business Trends and Outlook
The Company expects third quarter consolidated revenue to be between $236 million and $240 million, representing year-over-year revenue growth of 3% to 5%. Gross margin is expected to be approximately 28.0% to 28.5%. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue is expected to remain consistent with second quarter of 2012 including approximately $1 million of expenses related to strategic initiatives to expand our future candidate supply and new workforce solutions. Adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be approximately 7.5%.

Third Quarter 2012 Results
For the third quarter of 2012, the Company generated consolidated revenue of $244 million, an increase of 7% from the same quarter last year and 3% sequentially.

Gross margin in the third quarter of 28.5% was higher by 70 basis points than the same quarter last year and 10 basis points compared to the previous quarter.

The improvement from the prior year was due primarily to improved SG&A leverage offset by increased spending in support of our revenue growth, and candidate recruitment and workforce solutions strategic initiatives.

Exhibit 99.1
 
SAN DIEGO  (February 21, 2013)  AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. (NYSE: AHS), healthcare's innovator in workforce solutions and staffing services, today announced fourth quarter 2012 financial results which exceeded the Company's guidance for both revenue and adjusted EBITDA. Fourth quarter and full year financial highlights are as follows:
Dollars in millions, except per share amounts.*
 
 
 
 
 
 
"AMN Healthcare made tremendous strides in executing on our long-term strategy during 2012. The investments we made to develop successful, innovative workforce solutions, coupled with the strong execution by our teams, have created significant differentiation and value for our clients," said Susan R. Salka, President and Chief Executive Officer of AMN Healthcare. "We expect 2013 to be another year of steady growth, improved profitability and solid cash flows. Further growth in MSP and other workforce solutions is expected and we will continue to be at the forefront of innovating and delivering quality, economically beneficial solutions and staffing services to our clients as they navigate through the transformational trends in healthcare."

Full year consolidated revenue was $954 million, an increase of 7% from prior year. Nurse and Allied Healthcare Staffing segment revenue was $654 million, a year-over-year increase of 15%. The Travel Nurse business contributed the greatest growth with a 22% revenue increase over prior year. Locum Tenens Staffing segment revenue was $261 million, a year-over-year decrease of 6%. Physician Permanent Placement Services segment revenue was flat with prior year at $39 million, and up 9% without the impact of deferred revenue accounting changes implemented in 2011.
Full year gross margin was 28.3% as compared to 28.1% for prior year. The year-over-year improvement was due primarily to an increase in the Locum Tenens Staffing segment gross margin of 210 basis points.
 
Full year SG&A expenses were $203 million, representing 21.3% of revenue as compared to 22.0% for the prior year. The improvement was due primarily to improved SG&A leverage and the absence of integration-related expenses, partially offset by increased spending in support of revenue growth and strategic initiatives to enhance candidate recruitment, workforce solutions, and technology infrastructure.
Full year adjusted EBITDA grew 15% to $74 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 7.7% represented a 50 basis point increase over prior year and was driven by improvement in gross margin and operating leverage. Full year net income from continuing operations was $16 million. Full year net income per diluted common share from continuing operations was $0.35. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the full year was $0.47.
As of December 31, 2012, cash and cash equivalents totaled $6 million. Full year cash flow from operations was $61 million, which enabled debt payments of $50 million throughout the year. The Company ended the year with total debt outstanding, net of discount, of $158 million, with a leverage ratio of 2.4 to 1. Capital expenditures during the year were $5 million.

Fourth quarter gross margin of 28.5% was higher by 20 basis points than the same quarter last year and flat sequentially. The increase was due primarily to the gross margin improvement in the Locum Tenens Staffing segment over prior year.
SG&A expenses for the fourth quarter were $53 million, representing 21.4% of revenue, compared to 22.1% of revenue in the same quarter last year and 21.5% of revenue in the prior quarter. The improvement from the prior year was due to improved operating leverage.
 
Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA grew 22% year-over-year to $19 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 7.8% represented a 70 basis point increase over prior year and was driven by improvement in gross margin and operating leverage. Fourth quarter net income from continuing operations was $7 million. Fourth quarter net income per diluted common share from continuing operations and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.15.
Fourth quarter cash flow from operations was $18 million and capital expenditures were $2 million. The Company made $12 million of voluntary debt prepayments during the fourth quarter.

On February 28, 2013, AMN Healthcare Services, Inc.

The effectiveness of the First Amendment is subject to certain customary closing conditions. To avoid having to make a prepayment premium payment under the Credit Agreement, we do not expect the First Amendment to become effective prior to April 6, 2013. If the closing conditions are not satisfied by April 10, 2013, the First Amendment shall be of no further force and effect.

Among other things, the First Amendment amends the Credit Agreement as follows:

The foregoing description of the First Amendment is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual amendment, which the Company intends to file with its quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ending March 31, 2013. Unless the context otherwise indicates, capitalized terms used in this Item 1.01 without definition have the meanings given to them in the First Amendment.
The Lenders and the Administrative Agent and their affiliates have provided, and may in the future provide, various investment banking, commercial banking and other financial services for us for which services they have received, and may in the future receive, customary fees.
This Current Report on Form 8-K contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), that are subject to safe harbors under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act.

Our expectations about what will occur may differ materially from those discussed in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements.

SAN DIEGO  (May 2, 2013)  AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. (NYSE: AHS), healthcare's innovator in workforce solutions and staffing services, today announced first quarter 2013 financial results which exceeded the Company's guidance for both revenue and adjusted EBITDA. Financial highlights are as follows:
Dollars in millions, except per share amounts.*
 
 
 
 
 
 
"AMN's first quarter performance, with year-over-year revenue growth and improved operating leverage across all business segments, was driven by the team's strong execution and solid market demand trends," said Susan R. Salka, President and Chief Executive Officer of AMN Healthcare. "As our clients continue to navigate through the transformational trends in healthcare, our clear position as the leader in delivering innovative workforce solutions is enabling AMN to be a more strategic partner. Our pipeline of MSP opportunities remains strong, and we anticipate continued MSP penetration across the nursing, allied and locum tenens staffing markets."
First Quarter 2013 Results
First quarter 2013 consolidated revenue was $252 million, an increase of 11% from the same quarter last year and 2% sequentially. First quarter revenue for the Nurse and Allied Healthcare Staffing segment was $177 million, up 15% from the same quarter last year and 1% sequentially. Locum Tenens Staffing segment revenue in the first quarter was $65 million, an increase of 3% from the same quarter last year and 4% sequentially. First quarter Physician Permanent Placement Services segment revenue was $10 million, an increase of 10% from the same quarter last year and a decrease of 2% sequentially.
First quarter gross margin of 29.0% was higher by 110 basis points than the same quarter last year and 50 basis points sequentially. The increase over the prior year was due primarily to a favorable workers' compensation reserve adjustment in the Nurse and Allied Healthcare Staffing segment and a gross margin improvement in the Locum Tenens Staffing segment. The sequential increase was driven by the favorable workers' compensation reserve adjustment.
SG&A expenses for the first quarter were $54 million, representing 21.3% of revenue, compared to 20.8% of revenue in the same quarter last year and 21.4% of revenue in the prior quarter. The increase from the prior year was due primarily to higher spending in support of revenue growth and a prior year $2 million refund received in connection with the settlement of an assessment with the California Employment Development Department partially offset by improved operating leverage.
 
First quarter adjusted EBITDA grew 21% year-over-year to $21 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 8.4% represented a 70 basis point increase over the prior year and was driven by improvements in gross margin and operating leverage. First quarter net income was $8 million. First quarter net income per diluted common share was $0.16.
As of March 31, 2013, cash and cash equivalents totaled $2 million and total term debt outstanding, net of discount, was $158 million, with a leverage ratio of 2.3 to 1. First quarter 2013 cash used in operations was $3 million, driven by an increase in working capital from higher days sales outstanding. Capital expenditures were $2 million.
The Company's amendment to its credit agreement went into effect on April 9, 2013, reducing the interest rate on the revolving line of credit and term loan.
Business Trends and Outlook
The Company expects second quarter consolidated revenue to be between $251 million and $255 million, representing year-over-year revenue growth of 6% to 8%. Gross margin is expected to be approximately 28.5%. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue are expected to be approximately 21.0% to 21.5%. Adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be approximately 7.5% to 8.0%.
