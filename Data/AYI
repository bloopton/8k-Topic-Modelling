(NYSE: AYI) announced today thatsales for its fourth quarter ended August 31, 2002 were $515.3  million,  up twopercent  from sales of $505.6  million  reported for the same period a year ago.Excluding  the results of  American  Electric,  which was  acquired in the firstquarter of 2002,  net sales in the fourth  quarter were down  approximately  onepercent  compared  to last  year's  results.  Record  quarterly  sales at AcuitySpecialty Products were offset by reduced sales in the Acuity Lighting Group dueto lower  volumes  and  continued  pricing  pressure in certain  commercial  andindustrial lighting markets caused by the continued weak economic environment.Net  income  for the  fourth  quarter  was $15.4  million,  or $0.37 per  share,compared  to $6.4  million,  or  $0.16  per  share,  reported  last  year.  Thisrepresents  an  increase  of  approximately  140  percent for net income and 130percent for earnings per share.  The fourth  quarter  included a pre-tax gain of$3.1 million on the sale of assets  while last year's  fourth  quarter  included$4.1  million in  restructuring  and asset  impairment  charges,  a $3.1 millioncharge  for the  termination  of a  purchase  obligation,  and $3.0  million  ofamortization  expense that has been discontinued.  Excluding the impact of theseitems,  earnings  per share would have been $0.32 in the fourth  quarter of 2002and $0.34 in the fourth quarter of 2001. The lost  contribution  margin on lowersales (noted above) and continued higher expenses for certain  non-discretionarycosts were offset by the benefits  obtained from  continued  aggressive  expensecontrol and profit improvement programs implemented throughout the company.Fourth Quarter Segment and Corporate OverviewNet sales in the fourth  quarter  for the  Acuity  Lighting  Group  were  $382.0million,  up approximately two percent compared to last year's fourth quarter aswell as to the 2002 third quarter.  Excluding the sales  contributed by AmericanElectric,  the Acuity Lighting Group's sales were down approximately two percentwhen  compared  to the  fourth  quarter  of 2001.  The  decline in net sales wasprimarily the result of lower  shipments to certain  commercial  and  industrialmarkets  and reduced  selling  prices for  certain  key  products  due to severecompetition for available orders caused by weakened demand.  Operating profit atthe Acuity  Lighting Group was $19.3 million,  down 24 percent  compared to lastyear's $25.3  million.  The decline in  operating  profit was  primarily  due toproduct mix changes,  lower selling prices for certain  products,  and increasesfor certain non-discretionary items. This decline was partially offset by profitimprovement initiatives and cost containment programs implemented throughout thecompany. Additionally, the adoption of a new accounting standard that eliminatedamortization for certain goodwill and intangibles contributed approximately $2.5million to lighting's fourth quarter operating profit.Net sales in the  fourth  quarter  for Acuity  Specialty  Products  were  $133.3million,   up  approximately  two  percent  compared  to  the  prior  year,  andrepresented record quarterly sales for Acuity Specialty Products,  excluding theimpact of certain divested operations from historical  periods.  The increase insales was  primarily  due to continued  strength in the retail  sector and, to alesser extent,  in certain niche markets.  Acuity Specialty  Products also set arecord with  fourth  quarter  operating  profit of $15.9  million,  a 52 percentincrease over last year's $10.4 million.  This increase was primarily due to theprofit  contribution  on  higher  volumes,  the  impact  of  profit  improvementprograms,  and the  elimination  of $0.5  million  of  amortization,  which werepartially offset by increased expenses for certain  non-discretionary  items andinvestments  made to enhance the company's  sales force  capabilities in certainstrategic markets.Corporate  expenses  were $4.3  million,  down $2.6 million from last year.  Thedecline was due primarily to cost containment programs and the reorganization ofthe corporate  staff.  Net interest  expense of $9.8 million was below the prioryear's $11.2 million largely due to lower interest rates and debt outstanding.Fiscal 2002 ResultsIn 2002, Acuity Brands generated net sales of approximately $2.0 billion,  whichwere  essentially  flat with the prior year's sales.  Excluding the results fromthe divestiture of certain Acuity Specialty  Products foreign operations and theacquisition of American Electric, net sales declined approximately three percentcompared  to 2001.  This  decline  was  primarily  due to lower net sales at theAcuity  Lighting  Group  caused by weakened  customer  demand and intense  pricecompetition  for  available  orders,  partially  offset by the solid second halfresults posted by Acuity Specialty Products.Net  income  for 2002 was $52.0  million,  or $1.26  per  share,  up 28  percentcompared to $40.5 million,  or $0.99 per share, in 2001.  Excluding $3.2 millionin gains on property sales and $0.9 million in restructuring  reversals,  fiscal2002  earnings  per share would have been $1.20  compared to last year's  $1.63,excluding  a $15.3  million  loss from  divested  operations,  $4.1  million  ofrestructuring  and asset  impairment  charges,  a $3.1  million  charge from thetermination  of  a  purchase  obligation,  and  $12.0  million  in  discontinuedamortization  expenses.  In 2002,  the company's  effective tax rate declined to37.2 percent from 41.4 percent  reported the prior year. The decline in the ratewas  primarily  the result of the legal entity  restructuring  that  occurred inconnection with the spin-off  transaction and the elimination of amortization ofgoodwill.OutlookJames S.  Balloun,  Chairman,  President and Chief  Executive  Officer of AcuityBrands,  said, "Our first year as a stand-alone publicly traded company was verychallenging.  During the year, events such as  well-publicized  lapses in propercorporate governance,  sensational business bankruptcies, large layoffs, and thetragedy on September  11,  2001,  all took their toll on an economy that had notexperienced  a  downturn  in over a decade.  For our  company,  this  created aneconomic   environment   characterized   by  weakened  demand  in  key  markets,particularly  non-residential  construction;  rising costs for raw materials andother  non-discretionary  expenses;  and intense  price  competition  in certainmarkets for available  orders.  We responded  and adapted to these  changing andvolatile market conditions by reducing costs, boosting productivity,  and bettermanaging  our  investments  to  produce  solid  earnings  and cash  flow for ourshareholders.   We  were  able  to   accomplish   this   without   damaging  ourorganizational development or stopping investments toward our future. I am proudof the  manner  in which  our  12,000  employees  performed  under  very  tryingcircumstances and that we delivered  earnings within the range of $1.10 to $1.30per share, which we projected in December 2001."In the fourth  quarter as well as the entire  fiscal year, we continued to makeprogress toward our goal of building a more competitive  company that can bettermeet the challenges of an uncertain economic  environment and that is capable ofdelivering more consistent earnings and cash flow in the future. Our initiativesthroughout the year included programs that helped us better manage discretionaryspending, lower product costs, enhance manufacturing efficiencies, and penetratechannels  of   distribution   and  customer   bases  that  allowed  for  greaterdiversification  of our end markets and made us less dependent on the commercialconstruction  market.  I am pleased that we turned in a record quarter at AcuitySpecialty Products. Additionally, I continue to be particularly pleased with ourintense focus on delivering an improved  balance sheet through  better  managingour investment in working capital. In fact, this effort has allowed us to reduceour outstanding  debt to $543 million as of August 31, 2002 from $643 million atNovember  30, 2001,  the  effective  date of the spin-off of Acuity  Brands as aseparate, publicly traded company."Balloun  continued,  "As we conclude  2002 and look  forward to 2003,  we remainconfident in the  long-term  potential of our company as a whole as well as eachof our  businesses.  However,  at this  time we fail to see any real  signs of ameaningful  recovery or sustainable  improvement in the business climate for ourkey markets,  particularly in North America.  While some economists predict thatthe economy will improve late in our fiscal 2003,  we are  preparing for anotheryear of very difficult conditions. Therefore, our focus remains on improving theproducts and services we provide to our customers,  becoming more productive andefficient,  and enhancing our profitability while diversifying and expanding themany end markets and  customers  we serve.  Assuming  that  economic  conditionsoverall,  and more  specifically in our key markets,  do not deteriorate  beyondtheir already  weakened state, we forecast our 2003 earnings to be between $1.20and $1.40 per share.  The low end of this range is based on the current economicenvironment and is essentially flat with our 2002 earnings per share,  excludinggains on asset sales and restructuring  reversals  previously noted.  Should theeconomy  begin to improve in the second  half of our fiscal  2003,  however,  wecould potentially deliver earnings per share at the high end of the range. Salesare expected to increase modestly in 2003, based on current market conditions."Dividend DeclarationOn October 2, 2002, the board of directors of Acuity Brands declared a quarterlydividend of 15 cents per share.

(NYSE:  AYI) announced todaythat sales for its first  quarter  ended  November 30, 2002 were $505.2  millioncompared to $481.7 million reported in the year ago period, an increase of $23.5million,  or 4.9 percent.  Sales increased 5.1 percent and 4.2 percent at AcuityLighting Group (ALG) and Acuity  Specialty  Products Group (ASP),  respectively.The  current  quarter  included  the full period  results of  American  ElectricLighting  (AEL),  which was acquired in October  2001.  Net income for the firstquarter of fiscal 2003 was $10.5 million, or $0.25 per share,  compared to $11.5million, or $0.28 per share,  reported in the first quarter of fiscal 2002. Thisrepresents a decrease in net income and earnings  per share of  approximately  9percent and 11 percent,  respectively. The decline in net income compared to theyear ago period was  primarily  due to higher  costs for certain raw  materials,greater expenses for  non-discretionary  items,  and increased  spending for newproduct  introductions  and expanded  marketing and logistics  initiatives.  Theimpact of these higher costs was  partially  offset by the  contribution  marginearned  from  the  higher  sales  volume  noted  above,   benefits  from  profitimprovement initiatives, and cost containment programs. While these consolidatedresults were consistent with management's expectations, the Company continued toexperience very difficult market  conditions,  including weak customer demand inthe   non-residential   construction   market  and  rising  raw   material   andnon-discretionary costs.First Quarter Segment and Corporate OverviewSales at Acuity  Lighting  Group in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 were $382.7million compared to $364.1 million reported in the year ago period,  an increaseof $18.5 million, or 5.1 percent. The increase in sales at ALG was primarily dueto greater  shipments  of  products  through  channels of  distribution  servingnational accounts,  utilities,  and other key commercial and industrial markets;improved service capabilities;  and available backlog. Sales at ALG in the firstquarter of fiscal 2003  compared to the year ago period were  benefited  by $6.7million due to the  inclusion of the full quarter  results of American  ElectricLighting,  which was acquired in October 2001.  Excluding the impact of AEL, netsales at Acuity  Lighting  Group  increased  3.3 percent in the first quarter offiscal  2003  compared  to the year ago period.  While  sales  increased  in thecurrent  quarter,  incoming  orders  remained soft reflecting the continued weakeconomic environment, particularly in the non-residential construction industry.Order rates,  excluding AEL, for the first quarter were  approximately 4 percentbelow order rates from the year ago  period.  The decline in order rates  duringthe quarter,  coupled with process improvement initiatives to reduce order cycletimes and  shorten  lead  times to  customers,  resulted  in a lower  backlog atNovember 30, 2002. The backlog at ALG decreased $25.6 million,  or 17.7 percent,to $119.1  million at  November  30, 2002 from August 31,  2002.  Excluding  theimpact  of AEL,  the  backlog  declined  5.6  percent  in the year  ago  period.Operating  profit for  Acuity  Lighting  Group  improved  $1.0  million to $26.1million in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 from $25.1  million  reported in theprior year.  Operating profit margins dropped  nominally to 6.8 percent from 6.9percent, as the variable  contribution margin from the higher sales volume notedabove was offset by continued  pricing pressure and product mix changes,  higherraw  material  costs,  and  non-discretionary  spending  for  expenses  such  asinsurance.Sales at Acuity  Specialty  Products  Group in the first  quarter of fiscal 2003were $122.6  million,  an increase of 4.2 percent  over the same period one yearearlier.  The increase in sales was driven by greater product penetration in keychannels  of  distribution   including  home  improvement  centers  and  certainindustrial  market  segments,  including  food  processing and  preparation  andvehicle  wash.  Operating  profit at ASP for the first  quarter  of fiscal  2003declined $3.2 million to $3.7 million from $6.9 million reported in the year agoperiod.  Operating margins declined to 3.0 percent from 5.9 percent. The declinein operating  profit was primarily due to startup costs associated with a numberof initiatives,  including new product  introductions and expanded marketing andlogistics  programs,  all of which are expected to benefit  future  periods.  Inaddition,  ASP  incurred  higher  costs for  certain raw  materials  and certainnon-discretionary  spending,  such as insurance,  which were partially offset byincreased  selling  prices and the greater  contribution  margin from the highersales volume noted above.Corporate  expenses  were $3.5  million  in the  first  quarter  of fiscal  2003compared to $2.7 million in the year ago period.  The increase was due primarilyto increased  expense  associated  with certain  stock-based  benefit  plans andgreater  non-discretionary  costs such as  insurance.  Interest  expense of $9.8million in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 was lower than  interest  expense of$10.4  million  reported in the year ago period due to a reduction  in both debtbalances and interest rates.OutlookJames S. Balloun,  Chairman,  President,  and Chief Executive  Officer of AcuityBrands,  said,  "Our first quarter  results,  which modestly  exceeded  internalexpectations,  reflected our ability to adapt to the difficult  conditions  thatcontinue  to  prevail  in  certain  key  markets,  particularly  non-residentialconstruction.  I am pleased that we were able to  partially  offset the negativeimpact of these conditions by aggressively taking actions to make our businessesstronger,  particularly at Acuity Lighting Group.  Our results were benefited bynumerous  initiatives  to  reduce  costs,  improve  customer  service,   enhanceproductivity,  and further  expand our product  offerings  and brands  through avariety of channels.  Overall,  these efforts allowed us to essentially maintaingross profit  margins  while  experiencing  significant  cost  increases for rawmaterials and non-discretionary  spending for insurance,  as well as to fund keyinitiatives at both companies  including  certain sales and marketing  programs.Also,  during the  quarter,  we were able to  generate  sufficient  cash flow tomaintain our debt balance while paying our  quarterly  dividend and investing inour businesses."I am pleased with our continued progress in making each business a stronger andmore competitive  organization in spite of prevailing market  conditions,  whichhave made it  difficult  to produce  more  favorable  results.  We  continue  toinnovate,  to find ways to more effectively serve our customers,  and to improveour margins.  We are doing this through better management of pricing,  includingprice increases which have been previously announced by our businesses;  greatersales to an expanding customer base; and enhanced  productivity.  We continue topursue  more  profitable  growth by  focusing  on and  better  serving  our bestcustomers and introducing  innovative and more effective  products.  While theseefforts are not without  short-term costs, we anticipate that these initiatives,in  addition  to  our  relentless  focus  on  cost  reduction  and  productivityenhancements,  will allow us to create  greater  value for our customers and ourshareholders."We remain optimistic about the long-term potential of the solid businesses thatcomprise Acuity Brands. However, we are cautious about our near-term results dueto uncertainty in the economic  environment,  particularly  for  non-residentialconstruction, which is one of the key drivers of the lighting fixture market andwhere incoming  orders for Acuity  Lighting Group declined year over year in thefirst  quarter of fiscal  2003.  We  anticipate  that the second  quarter of ourfiscal  year,  which is  historically  the  Company's  weakest,  will be an evengreater challenge due to the current economic  situation.  We continue to expectour full year earnings to be in the range of $1.20 to $1.40 per share,  assuminga  modest  rebound  in the  economy  in the  second  half of our  fiscal  2003."Conference Call and Board NewsAs  previously  announced,  the Company will host a  conference  call to discussfirst quarter results on December 18, 2002 at 4:00 p.m. EST.

(NYSE: AYI) announced today thatsales for its  second  quarter  ended  February  28,  2003 were  $489.4  millioncompared to $468.2 million reported in the year ago period, an increase of $21.2million, or 4.5 percent.  The sales percentage increase occurred equally at bothAcuity  Lighting  Group (ALG) and Acuity  Specialty  Products  Group (ASP).  Netincome for the  second  quarter of fiscal  2003 was $7.7  million,  or $0.19 pershare,  compared to $10.6  million,  or $0.26 per share,  reported in the secondquarter  of fiscal  2002.  This  represents  a  decrease  in both net income andearnings per share of approximately 27 percent.  The Company continued to reducedebt,  ending the quarter with total debt of $519.6 million,  down $24.2 millionfrom November 30, 2002.  These  consolidated  results were generally  consistentwith management's expectations.The  decline in net income  compared to the year ago period was largely due to aplanned  decrease  in  production   volume  resulting  in  lower  absorption  ofmanufacturing  costs,  primarily at ALG.  This resulted in the  acceleration  ofapproximately  $2.9 million of greater  expense in the second  quarter of fiscal2003.  Also  contributing  to the decline in net income  were  higher  costs forcertain  raw  materials,  greater  expenses  for  non-discretionary  items,  andincreased  spending for new product  introductions  and expanded  marketing  andlogistics initiatives.  The impact of these higher costs was partially offset bythe  contribution  margin  earned  from the higher  sales  volume  noted  above,benefits from profit improvement initiatives, and cost containment programs.The Company  continued  to have  significant  success at  reducing  its level ofworking  capital,   particularly   inventory,   through  improved  manufacturingefficiency and  productivity,  while  supporting  its sales growth  initiatives.These  improvements  in  manufacturing  capabilities  are expected to allow moreeffective  utilization  of inventory  assets.  While the temporary  reduction inproduct  output had a negative  impact on the  earnings  reported  in the secondquarter as noted above,  the decline in inventory  contributed to the generationof positive free cash flow that was used to pay down debt.Second Quarter Segment and Corporate OverviewSales at Acuity  Lighting Group in the second quarter of fiscal 2003 were $368.8million compared to $352.8 million reported in the year ago period,  an increaseof $16.0 million, or 4.5 percent. The increase in sales at ALG was primarily dueto greater  shipments  of  products  through  channels of  distribution  servingnational  accounts,  home  improvement  centers,  and other key  commercial  andindustrial  markets.  In the second quarter ALG announced a sales price increasefor certain products. The terms and conditions of the price increase resulted ina significant  influx of orders in the second  quarter with delivery  dates thatextend into the third quarter of fiscal 2003. As a  consequence,  the backlog atALG increased  $45.0 million,  or 37.8 percent,  to $164.1 million from November30, 2002 and 6.6 percent over the year ago period.  Operating  profit for AcuityLighting Group  decreased $3.2 million to $18.8 million in the second quarter offiscal 2003 from $22.0  million  reported in the prior  year.  Operating  profitmargins  dropped to 5.1 percent from 6.2 percent,  as the variable  contributionmargin from the higher sales volume was more than offset by the lost  absorptionof  manufacturing  costs as noted above;  continued  pricing pressure in certainmarkets and product mix changes;  higher raw material costs,  particularly steeland fuel costs; and greater spending for certain sales and marketing initiativesand for non-discretionary expenses such as insurance.Sales at Acuity  Specialty  Products  Group in the second quarter of fiscal 2003were $120.6  million,  an increase of 4.5 percent  over the same period one yearearlier.  The increase in sales was driven by greater product penetration in keychannels  of  distribution   including  home  improvement  centers  and  certainindustrial market segments,  such as food processing and preparation and vehiclewash.  Operating  profit at ASP for the second  quarter of fiscal 2003  declined$3.6 million to $4.8 million from $8.4 million  reported in the year ago period.Operating  margins  declined  to 4.0 percent  from 7.3  percent a year ago.  Thedecline in operating profit was primarily due to startup costs associated with anumber  of  initiatives,   including  new  product  introductions  and  expandedmarketing and logistics  programs,  all of which are expected to benefit  futureperiods.  In addition,  ASP incurred  higher costs for certain raw materials andcertain non-discretionary spending, including medical and other insurances. Thiswas partially  offset by increased  selling prices and the greater  contributionmargin from the higher sales volume noted above.Corporate  expenses  were $4.2  million  in the second  quarter  of fiscal  2003compared to $3.2 million in the year ago period.  The increase was due primarilyto higher expense associated with certain stock-based  benefit plans,  liabilityinsurance,  and expanded audit services. Net interest expense of $9.5 million inthe second  quarter of fiscal 2003 was lower than net interest  expense of $10.2million reported in the year ago period due to a reduction in both debt balancesand interest rates.Net sales for the first half of fiscal  2003  increased  $44.7  million,  or 4.7percent,  to $994.6  million  compared  to $949.9  million  reported in the sameperiod a year ago.  Net income for the first six  months was $18.2  million,  or$0.44 per share, compared to last year's first half net income of $22.1 million,or $0.54 per share. Net income and earnings per share were down approximately 18percent in the first half of fiscal 2003 compared to the year ago period.OutlookJames S. Balloun,  Chairman,  President,  and Chief Executive  Officer of AcuityBrands,  said,  "During the second  quarter we continued  to implement  programsaimed at making our  businesses  stronger  and more  financially  viable,  whileconfronting  the  difficult  conditions  that continue to prevail in certain keymarkets, particularly non-residential construction.  For example, we implementedsales price  increases on many products  throughout the Company,  reflecting thestrength of our value  propositions and the need to generate  acceptable marginsto fund future  innovations  and to continue to build greater  customer  servicecapabilities.  In addition, the benefits of continued investments to improve ourmanufacturing  capabilities  allowed us to significantly reduce inventory duringthe  quarter,  particularly  at ALG,  while  meeting the needs of our  expandingcustomer   base.   These   programs  will  continue  to  improve  our  financialperformance,  including better margins,  higher returns on invested capital, andlower debt. These initiatives and actions are not without a short-term cost. Forexample, we reduced the levels of inventory by lowering our production output inthe second  quarter,  while  supporting  a 4.5 percent  increase in sales.  Thisresulted in less absorption of manufacturing  costs, leading to the accelerationof greater  expense and reduced gross profits during the quarter.  However,  thebenefits  are  twofold:  we are becoming  more  efficient  in our  manufacturingcapabilities,  thus reducing  future costs,  and we now need less  investment inworking capital to support our businesses. As a consequence,  we were again ableto significantly reduce outstanding debt in the quarter because of lower workingcapital requirements.  As of February 28, 2003, our outstanding debt balance was$519.6  million,  a  reduction  of $24.2  million  since  November  30, 2002 andapproximately  $124 million over the last five  quarters.  We have achieved thiswhile paying  approximately  $6 million in quarterly  dividends and investing inour businesses."Overall,  the results for the second  quarter  were  generally in line with ourinternal  expectations.  We are pleased  with our  ability to  generate  revenuegrowth under these difficult economic  conditions.  We have been able to do thisby expanding our customer base and extending our market leading brands into morechannels  of  distribution.  However,  we are not as pleased  with our  earningsperformance.  Earnings  continue to be impacted  by  numerous  controllable  anduncontrollable  factors.  Uncontrollable  factors  included  pricing  pressures,rising raw material costs (including steel and petroleum-based  components), andnon-discretionary  spending  for  insurance,  all of which  continue to persist.Controllable   factors   included  costs  associated  with  lowering  levels  ofinventory,  as  previously  mentioned,  and  investments  in sales and marketinginitiatives  at both  businesses  designed to strengthen  our  capabilities.  Wecontinue  to make  these  investments  because of high  expectations  for futurebenefit and the knowledge that past investments  have had a significant  benefiton current  performance  by  partially  offsetting  the  impact of the  negativefactors noted above. Overall,  while the net impact of these factors resulted inlower  operating  margins in the quarter when compared with the year ago period,these  investments are positioning the Company for a higher level of performancethan we had in the past."We remain confident about the long-term  potential of the solid businesses thatcomprise Acuity Brands. However, we are cautious about our near-term results dueto uncertainties in the economic  environment,  particularly for non-residentialconstruction, which is one of the key drivers of the lighting fixture market. Weanticipate  that the  results  for the third  quarter  of fiscal  year 2003 willreflect the  historical  seasonal  pattern of greater  sales,  the benefits of astrong backlog at ALG, and the positive impact of various initiatives to enhancemargins,  including  previously  mentioned price increases.  Assuming no furtherdeterioration in the economy and the benefit of the previously  mentioned items,we  continue  to expect  our full year  earnings  to be in the range of $1.20 to$1.40 per share."Conference Call and Board NewsAs  previously  announced,  the Company will host a  conference  call to discusssecond quarter  results on March 25, 2003 at 4:00 p.m. EST.

 Acuity Brands, Inc. (NYSE: AYI) announced today that net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2003 was $15.3 million, or $0.37 per share, compared to $14.6 million, or $0.35 per share, reported in the third quarter of fiscal 2002. This represents an increase in net income and earnings per share of 5.2 percent and 5.7 percent, respectively. The consolidated earnings results were generally consistent with management's expectations. Also, the Company continued to reduce debt at a pace exceeding previous expectations, ending the quarter with total debt of $494.4 million, down $25.2 million from February 28, 2003.
ATLANTA, June 24, 2003
 
Net sales for the third quarter ended May 31, 2003 were $521.0 million compared to $507.6 million reported in the year-ago period, an increase of $13.5 million, or 2.7 percent. The growth in sales occurred primarily at Acuity Lighting Group (ALG) due largely to greater shipments through certain channels of distribution,
higher sales in Europe, and the impact of previously announced price increases. Overall, consolidated gross profit margins advanced to 42.0 percent of sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2003, from 41.1 percent reported in the year-ago period, due primarily to the higher sales noted above and the impact of profit improvement programs that helped offset the cost of higher raw materials, rising medical costs, and expenses associated with the consolidation of certain manufacturing facilities at ALG. Consolidated operating expenses increased to 35.7 percent of sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2003, compared to 34.6 percent reported in the year-ago period, due primarily to higher sales and marketing initiatives, legal and logistics costs, and increased corporate expenses associated with stock-based benefit programs. Consolidated operating profit of $32.7 million was essentially flat in the third quarter compared to the year-ago period as the improvement in gross profit was offset by higher operating expenses. The increase in net income compared to the year-ago period was due primarily to a lower effective income tax rate and lower interest expense associated with the decline in outstanding borrowings throughout the current period.
 
Third Quarter Segment and Corporate Overview
 
Sales at Acuity Lighting Group in the third quarter of fiscal 2003 were $389.2 million compared to $376.0 million reported in the year-ago period, an increase of $13.3 million, or 3.5 percent. The increase in sales at ALG was due primarily to greater shipments of products through channels of distribution serving national
 
accounts and home improvement centers, growth in the European operations, and the impact of price increases for certain products. This was partially offset by lower shipments to certain other key commercial and industrial markets due primarily to the continued economic weakness that prevailed throughout the current period. As expected, the backlog at ALG decreased approximately $31.0 million, or 18.9 percent, from February 28, 2003 to $133.0 million at May 31, 2003. The decline was due primarily to the impact of a significant volume of second quarter orders, placed in advance of a previously announced price increase, that were shipped during the third quarter. Operating profit at ALG increased $1.9 million to $25.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2003 from $23.2 million reported in the prior year. Operating profit margins at ALG improved to 6.4 percent of sales from 6.2 percent reported in the year-ago period. The increase in operating profit was due primarily to the contribution margin from the higher sales noted above and continuous improvement programs, including sourcing initiatives to lower product costs, and significant improvements in the operations at the facility in Matamoros, Mexico. This was partially offset by costs associated with the consolidation of certain manufacturing facilities, higher raw material costs, greater spending for sales and marketing initiatives associated with new product introductions and penetration of the home improvement channel, higher logistics costs, and additional legal costs associated with pending litigation.
 
Sales at Acuity Specialty Products Group (ASP) in the third quarter of fiscal 2003 were $131.8 million, a nominal increase of $0.2 million over the same period one
 
year earlier. Sales were essentially flat at ASP as greater shipments to mass merchandisers and home improvement centers and higher sales in Europe and Canada were offset by softness in the core industrial and institutional channel attributable to weak economic conditions. Operating profit at ASP for the third quarter of fiscal 2003 declined $1.3 million to $12.5 million from $13.8 million reported in the year-ago period. Operating margins declined to 9.5 percent from 10.5 percent a year ago. The decline in operating profit was due primarily to startup costs associated with a number of initiatives, including new product introductions, spending to further penetrate the mass merchandise channel, and expanded marketing and logistics programs, all of which are expected to benefit future periods. In addition, ASP continued to incur higher costs for certain raw materials, partially offset by the benefits of sourcing initiatives.
 
Corporate expenses were $4.9 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2003 compared to $4.2 million in the year-ago period. The increase was due primarily to higher expense associated with certain stock-based benefit programs, liability insurance, and expanded audit services. Net interest expense in the third quarter of fiscal 2003 declined to $9.2 million from $10.3 million reported in the year-ago period due to a reduction in both debt balances and interest rates.
 
Year-To-Date Results
 
Net sales for the nine months ended May 31, 2003 increased $58.1 million, or 4.0 percent, to $1,515.7 million compared to $1,457.5 million reported in the same period a year ago. Year-to-date net income was $33.5 million, or $0.81 per
 
share, compared to last year's net income of $36.7 million, or $0.89 pro forma earnings per share. Net income and earnings per share were down 8.6 percent and 9.0 percent, respectively, in the first three quarters of fiscal 2003 compared to the year-ago period.
 
Outlook
 
James S. Balloun, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Acuity Brands, said, "I am pleased to report that in the third quarter we delivered solid financial results while making substantial progress in further implementing strategies and expanding programs aimed at making our businesses stronger and more financially successful. We accomplished this while confronting difficult conditions that continued to prevail in certain key markets, particularly non-residential construction, as well as additional economic softness exacerbated by the conflict in Iraq. For example, we were able to grow sales at Acuity Lighting Group by 3.5 percent when most indicators showed that our primary markets had either declined or were flat during the period. We accomplished this market penetration by collaborating more closely with our strongest partners in each channel and capitalizing on new and innovative lighting fixtures such as Lithonia Lighting's AERIS, Holophane's ILLUMINAIRE, and the HOT-5 family of products. In addition, we realized benefits from sales price increases initiated on many products throughout the Company. Further, I am pleased to report that our gross profit margins improved in the third quarter to 42.0 percent from 41.1 percent in the year-ago period reflecting the strength of our value propositions,
 
benefits of price increases, and our continued effort to build a more globally competitive supply chain capability. Our goal continues to be to generate more acceptable margins to fund future innovations and to build greater customer service capabilities while providing enhanced returns for our shareholders. We advanced our margins while absorbing the cost of ongoing initiatives to consolidate the North American manufacturing base of ALG to more cost-effective facilities within our supply chain network, as well as absorbing the rising costs of raw materials and employee benefits. In addition, continued investments to improve our manufacturing capabilities allowed us to maintain reduced inventory levels during the quarter, particularly at ALG, while meeting the needs of our expanding customer base. We expect these programs to lead to enhanced financial performance, including better margins, higher returns on invested capital, and lower debt. As of May 31, 2003, our outstanding debt balance was $494.4 million, a reduction of $25.2 million since February 28, 2003 and approximately $149.2 million over the last six quarters. We have achieved this while continuing to pay approximately $6 million in quarterly dividends and investing in our businesses. We expect to continue to reduce debt in the fourth quarter, though most likely at a slower pace.
 
"While past initiatives to enhance our global competitiveness are driving improvements in gross margins, we are still not pleased with our earnings performance. Earnings continue to be impacted by numerous controllable and uncontrollable factors particularly in operating expenses. Uncontrollable factors included pricing pressures from certain competitors, rising raw material costs
 
(including steel and petroleum-based components), and non-discretionary spending for insurance, all of which continue to persist. Controllable factors included costs associated with improving the effectiveness of our global supply chain, new product introductions, and investments in sales and marketing initiatives, such as the Genesis project designed to strengthen the Zep sales force. The investments in these areas are designed to strengthen our capabilities for the future.
 
"We remain confident about the long-term potential of the solid businesses that comprise Acuity Brands and the actions we continue to implement to make our Company more profitable. However, we remain cautious about our near-term results due to uncertainties in the economic environment, particularly for non-residential construction, which is one of the key drivers of the lighting fixture market. We do not expect any meaningful rebound in our key markets in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 as many had predicted earlier in the year. As a consequence, we now expect our full year earnings to be at the low end of the range of our previous forecast of $1.20 to $1.40 per share, which was provided at the beginning of fiscal 2003. This forecast includes our current estimate of legal fees necessary to litigate the previously disclosed patent infringement dispute."

EXHIBIT 99.1 COMPANY CONTACT: KAREN HOLCOM ACUITY BRANDS, INC. (404) 853-1437 ACUITY BRANDS SETTLES OUTSTANDING PATENT LITIGATION ATLANTA, AUGUST 29, 2003 - Acuity Brands, Inc. (NYSE: AYI) announced today that it has settled the patent infringement suit brought against it by Genlyte Thomas Group, LLC (GTG) in March 2000 in the United States District Court, Western District of Kentucky. In the suit, previously disclosed by Acuity Brands, GTG claimed that a Lithonia Lighting(R) recessed downlighting product introduced in 1994 infringed a GTG patent. The Court had previously found that the product did infringe the patent but had not yet ruled whether the patent was invalid based on the contention of Acuity Brands that the claimed invention was obvious. The settlement agreement requires that Acuity Brands discontinue sales of the current version of the product by December 31, 2003, refrain from directly or indirectly challenging the validity of GTG's patent, and pay $8 million to GTG. Acuity Brands will record the $8 million pre-tax settlement expense (or $0.12 per share after-tax) in its fiscal quarter ending August 31, 2003. John K. Morgan, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of Acuity Brands, said, "By settling this matter, we are able to avoid the uncertainties, expense, and distractions associated with a jury trial involving a matter in which GTG alleged damages in excess of $20 million and sought treble damages. We are pleased to put this matter behind us and be able to keep our focus on serving our customers. Although we will be discontinuing sales of the product as currently designed, we will begin manufacturing an alternative design late this fall so that it will be available by January 1, 2004. We expect no disruptions of service to customers. "We believe strongly in the protection of patented inventions, and our businesses make every reasonable effort to avoid violation of the intellectual property rights of others, including their patents. Our vigorous defense of this matter should in no way be interpreted as disregard for intellectual property. Similarly, product innovation is an important part of our business strategy and we intend to enforce our own intellectual property rights." Vernon J. Nagel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Acuity Brands, said, "In June, we stated that we expected full year earnings of Acuity Brands to be at the low end of the range of the previous forecast of $1.20 to $1.40 per share. While that expectation included an estimated accrual for this matter, the settlement expense is higher than the previously anticipated costs of this suit and will result in an additional after-tax charge of $0.12 per share. We expect to report 2003 fourth quarter earnings on or about October 2, 2003, and we are not providing an updated forecast at this time." Acuity Brands, Inc., with fiscal year 2002 sales of approximately $2.0 billion, is comprised of Acuity Lighting Group and Acuity Specialty Products Group. Acuity Lighting Group is the world's leading lighting fixture manufacturer and includes brands such as Lithonia Lighting(R), Holophane(R), Peerless(R), Hydrel(R), and American Electric Lighting(R).

Consequently, actual results 4
may differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements. Statements made herein that may be considered forward-looking include statements concerning: (a) the Company's results of operations; (b) expectations regarding the timing of manufacturing a new product with an alternative design and the lack of impact of this change on customer service; and (c) future enforcement of our intellectual property rights. A variety of risks and uncertainties could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the Company's forward-looking statements. The risks and uncertainties include without limitation the following: (a) the uncertainty of general business and economic conditions; (b) unexpected developments and outcomes in the Company's legal and environmental proceedings; and (c) unanticipated delays in the development and manufacture of a new product with an alternative design.

(NYSE: AYI) announced today thatnet income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 was $14.3 million, or $0.34 pershare,  compared to $15.4 million,  or $0.37 per share,  reported for the fourthquarter of fiscal  2002.  Included in net income and  earnings per share for thefourth quarter of fiscal 2003 were $8.0 million of pre-tax expense (or $0.12 pershare) related to the previously announced settlement of the litigation with theGenlyte Thomas Group LLC ("Genlyte") and  approximately  $2.7 million of pre-taxexpense (or $0.04 per share) related to environmental  matters  discussed below.The  settlement  with Genlyte was paid in August 2003. In addition,  the Companycontinued to reduce debt at a pace exceeding previous  expectations,  ending thequarter with total debt of $445.8 million,  down $48.6 million from May 31, 2003and $97.3 million from August 31, 2002.Net sales for the fourth  quarter  ended  August 31,  2003 were  $533.7  millioncompared to $515.3 million reported in the year-ago period, an increase of $18.4million,  or 3.6 percent.  The growth in net sales occurred  primarily at AcuityLighting Group (ALG) due largely to increased shipments through certain channelsof distribution and the impact of previously announced price increases. Overall,consolidated  gross profit margins  advanced to 43.2 percent of net sales in thefourth  quarter of fiscal  2003,  from 40.5  percent  reported  in the  year-agoperiod,  due  primarily  to the higher net sales  noted  above and the impact ofprofit improvement  programs that helped offset the cost of higher raw materialsand  expenses  associated  with  the  consolidation  of  certain   manufacturingfacilities at ALG. Consolidated  operating expenses increased to 37.2 percent ofnet  sales in the  fourth  quarter  of fiscal  2003,  compared  to 34.5  percentreported in the year-ago period,  due primarily to the settlement of the Genlytelitigation,  charges  related  to  environmental  matters  at  Acuity  SpecialtyProducts  Group  discussed  below,  higher  expenses  for  sales  and  marketinginitiatives, higher logistics costs, and increased corporate expenses associatedprimarily with stock-based  benefit programs.  Consolidated  operating profit of$31.9  million  was $1.1  million  higher in the fourth  quarter of fiscal  2003compared to the  year-ago  period as the  improvement  in gross profit more thanoffset the higher operating  expenses.  Excluding the Genlyte settlement and theenvironmental  matters,  the 38  percent  increase  in net  income in the fourthquarter of fiscal 2003 compared to the year-ago  period was due primarily to thecontribution  margin from the higher net sales noted  above,  a lower  effectiveincome tax rate,  and lower  interest  expense  associated  with the  decline inoutstanding borrowings throughout the current period.Fourth Quarter Segment and Corporate OverviewNet sales at Acuity  Lighting  Group in the fourth  quarter of fiscal  2003 were$398.1 million compared to $382.0 million  reported in the year-ago  period,  anincrease of $16.1 million, or 4.2 percent.  The increase in net sales at ALG wasdue primarily to greater  shipments of products through channels of distributionserving national  accounts and home improvement  centers and the impact of priceincreases for certain products.  This was partially offset by lower shipments tocertain  other key  commercial  and  industrial  markets  due  primarily  to thecontinued economic weakness that prevailed  throughout the quarter.  The backlogat ALG increased  $3.4 million to $136.1  million at August 31, 2003 from $132.7million at May 31, 2003 and decreased $8.6 million, or 5.9 percent,  from August31, 2002. Operating profit at ALG increased $7.5 million to $26.8 million in thefourth  quarter of fiscal  2003 from $19.3  million  reported in the prior year.Operating  profit  margins at ALG  improved to 6.7 percent of net sales from 5.0percent  reported in the year-ago  period.  The increase in operating profit wasdue primarily to the  contribution  margin from the higher net sales noted aboveand continuous  improvement  programs,  including sourcing  initiatives to lowerproduct costs, and significant improvements in the operations at the facility inMatamoros,  Mexico.  This was partially offset by an $8.0 million charge for thesettlement of the Genlyte litigation, costs associated with the consolidation ofcertain  manufacturing  facilities,  higher raw material costs, greater spendingfor sales and marketing  initiatives  associated with new product  introductionsand further  penetration of the home improvement  channel,  and higher logisticscosts.Net sales at Acuity  Specialty  Products  Group  (ASP) in the fourth  quarter offiscal 2003 were $135.6  million,  an  increase  of $2.3  million  over the sameperiod one year earlier. Net sales increased at ASP as greater shipments to massmerchandisers  and home  improvement  centers and higher net sales in Europe andCanada  were   partially   offset  by  softness  in  the  core   industrial  andinstitutional channel attributable to weak economic conditions. Operating profitat ASP for the fourth  quarter of fiscal  2003  declined  $5.6  million to $10.3million from $15.9  million  reported in the year-ago  period,  while  operatingmargins  declined to 7.6 percent  from 11.9  percent a year ago.  The decline inoperating  profit was due  primarily  to the  charges  related to  environmentalmatters  discussed  below and a $1.9  million  charge to reflect the fair marketvalue of certain inventories. In addition,  profitability at ASP was impacted byrising costs for certain raw materials,  partially offset by various initiativesto reduce expenses.Corporate  expenses  were $5.3  million  in the fourth  quarter  of fiscal  2003compared to $4.3 million in the year-ago period.  The increase was due primarilyto  higher  expense  associated  with  certain   stock-based  benefit  programs,liability  insurance,  and expanded audit services.  Net interest expense in thefourth  quarter  of fiscal  2003  declined  to $8.9  million  from $9.8  millionreported in the year-ago period due to a reduction in outstanding debt balances.Fiscal 2003 Full Year  ResultsIn 2003, Acuity Brands increased net sales by $76.5 million,  or 3.9 percent, to$2,049.3  million  compared to  $1,972.8  million  reported  for the prior year.Fiscal 2003 net income was $47.8 million,  or $1.15 per share,  compared to lastyear's  net  income of $52.0  million,  or $1.26 pro forma  earnings  per share.Included in net income and  earnings  per share in fiscal 2003 were $8.0 millionof  pre-tax  expense  (or $0.12 per  share) for the  settlement  of the  Genlytelitigation  and  approximately  $2.7  million of pre-tax  expense  (or $0.04 pershare) for the  environmental  matters  noted below.  In  addition,  the Companyincurred  approximately  $2.0  million  in legal  costs  over the past two yearsassociated with the Genlyte litigation. The Genlyte settlement and substantiallyall legal  fees were  paid by August  31,  2003.  As of  August  31,  2003,  theoutstanding  debt balance was $445.8 million,  a reduction of $97.3 million fromthe end of fiscal  2002.  Stockholders'  equity at August  31,  2003 was  $408.3million,  an increase of $6.3 million from August 31, 2002. The increase in 2003was  primarily  the result of net income  partially  offset by  dividends  and atax-effected  adjustment  of $22.5  million  related  to the  Company's  pensionobligations.  Debt to total capitalization declined to 52.2 percent as of August31, 2003 from 57.5  percent at the end of fiscal 2002.Legal  MattersIn August  2003,  ASP  received a grand  jury  subpoena  from the United  StatesAttorney for the Northern District of Georgia  concerning the operation of ASP'swastewater  pretreatment  plant and ASP's  management  of  hazardous  waste at afacility in Atlanta,  Georgia. The grand jury investigation appears to relate tothe discharge of wastewater from the facility to the City of Atlanta's  sanitarysewer  system  and  ASP's  practices  in  connection  with the  sampling  of thefacility's  wastewater  discharges for permitting  purposes.  ASP is cooperatingwith the  investigation by the U.S.  Attorney's  Office and is in the process ofcollecting the required  documents.  The U.S.  Attorney's  Office  investigationfollows  an inquiry  by the City of  Atlanta,  which  regulates  the  wastewaterdischarge at the facility.  The Company has tentatively  settled the matter withthe City of Atlanta. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company recordedan  aggregate  charge of  approximately  $2.7  million  to cover  various  costsincluding  off-site  disposal,  the  estimated  costs  of  resolution  of  theseproceedings  with the City of Atlanta and the U.S.  Attorney's  Office,  and theestimated  legal  expenses to be incurred by the Company in these  matters.  Theproceedings with the U.S. Attorney are at a preliminary  stage, and developmentsin the  investigation  and the terms of any final  settlement or adjudication ofthese  matters  could cause the Company to record  additional  charges in futureperiods.CommentsJames S. Balloun,  Chairman,  President,  and Chief Executive  Officer of AcuityBrands,  said, "As we conclude  fiscal 2003, I am pleased to report that,  alongwith  solid  financial  results,  we  continued  to  make  substantial  progressthroughout the year in further  implementing  strategies and initiatives focusedat making our  businesses  stronger and more  successful  financially.  While weenjoyed many  accomplishments  in 2003, both financially and  operationally,  wealso resolved the Genlyte litigation, which resulted in a $0.12 per share chargeto earnings,  and addressed certain environmental matters at ASP, which resultedin a $0.04 per share charge to earnings.  Excluding the impact of those charges,our full year results would have been  essentially in the middle of the range ofour  earnings  guidance  provided at the  beginning  of the year,  while  fourthquarter  earnings  per share would have  advanced 35 percent  over the  year-agoperiod.  We accomplished  this while continuing to confront  difficult  economicconditions throughout much of the year in key markets,  including commercial andindustrial   construction,    electrical   utilities,   and   other   industrialmanufacturing  sectors.  Also in 2003,  profitability  was  impacted by numerouscontrollable and uncontrollable factors. Uncontrollable factors included pricingpressures  from certain  competitors,  rising product  related costs  (includingsteel  and  petroleum-based  components),  and  non-discretionary  spending  forvarious insurance programs.  Controllable  factors included  investments made toexpand our global  supply  chain,  to develop and  introduce  new  products,  toaccelerate  sales and  marketing  initiatives  (including  the  Genesis  projectdesigned to further  strengthen the Zep sales force),  and most importantly,  toimplement our new, robust organizational development program. The investments inthese areas, which reduced profitability in 2003, are designed to strengthen ourcapabilities  for the future.  Overall in 2003,  our business units were able tooffset  the  cost of many  of  these  initiatives  and the  negative  influencesimpacting our key markets because of profit improvement  programs implemented tobetter  manage  discretionary   spending,  to  lower  product  costs  (includingstrategic sourcing), and to enhance manufacturing efficiencies."In  addition,  we  accelerated  initiatives  to  streamline  our  manufacturingcapabilities,  improve margins through better pricing and selling effectiveness,and penetrate new markets with superior value  propositions.  These  initiativesall had a positive impact on our financial and operational  results in 2003. Forexample,  in 2003,  consolidated  net sales grew by 3.9 percent,  a  significantachievement when most indicators showed that our primary markets had declined orwere flat  during the year.  We  accomplished  this by further  penetrating  keychannels at both business units,  including home improvement centers,  which hadan added benefit of providing further  diversification and growth  opportunitiesto our  business  portfolio.  While  some  of  these  growth  initiatives  had ashort-term cost impact due to higher marketing and startup costs,  thus loweringour  profitability,  we are  confident  about the growth  potential of these andother key markets as we collaborate more closely with our strongest  partners ineach  channel  to more  effectively  serve the needs of the  ultimate  consumer.Another positive  indicator of our many profit  improvement  initiatives was ourconsolidated  gross margins,  which advanced to 41.6 percent in 2003, almost onefull point,  from the  year-ago  period,  reflecting  the  strength of our valuepropositions,  benefits  of  price  increases,  and our  effort  to build a moreglobally  competitive  supply  chain  while  absorbing  the rising  costs of rawmaterials and various  insurance  costs."As I have  mentioned in previous  press  releases,  our goal continues to be togenerate more acceptable margins and cash flow to fund future innovations and tobuild greater  customer service  capabilities  while providing higher returns toour  shareholders.  We advanced our gross profit margins while  absorbing  costsassociated with ongoing efforts to consolidate our North American  manufacturingbase  (these  efforts are  referred  to as "MNT") at ALG to more  cost-effectivefacilities  within our supply  chain  network.  We believe  that this program toconsolidate  our  manufacturing   base,  coupled  with  our  strategic  sourcinginitiative,  will have a  significant  impact on  improving  our future  servicecapabilities,  profitability,  and cash  flow.  While  the  investment  for thisprogram and others will be significant over the next 18 months, both in terms ofcapital and management focus, we have worked diligently to improve our financialposition in order to have the capacity to invest in initiatives, like MNT, whichwill provide shareholders with significant benefits in the future. Our financialposition  continued  to  strengthen  throughout  2003 in light of our ability togenerate cash flow,  primarily through our many supply chain initiatives,  whichresulted in  substantially  lower debt. As of August 31, 2003,  our  outstandingdebt balance was $445.8  million,  a reduction of $97.3 million since the end of2002 and approximately $197.8 million, or 30.7 percent, since November 30, 2001,when the Company  became an  independent  entity.  We have achieved this in 2003while  reinvesting in our  businesses and continuing to pay to our  shareholdersapproximately $6.0 million in quarterly dividends."While  the  near-term  economic  outlook  remains  somewhat  cloudy,  we remainconfident that the long-term  potential for the businesses  that comprise AcuityBrands is bright.  Our results and  accomplishments  in 2003 confirm that we aremoving in the right  direction.  We  continue  to make  substantial  progress infurther  implementing  initiatives  and expanding  programs  aimed at making ourbusinesses  stronger  and  more  successful  financially  even in this  stagnanteconomic climate. While we cannot predict the pace at which the economies of theworld will rebound,  we can continue to make our company a better investment forour  shareholders  by staying  focused and executing well on the initiatives andstrategies  in  place.  In that  respect,  we  intend  to build on the  positivemomentum  generated in 2003 as we enter 2004.  Earnings  projections  for fiscal2004 will be provided  later in October,  once the business plan for fiscal 2004has been approved by the Board of Directors."Conference Call and Board NewsAs  previously  announced,  the Company will host a  conference  call to discussfourth  quarter  and full year  results  on  October  2, 2003 at 4:00 p.m.  EDT.Interested  parties  may listen to this call live  today or hear a replay  untilOctober 23, 2003 at the Company's Web site:  www.acuitybrands.com.The Board of Directors  will hold its regular  quarterly  meeting on October 11,2003.Acuity  Brands,  Inc.,  with  fiscal year 2003 net sales of  approximately  $2.0billion,  is comprised of Acuity  Lighting Group and Acuity  Specialty  ProductsGroup.

(NYSE: AYI) announced today thatit projects  earnings per share for its fiscal year 2004 to be between $1.25 and$1.45 per share  compared  to $1.15 per share  reported  in 2003.  In 2003,  theCompany incurred charges for the settlement of certain patent litigation and forenvironmental  issues that totaled  approximately $0.16 per share. This range ofearning  estimates for fiscal 2004 is based on the current economic  environmentand assumes that the Company's key markets do not deteriorate further.  Includedin the projected  earnings per share range for fiscal 2004 for Acuity Brands areincremental  expenses  anticipated for stock-based plans, ($7.2 million pre-tax,or $0.11 per share),  primarily  for  Long-Term  Incentive  Plan  (LTIP)  awardsexpected to be granted in the second  quarter of 2004,  and for pension  expense($3.8  million  pre-tax,  or $0.06 per share),  due primarily to declines in thediscount  rates  used to  compute  the 2004  expense  and the  August  31,  2003accumulated benefit obligation.In 2004, the Company  anticipates that various profit  improvement  programs andchanges in product mix will more than offset expected higher costs for wages andemployee benefits,  insurance programs, and raw materials, all of which could besignificant,   and  the  potential   impact  of  pricing   pressures  driven  byover-capacity  and weak  customer  demand in key markets in North  America.  TheCompany expects earnings in the first half of 2004 to approximate those reportedin the same period in 2003,  given the negative  impact of the items noted aboveand current economic conditions,  while expecting improvement in the second halfof fiscal 2004 due primarily to the expected seasonal pattern and the benefit ofprofit improvement programs, some of which are just now getting underway.The proposed  LTIP awards for 2004 include a  combination  of stock  options andrestricted  stock  and  will  depend,   to  some  extent,  on  the  approval  byshareholders of additional  shares for the LTIP at the Annual Meeting  scheduledfor December 18, 2003. The awards granted under the LTIP for 2003 were primarilyrestricted  stock.  The  Company  expects  to adopt  the  prospective  method ofexpensing various  compensation  programs in accordance with FASB No. 148 in thefirst quarter of fiscal 2004.  Under the prospective  method,  the Company wouldrecognize compensation expense in fiscal 2004 for stock option awards made underthe LTIP on or after September 1, 2003 as well as for discounted purchases underits   broader-based   Employee  Stock  Purchase  Program  (ESPP).   Although  nocompensation  expense was  recognized  with respect to stock options or the ESPPprior to fiscal 2004,  expense  associated  with these  programs was  previouslydisclosed in the footnotes to the consolidated  financial  statements.  In 2004,the  Company  also  expects to  recognize  compensation  expense  related to thevesting of restricted  stock awards made in 2003 as well as the awards  expectedin 2004.In fiscal 2004,  the Company  expects to invest  between $50 and $55 million fornew plant and equipment  compared to $28.2 million  invested in fiscal 2003. Theprojected  increase  in capital  investment  is due  primarily  to  expendituresrelated  to  the   consolidation   of  certain   manufacturing   facilities  andenhancements to information technology capabilities within Acuity Lighting Groupand investments to improve  manufacturing  and waste management  capabilities atAcuity  Specialty  Products Group.  Approximately 60 percent of the consolidatedcapital  investment  program at Acuity  Brands is expected to occur in the firsthalf of fiscal 2004. As a consequence, the Company expects total indebtedness toincrease by up to 10 percent in the first half from $445.8  million  reported atthe end of 2003. Overall, the Company expects to reduce total debt by the end offiscal 2004 to approximately $400 million.James S. Balloun,  Chairman,  President,  and Chief Executive  Officer of AcuityBrands,  said  "We  remain  confident  about  the  long-term  potential  of  thebusinesses that comprise Acuity Brands and the expected impact of initiatives wecontinue to implement to make our Company better for all stakeholders.  However,we are  cautious  about our  expected  results  over the next twelve  months dueprimarily  to  uncertainties  in  the  economic  environment,  particularly  fornon-residential   construction  and  certain  industrial  markets.   While  someeconomists and forecasting  organizations continue to predict that these marketswill improve in the near-term,  we do not expect any meaningful rebound to occuruntil late in fiscal 2004 nor do we expect that this late  recovery  will have ameaningful  impact on our fiscal 2004.  As a  consequence,  we are preparing foranother  year of very  difficult  conditions.  Based on our current  view of theeconomy and demand in our key markets,  we expect net sales to improve nominallyin fiscal 2004 compared to 2003. Therefore, we expect that a substantial portionof the improvement in earnings in 2004 compared to 2003 will be due primarily tobenefits from profit improvement  initiatives aimed at creating a stronger, morecapable organization."The  focus of the  organization  will  remain on  improving  the  products  andservices  provided to customers,  becoming more  productive and  efficient,  andenhancing  profitability  while  continuing to diversify and expand the many endmarkets and  customers  served.  As part of that effort in 2003, we commenced aninitiative to improve the capabilities and cost structure of our  manufacturing,distribution,  and procurement base at Acuity Lighting Group. This multi-facetedinitiative,  which will take almost three years to complete,  will result in theconsolidation  of certain  facilities  into our most  productive  and  efficientplants, as well as expand our world-wide  sourcing  capabilities.  A significantportion of the capital  investment for this initiative will occur in 2004, whilethe expenses  associated with the consolidation for severance and relocation areexpected to be largely  offset by cost savings and asset sales from the program.While the  timing of expense  recognition  will  depend on the  actual  dates ofcertain  events  and  may  impact  our  quarterly  results  differently  than wecurrently anticipate,  we expect that the program will have a relatively neutralimpact on fiscal 2004  earnings per share.  We do expect the benefits  from thisprogram  to have a  positive  impact on  earnings  in fiscal  2005.  This is yetanother  example of  improvements  to our  businesses  that we are  making  now,without  compromising  short-term results, for the purpose of better positioningour businesses and making us stronger for the long term."Acuity  Brands,  Inc.,  with  fiscal year 2003 net sales of  approximately  $2.0billion,  is comprised of Acuity  Lighting Group and Acuity  Specialty  ProductsGroup.   Acuity  Lighting  Group  is  the  world's  leading   lighting   fixturemanufacturer  and includes  brands such as Lithonia  Lighting(R),  Holophane(R),Peerless(R),  Hydrel(R),  and American  Electric  Lighting(R).

EXHIBIT 99.1 (ACUITYBRANDS LOGO) Acuity Brands, Inc. 1170 Peachtree Street, NE Suite 2400 Atlanta, GA 30309 Tel: 404 853 1400 Fax: 404 853 1440 AcuityBrands.com COMPANY CONTACT: KAREN HOLCOM ACUITY BRANDS, INC. (404) 853-1437 ACUITY BRANDS REPORTS FISCAL YEAR 2004 FIRST QUARTER RESULTS ATLANTA, DECEMBER 18, 2003 - Acuity Brands, Inc. (NYSE: AYI) announced today that net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2004 was $12.9 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, compared to $10.5 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, reported in the year-ago period. This represents an increase in net income and diluted earnings per share of approximately 22.9 percent and 20.0 percent, respectively. In addition, total debt outstanding increased modestly to $449.8 million at November 30, 2003 from $445.8 million at August 31, 2003. Net sales for the quarter ended November 30, 2003 were $517.5 million compared to $505.2 million reported in the year-ago period, an increase of $12.3 million, or 2.4 percent. The growth in net sales, which occurred in both of the Company's segments, was due primarily to greater shipments to the home improvement and retail channels. Overall, consolidated gross profit margins advanced to 41.5 percent of net sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2004 from 41.0 percent reported in the year-ago period due primarily to improvements in pricing, the mix of products sold, and the impact of initiatives to reduce product cost, 1
partially offset by higher raw material costs and expenses associated with the consolidation of certain manufacturing facilities at Acuity Brands Lighting (ABL). Consolidated operating expenses increased slightly to 36.0 percent of net sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2004 compared to 35.8 percent of net sales in the similar period one year earlier. The increase was due primarily to higher corporate expenses more fully described below, partially offset by the impact of programs to reduce operating expenses and improve efficiencies. Consolidated operating profit of $28.6 million was $2.3 million higher in the first quarter of fiscal 2004 compared to the year-ago period due primarily to higher sales and greater gross profit margin, partially offset by the increased operating expenses. Consolidated operating profit margins were 5.5 percent of net sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2004 compared to 5.2 percent reported in the year-ago period. The 22.9 percent growth in net income in the first quarter of fiscal 2004 compared to the similar period in 2003 was due primarily to the increase in operating profit as noted above, a gain recognized on the sale of a small product line at Acuity Specialty Products (ASP), and lower interest expense due to less debt outstanding during the current period. First Quarter Segment and Corporate Overview Net sales at Acuity Brands Lighting in the first quarter of fiscal 2004 were $391.0 million compared to $382.7 million reported in the year-ago period, an increase of $8.3 million, or 2.2 percent. The increase in net sales at ABL was due primarily to greater shipments of products to the home improvement channel. While net sales increased in the current quarter, incoming orders remained soft reflecting 2
continued weak economic conditions, particularly in the commercial and industrial construction channel. This, along with process improvement initiatives to reduce order cycle times and shorten lead times to customers, resulted in a modestly lower backlog at November 30, 2003. The backlog at ABL decreased $12.8 million, or 9.4 percent, to $123.3 million at November 30, 2003 from August 31, 2003. Operating profit at Acuity Brands Lighting improved $1.8 million to $27.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2004 from $26.1 million reported in the same period in the prior year. Operating profit margins improved to 7.1 percent from 6.8 percent due primarily to a favorable product mix, better pricing, and benefits from initiatives to reduce product costs and contain expenses. Net sales at Acuity Specialty Products in the first quarter of fiscal 2004 were $126.5 million compared to $122.6 million reported in the year-ago period, an increase of $3.9 million, or 3.2 percent. The increase in net sales was due primarily to greater shipments through the retail channel and to institutional and industrial customers in key domestic and international markets. Operating profit at ASP for the first quarter of fiscal 2004 doubled to $7.4 million from $3.7 million reported in the year-ago period. Operating profit margins advanced to 5.9 percent from 3.0 percent. The improvement in operating profit and margin was due primarily to the higher sales noted above, the impact of previously announced price increases, lower product costs, and the reduction of costs associated with product introductions and logistics programs in the prior year. 3
Corporate expenses were $6.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2004 compared to $3.5 million in the year-ago period. The increase was due primarily to greater expense for company-wide restricted stock incentives and other share-price based programs, reflecting the 33 percent appreciation in the Company's share price in the current quarter. Corporate expenses also included investments to facilitate compliance with the rules promulgated under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Net interest expense decreased $1.1 million to $8.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2004 compared to $9.8 million reported in the year-ago period due to a reduction in outstanding debt, partially offset by a higher weighted-average interest rate. The Company anticipated adopting certain provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148 in the first quarter of fiscal 2004, which would have required stock options to be expensed. In light of recent public communications from the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the Company has elected to delay the recognition of expense related to stock options until the final standard is promulgated. The recognition of stock option expense was projected to reduce earnings in fiscal 2004 by approximately $0.02 per share for each quarter beginning with the second quarter. Outlook James S. Balloun, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Acuity Brands, said, "Our first quarter results, which modestly exceeded our expectations, reflected the positive impact of initiatives to improve the performance of our business units in the face of continued softness in key 4
markets, especially non-residential construction. Numerous programs to reduce costs, enhance productivity, and further expand our product offerings and brands through a variety of channels contributed to improved results. Overall, these efforts allowed us to improve our gross profit margins while experiencing cost increases for certain raw materials and employee related programs, as well as to fund key initiatives to improve our selling effectiveness and supply chain. Also, during the quarter, we were able to generate more cash flow than anticipated to essentially maintain our debt level while paying our quarterly dividend and expanding our investment in each segment. "I am pleased with our progress to make each segment a stronger and more competitive organization in spite of continued weak demand and overcapacity in key markets. We continue to find innovative ways to more effectively serve customers, introduce new products, and expand our access to new markets. These efforts and other initiatives designed to improve pricing, reduce product costs, and improve productivity are all having a positive impact on our profit margins. Our goal continues to be to generate higher margins to fund product innovations and to build greater customer service capabilities while providing enhanced returns for our shareholders. While these efforts, including programs to rationalize our manufacturing network at ABL and improve our information technology capabilities, are not without short-term costs, we anticipate that they will allow us to continue to create greater value for our customers and our shareholders. 5
"We are optimistic about the long-term potential of our Company. However, we remain cautious about our near-term results due to the continued softness in demand and uncertainties that exist in our key markets, particularly non- residential construction. While it appears that certain sectors of the economy are showing signs of renewed growth and some economists are again calling for a rebound in portions of the non-residential construction market in calendar 2004, we have yet to see or benefit from such a rebound. Therefore, we anticipate that the second quarter of our fiscal year, which is historically the weakest for the Company, will be very challenging. Further, as indicated in our most recent Form 10-K, we still expect earnings for the first half of 2004 to approximate those reported in the same period in 2003. Adjusting for the previously mentioned delay in accounting for stock option expense, we expect full year earnings for fiscal 2004 to be in the range of $1.31 to $1.51 per share. Lastly, as we have previously indicated, the Company's debt balance at the end of the second quarter may increase up to ten percent from August 31, 2003 due primarily to the timing of certain expenses and capital spending associated with the consolidation of the manufacturing network at ABL. Outstanding debt is then expected to decline by the end of fiscal 2004 to approximately $400 million." Conference Call and Board News As previously announced, the Company will host a conference call to discuss first quarter results on December 18, 2003 at 4:00 p.m. EST. Interested parties may listen to this call live today or hear a replay until January 8, 2004 at the Company's Web site: www.acuitybrands.com. 6

 Acuity Brands, Inc. (NYSE: AYI) announced today that net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2004 was $9.5 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, compared to $7.7 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, reported in the second quarter of fiscal 2003. These represent increases in net income and diluted earnings per share of 23% and 16%, respectively. In addition, the Company continued to reduce debt at a pace exceeding previous expectations, ending the quarter with total debt of $437.5 million, down $8.3 million from August 31, 2003.
ATLANTA, April 6
 
Net sales for the second quarter ended February 29, 2004 increased $1.7 million to $491.0 million compared to $489.3 million reported in the year-ago period. Net sales were essentially flat at both Acuity Brands Lighting (ABL) and Acuity Specialty Products (ASP) as gains from pricing at both units and greater shipments of lighting products to the home improvement channel were offset by
 
declines in certain other channels, primarily those serving the non-residential construction market. Overall, consolidated gross profit margins advanced to 41.0% of net sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2004, from 39.9% reported in the year-ago period, due primarily to favorable price and mix changes and the impact of profit improvement programs that helped offset the costs of higher raw materials and the consolidation of certain manufacturing facilities at ABL. Consolidated operating expenses increased slightly to 36.1% of net sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2004, compared to 35.9% reported in the year-ago period, due primarily to greater expense for company-wide restricted stock incentives. Consolidated operating profit of $24.4 million was $5.0 million, or 26%, higher than operating profit reported in the second quarter of fiscal 2003 as the improvement in gross profit more than offset higher operating expenses. Operating profit margin increased to 5.0% of net sales at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2004 from 4.0% reported in the prior-year period. Net income increased 23% compared to the year-ago period due primarily to the higher operating profit noted above and lower interest expense because of less outstanding debt, partially offset by lower gains on the sale of assets in the current quarter compared to the same period a year earlier.
 
Second Quarter Segment and Corporate Overview
 
Net sales at Acuity Brands Lighting in the second quarter of fiscal 2004 were $369.4 million compared to $368.8 million reported in the year-ago period, an increase of $0.6 million. Net sales at ABL were essentially flat as greater shipments of products through home improvement centers and the positive
 
impact of pricing initiatives were substantially offset by lower shipments to certain other key commercial and industrial markets due primarily to the continued economic weakness that prevailed throughout the current period in the non-residential construction market. The backlog at ABL increased $20.9 million, or 17%, to $144.2 million at February 29, 2004 from November 30, 2003 reflecting the normal seasonal pattern for the non-residential construction market. Operating profit at ABL increased $2.4 million, or 13%, to $21.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2004 from $18.8 million reported in the prior year. Operating profit margins at ABL improved to 5.7% of net sales from 5.1% reported in the year-ago period. The increases in operating profit and margin were due primarily to the benefits from continuous improvement programs, including sourcing and strategic pricing initiatives. These improvements were partially offset by costs associated with the consolidation of certain manufacturing facilities and higher raw material costs.
 
Net sales at Acuity Specialty Products in the second quarter of fiscal 2004 were $121.7 million, an increase of $1.1 million over the same period one year earlier. The increase in net sales was due primarily to improved pricing and higher volume in the industrial and institutional channel in both domestic and international markets, partially offset by lower retail sales and the divestiture of a small product line in November 2003. Operating profit at ASP for the second quarter of fiscal 2004 increased $4.2 million, or 88%, to $9.0 million from $4.8 million reported in the year-ago period. Operating margins improved significantly to 7.4% of net sales from 4.0% reported a year ago. The increases in operating profit and margin were due primarily to a better mix of products sold and the
 
impact of continuous improvement initiatives to enhance pricing and control costs.
 
Corporate expenses were $5.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2004 compared to $4.2 million in the year-ago period. The increase was due primarily to higher expense for company-wide restricted stock incentives resulting from a greater mix of restricted stock compared to stock options used in the year-ago period. Net interest expense in the second quarter of fiscal 2004 declined to $8.9 million from $9.5 million reported in the year-ago period due primarily to a reduction in debt balances.
 
Year-To-Date Results
 
Net sales for the six months ended February 29, 2004 increased $14.0 million to $1,008.6 million compared to $994.6 million reported in the same period a year ago. Consolidated operating profit for the first half of fiscal 2004 increased $7.3 million, or 16%, to $53.0 million compared to operating profit of $45.7 million in the prior year. Consolidated operating margins improved to 5.3% of net sales for the six months ended February 29, 2004 from 4.6% of net sales reported in the prior year. Year-to-date net income was $22.4 million, or $0.52 per diluted share, compared to last year's net income of $18.2 million, or $0.44 per diluted share. Net income and diluted earnings per share increased 23% and 18%, respectively, in the first half of fiscal 2004 compared to the year-ago period.
 
Outlook
 
James S. Balloun, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Acuity Brands, said, "I am pleased to report that in the second quarter we improved consolidated operating profit margins by 100 basis points and increased diluted earnings per share by 16% over the prior year. These strong improvements compared to the year-ago period reflect the strength of our value propositions, the benefits of margin management initiatives, and our continued effort to build a more globally competitive supply chain. We delivered these positive results while continuing to incur costs at ABL to redeploy resources within the supply chain to strengthen future performance and while confronting weak economic conditions that continued to prevail in certain key markets, particularly non-residential construction. As of February 29, 2004, our outstanding debt balance was $437.5 million, a reduction of $8.3 million since August 31, 2003 and significantly below previous estimates. We have achieved this while continuing to pay approximately $6 million in quarterly dividends and accelerating investment in key areas of our businesses. We expect to continue to reduce debt in the second half of the year and anticipate a debt balance of approximately $400 million by the end of fiscal 2004.
 
"Results for the first half of fiscal 2004 were impacted by soft demand and uncertainties that existed in the Company's key markets, particularly non-residential construction. It now appears that certain sectors of the economy are starting to show signs of renewed growth, and some economists are predicting modest growth in portions of the non-residential construction market starting in
 
the second half of calendar year 2004. While we remain cautious about the potential benefit from such a rebound in our fiscal 2004, we now expect full-year earnings to be in the middle to upper end of the range of $1.31 to $1.51 per share."
 
Conference Call
 
As previously announced, the Company will host a conference call to discuss second quarter results today, April 6, 2004, at 4:00 p.m. ET. Interested parties may listen to this call live today or hear a replay until April 27, 2004 at the Company's Web site: www.acuitybrands.com .

 Acuity Brands, Inc. (NYSE: AYI) announced today that net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2004 was $18.0 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, compared to $15.3 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, reported in the third quarter of fiscal 2003. These represent increases in net income and diluted earnings per share of 18% and 14%, respectively. In addition, the Company continued to reduce debt, ending the quarter with total debt of $429.6 million, down $16.2 million from August 31, 2003 and $7.9 million from February 29, 2004.
ATLANTA, July 6, 2004
 
Net sales for the third quarter ended May 31, 2004 increased $11.2 million, or 2%, to $532.2 million compared to $521.0 million reported in the year-ago period. Both Acuity Brands Lighting (ABL) and Acuity Specialty Products (ASP) posted higher net sales in the period due primarily to better pricing and product mix.
 
Overall, consolidated gross profit margins decreased slightly to 41.8% of net sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2004 from 42.0% reported in the year-ago period, due primarily to the higher cost of raw materials and expenses associated with enhancements to the supply chain at ABL. These items were partially offset by favorable price and mix changes and the impact of other profit improvement programs. Consolidated operating expenses declined as a percentage of net sales to 34.7% in the third quarter of fiscal 2004, compared to 35.7% reported in the year-ago period, due primarily to lower expense at ABL and miscellaneous corporate gains, partially offset by greater expense for company-wide long-term incentive programs. Consolidated operating profit advanced $4.7 million, or 14%, to $37.4 million in the third quarter of 2004 compared to the year-ago period due to the contribution margin from the higher net sales noted above and lower operating expenses. Operating profit margin increased 70 basis points to 7.0% for the third quarter of fiscal 2004 from 6.3% reported in the prior-year period due to lower operating expenses as a percentage of net sales. Net income increased 18% compared to the year-ago period due primarily to the higher operating profit noted above, a lower effective tax rate, and lower interest expense, partially offset by asset impairment charges of $0.9 million (pre-tax) recorded in the current quarter.
 
Third Quarter Segment and Corporate Overview
 
Net sales at Acuity Brands Lighting in the third quarter of fiscal 2004 were $397.5 million compared to $389.2 million reported in the year-ago period, an increase of $8.3 million, or 2%. Net sales at ABL increased over the prior year due primarily
 
to better pricing and product mix. The backlog at ABL increased $59.8 million, or 41%, to $204.0 million at May 31, 2004 from February 29, 2004, reflecting orders placed in advance of a price increase effective in May and the normal seasonal pattern for the non-residential construction market. Operating profit at ABL increased $4.5 million, or 18%, to $29.6 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2004 from $25.1 million reported in the prior year. Operating profit margins at ABL improved to 7.4% of net sales from 6.4% reported in the year-ago period. The increases in operating profit and margin were due primarily to the benefits from certain programs, including sourcing and margin management initiatives, and cost savings from enhancements to the supply chain, including the manufacturing network transformation that has impacted 13 plants over the last year. These improvements were partially offset in the third quarter by manufacturing inefficiencies and other costs related to changes in the supply chain and higher raw material costs (primarily steel). Overall, manufacturing inefficiencies totaled approximately $4.0 million (pre-tax) in the third quarter, which was somewhat higher than expected.
 
Net sales at Acuity Specialty Products in the third quarter of fiscal 2004 increased $2.9 million, or 2%, to $134.7 million from $131.8 million in the year-ago period. The increase in net sales was due primarily to improved pricing in the domestic industrial and institutional channel and greater volume in the international market, partially offset by the absence of sales from a small product line divested in November 2003. Operating profit at ASP for the third quarter of fiscal 2004 decreased slightly to $12.4 million, or 9.2% of net sales, from $12.5 million, or 9.5% of net sales, reported in the year-ago period. The decreases in
 
operating profit and margin were due primarily to higher employee, insurance, and certain raw material costs, partially offset by the impact of initiatives to enhance pricing and control costs.
 
Corporate expenses were $4.5 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2004 compared to $4.9 million in the year-ago period. The decrease was due primarily to miscellaneous gains of $1.7 million, partially offset by higher expense for company-wide long-term incentive programs resulting from the use of a greater mix of restricted stock awards compared to stock option awards used in the year-ago period. Net interest expense in the third quarter of fiscal 2004 declined to $8.7 million from $9.2 million reported in the year-ago period due primarily to a reduction in debt balances. The consolidated tax rate for the Company was 33.5% for the quarter ended May 31, 2004 as compared to 36.0% for the quarter ended May 31, 2003. The decrease in the effective rate was primarily the result of the recognition of certain non-taxable gains and a more favorable geographic mix of income. Overall, the Company expects its effective tax rate to be approximately 35% for fiscal 2004.
 
Year-To-Date Results
 
Net sales for the nine months ended May 31, 2004 increased $25.1 million, or 2%, to $1,540.8 million compared to $1,515.7 million reported in the same period a year ago. Consolidated operating profit for the first nine months of fiscal 2004 increased $12.0 million, or 15%, to $90.4 million compared to operating profit of $78.4 million in the prior year. Consolidated operating margins improved to 5.9% of net sales for the nine months ended May 31, 2004 from 5.2% of net sales
 
reported in the prior year. Year-to-date net income was $40.4 million, or $0.94 per diluted share, compared to last year's net income of $33.5 million, or $0.81 per diluted share. Net income and diluted earnings per share increased 21% and 16%, respectively, in the first nine months of fiscal 2004 compared to the year-ago period.
 
Outlook
 
James S. Balloun, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Acuity Brands, said, "I am pleased to report that we again demonstrated meaningful improvement in our financial performance while experiencing no tangible improvement in the non-residential construction market. Overall, consolidated operating profit margins improved by 70 basis points and diluted earnings per share increased by 14% over the prior-year quarter. These strong improvements compared to the year-ago period reflect the benefits from numerous initiatives to enhance margins, improve operating efficiencies, and lower costs. We delivered these positive results while incurring costs to redeploy resources within the supply chain at ABL that we anticipate will strengthen future performance and confronting rising raw material costs company-wide. For example, the increased cost of steel reduced consolidated operating profit by approximately $4.0 million in the third quarter as compared to the prior year.
 
"We also continue to focus on driving cash flow and strengthening our financial position. As of May 31, 2004, our outstanding debt balance was $429.6 million, a reduction of $16.2 million since August 31, 2003. Further, our debt-to-total- capitalization ratio fell below 50% for the first time. We have achieved this level
 
of debt reduction while continuing to pay approximately $6 million in quarterly dividends and accelerating investment in key areas of our businesses. We continue to forecast a reduction in our debt balance through the remainder of the year. However, depending on the vitality of the non-residential construction market and the working capital requirements necessary to meet customer demands, total debt at year-end may be as high as $415 million.
 
"Results for the first nine months of fiscal 2004 were impacted by, among other influences, soft demand and uncertainties that existed in the Company's key markets, particularly non-residential construction. While these market conditions are forecasted to improve sometime in the fourth quarter, we remain cautious about the positive impact that such a rebound may have on our fourth quarter financial performance. In spite of our caution, we expect full-year earnings to be in the upper end of the range of our earlier full-year forecast of $1.31 to $1.51 per share."

 Acuity Brands, Inc. (NYSE: AYI) announced today that net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 was $26.8 million, or $0.62 per diluted share, compared to $14.3 million, or $0.34 per diluted share, reported for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. Net income and diluted earnings per share increased by 87% and 82%, respectively. Included in net income and earnings per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 were certain pre-tax charges of $10.7 million (or $0.16 per diluted share) that were not repeated in 2004 and are more fully described below. In addition, the Company continued to reduce debt, ending the 2004 fourth quarter with total debt of $395.7 million, down $33.9 million from May 31, 2004 and $50.1 million from August 31, 2003.
ATLANTA, October 5, 2004
 
Net sales for the fourth quarter ended August 31, 2004 were $563.4 million compared to $533.7 million reported in the year-ago period, an increase of $29.7 million, or 6%. Acuity Brands Lighting (ABL) and Acuity Specialty Products (ASP) increased net sales by 6% and 4%, respectively, due primarily to higher shipments and improved pricing on certain products. Consolidated operating expenses decreased to 33.1% of net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, compared to 36.1% reported in the year-ago period, due primarily to the previously mentioned charges that were included in the prior year. Consolidated operating profit of $49.1 million was $17.2 million, or 54%, higher in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 compared to the year-ago period due to the contribution margin from the higher net sales noted above and lower operating expenses. The increase in net income was due primarily to the higher operating profit previously noted and a lower effective income tax rate.
 
Fourth Quarter Segment and Corporate Overview
 
Net sales at Acuity Brands Lighting in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 were $422.6 million compared to $398.1 million reported in the year-ago period, an increase of $24.5 million, or 6%. The increase in net sales at ABL was due primarily to higher shipments and better pricing for certain products. The backlog at ABL decreased $51.2 million, or 25%, to $152.8 million at August 31, 2004 from May 31, 2004, reflecting the shipment of orders placed in advance of a price increase effective in May and the normal seasonal pattern for the non-residential construction market. Operating profit at ABL increased $14.9 million, or 56%, to $41.7 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 from $26.8 million reported in the
 
prior year. Operating profit margins at ABL improved to 9.9% of net sales from 6.7% reported in the year-ago period. The increase in operating profit was due primarily to the contribution margin from the higher net sales noted above, benefits from continuous improvement programs, including sourcing initiatives to lower product costs, and efficiencies resulting from the manufacturing network transformation. Additionally, the prior year included a pre-tax charge of $8.0 million for a patent litigation settlement, which was not repeated in fiscal 2004. These improvements were partially offset by costs associated with the consolidation of certain manufacturing facilities, higher costs for various raw materials, and estimated pre-tax costs of $2.5 million associated with a voluntary product recall expected to be announced by the end of October.
 
Net sales at Acuity Specialty Products in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 were $140.8 million compared to $135.6 million, an increase of $5.2 million, or 4%, over the same period one year earlier. The increase in net sales was due primarily to improved pricing in the domestic industrial and institutional channel and greater volume in the international market, partially offset by the absence of sales from a small product line divested in November 2003. Operating profit at ASP for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 increased $4.5 million, or 44%, to $14.8 million from $10.3 million reported in the year-ago period, while operating margins improved to 10.5% of net sales from 7.6% in the year-ago period. The improvement in operating profit was due primarily to the profit contribution from the higher net sales in the current year, 2003 pre-tax charges of $2.7 million related to environmental matters, and charges related to inventory that were recorded in the prior year.
 
Corporate expenses were $7.4 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 compared to $5.2 million in the year-ago period. The increase was due primarily to higher expense associated with certain stock-based benefit programs and expanded services to comply with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Net interest expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 declined to $8.5 million from $8.9 million reported in the year-ago period due primarily to a reduction in outstanding debt balances.
 
Fiscal 2004 Full Year Results
 
Net sales for the year ended August 31, 2004 increased $54.9 million, or 3%, to $2,104.2 million compared to $2,049.3 million reported in the same period a year ago. Consolidated operating profit for fiscal 2004 increased $27.6 million, or 25%, to $137.9 million compared to operating profit of $110.3 million in the prior year. Consolidated operating margins improved to 6.6% of net sales for the year ended August 31, 2004 from 5.4% of net sales reported in the prior year. Net income in 2004 was benefited by a 34.5% effective income tax rate, which is below the expected rate of 36.0%. Net income for fiscal 2004 was $67.2 million, or $1.56 per diluted share, compared to net income of $47.8 million, or $1.15 per diluted share, for fiscal 2003. Net income and diluted earnings per share increased 41% and 36%, respectively, in fiscal 2004 compared to the year-ago period.
 
Comments
 
Vernon J. Nagel, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Acuity Brands, said, "I am pleased to report that we again demonstrated meaningful improvement in our financial performance while experiencing no tangible improvement in the non-residential construction market. Overall, fiscal 2004 consolidated operating profit margins improved by 120 basis points and diluted earnings per share increased by 36% over the prior year. The significant improvement in fiscal 2004 performance resulted from the benefits of numerous initiatives to enhance margins, improve operating efficiencies, and lower costs. We delivered these positive results while incurring costs and inefficiencies to redeploy resources within the supply chain at ABL that we anticipate will strengthen future performance and while confronting rising raw material costs company-wide. For example, the increased cost of steel reduced consolidated operating profit by approximately $5.0 million in the fourth quarter as compared to the prior year.
 
"We also continued to focus on driving cash flow and strengthening our financial position. As of August 31, 2004, our outstanding debt balance was $395.7 million, a reduction of $50.1 million since August 31, 2003. Further, our debt-to-total-capitalization ratio was 45.3% compared to 52.2% in the prior-year period. We have achieved this level of debt reduction while accelerating investment in key areas of our businesses and continuing to pay approximately $26 million in annual dividends.
 
"We expect that fiscal 2005 will be a challenging year, as we are cautious about the potential for a meaningful recovery in the non-residential construction market
 
and expect that prices for certain components and raw materials (particularly steel and petroleum-based products) will continue to increase dramatically. However, we do expect benefits from continuous improvement initiatives and our annual product and price review programs to help offset these rising costs. In light of tepid demand for non-residential construction lighting fixtures and the anticipated timing of raw material cost increases, we expect operating results for the first half of fiscal 2005 to be relatively consistent with those of the first half of fiscal 2004. However, we hope to again make meaningful progress in 2005 towards our long-term goal of delivering consistent growth in earnings per share of 15% per annum. Additionally, we anticipate reducing debt to our targeted debt-to-capitalization ratio of approximately 40% by the end of fiscal 2005 while increasing available cash, investing approximately $50 to $55 million in capital expenditures, and paying annual dividends of approximately $26 million."

 Acuity Brands, Inc. (NYSE: AYI) announced today that net income for the first quarter ended November 30, 2004 was $13.2 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, compared to $12.9 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, reported in the year-ago period. This represents an increase in net income of approximately 2%. Sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2005 increased $7.7 million to $525.2 million from $517.5 million reported in the prior year. Please see the Company's Form 10-Q to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission today for more information on the results for the first quarter of fiscal 2005.
ATLANTA, January 6, 2005
 
Vernon J. Nagel, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Acuity Brands, said, "Earnings for the first quarter were in line with our expectations in spite of a number of challenges, particularly rising raw material costs which were approximately $3.5 million higher than expected. Operating profit was essentially
 
flat with the prior year as benefits from previously announced price increases, a more favorable mix of products sold, and benefits from programs to reduce costs were offset by higher raw material costs and greater expenses related to stock-based incentive programs. We continued to make significant progress in improving our productivity and service capabilities through previously announced programs. From a market perspective, we saw favorable signs of increased demand in the non-residential construction market as incoming orders began to strengthen late in the quarter. While we anticipate that the second quarter will be as challenging as our first quarter, we continue to expect to make meaningful progress in 2005 towards achieving our long-term financial targets, which include improving earnings per share by at least 15% annually as stated in our 2004 annual report."

Acuity Brands, Inc. ("Acuity Brands" or the "Company") expects all of its employees, directors, and agents to act with the highest ethical standards and comply with all applicable laws. This Code applies to Acuity Brands and all of its subsidiaries.
 
This Code embodies and exemplifies The Acuity Brands Way, which sets forth the fundamentals for creating and sustaining value for our customers, employees and shareholders. It explains specific standards of business conduct applicable to people acting on Acuity Brands' behalf. The standards set forth in the Code, which sometimes may be stricter than legal requirements, are designed to protect the integrity of the Company and to ensure compliance with laws and regulations wherever the Company does business. Conduct that violates these standards is not in keeping with The Acuity Brands Way, and violation of the Code may result in disciplinary action including termination of employment.
 
Certain legal requirements addressed in this Code are covered by specific compliance policies and guidelines promulgated by Acuity Brands. The Company distributes these policies and guidelines separately to the appropriate directors and employees. These compliance policies and guidelines are also available from the Acuity Brands legal department upon request or through its intranet website. In addition to these specific policies and guidelines, the Company publishes various policies, procedures and rules from time to time, and directors and employees are expected to comply with these policies, procedures and rules as well.

It is designed to deter wrongdoing and to promote:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Acuity Brands is committed to conducting our businesses in accordance with the letter and the spirit of the laws in the countries in which we operate. All directors and employees of the Company are responsible for fulfilling this commitment by being knowledgeable about applicable laws, rules and regulations and by steadfastly complying with their legal obligations in the performance of their Company responsibilities. For questions or clarification, directors and employees should consult the Company's Legal Department.
 
 
Equal Opportunity for All Employees
 
One of the four building blocks of The Acuity Brands Way is "how we work together." We are committed to providing a positive, constructive and action-oriented environment that supports diversity in individuals and their talents, thoughts, and perspectives.
 
Acuity Brands is an equal employment opportunity employer. Employment opportunities are available regardless of race, color, sex, religion, national origin, age, disability, veteran status, or other legally protected status. This commitment applies to all aspects of the employment relationship, including recruiting, hiring, training, work assignment, promotion, transfer, termination, and wage and salary administration.
 
Recognizing equal employment opportunity can only be achieved through demonstrated leadership and aggressive implementation of the Company's Affirmative Action Plans, which the Company and its business units maintain in accordance with applicable law, all employees are expected to make every reasonable effort to carry out their affirmative action responsibilities in spirit as well as letter to assure that equal employment opportunity is available to all. All employees must demonstrate sensitivity to and respect for all other employees and commitment to Acuity Brands' equal employment opportunity and affirmative action objectives.
 
Freedom from Harassment and Violence-Free Workplace
 
Acuity Brands is committed to providing a positive, productive work environment for all employees. Acuity Brands' policy is to treat all employees fairly and with dignity and respect. Acuity Brands will not tolerate any harassment, discrimination or unlawful treatment of employees by anyone, including any supervisor, co-worker, vendor, client, or customer of Acuity Brands.
 
The prohibition against harassment includes harassment for any discriminatory reason, such as sex, race, national origin, disability, age or religion, as well as any other unprofessional and discourteous actions toward employees. Accordingly, derogatory or inappropriate conduct - whether verbal, written, physical, or graphic - for any discriminatory reason will not be tolerated. All of Acuity Brands' directors and employees are responsible for helping to enforce this policy and ensuring that the work environment remains pleasant and professional for all who work at Acuity Brands.
 
Further, acts or threats of violence, including inappropriate verbal or physical threats, intimidation, harassment, and/or coercion will not be tolerated. Behavior that threatens the safety of people or property, or has the potential to become violent, should be reported immediately. In addition, firearms (even if licensed and permitted), ammunition, weapons, and explosives are forbidden inside Company facilities or in Company vehicles.
 
Drug-Free and Alcohol Free Workplace
 
Acuity Brands is committed to providing its employees with a safe work environment that is free from the effects of illegal drugs and alcohol.
 
The unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession, or use, or being under the influence of, illegal drugs or alcohol on the job or on Company premises is prohibited. "Illegal drugs" refers to any drugs or controlled substances that are not prescribed by a licensed medical doctor (other than over-the-counter drugs) and prescription or over-the-counter drugs that are used in a manner inconsistent with the instructions of either a licensed medical doctor or the over-the-counter drug.
 
Any vice president of a business unit or division may authorize the consumption of alcohol at business meetings or for special occasions. The moderate consumption of alcohol at business dinners is allowed so long as any legal requirements are not violated and good judgment is exercised. The Company will always provide transportation after such dinners if there is any question about the employee's ability to get home safely.
 
Sound Environmental, Safety, and Health Practices
 
Acuity Brands is committed to an injury-free and illness-free workplace that is operated in an environmentally sound manner in compliance with all relevant laws and regulations that protect worker safety and the environment. Employees should perform work in a safe manner.
 
Acuity Brands strives diligently to avoid any adverse impact to the environment and the communities in which it does business. In furtherance of this standard, Acuity Brands' goal is to eliminate, to the fullest extent practicable, the use of hazardous materials and the generation of solid and hazardous waste in its operations. Acuity Brands continuously assesses potential environmental consequences and legal environmental requirements relating to its operations. To ensure compliance, each business unit is required to maintain an effective environmental compliance program.
 
 
Antitrust and Competition
 
Acuity Brands' policy is to compete vigorously, independently, and fairly in compliance with all applicable antitrust and competition laws and without any anticompetitive understandings or agreements with its competitors. Accordingly, Acuity Brands' employees cannot agree (formally or informally) with competitors to fix prices, manipulate or divide markets or customers, or boycott customers, and cannot attempt to unfairly monopolize a market, or engage in any other acts or agreements that inappropriately restrict or restrain competition. Arrangements such as joint ventures, mergers and acquisitions, requirement contracts, and tying contracts ( contracts that require a customer to purchase one product or service as a condition to the sale of another product or service) may also trigger antitrust concerns and should be discussed with the Legal Department.
e.g.,
 
Acuity Brands' corporate office and Acuity Brands' business units are required to conduct their operations in accordance with the foregoing and with the applicable antitrust and trade practice guidelines provided by Acuity Brands.
 
Restrictive Covenants with Third Parties
 
Acuity Brands does not condone activities that seek to gain an unfair competitive advantage. No individual may engage in any activity which violates any valid restrictive covenants entered into by that individual for the benefit of a third party, and no individual may, directly or indirectly, use or disclose any confidential information or trade secrets of a third party that the individual obtained while employed by or associated with such third party.
 
Government Contracts
 
Acuity Brands is committed to complying with all applicable laws and regulations relating to government contracts and to ensuring that its reports and certifications to government officials are accurate and complete and that any deviations from contract requirements are properly approved. Everyone at Acuity Brands who is engaged in government contracting or subcontracting work is expected to adhere to specific company policies and procedures which reflect the special rules under the Federal Acquisition Regulation, establish standards of conduct for employees, and identify the special compliance risks in doing business with the government.
 
 
Financial Reporting
 
All transactions must be recorded so as to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. No false or misleading entries may be made in the books and records of the Company for any reason, and no employee may engage in any arrangement that results in such a prohibited act.
 
No undisclosed or unrecorded fund or asset of the Company may be established for any purpose.
 
No payment on behalf of the Company may be approved without adequate supporting documentation or made with the intention or understanding that any part of such payment is to be used for any purpose other than as described by the documents supporting the payment.
 
From time to time, the Company may publish written policies on financial reporting, disclosure and compliance to reinforce the financial reporting expectations in this Code. All employees at Acuity Brands, including the Company's senior financial officers and other financial employees, are expected to implement and strictly follow these written policies.
 
Gifts to Third Parties
 
No funds or assets of the Company may be used directly or indirectly for excessive entertainment of, or gifts of significant value to, customers and other commercial parties. All reimbursable entertainment must be identified on expense reports and other documents and are subject to supervisory review, including a determination that expenditures conform to the letter and spirit of this policy. For purposes of this standard, "gifts of significant value" will include money of any amount.
 
Some government agencies prohibit any entertaining of, or gifts to, their employees, and in such cases no entertainment or gifts will be permitted. In addition, the Company complies fully with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which specifically prohibits any payment to foreign officials, including political parties or candidates, for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business for the Company or otherwise securing any improper advantage.
 
Loans and Political Contributions
 
No funds or assets of the Company may be used directly or indirectly for: (a) loans to any federal, state, local, or foreign government official or employee or to any entity in which the government official or employee is known to have a material interest; or (b) any contributions to political parties or to candidates for political office. This prohibition also applies to indirect contributions or payments made in any form such as those made through consultants, advisors, suppliers, customers, or other third parties.
 
Intellectual Property
 
One of the Company's most valuable assets is its intellectual property  including patents, trade secrets, trademarks, service marks, and copyrights. Employees must safeguard the Company's intellectual property by using it only in ways that are consistent with applicable law and by not allowing third parties to use the Company's intellectual property without appropriate legal protections approved by Acuity Brands' counsel. The Company also will not permit the unauthorized use of the intellectual property rights of others. Inventions and ideas of employees, which are created by employees in connection with the Company's business, research, development, design, or manufacturing efforts, are the property of the Company.
 
The Company's Confidential Information
 
The Company's confidential information is vital to the Company's success. "Confidential information" is financial, business, or technical information, both oral and written, about the Company, its products, suppliers, or customers that is (a) classified as proprietary, secret, or confidential, or (b) not known to the public or our competitors, and which provides the Company with a competitive advantage. No director or employee may use or disclose any confidential information regarding the Company or its customers, operations, finances, or business dealings, except in connection with the individual's work for the Company or as required by legal process. This policy also applies to any confidential information of third parties of which the individual becomes aware during the course of his or her employment or directorship. Care should be taken not to leave documents containing confidential information visible on desks, not to throw such documents away in a trash can without shredding the documents, and not to discuss confidential information in public places.
 
Misappropriation of Company Property
 
Assets of the Company (or third parties doing business with the Company) may not be appropriated for personal use. Similarly, personal expenses may not be charged to or otherwise paid by the Company, except as permitted under approved fringe benefit policies.
 
Use of Company Software
 
Unauthorized acquisition, copy, or use of computer software of the Company or any third party is prohibited. Software must be used only in accordance with the terms of its license agreement. Unless otherwise provided in the license, no employee may make or distribute copies of software or documentation for use within or on behalf of the Company or for personal use or for the use of others, including customers and family members. All software used by or on behalf of the Company or on Company-owned computers must be purchased through the appropriate channels in the Company using approved procedures. Software may not be brought in from any unauthorized source, including downloading from the Internet.
 
Use of Electronic Devices
 
Electronic devices that belong to the Company and electronic services provided by the Company must be used for the purpose of conducting the Company's business. The Internet can be a valuable source of information and research. In addition, e-mail can provide an excellent means of communicating with directors, employees, customers, outside vendors, and other businesses.

On February 22, 2005, Acuity Brands, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release providing a strategic update and business outlook. In this press release, among other things, the Company announced that it is accelerating the implementation of key elements of its ongoing restructuring program, and that as part of such program, the Company expects to take a pretax charge of approximately $17 million (or $0.25 per diluted share) in its second quarter of 2005 to reflect the costs associated with the elimination of approximately 1,100 positions worldwide. Additionally, the Company provided guidance related to expected results for the second quarter of 2005.
 
The foregoing summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the press release referenced above, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K and is incorporated into Item 8.01 by reference.

 Acuity Brands, Inc. (NYSE: AYI) announced today that it is accelerating the implementation of key elements of its ongoing restructuring program, which is an integral part of its long-term growth strategy and performance improvement efforts. Vernon J. Nagel, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Acuity Brands, said, "While we have made solid progress in our transformation, we are not satisfied with our level of performance. By accelerating our restructuring, Acuity Brands expects to significantly improve operating efficiencies, resulting in enhanced customer service, greater productivity, and higher returns for our shareholders." As part of this program, Acuity Brands expects to take a pretax charge of approximately $17 million (or $0.25 per diluted share) in its second quarter ending February 28, 2005 to reflect the costs associated with the elimination of approximately 1,100 positions worldwide, including almost 15% of its salaried workforce. The Company
ATLANTA, February 22, 2005
 
expects that this action will reduce its operating costs by at least $13 million in the second half of fiscal 2005 and approximately $50 million annually by the end of calendar year 2005. The ongoing company-wide restructuring, which includes facility consolidations and process improvement initiatives, involves its business units, Acuity Brands Lighting (ABL) and Acuity Specialty Products (ASP), as well as its corporate office.
 
Nagel further commented that, "The announcement of this acceleration is to make clear to our key stakeholders the magnitude of the opportunity we still have to improve our operating and financial performance and to assure our customers of our continued commitment to competitively deliver market-leading products and services while investing in future innovations. As we move forward, we are taking extra precautions to ensure that customer service remains our top priority. Our goal is to expand our industry-leading capabilities for our customers while creating a company capable of delivering substantially better returns for our shareholders and a brighter future for our employees. While decisions to eliminate jobs are never easy, this action is essential if we are to be a stronger, more effective organization. In order for us to achieve our long-term goals, we will need to further consolidate our supply chains and better leverage our organizational capabilities. This restructuring program may result in additional charges for the potential consolidation of certain plants and other facilities, beyond that which has already been announced.
 
"We previously projected that operating results in the first half of our fiscal year would be essentially flat compared to last year, and results for the first quarter
 
were consistent with that projection. That projection did not include the charge announced today. As we currently review our operating performance, we see increasing strength in the Company's more traditional markets, consistent with industry trends. However, challenges remain in certain product lines and channels, particularly the home improvement channel where shipments and profitability trail last year. We have implemented corrective actions; however, they will not be sufficient to offset our quarterly performance to date. In addition, we have commenced a program to reduce inventory levels due to the positive impact of process improvement programs. We expect that this may result in lower absorption of factory overhead costs creating a drag on operating profit in the current quarter and for the balance of fiscal 2005. Finally, cost increases for raw materials and other expenses during the second quarter have outpaced realized price increases at both ABL and ASP. Our most recent price increases, which generally phase in over a three-month period, will not fully benefit the Company's results until the third quarter of fiscal 2005. As a result of these combined factors, we now expect our second quarter results, before the impact of the charge announced today, to be approximately break-even or perhaps a slight loss. While our expected results for the second quarter did not bring about our decision to eliminate positions in connection with our restructuring, they did cause us to be more aggressive in accelerating our restructuring program.
 
"We believe that we are positioned to realize the full benefits of the emerging strength in our more traditional markets and the impact of previously announced price increases. We anticipate that in the second half of fiscal 2005 the benefits
 
of ongoing process improvements and accelerated restructuring initiatives will offset some of the challenges we continue to face in certain other product lines and channels. Therefore, excluding the potential impact of our inventory reduction program noted earlier, we continue to expect that our results in the second half will be more indicative of our future performance and more consistent with our long-term performance goals. We are confident that our actions, as well as the commitment of our employees to be the best, will result in a strong and vibrant future for Acuity Brands."

ATLANTA, April 4, 2005
 
Net sales for the first half of fiscal 2005 were $1,030.3 million compared to $1,008.6 million in 2004, an increase of 2%. Net income for the first six months of 2005 was $4.7 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, compared with $22.4 million, or $0.52 per diluted share in the year-ago period.

ATLANTA  July 6, 2005Acuity Brands, Inc. (NYSE: AYI) announced today that net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2005 was $19.7 million, or $0.44 per diluted share, compared to $18.0 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, reported in the third quarter of fiscal 2004. These represent increases in net income and diluted earnings per share of 9% and 5%, respectively. Also during the quarter, the Company generated significant cash flow from operations, bringing year-to-date cash flow from operations to $61.2 million compared to $49.3 million reported in the first nine months of 2004, an increase of $11.9 million. Total debt outstanding at May 31, 2005 was $390.7 million, down $5.0 million from August 31, 2004, while the Company's cash position was $44.3 million, an increase of $30.1 million from August 31, 2004.
 
Net sales for the quarter ended May 31, 2005 increased $13.1 million, or 2%, to $545.3 million from the year-ago period. Acuity Brands Lighting (ABL) and Acuity Specialty Products (ASP) posted higher net sales in the period due primarily to the positive impact of price increases, partially offset by lower shipments in certain commercial and retail channels. Consolidated gross profit margins decreased to 39.6% of net sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2005 from 41.8% reported in the year-ago period. The decline was due primarily to higher costs for raw materials and components, less profit contribution resulting from lower shipments in certain channels, and the negative impact of reduced production at ABL. These items were partially offset by higher pricing and favorable product mix changes and benefits from the efforts taken to streamline and improve the operations. Overall, raw material and component costs increased approximately $20.0 million in the third quarter of 2005 compared to the year-ago period. Consolidated operating expenses declined as a percentage of net sales to 32.5% in the third quarter of fiscal 2005, compared to 34.9% reported in the year-ago period, due primarily to
 
 
benefits from the Company's restructuring and cost reduction programs. Consolidated operating profit increased $2.3 million, or 6%, to $38.8 million in the third quarter of 2005 compared to the year-ago period due primarily to lower operating expenses, partially offset by the lower gross profit noted above. Operating profit margin increased 20 basis points to 7.1% of net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2005 from 6.9% reported in the prior-year period.
 
Third Quarter Segment and Corporate Overview
 
Net sales at Acuity Brands Lighting in the third quarter of fiscal 2005 were $406.2 million compared to $397.5 million reported in the year-ago period, an increase of $8.7 million, or 2%. Net sales at ABL increased over the prior year due primarily to better pricing and a more favorable mix of products sold, partially offset by lower shipments into the commercial and industrial channel, which experienced general softness in demand particularly in the early portion of the quarter. The backlog at ABL increased $14.6 million, or 9%, to $174.4 million at May 31, 2005 from February 28, 2005, reflecting a strong order rate, principally in the month of May, and the normal seasonal pattern for the non-residential construction market. Operating profit at ABL increased $1.3 million, or 5%, to $29.9 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2005 from $28.6 million reported in the prior year. Operating profit margins at ABL improved to 7.4% of net sales from 7.2% reported in the year-ago period. The increases in operating profit and margin were due primarily to the positive impact of price increases, favorable changes in the mix of products sold, and benefits from the reduction in workforce announced in the second quarter of fiscal 2005 and continued cost containment programs. These improvements were partially offset by higher raw material and component costs, increased transportation costs, less profit contribution resulting from reduced shipments into certain channels, and lower absorption of manufacturing costs due to decreased production volume.
 
Net sales at Acuity Specialty Products in the third quarter of fiscal 2005 increased $4.4 million, or 3%, to $139.1 million from $134.7 million in the year-ago period. The increase
 
 
in net sales was due primarily to improved pricing in the domestic industrial and institutional channel and greater volume in international markets, particularly Canada, partially offset by lower net sales in certain retail channels. Operating profit at ASP for the third quarter of fiscal 2005 increased to $13.9 million, or 10.0% of net sales, from $12.4 million, or 9.2% of net sales, reported in the year-ago period. The improvements in operating profit and margin were due primarily to the positive impact of price increases and benefits from the second quarter reduction in workforce, partially offset by higher costs for certain raw material and logistics costs and lower profit contribution from the retail channel.
 
Corporate expenses were $5.0 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2005 compared to $4.5 million in the year-ago period. The increase was due primarily to higher miscellaneous gains in the prior year and increased costs for Sarbanes-Oxley compliance. Net interest expense in the third quarter of fiscal 2005 increased to $9.0 million from $8.7 million reported in the year-ago period due to an increase in the weighted average interest rate, partially offset by a lower debt balance. The consolidated income tax rate for the Company was 33.7% for the quarter ended May 31, 2005 as compared to 33.5% for the quarter ended May 31, 2004. Overall, the Company expects its effective income tax rate to be approximately 34.5% for fiscal 2005.
 
Year-To-Date Results
 
Net sales for the nine months ended May 31, 2005 increased $34.9 million, or 2%, to $1,575.7 million compared to $1,540.8 million reported in the same period a year ago. Consolidated operating profit for the first nine months of fiscal 2005 decreased $26.4 million, or 30%, to $62.5 million compared to operating profit of $88.9 million in the prior year. Consolidated operating margins declined to 4.0% of net sales for the nine months ended May 31, 2005 from 5.8% of net sales reported in the prior year. Year-to-date net income was $24.4 million, or $0.55 per diluted share, compared to last year's net income of $40.4 million, or $0.94 per diluted share. Net income and diluted earnings per share decreased 40% and 41%, respectively, in the first nine months of fiscal 2005 compared to the year-ago period. Operating profit, margin, net income, and earnings per share for the nine months ended May 31, 2005 were impacted significantly by the $17.0 million
 
 
pre-tax restructuring charge (or $0.25 per diluted share after-tax) taken in the second quarter of fiscal 2005 and by escalating raw material and component costs, partially offset by price increases, a more favorable mix of products sold, and actions implemented to improve overall operating effectiveness.
 
Outlook
 
Vernon J. Nagel, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Acuity Brands, said, "Our third quarter results reflect the positive efforts of our dedicated and focused associates to overcome the impact of a marketplace fraught with intense competition, dramatically rising material and benefit costs, and sluggish end markets. On balance, we posted solid results and made positive strides to improve our overall effectiveness. While we generated an improvement in earnings, results are still not where we would like them to be. During the quarter, we were able to raise prices to help offset approximately $20.0 million in material and component cost increases while experiencing higher costs for transportation and the negative impact of lower production volume. We took strong actions that improved our customer service, reduced operating costs, and improved the effectiveness of our manufacturing facilities at both businesses. These actions contributed to ASP's achievement of a 10.0% operating profit margin in the quarter. We were particularly pleased with our ability to generate strong cash flow as evidenced by our declining debt level and our growing cash position. These were all positive indicators of managing well while our primary end markets were soft, particularly in the first half of the quarter.
 
"As we look forward, we see both opportunities and conditions that continue to cause us concern. On the positive side, order rates at ABL were strong in May and continued so in June, reflecting unit growth as well as our ability to hold recent price increases. This is a reflection of what we believe to be improving market conditions in the non-residential construction market, our largest market. The backlog at ABL continues to build while our customer service metrics improve. Actions to enhance the efficiencies of our facilities should begin to benefit our financial results. Assuming all these conditions continue to prevail, they should have a positive impact on our results going forward. We continue to be concerned by rising raw material and component costs, particularly those impacted
 
 
by the price of oil, as well as end market demand, which seems to ebb and flow giving mixed signals of growth sustainability. Nonetheless, we expect that the numerous actions implemented will enhance our fourth quarter performance as compared to the year-ago period and positively impact fiscal 2006."

EXHIBIT 99.1 ACUITY BRANDS NEWS RELEASE Acuity Brands, Inc. 1170 Peachtree Street, NE Suite 2400 Atlanta, GA 30309 Tel: 404 853 1400 Fax: 404 853 1430 AcuityBrands.com COMPANY CONTACT: DAN SMITH ACUITY BRANDS, INC. (404) 853-1423 ACUITY BRANDS REPORTS 2005 FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR RESULTS ATLANTA - October 5, 2005 - Acuity Brands, Inc. (NYSE: AYI) announced today that it expects to report net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 of $27.8 million, or $0.61 per diluted share. Net income in the fourth quarter of 2005 included a pretax charge of $6.0 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, for additional severance costs related to the previously announced reduction in force as well as certain follow-on actions under the Company's ongoing restructuring program. Also included in net income for the fourth quarter of 2005 was a pretax gain related to sales of property of $1.8 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, and a lower effective tax rate, which benefited the quarter by approximately $0.06 per diluted share. Lastly, higher diluted shares outstanding during the current quarter lowered earnings per share by $0.03 compared to the year-ago period. Net income in the fourth quarter of 2004 was $26.8 million, or $0.62 per diluted share. The Company generated $75.9 million in cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter of 2005. Total debt at August 31, 2005 was $372.3 million compared to $395.7 million one year earlier, while cash on hand grew to $98.5 million from $14.1 million at the end of August 2004. Total debt outstanding as of August 31, 2005 was comprised primarily of fixed rate obligations with longer-term maturities. Net debt (total debt less cash and cash equivalents) was $273.8 million at August 31, 2005 compared to $381.6 million at the end of the prior year, a decrease of $107.8 million or 28%. Net sales for the quarter ended August 31, 2005 increased $33.8 million, or 6%, to $597.2 million from the year-ago period. The increase was due primarily to the positive impact of price increases and, to a lesser degree, unit volume growth. Consolidated
ACUITY BRANDS NEWS RELEASE 2 gross profit grew approximately 2% to $232.5 million, while gross profit margins decreased to 38.9% of net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 from 40.6% reported in the year-ago period. The increase in gross profit was due primarily to higher selling prices and a more favorable mix of products sold, partially offset by higher costs for raw materials and components. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales primarily declined because the increase in net sales largely offset rising raw material costs. Overall, raw material and component costs increased approximately $25.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 compared to the year-ago period. Operating expenses were $188.3 million, or 31.5% of net sales, in the fourth quarter of 2005 compared to $179.8 million, or 31.9% of net sales, reported in the year-ago period. The increase in operating expenses in the current quarter was due primarily to the $6.0 million special charge and higher freight and distribution expenses, partially offset by benefits from the previously announced reduction in force. Consolidated operating profit for the fourth quarter of 2005, which included the $6.0 million charge, decreased $4.8 million to $44.2 million from $49.0 million reported in the year-ago period. Fourth Quarter Segment and Corporate Overview Net sales at Acuity Brands Lighting (ABL) in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 were $452.5 million, a company record, compared to $422.5 million reported in the year-ago period, an increase of $30.0 million, or 7%. Net sales at ABL increased over the prior year due primarily to better pricing, a more favorable mix of products sold, and greater shipments in certain channels, partially offset by lower volume in the core commercial and industrial business. The backlog at August 31, 2005 of $152.2 million approximated the backlog at the end of the prior year. Operating profit at ABL was $37.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, a decrease of $4.4 million from the year-ago period, and included a pretax charge of $3.0 million, primarily for an increase in costs associated with the previously announced reduction in force and additional severance for ongoing programs to streamline certain operations. The decrease in operating profit was due primarily to the special charge; higher raw material and component costs; greater expenses for freight and distribution; and higher commission expense. These items were partially offset by the positive impact of price increases, favorable changes in the mix of products sold, and benefits from the reduction in workforce announced in the
ACUITY BRANDS NEWS RELEASE 3 second quarter of fiscal 2005. Raw materials and component costs increased over $20.0 million compared to the year-ago period, while distribution and freight expenses increased approximately $5.0 million over the prior year. Net sales at Acuity Specialty Products (ASP) in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 increased $3.9 million, or 3%, to $144.7 million from $140.8 million in the year-ago period. The increase in net sales was due primarily to more favorable pricing in the domestic industrial and institutional channel and the favorable impact of foreign currency translation on international sales, partially offset by lower unit volume. Operating profit at ASP for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 was $17.1 million compared to $14.8 million reported in the year-ago period, an increase of 16%. The increase in operating profit in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 was due primarily to the positive impact of price increases and benefits from the second quarter reduction in force, partially offset by the $0.6 million special charge related to additional actions to be taken as part of the previously announced reduction in force and by higher costs for certain raw materials. Corporate expenses were $10.1 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 compared to $7.5 million in the year-ago period. The increase included an additional special charge of $2.4 million primarily for non-cash costs associated with long-term incentive programs for those employees included in the restructuring. Net interest expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 increased to $8.7 million from $8.5 million reported in the year-ago period. The consolidated income tax rate for the Company was 26.7% for the quarter ended August 31, 2005 as compared to 33.9% for the quarter ended August 31, 2004. The decrease in the effective rate was due primarily to certain tax credits associated with the Mexican operations and state tax benefits. The Company expects the tax rate to be approximately 35% in fiscal 2006. Fiscal Year Results Net sales for the year ended August 31, 2005 increased $68.7 million, or 3%, to $2,172.9 million compared to $2,104.2 million reported in the same period a year ago. Consolidated operating profit for fiscal 2005 was $106.7 million as compared to operating profit of $137.9 million in the prior year. Fiscal 2005 net income was $52.2
ACUITY BRANDS NEWS RELEASE 4 million, or $1.17 per diluted share, compared to last year's net income of $67.2 million, or $1.56 per diluted share. Operating profit, net income, and earnings per share for the year ended August 31, 2005 were negatively impacted primarily by the aggregate $23.0 million pre-tax restructuring charge (or $0.34 per diluted share) taken in the second and fourth quarters of fiscal 2005, lower shipments in certain channels, escalating raw material and component costs, and lower absorption of manufacturing expenses. These items were partially offset by benefits from price increases, a more favorable mix of products sold, and actions implemented to improve overall operating effectiveness, including benefits of approximately $13 million from the reduction in force. Pursuant to Sarbanes-Oxley requirements, the Company's certifying public accountants' audit opinion with respect to the year-end financial statements will not be dated until the Company completes the final 10-K report and evaluation of internal controls over financial reporting. Accordingly, the financial results reported in this earnings release are preliminary pending completion of the audit. Commentary and Outlook Vernon J. Nagel, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Acuity Brands, said, "We posted solid results in the fourth quarter in spite of higher raw material, component, freight, and distribution costs and the continued softness in the non-residential construction market, now forecasted to be down in calendar year 2005 for the sixth year in a row. Our net sales grew by 6% over the year-ago period reflecting both benefits from previously implemented pricing initiatives and unit volume growth in certain lighting channels. In addition, I am particularly pleased with our ability to continue to generate strong cash flow and our efficient use of working capital, which reflects the success of certain programs implemented in prior periods to enhance our operations. In 2005, we generated $137.1 million in cash flow from operations while paying $26.3 million in dividends, significantly enhancing our financial position and flexibility. Today, we have almost $100 million in cash and our existing debt is comprised primarily of fixed rate obligations with longer-term maturities.
ACUITY BRANDS NEWS RELEASE 5 "Looking ahead to fiscal 2006, we expect that past actions and improvements we continue to make will result in more efficient and effective operations producing results expected by our key stakeholders. Our service to customers has improved dramatically in key channels and we continue to make progress in creating a leaner, more efficient company. We believe that we are on target to achieve the previously announced annualized savings run-rate of approximately $50 million by the end of our second quarter in fiscal 2006 from actions associated with the Company's ongoing restructuring program. Additionally, we are encouraged by external forecasts that are projecting unit volume growth in calendar year 2006 in the non-residential construction industry, a core market for us. To the extent this occurs, we believe it will have a positive impact on our unit volume. We expect cash flow from operations to remain strong, while investing between $40 million and $45 million in capital expenditures. Although these influences bode well for us in 2006, we are not without formidable challenges, including the impact of rising prices for crude oil, generating profitable growth within our retail channels, and continued escalating costs. However, in spite of these challenges, we expect to make positive progress in growing our business and improving our operations in 2006 sufficient to allow us to make meaningful progress towards the achievement of our long-term financial goals." Conference Call As previously announced, the Company will host a conference call to discuss fourth quarter results today, October 5, 2005, at 4:00 p.m. ET.

(404) 853-1423 ACUITY BRANDS DECLARES QUARTERLY DIVIDEND AND ANNOUNCES STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM ATLANTA, October 5, 2005 - The Board of Directors of Acuity Brands, Inc. (NYSE: AYI) has declared a quarterly dividend of 15 cents per share. The dividend is payable on November 1, 2005 to stockholders of record on October 17, 2005. In addition, the Board of Directors of Acuity Brands has authorized the repurchase of up to 2,000,000 shares, or approximately 4.5%, of the Company's outstanding common stock. Under the share repurchase program, the Company expects to acquire shares primarily through open market transactions, subject to market conditions and other factors. The Company may enter into Rule 10b5-1 plans to facilitate open market repurchases under the program. A Rule 10b5-1 plan would generally permit the Company to repurchase shares at times when it might otherwise be prevented from doing so under certain securities laws provided the plan is adopted when the Company is not in possession of material non-public information. Shares repurchased under the program may be retired or used for general corporate purposes, which may include the Company's share-based compensation and employee benefit plans. Vernon J. Nagel, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Acuity Brands, said, "The Board's approval of the share repurchase program is a reflection of our confidence in the Company's future and its ability to continue to generate strong cash 1
flow from operations. Over the past four years, the Company has significantly improved its financial position and has reduced overall debt levels by 42%, enhancing the Company's financial flexibility. In 2005, the Company generated over $137 million in cash flow from operations and paid shareholders more than $26 million in dividends while ending the year with almost $100 million of cash. At August 31, 2005, the Company's net debt balance (total debt minus cash and cash equivalents) was approximately $274 million. Outstanding debt consisted almost entirely of long-term obligations. We believe that a share repurchase program represents a wise use of our cash flow, also allowing us to offset dilution resulting from our stock-based compensation and benefit programs. We believe that the repurchase program supports Acuity Brands' objective to maximize long-term stockholder value, while continuing to fund investments to better serve our customers, to grow our businesses, and to improve our operating and financial performance." Acuity Brands, Inc., with fiscal year 2005 net sales of approximately $2.2 billion, is comprised of Acuity Brands Lighting and Acuity Specialty Products. Acuity Brands Lighting is one of the world's leading providers of lighting fixtures and includes brands such as Lithonia Lighting(R), Holophane(R), Peerless(R), Hydrel(R), American Electric Lighting(R), and Gotham(R).

ATLANTA  January 4, 2006  Acuity Brands, Inc. (NYSE: AYI) announced today that net income for the first quarter ended November 30, 2005 was $22.0 million, or $0.48 per diluted share, compared with $13.2 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, reported in the year-ago period. This represents increases in net income and diluted earnings per share of 67% and 60%, respectively. Sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2006 increased $40.7 million, or 7.7%, to $565.9 million from $525.2 million reported in the prior year.
 
Please see the Company's Form 10-Q to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission today for more information on the results for the first quarter of fiscal 2006.
 
Vernon J. Nagel, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Acuity Brands, said, "We are very pleased with our results for the first quarter of fiscal 2006. Prior to the beginning of 2006, the Company implemented a number of profit improvement programs designed to streamline operations, enhance customer service, improve manufacturing and transactional efficiencies, and introduce new products and services. These programs, as well as other continuous improvement actions, including ongoing product price reviews, benefited the Company's performance and operating profit margins in the first quarter of 2006. The improvement in operating margin in the first quarter of 2006 was achieved without any overall increase in demand for lighting fixtures in the non-residential construction market, particularly for commercial offices and industrial buildings.
 
For the full year of fiscal 2006, we are optimistic about the prospects for unit volume growth of lighting fixtures, as leading indicators suggest the potential for
more robust demand in the non-residential construction market, primarily in the second half of our fiscal 2006. However, we expect the second quarter of fiscal 2006, historically the Company's weakest, to be challenging due to normal seasonality and the unpredictability of the buying patterns of certain customers as they may seek to reduce inventory levels as they approach the end of their fiscal year. We remain confident that for fiscal 2006, the Company will make meaningful progress towards the achievement of its longer-term financial goals including growing earnings per share in excess of 15% per annum."

As previously announced, the Company will host a conference call to discuss first quarter results today at 4:00 p.m. ET. Interested parties may listen to this call live today or hear a replay at the Company's Web site: www.acuitybrands.com.
 
The Company will hold its annual shareholders meeting on January 12, 2006, as well as its quarterly meeting of the Board of Directors.

ATLANTA  April 5, 2006  Acuity Brands, Inc. (NYSE: AYI) announced today that net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2006 increased $44.5 million, or 8.8%, to $549.6 million from $505.1 million reported in the prior year. Net income for the second quarter ended February 28, 2006 was $14.5 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, compared with a net loss of $8.4 million, or $0.20 loss per diluted share, reported in the year-ago period. Reported earnings per share of $0.32 for the current quarter included an additional pretax expense of approximately $3.3 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, for certain share-based incentive plans, that were impacted by the 27% appreciation in the Company's stock price in the second quarter, and the adoption of SFAS123(R), an accounting standard related to share-based payments. The year-ago period included a charge of $0.26 per share related to efforts to streamline the organization.
Net sales for the first half of fiscal 2006 were $1,115.4 million compared with $1,030.3 million in 2005, an increase of 8.3%. Net income for the six months ended February 28, 2006 was $36.5 million, or $0.80 per diluted share, compared with $4.7 million, or $0.11 per diluted share in the year-ago period.
Please see the Company's Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission today for more information on the results for the second quarter of fiscal 2006. You may access the 10-Q through the Company's website at .
www.acuitybrands.com
Vernon J. Nagel, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Acuity Brands, said, "We continue to be very pleased with our results for fiscal 2006. In the second
 
quarter we achieved meaningful increases in net sales, operating profit, and earnings per share, all of which exceeded our internal expectations and represented a dramatic turnaround from the results reported one year ago. Our results reflect the benefits from our previously communicated programs to enhance customer service to the non-residential construction market, streamline operations, improve manufacturing and transactional efficiencies, and introduce new products and services. Our continued progress in these areas, as well as improvements in our financial performance, reflects the commitment to excellence and the effective execution of our plans by our 10,000 associates worldwide.
"Our net sales growth in the quarter was very positive, particularly in our lighting business. This growth was due to continued increases in selling prices, greater market presence in certain key channels, new product introductions, improved service, and a slight benefit from improvement in the non-residential construction market. In our specialty chemical business, net sales benefited from our ability to raise prices in a difficult economic environment, which helped offset rising raw material costs, and growth in unit sales in certain key geographies. Overall unit volume in the specialty chemical business declined modestly in the quarter due to the impact of higher selling prices, soft economic conditions in the Midwest, and reduced shipments in the retail channel due to contraction of inventory by certain retail customers. Fortunately, both business segments have been successful in closing the gap created last year when increases in material costs outpaced our ability to raise prices.
"Further, we are also seeing early signs of a recovery from a prolonged, multi-year decline in the non-residential construction market, including leading indicators that suggest the potential for more robust demand. Our incoming order rates are improving on a year-over-year basis, particularly for new products. Therefore, we continue to be optimistic about the prospects for industry-wide unit volume growth of lighting fixtures in the second half of our fiscal 2006 and beyond. We expect unit volume at our lighting business to track overall growth trends in the non-residential construction market. In addition, we expect the second half of our fiscal year to benefit from the traditional seasonal increase in demand as compared with the first half of fiscal 2006. Lastly, we expect profitability and margins in the remainder of the fiscal year to benefit from favorable pricing actions implemented over the previous twelve months, though we remain cautious due to the potential for rising raw material and component costs.
 
"Our financial performance in the first half of fiscal 2006 provides a very solid platform for sustained results for the remainder of 2006 and beyond. We remain confident that the Company will continue its progress towards the achievement of its longer-term financial goals of operating margin expansion, earnings growth, and cash flow generation. As previously announced, we are pleased that the Company's Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to two million additional shares of the Company's outstanding common stock as we believe this represents an effective use of our cash flow to generate shareholder value."

Acuity Brands, Inc.
(404) 853-1423
ATLANTA, April 3, 2006  The Board of Directors of Acuity Brands, Inc. (NYSE: AYI) has declared a quarterly dividend of 15 cents per share. The dividend is payable on May 1, 2006 to stockholders of record on April 14, 2006.
In addition, the Board of Directors of Acuity Brands has authorized the repurchase of an additional 2,000,000 shares, or approximately 4.5%, of the Company's outstanding common stock. Under the share repurchase program, the Company expects to acquire shares primarily through open market transactions, subject to market conditions and other factors. The Company may enter into Rule 10b5-1 plans to facilitate open market repurchases under the program. A Rule 10b5-1 plan would generally permit the Company to repurchase shares at times when it might otherwise be prevented from doing so under certain securities laws provided the plan is adopted when the Company is not in possession of material non-public information. Shares repurchased under the program may be retired or used for general corporate purposes, which may include the Company's share-based compensation and employee benefit plans.
During the month of February 2006, the Company completed the buyback of 2,000,000 shares as authorized by the stock repurchase program announced in October 2005. The reduction in outstanding shares resulting from the repurchases was largely offset by shares issued for stock options exercised during the first half of the Company's fiscal year 2006.
 
Vernon J. Nagel, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Acuity Brands, said, "The Board's approval of the share repurchase program is a reflection of our confidence in the Company's future and its ability to continue to generate strong cash flow from operations. We believe that a share repurchase program represents a wise use of our cash flow, also allowing us to offset dilution resulting from our stock-based compensation and benefit programs. We believe that the repurchase program supports Acuity Brands' objective to maximize long-term stockholder value, while continuing to fund investments to better serve our customers, to grow our businesses, and to improve our operating and financial performance."
Acuity Brands, Inc., with fiscal year 2005 net sales of approximately $2.2 billion, is comprised of Acuity Brands Lighting and Acuity Specialty Products. Acuity Brands Lighting is one of the world's leading providers of lighting fixtures and includes brands such as Lithonia Lighting, Holophane, Peerless, Hydrel, American Electric Lighting, and Gotham. Acuity Specialty Products is a leading provider of specialty chemicals and includes brands such as Zep, Zep Commercial, Enforcer, and Selig.

THIS AMENDED AND RESTATED CHANGE IN CONTROL AGREEMENT, made as of this 21st day of April, 2006, by and between Acuity Brands, Inc. (the "Company") and _____________ (the "Executive").
WHEREAS, Executive is a key executive employee of the Company; and
WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") recognizes that the possibility of a Change in Control (as hereinafter defined) exists and that the threat of or the occurrence of a Change in Control can result in significant distractions of its key executive personnel because of the uncertainties inherent in such a situation;
WHEREAS, the Board has determined that it is essential and in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders to retain the services of the Executive in the event of a threat or occurrence of a Change in Control and to ensure his continued dedication and efforts in such event without undue concern for his personal financial and employment security; and
WHEREAS, Executive has previously entered into a Severance Protection Agreement, dated as of                                      (the "Prior Agreement"), with the Company providing the Executive with certain compensation and benefits in the event his employment is terminated in connection with a Change in Control; and
WHEREAS, in order to continue to induce the Executive to provide services to the Company, particularly in the event of a threat or the occurrence of a Change in Control, the Company desires to enter into this Amended and Restated Change in Control Agreement (the "Agreement") with the Executive to provide the Executive with certain benefits in the event his employment is terminated as a result of, or in connection with, a Change in Control and to provide the Executive with the Gross-Up Payment (as hereinafter defined) and certain other benefits whether or not the Executive's employment is terminated.
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the respective agreements of the parties contained herein, it is agreed as follows:
 
(a) Unless earlier terminated as hereinafter provided, this Agreement shall commence on the date hereof and shall be for a rolling, two-year term (the "Term") and shall be deemed to extend automatically, without further action by either the Company or Executive, each day for an additional day, such that the
 
remaining term of the Agreement shall continue to be two years; provided, however, that either party may, by written notice to the other, cause this Agreement to cease to extend automatically and, upon such notice, the "Term" of this Agreement shall be the two-year period following the date of such notice and this Agreement shall terminate upon the expiration of such Term. This Agreement shall not be considered an employment agreement and in no way guarantees Executive the right to continue in the employment of the Company or its affiliates. Executive's employment is considered employment at will, subject to Executive's right to receive payments and benefits upon certain terminations of employment as provided below.
(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, (1) the term of this Agreement shall not expire during a Threatened Change in Control Period or prior to the expiration of two (2) years after the occurrence of a Change in Control, and (2) prior to a Change in Control and other than during a Threatened Change in Control Period, the term of this Agreement shall expire on the date the Executive terminates employment (except in circumstances that entitle the Executive to compensation and benefits hereunder), unless such termination was at the request of a Third Party or otherwise occurred in connection with, or in anticipation of, a Change in Control.
(c) Each place in this Agreement where a reference to the "Company" appears that relates to the Executive's employment, termination of employment or performing services, including the definitions of "Cause" and "Good Reason", such reference shall mean and include any subsidiary of the Company which is the primary employer of the Executive. Further, in each place where this Agreement refers to a benefit plan or program, payment of compensation, compensation arrangement or other similar plan or program maintained by the Company, such reference shall include any plan, program or arrangement maintained or established by a subsidiary of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the references in the definitions of "Change in Control," "Threatened Change in Control Period" and similar references to changes in ownership and control of the Company shall mean and refer to Acuity Brands, Inc., a Delaware corporation.
(d) As of the date hereof, this Agreement is intended to, and shall, supersede and replace in its entirety the compensation and benefits provided under Executive's Prior Agreement.
 
2.1 . For purposes of this Agreement, a termination for "Cause" is a termination evidenced by a resolution adopted in good faith by two-thirds of the Board that the Executive (a) intentionally and continually failed to substantially perform his duties with the Company (other than a failure resulting from the Executive's incapacity due to physical or mental illness) which failure continued for a period of at least thirty (30) days after a written notice of demand for substantial performance has been delivered to the Executive specifying the manner in which the
Cause
 
Executive has failed to substantially perform, or (b) intentionally engaged in conduct which is demonstrably and materially injurious to the Company, monetarily or otherwise; , , that no termination of the Executive's employment shall be for Cause as set forth in clause (b) above until (x) there shall have been delivered to the Executive a copy of a written notice setting forth that the Executive was guilty of the conduct set forth in clause (b) and specifying the particulars thereof in detail, and (y) the Executive shall have been provided an opportunity to be heard by the Board (with the assistance of the Executive's counsel if the Executive so desires). No act, nor failure to act, on the Executive's part, shall be considered "intentional" unless he has acted, or failed to act, with an absence of good faith and without a reasonable belief that his action or failure to act was in the best interest of the Company. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, no failure to perform by the Executive after a Notice of Termination is given by the Executive shall constitute Cause for purposes of this Agreement.
provided
however
 
(a) The acquisition (other than from the Company in an acquisition that is approved by the Incumbent Board) by any "Person" (as the term person is used for purposes of Sections 13(d) or 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act"), of beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the 1934 Act) of twenty percent (20%) or more of the combined voting power of the Company's then outstanding voting securities; or
(b) The individuals who, as of the day and year first written above, are members of the Board (the "Incumbent Board"), cease for any reason to constitute at least two-thirds of the Board; , , that if the election, or nomination for election by the Company's stockholders, of any new director was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the Incumbent Board, such new director shall, for purposes of this Agreement, be considered as a member of the Incumbent Board; or
provided
however

(d) a complete liquidation or dissolution of the Company or the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company.

3.1 If, during the term of this Agreement, the Executive's employment with the Company shall be terminated coincident with or within two (2) years following the occurrence of a Change in Control, the Executive shall be entitled to the following compensation and benefits depending upon the circumstances of such termination (in addition to any compensation and benefits provided for under any of the Company's employee benefit plans, policies and practices):
(a) If the Executive's employment with the Company shall be terminated during such 2-year period (1) by the Company for Cause or Disability, (2) by reason of the Executive's death, or (3) by the Executive other than for Good Reason (as each term is defined herein), the Company shall pay the Executive all amounts earned or accrued through the Termination Date but not paid as of the Termination Date, including (i) base salary, (ii) reimbursement for reasonable and necessary expenses incurred by the Executive on behalf of the Company during the period ending on the Termination Date, (iii) vacation pay, and (iv) sick leave (collectively, "Accrued Compensation"). In addition to the foregoing, if the Executive's employment is terminated by the Company for Disability or by reason of the Executive's death, the Company shall pay to the Executive or his beneficiaries an amount equal to the "Pro Rata Bonus" (as hereinafter defined). The "Pro Rata Bonus" is an amount equal to the Bonus Amount (as hereinafter defined) multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in such fiscal year through the Termination Date and the denominator of which is 365. The term "Bonus Amount" shall mean the greatest of the following: (x) most recent annual bonus paid or payable to the Executive, or (y) the annual bonus payable for the fiscal year during which the Termination Date occurs, or, if greater, for the fiscal year during which a Change in Control occurred or (z) average of the annual bonuses paid or payable during the three full fiscal years ended prior to the Termination Date or, if greater, the
 
three full fiscal years ended prior to the Change in Control (or, in each case, such lesser period for which annual bonuses were paid or payable to the Executive). Executive's entitlement to any other compensation or benefits shall be determined in accordance with the Company's employee benefit plans and other applicable programs and practices then in effect.
(b) If the Executive's employment with the Company shall be terminated (other than by reason of death) during such 2-year period, (1) by the Company other than for Cause or Disability, or (2) by the Executive for Good Reason, the Executive shall be entitled to the following:
(i) the Company shall pay the Executive all Accrued Compensation and a Pro-Rata Bonus;
(ii) the Company shall pay the Executive as severance pay and in lieu of any further compensation for periods subsequent to the Termination Date, in a single payment an amount (the "Severance Amount") in cash equal to ________ times the sum of (A) the greater of the Executive's base salary in effect on the Termination Date or at any time during the 90-day period prior to the Change in Control ("Base Salary") and (B) the Bonus Amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Executive has attained at least age 62 on the Termination Date the Severance Amount to be paid under this Subsection (ii) shall be the amount described in the preceding sentence multiplied by a fraction (which in no event shall be less than one-half) the numerator of which shall be the number of months (for this purpose any partial month shall be considered as a whole month) remaining until the Executive's 65th birthday (but in no event shall be less than __ ) and the denominator of which shall be ___;
(iii) for a number of months equal to the lesser of (A) ____ or (B) the number of months remaining until the Executive's 65th birthday (the "Continuation Period"), the Company shall at its expense continue on behalf of the Executive and his dependents and beneficiaries as if Executive remained actively employed, the life insurance, disability, and healthcare (including dental and vision, if applicable) benefits provided (x) to the Executive at the time the Notice of Termination is given, at any time during the 90-day period prior to the Change in Control or at any time thereafter, or (y) to other similarly situated executives who continue in the employ of the Company during the Continuation Period. The coverage and benefits (including deductibles and costs) provided in this Section 3.1(b) (iii) during the Continuation Period shall be no less favorable to the Executive and his dependents and beneficiaries, than the most favorable of such coverages and benefits during any of the periods referred to in clauses (x) and (y) above. Any costs Executive was paying for such coverages at the time of termination shall be paid by Executive by separate check to the Company each month in advance. If the terms of the life insurance or disability plan referred to in this subsection (iii), or the laws applicable to such plan, do not permit continued participation by Executive as
 
required by this subsection, then the Company will arrange for other coverages satisfactory to Executive at the Company's expense providing substantially identical benefits or, at the Executive's election, the Company will pay Executive a lump sum amount equal to the costs to Executive for the coverage (or coverages) for the full Continuation Period within five (5) days after the Executive's Termination Date. If the terms of the healthcare plan referred to in this subsection (iii) do not permit continued participation by Executive as required by this subsection or if the healthcare benefits to be provided to Executive and his dependents pursuant to this subsection (iii) cannot be provided in a manner such that the benefit payments will be tax-free to Executive and his dependents, then the Company shall (A) pay to Executive within five (5) days after Executive's Termination Date a lump sum amount equal to the monthly rate for COBRA coverage at the date of Executive's termination under the healthcare plan that is then being paid by former active employees for the level of coverage that applies to Executive and his dependents, minus the amount active employees are then paying for such coverage, multiplied by the number of months in the Continuation Period (plus a tax gross-up on the lump sum amount determined under this subsection (iii)(A)), and (B) permit Executive and his dependents to elect to participate in the healthcare plan for the Continuation Period upon payment of the applicable rate for COBRA coverage during the Continuation Period.
The Company's obligation hereunder with respect to the foregoing benefits shall be limited to the extent that the Executive obtains any such benefits pursuant to a subsequent employer's benefit plans, in which case the Company may reduce the coverage of any benefits it is required to provide the Executive hereunder as long as the aggregate coverages and benefits of the combined benefit plans is no less favorable to the Executive than the coverages and benefits required to be provided hereunder. This Subsection (iii) shall not be interpreted so as to limit any benefits to which the Executive or his dependents may be entitled under any of the Company's employee benefit plans, programs or practices following the Executive's termination of employment, including without limitation, retiree medical and life insurance benefits;
In the event the Executive receives healthcare benefits coverage for the full length of the Continuation Period pursuant to the provisions of this subsection (iii), the Executive and his dependents shall continue to be eligible to elect to receive heathcare benefits coverage for up to an additional sixty (60) months ("Extended Continuation Period"), provided however, that no benefits will be provided (i) if healthcare benefits coverage is available to the Executive through another employer during the Extended Continuation Period, or (ii) after the covered individual reaches age 65. The healthcare benefits coverage during the Extended Continuation Period shall be substantially similar to the healthcare benefits coverage Executive received during the Continuation Period. The costs to the Executive for the healthcare benefits coverage during the Extended Continuation Period shall be the
 
same as the COBRA costs paid by terminating employees during the same time period as the Extended Continuation Period.
(iv) the Company shall pay in a single payment an amount in cash equal to the excess of (A) the Supplemental Retirement Benefit (as defined below) had (x) the Executive remained employed by the Company for an additional ____________ complete years of Credited Service (or until his 65th birthday if earlier), (y) his annual compensation during each year of such period been equal to his Base Salary and the Bonus Amount, and (z) he had been fully (100%) vested in his benefit under each retirement plan in which the Executive was a participant, over (B) the lump sum actuarial equivalent of the aggregate retirement benefit the Executive is actually entitled to receive under such retirement plans. For purposes of this Subsection (iv), the "Supplemental Retirement Benefit" shall mean the lump sum actuarial equivalent of the aggregate retirement benefit the Executive would have been entitled to receive under the Company's supplemental executive retirement plans including, but not limited to, the Acuity Brands, Inc. 2002 Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan ("SERP"), , , if the Executive has attained at least age 50 and has at least 3 years of Credited Service (including the additional years credited under this subsection (iv)) as of the Termination Date the calculation of the Supplemental Retirement Benefit shall be made pursuant to the Early Retirement provisions under the SERP, without regard to the Executive's attained age or years of Credited Service. For purposes of this Subsection (iv), the "actuarial equivalent" shall be determined in accordance with the actuarial assumptions used for the calculation of benefits under the SERP as applied prior to the Termination Date in accordance with such plan's past practices;
provided
however
(v) the Company shall pay in a single payment an amount in cash equal to the amount the Executive would have received if he remained employed for an additional ________ years (or until his 65th birthday, if earlier), his annual compensation during such period had been equal to his Base Salary and the Bonus Amount and the Company had continued to make employer contributions or credits on Executive's behalf to each defined contribution plan in which Executive was a participant at the Termination Date including, without limitation, the Acuity Brands, Inc. 401(k) Plan (assuming Executive participated in such plan at the maximum permissible contribution level) and the Acuity Brands, Inc. Supplemental Deferred Savings Plan ("SDSP"). For purposes of the SDSP, the Executive shall be credited with the contribution to the Supplemental Subaccount (but not the Matching Subaccount), the Make-Up Contribution Credit and the SERP Make-Up Contribution Credit for such ________ -year period (to the extent Executive is eligible for each such contribution), provided that the requirements of the SDSP that the Executive have a Year of Service for each year and be employed on the last day of the year shall not apply to the eligibility to receive such contributions; and
(vi) (A) the restrictions on any outstanding incentive awards (including restricted stock, restricted stock units and granted Performance
 
Shares) granted to the Executive under the Long-Term Incentive Plan or under any other incentive plan or arrangement shall lapse and such incentive awards shall become one hundred percent (100%) vested, all stock options and stock appreciation rights granted to the Executive shall become immediately exercisable and shall become 100% vested, and all Performance Units granted to the Executive shall become 100% vested and (B) the Executive shall have the right to require the Company to purchase, for cash, any shares of unrestricted stock or shares purchased upon exercise of any options, at a price equal to the fair market value of such shares on the date of purchase by the Company.
(c) The amounts provided for in Sections 3.1(a) and 3.1(b)(i), (ii), (iv), (v) and (vi) shall be paid within five (5) days after the Executive's Termination Date.
(d) The Executive shall not be required to mitigate the amount of any payment provided for in this Agreement by seeking other employment or otherwise and no such payment shall be offset or reduced by the amount of any compensation or benefits provided to the Executive in any subsequent employment except as provided in Section 3.1(b)(iii).
3.2 If, as a result of Executive's termination of employment, Executive becomes entitled to compensation and benefits under this Agreement and under the Severance Agreement, dated as of January 20, 2004, ("Severance Agreement"), between Executive and the Company (or any successor agreement to such Severance Agreement), Executive shall be entitled to receive benefits under whichever agreement provides Executive the greater aggregate compensation and benefits (and not under the other agreement) and there shall be no duplication of benefits. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, the severance pay and benefits provided for in Sections 3.1(a) and 3.1(b) shall be in lieu of any other severance pay or benefits to which the Executive may be entitled under any Company severance plan, program or arrangement for a termination of employment covered by such circumstances.
3.3 To the extent applicable, this Agreement shall at all times be operated in accordance with the requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended and the regulations and rulings thereunder ("Section 409A"), including any applicable transition rules.

4. . During a Threatened Change in Control Period and following a Change in Control, any purported termination by the Company or by the Executive shall be communicated by written Notice of Termination to the other. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Notice of Termination" shall mean a notice which indicates the specific termination provision in this Agreement relied upon and shall set forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances claimed to provide a basis for termination of the Executive's employment under the provision so indicated. For purposes of this Agreement, no such purported termination shall be effective without such Notice of Termination.
Notice of Termination
5. . "Termination Date" shall mean in the case of the Executive's death, his date of death, and in all other cases, the date specified in the Notice of Termination subject to the following:
Termination Date
(a) If the Executive's employment is terminated by the Company for Cause or due to Disability, the date specified in the Notice of Termination shall be at least thirty (30) days from the date the Notice of Termination is given to the Executive, provided that in the case of Disability the Executive shall not have returned to the full-time performance of his duties during such period of at least 30 days; and
(b) If the Executive's employment is terminated for Good Reason, the date specified in the Notice of Termination shall not be more than sixty (60) days from the date the Notice of Termination is given to the Company.
 
(a) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary and without regard to whether the Executive's employment with the Company has terminated, in the event that any payment or benefit (within the meaning of Section 280G(b) (2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), to the Executive or for his benefit, whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise in connection with, or arising out of, his employment with the Company or a change in ownership or effective control of the Company or of a substantial portion of its assets (a "Payment" or "Payments"), would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or any interest or penalties are incurred by the Executive with respect to such excise tax (such excise tax, together with any such interest and penalties, are hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Excise Tax"), then the Executive shall be entitled to receive an additional payment (a "Gross-Up Payment") in an amount such that after payment by the Executive of all taxes (including any interest or penalties imposed with respect to such taxes and the Excise Tax), including any Excise Tax, imposed upon the Gross-Up Payment, the Executive retains an amount of the Gross-Up Payment equal to the Excise Tax imposed upon the
 
Payments; provided, however, if the Executive's Payments do not exceed 105% of the largest amount that would result in no portion of the Payments being subject to the Excise Tax (the "Safe Harbor Amount"), then this subsection (a) shall not apply and the Payments shall be reduced so that the amount of the Payments shall be equal to the Safe Harbor Amount, provided, further, that the Executive shall elect which non-cash or cash Payments shall be reduced so that the Payments equal the Safe Harbor Amount.
(b) An initial determination as to whether a Gross-Up Payment is required pursuant to this Section 6 and the amount of such Gross-Up Payment shall be made by an accounting firm selected by the Company and reasonably acceptable to the Executive which is designated one of the four largest accounting firms in the United States (the "Accounting Firm"). The Accounting Firm shall provide its determination (the "Determination"), together with detailed supporting calculations and documentation to the Company and the Executive within five days of the Termination Date if applicable, or such other time as requested by the Company or by the Executive (provided the Executive reasonably believes that any of the Payments may be subject to the Excise Tax) and if the Accounting Firm determines that no Excise Tax is payable by the Executive with respect to a Payment or Payments, it shall furnish the Executive with a substantial authority opinion reasonably acceptable to the Executive that no Excise Tax will be imposed with respect to any such Payment or Payments. Within fifteen (15) days of the delivery of the Determination to the Executive, the Executive shall have the right to dispute the Determination (the "Dispute) and in the event of such Dispute, the Executive and the Company shall in good faith discuss a resolution of the Dispute. The Gross-Up Payment, if any, as determined pursuant to this Section 6(b) shall be paid by the Company to the Executive within fifteen (15) days of the receipt of the Accounting Firm's determination or, subject to Executive's approval, all or a portion of the Gross-Up Payment may be paid directly to the appropriate tax authorities. The existence of the Dispute (and any discussions to resolve the Dispute) shall not in any way affect the right of the Executive to receive the Gross-Up Payment in accordance with the Determination. If there is no Dispute, the Determination shall be binding, final and conclusive upon the Company and the Executive subject to the application of Section 6(c).
(c) As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Sections 4999 and 280G of the Code, it is possible that a Gross-Up Payment (or a portion thereof) will be paid which should not have been paid (an "Excess Payment") or a Gross-Up Payment (or a portion thereof) which should have been paid will not have been paid (an "Underpayment"). An Underpayment shall be deemed to have occurred (1) upon notice (formal or informal) to the Executive from any governmental taxing authority that the tax liability of the Executive (whether in respect of the then current taxable year of the Executive or in respect of any prior taxable year of the Executive) may be increased by reason of the imposition of the Excise Tax on a Payment or Payments with respect to which the Company has failed to make a sufficient Gross-Up
 
Payment, (2) upon a determination by a court imposing the Excise Tax on a Payment or Payments with respect to which the Company has failed to make a sufficient Gross-Up Payment, (3) by reason of a determination by the Company (which shall include the position taken by the Company, or together with its consolidated group, on its federal income tax return) or (4) upon the resolution to the satisfaction of the Executive of the Dispute. If an Underpayment occurs, the Executive shall promptly notify the Company and the Company shall pay to the Executive at least fifteen (15) days prior to the date on which the applicable government taxing authority has requested payment, an additional Gross-Up Payment equal to the amount of the Underpayment plus any interest and penalties (other than interest and penalties imposed by reason of a failure to file timely a tax return or pay taxes shown due on a return) imposed on the Underpayment. An Excess Payment shall be deemed to have occurred upon a "Final Determination" (as hereinafter defined) that the Excise Tax shall not be imposed upon a Payment or Payments with respect to which the Executive had previously received a Gross-Up Payment. A Final Determination shall be deemed to have occurred when the Executive has received from the applicable government taxing authority a refund of taxes or other reduction in his tax liability by reason of the Excess Payment and upon either (i) the date a determination is made by, or an agreement is entered into with, the applicable governmental taxable authority which finally and conclusively binds the Executive and such taxing authority, or in the event that a claim is brought before a court of competent jurisdiction, the date upon which a final determination has been made by such court and either all appeals have been taken and finally resolved or the time for all appeals has expired or (ii) the statute of limitations with respect to the Executive's applicable tax return has expired. If an Excess Payment is determined to have been made, the amount of the Excess Payment shall be treated as a loan by the Company to the Executive and the Executive shall pay to the Company within 15 days following demand (but not less than 30 days after the determination of such Excess Payment) the amount of the Excess Payment plus interest at an annual rate equal to the rate provided for in Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code from the date the Gross-Up Payment (to which the Excess Payment relates) was paid to the Executive until the date of repayment to the Company.
Executive shall promptly notify the Company in writing of any written communication with any governmental taxing authority relating to the Excise Tax. The Company shall be entitled, at its sole cost and expense, to contest the imposition of the Excise Tax on Executive's behalf (including filing a claim for refund of the Excise Tax) and Executive shall cooperate with the Company in good faith in connection with any such contest or proceeding. The Company's election to contest the Excise Tax shall not affect its obligation to pay to Executive or on his behalf an additional Gross-Up Payment with respect to an Underpayment pursuant to this subsection (c). Any refund of taxes or other reduction in Executive's tax liability arising from any such contest by the Company shall be treated as an Excess Payment under this subsection (c).
 
(d) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event that, according to the Determination, an Excise Tax will be imposed on any Payment or Payments, the Company shall pay to the applicable government taxing authorities as Excise Tax withholding, the amount of the Excise Tax that the Company has actually withheld from the Payment or Payments.
(e) The Executive and the Company shall each provide the Accounting Firm access to and copies of any books, records and documents in the possession of the Company or the Executive, as the case may be, reasonably requested by the Accounting Firm, and otherwise cooperate with the Accounting Firm in connection with the preparation and issuance of the Determination contemplated by subsection (b) hereof.
(f) The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm for its services in connection with the Determination and the calculations contemplated by this Section 6 shall be paid by the Company.
7. . During the period that the Executive is actively employed by the Company or Business Unit and for a period of six (6) months after Executive's termination of employment, the Executive shall not make any Unauthorized Disclosure. For purposes of this Agreement, "Unauthorized Disclosure" shall mean disclosure by the Executive without the consent of the Board (other than pursuant to a court order) to any person, other than an employee or director of the Company or a person to whom disclosure is reasonably necessary or appropriate in connection with the performance by the Executive of his duties as an executive of the Company or as may be legally required, of any material Confidential Information obtained by the Executive while in the employ of the Company (including any material Confidential Information with respect to any of the Company's customers or methods of distribution) the disclosure of which is demonstrably and materially injurious to the Company; provided, however, that such term shall not include the use or disclosure by the Executive, without consent, of any information known generally to the public (other than as a result of disclosure by him in violation of this Section 7) or any information not otherwise considered confidential and material by a reasonable person engaged in the same business as that conducted by the Company; provided further, however, that any breach of this Section 7 shall in no event subject the Executive to damages (including costs, fees and expenses incurred by the Company or the Business Unit) in excess of $10,000 in the aggregate.
Unauthorized Disclosure
8. . During the period that the Executive is actively employed by the Company or Business Unit, the Executive shall not directly or indirectly, own, manage, operate, control, consult with, or be connected as an officer, employee, agent, partner, director or consultant with, or have any financial interest in, or assist anyone in the conduct of, any business which directly competes with the businesses of the Company in the State of Georgia.

Failure of the Company to obtain such assumption and agreement prior to the effectiveness of any such succession shall be a breach of this Agreement and shall entitle the Executive to compensation from the Company in the same amount and on the same terms as the Executive would be entitled to hereunder if the Executive were to terminate the Executive's employment for Good Reason, except that, for purposes of implementing the foregoing, the date on which any such succession becomes effective shall be deemed the Date of Termination. The term "the Company" as used herein shall include such successors and assigns. The term "successors and assigns" as used herein shall mean a corporation or other entity acquiring all or substantially all the assets and business of the Company (including this Agreement) whether by operation of law or otherwise.
(b) Neither this Agreement nor any right or interest hereunder shall be assignable or transferable by the Executive, his beneficiaries or legal representatives, except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution.

10. .

If Executive's employment is involuntarily terminated by the Company during the term of this Agreement without Cause (and such termination does not arise as a result of Executive's death or Disability), or if Executive terminates his employment for Good Reason, the Executive shall be entitled to the compensation and benefits described below, provided that Executive, as described in Section 4.7, executes a valid release of claims in such form as may be required by the Company.

The bonus amount determined pursuant to Section 4.2(i) shall be paid to Executive within ten (10) days of Executive's Date of Termination and any additional amount payable pursuant to Section 4.2(ii) shall be payable at the same time as bonuses are payable to other executive under the Incentive Plan.

The Vested Value (as defined in the Restricted Stock Agreement) of the shares of Restricted Stock vesting pursuant to this Section 4.3 shall be delivered to Executive in the manner provided in Section 2.2 of the Restricted Stock Agreement within ten (10) days of Executive's Date of Termination, using Executive's Date of Termination as the date for determining the Vested Value.

Any additional coverages Executive had at termination, including dependent coverage, will also be continued for such period on the same terms, to the extent permitted by the applicable policies or contracts. Any costs Executive was paying for such coverages at the time of termination shall be paid by Executive by separate check payable to the Company each month in advance or, at Executive's election, may be deducted from his Base Salary payments under Section 4.1. If the terms of
Health Care and Life Insurance
 
any benefit plan referred to in this Section, or the laws applicable to such plan do not permit continued participation by Executive, then the Company will arrange for other coverage(s) satisfactory to Executive at Company's expense which provides substantially similar benefits or, at Executive's election, will pay Executive a lump sum amount equal to the annual costs of such coverage(s) for the Severance Period. A benefit provided under this Section 4.4 shall cease if Executive obtains other employment and, as a result of such employment, health care or life insurance benefits are available to Executive.

Except as expressly provided herein, for all other plans sponsored by the Company, the Executive's employment shall be treated as terminated on his Date of Termination and Executive's right to benefits shall be determined under the terms of such plans; provided, however, in no event will Executive be entitled to severance payments or benefits under any other severance plan, policy, program or agreement of the Company, except to the extent Executive is covered by a Change in Control Agreement.
Other Benefits

Amendment No. 4 transfers to the 2005 Plan liability for amounts in the Original Savings Plan that were deferred by, or credited to, a participant or that vested or will vest, in each case, on or after January 1, 2005, and further provides that all future Company credits or participant deferrals will be made through the 2005 Plan rather than the Original Savings Plan. Amendment No. 4 also provides that, with respect to deferrals of restricted stock to the Original Savings Plan, such deferrals will be distributed in shares of Common Stock and that dividends credited on such restricted stock deferrals will be invested in an interest-bearing account and distributed in cash.

Purpose
The Acuity Brands, Inc. Nonemployee Director Deferred Compensation Plan (formerly known as the "NonEmployee Director Deferred Stock Unit Plan"; the "Plan") is intended to increase the alignment of the interests of eligible members of the Board with the interests of stockholders of Acuity Brands, Inc. (the "Corporation") by increasing their incentive to contribute to the success of the Corporation's business through permitting Eligible Directors to elect to defer their fees for investment into an interest bearing account or in Deferred Stock Units, as hereinafter defined, on the terms and conditions set forth herein. This amendment and restatement of the Plan provides for (i) the Eligible Director to elect whether mandatory and optional deferrals will be deemed to be invested in an interest bearing account or in Deferred Stock Units; (ii) amounts currently credited to the Eligible Director under the Plan (and that will be credited through December 31, 2006), an election whether such amounts will be deemed to be invested in an interest bearing account or in Deferred Stock Units, (iii) all amounts deemed to be invested in Deferred Stock Units to be distributed in shares of Stock, (i) dividends on Deferred Stock Units to be invested in an interest bearing account and paid in cash, (v) eliminating any automatic grants of Deferred Stock Units, and (vi) bringing the Plan into compliance generally with Section 409A.
The Plan was initially effective as of December 1, 2001, and was established in connection with the spin-off of the Corporation by National Service Industries, Inc., as a successor plan to the National Service Industries, Inc.

ATLANTA, October 5, 2006  Acuity Brands, Inc. (NYSE: AYI) announced today that net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 was $41.4 million, or $0.93 per diluted share, an increase of 49% and 52% in net income and earnings per share, respectively, over the year-ago period. Net income and diluted EPS in the fourth quarter of 2005 were $27.8 million and $0.61, respectively, and included a pretax charge of $6.0 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, for additional actions taken under the Company's 2005 restructuring program as well as a lower effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, which benefited the quarter by approximately $0.07 per diluted share. Net sales increased 13% to $674.5 million for the quarter ended August 31, 2006 from $597.2 million in the year-ago period.
Net income for fiscal 2006 was $106.6 million, or $2.34 per diluted share, compared with last year's net income of $52.2 million, or $1.17 per diluted share, an increase in earnings per share of 100%. Net income and earnings per share for the year ended August 31, 2005 included a $23.0 million pre-tax restructuring charge (or $0.34 per diluted share). Net sales in fiscal 2006 were $2,393.1 million compared with $2,172.9 million reported in the year-ago period, representing an increase of $220.2 million, or 10%.
 
Commentary and Outlook
Vernon J. Nagel, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Acuity Brands said, "2006 was an outstanding year for Acuity Brands. We shipped more products and earned more income in the fourth quarter and for the full year than any other respective periods in our history. This performance reflects the crisp execution of our key strategic initiatives by our more than 10,000 associates world-wide resulting in significant benefits from enhanced service to customers, the successful introduction of new and innovative products, and improved productivity. In fiscal 2006, we grew unit volume significantly at Acuity Brands Lighting and expanded consolidated margins, despite continued increases in the cost of certain raw materials, component parts, and energy-related items as well as managing through the challenges brought on by inconsistent pricing policies of certain competitors in key markets at both businesses. Additionally, we continued to manage our financial assets effectively, further reducing operating working capital as a percentage of net sales to 14.4% at the end of fiscal 2006 from 15.6% in the year-ago period.
"Looking ahead to fiscal 2007, we continue to be cautiously optimistic regarding our future financial performance. We expect that the rebound in non-residential construction, our primary market, will continue throughout 2007 and that our revenue growth will again outpace the overall rate of growth in the market due to our continued focus on service, quality, and new product introductions as well as our disciplined approach to pricing. In addition, our 2007 results should benefit from recent price increases and our on-going initiatives to improve productivity and service, but will be partially offset by certain investments we intend to make in 2007 to accelerate growth, improve mix, and enhance productivity in current and future periods, particularly at Acuity Specialty Products. We further expect cash flow from operations to remain strong, while investing between $40 million and $45 million in capital expenditures in 2007.
"While we are optimistic about our future prospects, we are not without challenges in 2007. We continue to monitor economic factors such as costs for energy, raw materials and components; the potential for a slowing U.S. economy, which could impact the pace
 
of growth in non-residential construction; the potential economic repercussions that could result from instability caused by worldwide political events; and the potential for changes in competitive pricing dynamics. In addition, we face execution risk around accomplishing our key strategic initiatives, which we are counting on to continue to fuel gains in our overall performance for key stakeholders. However, all this notwithstanding, with proper execution and the continuation of the current economic and market environment, we expect to continue to grow in our key markets by accelerating new product introductions and improving our service and quality. This, along with expected improvements in productivity, should again allow us to continue to make meaningful progress towards the achievement of our long-term financial goals that are consistent with being an upper quartile performing company."
Fourth Quarter Consolidated, Segment, and Corporate Overview
Consolidated net sales for the fourth quarter ended August 31, 2006 increased $77.3 million, or 13%, to $674.5 million from the year-ago period. The increase was due primarily to the positive impact of unit volume growth in the lighting business and price increases in both the lighting and the specialty chemical businesses. Consolidated gross profit grew approximately 21% to $280.5 million, while gross profit margins expanded 270 basis points to 41.6% of net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 from 38.9% reported in the year-ago period. The increase in gross profit and margin was due primarily to higher selling prices, the profit contribution from increased sales volume, improved productivity, and a more favorable mix of products sold, partially offset by higher costs for raw materials and components.
Consolidated operating expenses were $207.5 million, or 30.8% of net sales, in the fourth quarter of 2006 compared with $188.3 million, or 31.5% of net sales, reported in the year-ago period. The increase in operating expenses in the current quarter was due primarily to increased costs related to commissions and freight to support higher net sales as well as higher compensation expense, principally for share-based and incentive compensation programs. These higher costs were partially offset by improved productivity and the $6.0 million special charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2005 that was not repeated in the current quarter. Consolidated operating profit for the fourth
 
quarter of 2006 increased $28.8 million, or 65%, to $73.0 million from $44.2 million reported in the year-ago period due primarily to the higher gross profit noted above. Consolidated operating profit margins expanded 340 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2006 to 10.8% from 7.4% in the year-ago period due to improvements in both gross profit and operating expenses as a percentage of net sales.
Net sales at Acuity Brands Lighting (ABL) in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 were $524.3 million, a quarterly record, compared with $452.5 million reported in the year-ago period, representing an increase of $71.8 million, or 16%. Net sales at ABL increased over the prior year due primarily to greater unit volume, better pricing, and a more favorable mix of products sold. More than half of the increase in net sales was due to greater shipments in the quarter as a result of improved service and higher customer demand in the non-residential construction market. The backlog at August 31, 2006 was $176.0 million, $23.8 million greater than the prior year-end backlog, reflecting continued strong order rates. Operating profit at ABL was $65.9 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, an increase of $28.6 million, or 77%, from the year-ago period. The increase in operating profit was due primarily to the variable contribution from higher net sales noted above, improved productivity, and the special charge in 2005 that was not repeated in the current year ($3.0 million), partially offset by higher raw material and component costs and increased costs for compensation, commissions, and freight.
Net sales at Acuity Specialty Products (ASP) in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 increased $5.4 million, or 4%, to $150.1 million from $144.7 million in the year-ago period. The increase in net sales was due primarily to more favorable pricing in the domestic industrial and institutional (I&I) and retail channels and the favorable impact of foreign currency translation on international sales, partially offset by lower unit volume in the I&I business. Operating profit at ASP for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 was $15.6 million compared with $17.1 million reported in the year-ago period, a decrease of $1.5 million, or 9%. The decrease in operating profit in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 was due primarily to higher costs for raw materials and freight, lower unit volume in the I&I business, and a pre-tax charge of $0.8 million related to a product recall due to defective containers purchased from a vendor.
 
Corporate expense was $8.5 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 compared with $10.1 million in the year-ago period. The decrease was due primarily to the special charge of $2.4 million included in the prior year and not repeated in 2006, partially offset by higher costs for incentive compensation, including share-based plans. Net interest expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 decreased to $8.4 million from $8.7 million reported in the year-ago period. The consolidated income tax rate for the Company was 35.6% and 26.7% for the quarters ending August 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The lower rate in the fourth quarter of 2005 was due primarily to certain tax credits associated with the Company's Mexican operations and certain state tax benefits.
Fiscal Year Results
Consolidated net sales for the year ended August 31, 2006 increased $220.2 million, or 10%, to $2,393.1 million compared with $2,172.9 million reported in the same period a year ago. Consolidated operating profit for fiscal 2006 was $197.4 million as compared with operating profit of $106.7 million in the prior year, an increase of $90.7 million, or 85%. Operating profit for the year ended August 31, 2006 was positively impacted primarily by the variable contribution margin earned from higher sales volume, benefits from pricing actions, improved productivity and manufacturing efficiencies, as well as by the aggregate $23.0 million pre-tax restructuring charge recorded in fiscal 2005 not repeated in 2006. These benefits were partially offset by escalating raw material and component costs and higher compensation costs, including share-based plans. The Company's effective tax rate in 2006 was 34.9% and is expected to approximate 35% in 2007.
Additionally, the Company generated $155.9 million in cash flow from operations for the year ended August 31, 2006 as compared with $137.1 million generated in the year-ago period, an increase of $18.8 million, or 14%. Total debt at August 31, 2006 was $371.9 million, essentially flat from a year ago because of its fixed, long-term nature, while cash on hand declined to $88.6 million from $98.5 million at the end of August 2005 due primarily to 2006 stock repurchases of $194.9 million, partially offset by stock issuances of $61.5 million due primarily to stock option exercises. As of August 31, 2006, the Company repurchased five million shares of its common stock outstanding for a net
 
reduction, after option exercises, of two million shares. Stockholders' equity remained essentially flat at $542.3 million due primarily to higher net income and a lower minimum pension liability, partially offset by the impact of the net stock repurchases and dividends.
The Company's certifying public accountants' audit opinion with respect to the year-end financial statements will not be dated until the Company completes the final 10-K report and evaluation of internal controls over financial reporting. Accordingly, the financial results reported in this earnings release are preliminary pending completion of the audit.

Acuity Brands, Inc.
(404) 853-1423
ATLANTA, January 4, 2007  Acuity Brands, Inc. (NYSE: AYI) announced today record first quarter results for net sales, net income, and earnings per diluted share. Net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2007 rose $48.6 million, or 8.6%, to $614.5 million from $565.9 million reported in the prior year. Net income increased 52.7% to $33.6 million for the quarter ended November 30, 2006 from $22.0 million reported in the year-ago period. Diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of fiscal 2007 increased 60.4% to $0.77 per diluted share, compared with $0.48 per diluted share in the prior year's first quarter.
Please see the Company's Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission today for more information on the results for the first quarter of fiscal 2007. The Form 10-Q is available through the Company's website at .
www.acuitybrands.com
Both business segments posted higher revenues compared with the year ago period. Net sales at Acuity Brands Lighting (ABL) advanced by 10.2% due primarily to more favorable pricing, a better mix of product sold, the impact of new product introductions, and greater customer demand in the non-residential construction market. Net sales at Acuity Specialty Products (ASP) grew by 3.2% due primarily to company-wide pricing initiatives and higher unit volume in the Industrial and Institutional (I&I) market, partially offset by lower volume in the retail channel.
Consolidated operating profit margin expanded 240 basis points in the first quarter to 9.8% compared with 7.4% in the year-ago period. The margin improvement reflected benefits from efforts to improve selling prices, on-going initiatives to enhance productivity
 
 
in both businesses, and additional profit contribution from increased volume and a better mix of product sold in the lighting business. These benefits were partially offset by lower unit sales volume in ASP's retail channel, higher costs in certain areas, including raw materials and component parts, compensation expense, and continued investments to improve productivity and customer service companywide.
Vernon J. Nagel, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Acuity Brands, said, "We are very pleased to report record first quarter results. Our strong first quarter results reflect the benefits from programs implemented to create greater value for our customers, to invest in our associates to be more customer-focused and productive, and to more effectively deploy our assets to generate greater returns for our stakeholders. We anticipate that the second quarter will once again be challenging due primarily to normal seasonal factors including inconsistent customer demand and inventory rebalancing by certain customers as well as continued cost pressures. In addition, we remain somewhat cautious about near term shipments at ABL due primarily to the decline in non-residential construction awards reported during the third quarter of calendar 2006, given the normal lag time between awards and shipments. However, based on the recent rebound in non-residential construction awards and other predictive indicators such as the Architecture Billings Index, we expect demand for lighting fixtures to resume its recovery during the course of the second half of the fiscal year, particularly in sectors where we participate to a significant degree.
"For the full year, we expect that ABL will continue to contribute a disproportionately higher share to the overall results of Acuity Brands due primarily to the success of strategies to drive profitable growth including new product introductions, enhancements to the mix of products sold, and productivity improvements as well as continued positive demand in key sectors of the non-residential construction market, the Company's largest served market. Our consolidated results will be somewhat tempered by the performance of ASP, as management expects that ASP's full year operating profit will approximate that earned in the year-ago period due primarily to market challenges caused by rising costs, weak demand in certain key markets and geographies, and the expense of investments made to drive future profitable growth. While the results at ASP in the first quarter were less than anticipated, we believe that actions taken to enhance profitability,
 
 
including programs to improve pricing, productivity and to expand unit volume will favorably impact the second half of 2007.
"Lastly, we believe that our consolidated first quarter results support our performance expectations for 2007. Therefore, we remain optimistic that for the full fiscal year 2007, and particularly in the second half, the Company will make significant progress towards the achievement of its longer-term financial goals including operating margin expansion, earnings growth, and cash flow generation."

Acuity Brands, Inc.
(404) 853-1423
ATLANTA  April 04, 2007  Acuity Brands, Inc. (NYSE: AYI) announced today record second quarter results for diluted earnings per share, net income and net sales. For the second quarter, diluted earnings per share increased 72% to $0.55 versus $0.32 reported in the year-ago period. Net income for the second quarter ended February 28, 2007 increased 68% to $24.4 million, compared with $14.5 million reported in the year-ago period, on net sales of $575.4 million, an increase of $25.8 million, or 4.7%.
Second quarter diluted earnings per share of $0.55 included a pretax charge totaling $2.3 million, or $0.07 per diluted share after reflecting a related adjustment to the tax provision, for a tentative resolution of the investigation by the United States Department of Justice of certain environmental issues at the primary manufacturing facility of Acuity Specialty Products ("ASP"). Additionally, for comparative purposes, last year's reported earnings per share of $0.32 included $2.6 million of higher pretax expense, or $0.04 per diluted share, related to certain share-based incentive programs subject to variable accounting. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006, the Company amended these incentive programs thereby eliminating variable accounting treatment and the related expense volatility caused by significant swings in the Company's stock price.
Net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2007 at Acuity Brands Lighting ("ABL") and ASP increased 4.6% and 5.0%, respectively, compared to the year-ago period. The growth in net sales was due primarily to more favorable pricing and modestly higher unit volume growth in both segments.
 
 
Consolidated operating profit margin expanded 230 basis points in the second quarter to 7.8% compared with 5.5% in the year-ago period. Operating profit margin at ABL improved 280 basis points to 10.4% while operating profit margin at ASP declined 110 basis points to 4.5%. The environmental charge negatively impacted the operating profit margin at ASP by over 170 basis points. The improvement in the consolidated operating profit margin was due primarily to more favorable pricing, incremental profit contribution on unit volume growth, and improved productivity, partially offset by higher costs for raw materials and component parts, greater commission and incentive compensation expense resulting from increased net sales and net income, and the aforementioned environmental charge.
The Company also achieved record diluted earnings per share, net income, and net sales for the first half of fiscal year 2007. Diluted earnings per share for the six months ended February 28, 2007 was $1.32, an increase of 65.0% compared to prior year's $0.80 per share. Net income for the first half of fiscal 2007 rose to $57.9 million, an increase of 58.6% versus the year-ago period while net sales climbed 6.7% to $1,189.9 million.
For the six months ending February 28, 2007, net cash flow generated from operating activities increased to $60.9 million versus $15.9 million in the year-ago period. The growth in net cash flow from operating activities was due primarily to higher net income and improved working capital management. The Company ended the second quarter with $123.1 million in cash and cash equivalents, an increase of $34.4 million since the beginning of the fiscal year. The net debt-to-capital ratio (defined as debt less cash divided by the sum of debt and equity less cash) declined to 29.6%. The Company did not repurchase any shares during the second quarter.
Please see the Company's Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission today for more information on fiscal 2007 results. You may access the 10-Q through the Company's website at .
www.acuitybrands.com
Vernon J. Nagel, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Acuity Brands said, "We are very pleased with our progress in fiscal 2007. In the second quarter, we once again produced record results that exceeded our internal expectations. Our performance on a consolidated basis continues to reflect the benefits obtained from our
 
 
pricing initiatives including ongoing product price reviews, new products and services, all-time high service levels, and enhanced productivity in key areas of our business. Both businesses reported solid sales growth during the quarter. At ABL, the growth in net sales was due primarily to higher selling prices and unit volume growth in the non-residential lighting market, partially offset by a decline in net sales to the home center channel, which primarily serves the residential and small project markets, and the impact of seasonal inventory rebalancing efforts by certain key customers. In our specialty chemical business, net sales grew primarily because of higher selling prices and greater shipments in both the retail channel and European markets.
"Excluding the environmental charge, both businesses reported increased operating profit and margins in the second quarter compared with the year-ago period. In addition to realizing benefits from our pricing initiatives to overcome higher material and operating costs, both businesses benefited from incremental margins on increased unit volume growth, partially due to the introduction of new products and enhanced services.
"With respect to the environmental charge, we concluded it was in the best interest of our customers, associates, and shareholders to accelerate the resolution of this long-time outstanding investigation at ASP through a plea agreement in order to avoid the negative impact of protracted litigation. The tentative resolution, described in the Company's 10-Q, includes a $3.8 million fine, which will not be tax-deductible. We had previously estimated and accrued a liability for the cost to resolve this matter, and the fiscal 2007 second quarter charge consists of an incremental amount necessary to cover the fine and legal and environmental consulting fees incurred in the matter during the quarter. We expect to be able to announce the final resolution of this matter shortly and it is not expected to lead to the loss of any material amount of ASP's business or any material disruption of production or significantly higher operating costs at ASP."
Mr. Nagel continued, "Looking at the remainder of the fiscal year, we remain confident that the Company will attain or exceed many of our stated longer-term financial goals of operating margin expansion, earnings growth, and cash flow generation by continuing to drive key initiatives to enhance pricing, introduce new products, and improve productivity. At ASP, we continue to expect that full-year operating profit, excluding the second quarter environmental charge, will approximate that earned in the year-ago period as productivity improvements, growth in certain markets, and higher selling prices
 
will negate the impact of rising costs, weak demand in certain geographies, and the expense of investments made to drive future profitable growth. At ABL, we continue to be cautiously optimistic about the prospects for industry-wide unit volume growth of lighting fixtures in the second half of our fiscal 2007 and beyond due to several key factors. The macro-economic environment in North America remains healthy including positive job creation, attractive long-term interest rates, and overall GDP expansion. In addition, leading indicators such as higher year-over-year new building contract awards, continued office space absorption, and positive readings from the Architectural Billings Index suggest the potential for continued positive demand in the non-residential lighting market. We believe unit volume at our lighting business will continue to be at or above the overall growth trends in the non-residential lighting market as we continue to expand our product offering and enhance our service capability. ABL's backlog at the end of the second quarter was $166 million, a 7.0 percent increase over the prior year, and incoming order rates for lighting fixtures are encouraging. Overall, we remain optimistic about our performance for the second half of 2007 in spite of continued cost and pricing pressures. Our expectations for positive performance are due primarily to anticipated positive demand in the non-residential lighting market and to our many continuous improvement efforts to enhance service to our customers, introduce new and innovative products and services, increase selling prices, and improve productivity."

Article V is hereby amended by deleting the present Article V in its entirety and substituting the following in lieu thereof:
5.1 .
Timing and Form of Payment
(a) Subject to subsection (h) below, on the Election Form, the Participant shall make an election as to the timing and form of payment for any Participant deferrals for such Plan Year and the form of payment for any Employer contribution credits for such Plan Year pursuant to Section 4.1 (such contributions are automatically credited to the Participant's Retirement Account) from among the options set forth below for the Participant's Retirement Account and for any Cash In-Service Account. Once the Participant elects a form of payment for the Retirement Account, and the time and form of payment for any Cash In-Service Account, those elections may only be changed twice and only in accordance with subsection (e) below.
(b) The Participant will be entitled to payment of his Retirement Account in accordance with his payment election if he terminates employment upon death, Disability or Retirement, or after attaining age 55 and completing five or more Years of Service. The Participant may elect that the vested amount of his Retirement Account be distributed in a lump sum, or in annual payments for a period of up to ten (10) years, provided that if the balance of the Participant's Account is less than $15,000, the Participant's Account will automatically be paid in a lump sum. For example, under the 10-year annual payment method, the first year's payment will equal one tenth (1/10) of the total Account, the second year's will equal one ninth (1/9) of the remaining Account, and so forth. Subject to subsection (h) below, payment of the Participant's Retirement Account shall be made (i) if the payment is in a lump sum, as soon as practicable after the event entitling the Participant to payment, or (ii) if the payment is in installments, commencing in the January following the event entitling the Participant to payment.
(c) The Participant may elect to have a Cash In-Service Account payable (or commence to be paid) during January of the year selected by the Participant on the Election Form (which initial payment date may not be earlier than two years after the end of the calendar year during which amounts are first credited to such Account), in a lump sum or in annual payments over a period of up to ten (10) years, in the manner provided in (a) above, as applicable; provided, that any subsequent deferrals to such designated Cash In-Service Account must be made no later than the end of the calendar year ending two years prior to such payment date; provided, further, that a Participant may only establish such number of Cash In-Service Accounts for his Account as may be permitted by the Plan Administrator (or his designee) and
 
the Plan Administrator may increase the minimum deferral period for Cash In-Service Accounts. Notwithstanding the Participant's elections under this Section 5.1(c), in the event the Participant becomes entitled to payment of his Retirement Account under subsection (b) above or to his Account under Section 5.2 below, the remaining balance of the Participant's Account shall be payable in accordance with the provisions for payment under subsection (b) or under Section 5.2 (whether or not the Cash In-Service Account was in payment status at such time).
(d) The Participant will designate each Plan Year which portion of the Participant's deferrals for such Plan Year shall be credited to the Participant's Retirement Account and any Cash In-Service Accounts he has established. If a Participant's Account is distributed in installments, the Account shall continue to be credited with deemed earnings, gains and losses in accordance with Article IV until the entire amount of the Account is distributed.
(e) A Participant may, not less than twelve (12) months prior to the payment dates of any Cash In-Service Accounts he has established under subsection (c) above, and with the approval of the Plan Administrator, elect to defer the date on which payment of any Cash In-Service Account shall commence and/or change the method of payment of such Cash In-Service Account, provided that, (i) after the initial election under subsection (c), a Participant may only make two election changes with respect to a particular Cash In-Service Account (after the second such election change, the election shall become irrevocable); (ii) except as otherwise permitted by Section 409A, the first in-service payment with respect to any such changed election must be deferred at least 5 years from the date such payment would otherwise have been made, (iii) except as otherwise permitted by Section 409A, the election shall not become effective for 12 months.
A Participant may, not less than twelve (12) months prior to the event entitling the Participant to payment of his Retirement Account under subsection (b) above, elect to change the method of payment of the Participant's Retirement Account, provided that (i) only two such changes are permitted and after the second such election change, the election is irrevocable; (ii) the payment date for the Participant's Retirement Account will be deferred for 5 years for each election change, and (iii) the election shall not become effective for 12 months.
The change of election shall be made through a method established by the Plan Administrator.
(f) Notwithstanding the Participant's payment elections under this Article V, the entire amount remaining in the Participant's Account will be paid to the Participant in a lump sum in January of the calendar year in which the Participant will attain age 80.
(g) Unless the Participant elects otherwise as provided below, the vested amounts credited to his Deferred Restricted Stock Subaccount shall automatically be paid in a single payment in January, 2008. The Participant may elect on such form as may be provided by the Plan Administrator to receive payment (i) at the same time as the initial payment of his Retirement Account (assuming the Participant qualifies under subsection (b)), or (ii) during January of the year selected by the Participant for payment of his Restricted Stock In-Service Account. If the Participant terminates employment prior to the payment date of his Restricted Stock In-Service Account or event entitling the Participant to payment under subsection (b),
 
payment of the Participant's Deferred Restricted Stock Subaccount will be made at the time of the Participant's termination of employment. All distributions from the Participant's Deferred Restricted Stock Subaccount shall be made in a lump sum. The Participant may elect to change the time of payment of his Restricted Stock In-Service Account, but such election may only be changed twice and only in accordance with the provisions of subsection (e) above.
The amounts credited to the Participant's Deferred Restricted Stock Subaccount shall be subject to the Financial Hardship distribution rules of Section 5.5. The amounts credited to the Deferred Restricted Stock Subaccount that are treated as invested in Shares shall be paid in Shares.
(h) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Article V, in the event a Participant who is a "key employee" (as determined by the Plan Administrator in accordance with procedures established by the Committee that are consistent with Section 409A) becomes entitled to payments upon Retirement or Termination of Service, payments shall not commence until 6 months after such Participant separates from service and on such date the payments that would have been made during such six-month period shall be made.
5.2 .
Payment upon Certain Terminations of Servic
e
Subject to Section 5.1(h) above, the vested amount of the Participant's Account (including any unpaid amounts in the Participant's In-Service Accounts) will be paid in a lump sum as soon as practical after the end of the month following the date on which the Participant has a Termination of Service and the elections under Section 5.1 shall not be recognized, unless the Participant has completed 5 Years of Service and attained age 55 at the time of such Termination of Service, or the Participant qualifies for Retirement or a Disability under the terms of this Plan.
5.3 .
Payment at Death
In the event a Participant dies while actively employed prior to Retirement or other Termination of Service, the entire amount of the Participant's Account will become fully vested and will be paid in accordance with the Participant's election under subsection (b). The form of payment to the Beneficiary shall be in accordance with the Participant's election on the Election Form and, in the absence of such election, payment will be made in a lump sum.
5.4 .
Payment at Disability
In the event of the Participant's Total and Permanent Disability (as defined in Section 2.38), the entire amount of the Participant's Account will become fully vested and payment will be made in accordance with the Participant's election under subsection (b). Once payment has commenced, payments will continue as elected regardless of any future change in the Participant's disability status.
 
5.5 .
Financial Hardship Distribution
Subject to approval by the Plan Administrator, the Participant may apply to withdraw, upon a showing of Financial Hardship, part or all of his vested Account. If the Plan Administrator determines that a distribution should be made on account of Financial Hardship, distribution from the Participant's Account shall be made as soon as administratively practical. Such distribution shall not exceed the dollar amount necessary to satisfy the Financial Hardship plus amounts necessary to pay taxes reasonably anticipated as a result of the distribution, after taking into account the extent to which the Financial Hardship is or may be relieved through reimbursement or compensation by insurance or otherwise or by liquidation of the Participant's assets (to the extent the liquidation of such assets would not itself cause Financial Hardship)."
Section 8.2 is hereby amended by substituting the words "three years" for the words "five years" in subsection (ii) thereof.
This Amendment No. 1 shall be effective as of June 1, 2007. Except as hereby modified, the Plan shall remain in full force and effect.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has executed this Amendment No. 1 as of the date first written above.

Acuity Brands, Inc. (NYSE: AYI) today announced that its Acuity Specialty Products Group, Inc. ("ASP") subsidiary finalized the resolution of a federal environmental investigation in a manner consistent with the tentative resolution announced on April 4, 2007. ASP entered into a plea agreement with the United States Department of Justice involving a Clean Water Act violation related to ASP's pretreatment of wastewater discharged to the City of Atlanta for treatment. The plea agreement, which was accepted today by United States District Judge Shoob, brings to an end a federal investigation into past practices at ASP's facility on Seaboard Industrial Boulevard in Atlanta, Georgia. The details of the investigation have been previously disclosed in Acuity Brands' filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
ATLANTA, June 29, 2007 
Under the plea agreement, ASP admitted to one felony count for failure to meet the requirements of its wastewater pretreatment permit. Consistent with the terms of the plea agreement, the Court today imposed a $3.8 million fine on ASP and also placed ASP on unsupervised probation for a term of three years. In addition, ASP has entered into a three-year EPA-administered compliance agreement that is incorporated into the probation requirements.
The conduct that was the subject of the plea agreement took place during or prior to 2002 and did not result in any adverse environmental impact or any regulatory
 
noncompliance by the City of Atlanta. While ASP has already resolved with the City the violation underlying the plea agreement, ASP continues to discuss with the City whether another matter raised in the investigation, involving past pumping of groundwater through ASP's pretreatment system, warrants a penalty.
Vernon J. Nagel, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Acuity Brands, stated: "Upon learning of the matters that were the subject of this federal investigation, we commenced our own comprehensive internal investigation and cooperated with the federal authorities. It is clear that the actions of certain ASP employees were wrong and simply not consistent with the way we do business. Those actions were directed by non-executive employees of ASP who are no longer with the business. We have taken extensive corrective actions to address the misconduct, including significant investments in equipment, training, personnel, and compliance audit programs. As previously announced, we accrued fully for the federal fine in prior quarters. As we have also previously disclosed, we are in the process of conducting additional soil and groundwater studies at our Seaboard Industrial Boulevard site."
Mr. Nagel concluded, "We are pleased that this wastewater matter has been resolved with the Department of Justice in a manner that will allow ASP to pursue its many opportunities going forward, including government business. We consider this resolution to be an important, positive step forward as our current management team looks to set an example of good environmental stewardship and corporate citizenship."

Dan Smith
Acuity Brands, Inc.
(404) 853-1423
ATLANTA, July 23, 2007  Acuity Brands, Inc. (NYSE: AYI) today announced that the Company's Board of Directors has unanimously authorized management to pursue a plan to separate its lighting and specialty products businesses by spinning off the business now known as Acuity Specialty Products Group, Inc. ("ASP") into an independent publicly-traded company. The spin-off will be accomplished through a tax-free distribution to Acuity Brands shareholders in the fall of 2007.
The new independent company ("Spinco"), to be formally named at a later date, will be a leading provider of cleaning and maintenance solutions in the commercial, industrial, institutional, and consumer markets and will have annual sales approaching $600 million. Acuity Brands will continue to own Acuity Brands Lighting, Inc. ("ABL"), one of the world's leading providers of lighting fixtures with annual sales of approximately $2.0 billion.
Vernon J. Nagel, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Acuity Brands, stated, "This planned spin-off will result in the creation of two businesses with leading positions in their respective markets. We believe this transaction will meaningfully enhance value for stockholders because it will enable our lighting business and our specialty products business to pursue their own distinct strategic initiatives and significant growth opportunities with a sharpened focus. For example, each company will be able to attract and allocate its own capital and to design equity-based compensation programs targeted to its own performance. We are excited
 
about the opportunities available for each company to expand its market presence both through organic growth and through acquisitions. Each company will have its own near-term strategies that will take advantage of its position in the market place, its capital structure, and its unique capabilities and opportunities. As separate companies, ABL and ASP will be better positioned to demonstrate their full potential and the market will be better able to evaluate the performance of each business."
Mr. Nagel continued, "We believe that this transaction will allow us to simplify our corporate structure at Acuity Brands, thus enabling us to achieve approximately $6 million in annual corporate cost savings on an aggregate basis as compared with total corporate expense in fiscal year 2006 of $33 million. Assuming both businesses had operated as standalone companies in 2006, we believe Spinco would have incurred approximately $12 million of corporate costs to operate as a standalone public company which includes about $3 million for stock-based incentive compensation expense. We believe Acuity Brands would have incurred the remaining $15 million in corporate costs, including approximately $11 million for stock-based incentive compensation expense. While we expect that the aggregate annual dividend paid by the two companies after the spin-off will be the same as the dividend currently paid by Acuity Brands, our investors will now have two distinct investment opportunities."
Management
Acuity Brands also announced that in anticipation of the spin-off transaction, John K. Morgan has succeeded William A. Holl as President and Chief Executive Officer of ASP. Mr. Morgan, who most recently served as President and Chief Executive Officer of ABL and at one time served as Chief Operating Officer of Acuity Brands, will serve as Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Spinco. Mr. Holl will continue with ASP and Spinco as Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer. Vernon J.
 
 
Nagel has been named President and Chief Executive Officer of ABL, effective immediately, in addition to his position as Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Acuity Brands.
"We are fortunate to have an accomplished and experienced executive such as John Morgan ready to run ASP's business as a separate public company," continued Mr. Nagel. "In John's 30 years with Acuity Brands and its predecessors and affiliates, he has demonstrated the ability to develop and execute strategy to achieve results. Personally, I look forward to leading the lighting business and working more directly with the outstanding team he assembled at ABL."
Mr. Nagel concluded, "We are grateful for the fine job that Bill Holl performed as President and Chief Executive Officer at ASP over the past year. He stepped in as an active field general, moved aggressively to address a number of organizational issues, and strengthened the business by making numerous operational and cultural changes that have positioned the company for greater future success. In his on-going role with the business, he will continue to help lead the organization in expanding its market presence."
Spinco
Upon completion of the spin, Acuity Brands shareholders are expected to receive one share of Spinco for every two shares held in Acuity Brands, Inc. Spinco will have approximately 22 million shares outstanding, is expected to pay an annual dividend of approximately $0.16 per share, and is expected to have debt, net of cash, of approximately $70 million. Spinco will assume approximately $7.5 million of Acuity Brands' outstanding debt with an additional planned debt of $67.5 million financed through a combination of a receivables securitization program and bank debt. The tax rate of Spinco is expected to approximate 37 percent.
 
 
Spinco will be headquartered in Atlanta and is expected to be listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange. Spinco will have well-established brand names, including Zep, Zep Commercial, Enforcer, and Selig, and will have approximately 3,000 employees located in the United States, Canada, and Europe.
In addition to John Morgan and Bill Holl, Spinco's management team will include Mark R. Bachmann as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Bachmann has, for over 10 years, served in various capacities at ASP and its affiliates. In addition to Mr. Morgan, directors of Spinco will include Earnest W. Deavenport, Jr., the former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Eastman Chemical Company, who currently serves on the Board of Acuity Brands, and Kenyon W. Murphy, who now serves as the Executive Vice President, Chief Administrative Officer, and General Counsel of Acuity Brands. Other directors will be named later.
John K. Morgan commented, "I am excited about joining the specialty products business and the opportunities ahead to profitably grow the business as an independent company delivering superior performance for our customers, employees, and shareholders. We have a very solid foundation to build on including a portfolio of strong brands and products, superior customer service, a dedicated workforce, and a sound balance sheet."
Acuity Brands
Acuity Brands will remain based in Atlanta and listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "AYI". Acuity Brands will continue to have approximately 44 million shares outstanding and is expected to pay an annual dividend of approximately
 
 
$0.52 per share. The proceeds from Spinco's incremental debt financing of $67.5 million are currently expected to go towards paying transaction costs related to the spin and reducing Acuity Brands' net debt at the time of the spin. The tax rate of Acuity Brands is expected to approximate 35 percent following the spin.
Acuity Brands and ABL will have approximately 7,000 employees located primarily in North America. ABL's brands will include Lithonia Lighting, Holophane, Peerless, Hydrel, American Electric Lighting, Gotham, Carandini, SpecLight, MetalOptics, Antique Street Lamps, and Mark Architectural Lighting.
In addition to Vernon J. Nagel, the management of Acuity Brands will continue to include Richard K. Reece, serving as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The entire Board of Directors of Acuity Brands will continue, except for Mr. Deavenport.
Transaction Details
Consummation of the spin-off transaction is subject to several conditions, including receipt of confirmation of the tax-free treatment of the spin-off, receipt of certain regulatory approvals, and the filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the effectiveness of a registration statement on Form 10. The registration statement on Form 10 is expected to be filed next week. Approval of the transaction by shareholders of Acuity Brands is not required.
In connection with the spin-off, Acuity Brands plans to effect internal corporate reorganization transactions. Any such reorganization transactions are expected to be tax-free to stockholders and would not require stockholder approval.
 
 
The Company anticipates incurring approximately $7 million of transaction costs, which includes the $1.3 million expensed in the Company's previously reported results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2007, in order to effect the spin-off of the specialty products business. In addition, the Company expects to incur a restructuring charge as a result of simplifying the corporate structure, primarily to vacate the corporate facilities and for the reduction of certain positions. The amount of the charge is not determinable at this time, however, the Company does not currently expect the amount to be material.
Wachovia Securities is serving as financial advisor to Acuity Brands, Inc. in this transaction.

Acuity Brands will hold a conference call tomorrow morning at 8:30 a.m. ET to discuss this announcement. Interested parties may listen to this call live or hear a replay at the Company's Web site: .

ATLANTA, August 14, 2007 (BUSINESS WIRE)  Acuity Brands, Inc. (NYSE: AYI) today announced that the Company has been authorized to repurchase an additional 2,000,000 shares, or almost 5%, of the Company's outstanding common stock. Also, at the end of the previous fiscal quarter, the Company had continuing authorization to buyback 368,300 shares of the Company's stock under the repurchase program announced in June of 2006. Under the share repurchase programs, the Company expects to acquire shares primarily through open market transactions, subject to market conditions and other factors. The Company may enter into Rule 10b5-1 plans to facilitate open market repurchases under the programs. A Rule 10b5-1 plan would generally permit the Company to repurchase shares at times when it might otherwise be prevented from doing so under certain securities laws provided the plan is adopted when the Company is not in possession of material non-public information. Shares repurchased under the programs may be retired or used for general corporate purposes, which may include the Company's share-based compensation and employee benefit plans.
Vernon J. Nagel, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Acuity Brands, said, "This additional share repurchase program is a reflection of our confidence in the Company's future and its ability to continue to generate strong cash flow from operations. We believe that repurchasing our shares represents a wise use of our cash flow, especially during periods of high stock price volatility, and also allows us to offset dilution resulting from our stock-based compensation and benefit programs. Additionally, we believe that the repurchase program supports Acuity Brands' objective to maximize long-term stockholder value, while continuing to fund investments to better serve our customers, to grow our businesses, and to improve our operating and financial performance."
Acuity Brands, Inc., with fiscal year 2006 net sales of approximately $2.4 billion, is comprised of Acuity Brands Lighting and Acuity Specialty Products. Acuity Brands Lighting is one of the world's leading providers of lighting fixtures and includes brands such as Lithonia Lighting,

The Registrant, formerly known as Acuity Brands Holdings, Inc., is the successor issuer to Acuity Brands, Inc., a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Delaware (the "Predecessor"), which, until the transaction described in this item, had its common stock, par value $.01, and its preferred stock purchase rights registered pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Act.
Effective on September 26, 2007, the former Acuity Brands, Inc., pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger among Acuity Brands, Inc., Acuity Merger Sub, Inc. ("Merger Sub") and Acuity Brands Holdings, Inc., dated September 25, 2007 (the "Reorganization Agreement"), reorganized into a new holding company (the "Reorganization"). The primary purposes of the Reorganization were to properly separate the assets and liabilities of the Registrant's business units into separate subsidiaries and to create a more efficient holding company structure. In addition, in connection with the Reorganization, the Registrant completed additional subsidiary reorganizations to facilitate the previously announced spin-off of Zep Inc. The business operations of Acuity Brands, Inc. and its subsidiaries will not change as a result of the Reorganization or the related subsidiary reorganizations.
The new holding company organizational structure was effected by a merger conducted pursuant to Section 251(g) of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL"), which provides for the formation of a holding company structure without a vote of the stockholders of the constituent corporations. Pursuant to the terms of the Reorganization Agreement, Merger Sub merged with and into the Predecessor (the "Merger"), the Predecessor is the corporation that survived the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub ceased, and the Predecessor became a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of the Registrant. In accordance with the terms of the Reorganization Agreement:
(i) each share of Common Stock of the Predecessor (the "Predecessor Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger was converted into a share of Common Stock of the Registrant (the "Registrant Common Stock") having the same designations, rights, powers and preferences, and qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof, as the shares of Predecessor Common Stock so converted;
(ii) each share of capital stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger was converted into a share of common stock of the Predecessor; and
(iii) each option, whether or not exercisable, to purchase shares of the Predecessor Common Stock (a "Predecessor Option") which was then outstanding and unexercised ceased to represent a right to acquire shares of Predecessor Common Stock and was converted automatically into an option to acquire, under the same terms and conditions including exercise price, as were applicable to such Predecessor Option immediately prior to the Merger, shares of Registrant Common Stock, and Registrant assumed each Predecessor Option and each option plan or agreement pursuant to which such Predecessor Option was granted.
In connection with the Reorganization, the certificate of incorporation of the Predecessor was amended to change the name of the Predecessor to "Old ABI, Inc." and, immediately thereafter, as described below under Item 5.03 of this Current Report, the certificate of incorporation of the Registrant was amended to change the corporate name of Registrant to "Acuity Brands, Inc."
Except for certain amendments to the certificate of incorporation of the Predecessor effected in accordance with Section 251(g) of the DGCL in conjunction with the Merger, including the name change described above, the provisions of the certificate of incorporation of Registrant, including its authorized capital stock and the designations, rights, powers and preferences of such capital stock, and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof, are identical to those of the Predecessor immediately prior to the Merger. As a result, no post-Merger exchange of stock certificates was made and outstanding shares of Predecessor Common Stock were automatically converted into shares of Registrant Common Stock.
In addition, prior to the effective time (the "Effective Time") of the Merger, the Registrant adopted a Rights Agreement (the "Registrant Rights Agreement") that is in all substantive matters identical to the Rights Agreement of the Predecessor (the "Predecessor Rights Agreement") except that Registrant is the party thereto, rather than the Predecessor. The November 16, 2011 expiration date of the Registrant Purchase Rights is identical with that of the Predecessor Purchase Rights. Under the terms of the Registrant Rights Agreement, the Registrant is obligated (pursuant to a provision identical to one that formerly obligated the Predecessor) to issue one Registrant Purchase Right at the time of each issuance thereafter of one share of Registrant Common Stock. As a result, each share of Registrant Common Stock issued pursuant to the Merger was accompanied by a Registrant Purchase Right and all previously outstanding Predecessor Purchase Rights were canceled.
The provisions of the bylaws of the Registrant following the Merger are identical with the provisions of the bylaws of the Predecessor in effect immediately prior to the Merger. The directors of the Registrant immediately after the Merger are the same individuals as were directors of the Predecessor immediately prior thereto. The management of the Registrant following the Merger is the same as the management of the Predecessor immediately prior to the Merger.
The Merger qualified as a reorganization under section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and, as a result, the stockholders of the Predecessor will not recognize gain or loss for United States federal income tax purposes.
In connection with the Reorganization the Registrant executed a supplemental indenture (the "Second Supplemental Indenture") to the Indenture under which the Predecessor's 6.00% notes due 2009 and 8.375% notes due 2010 were issued. Pursuant to the Second Supplemental Indenture, the Registrant assumed the obligations of the Predecessor and the Predecessor was released from its obligations with respect to each such series of notes pursuant to the terms of the Indenture. The Second Supplemental Indenture is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.1.
Also in connection with the Reorganization the Registrant and the Predecessor entered into (i) an assumption agreement in respect of the Predecessor's revolving credit facility, whereby Registrant assumed all rights, duties and obligations of Predecessor under said revolving credit facility, to allow the Reorganization and to add the Registrant as a party to such facility, and (ii) certain performance undertakings in respect of Predecessor's receivables securitization facility, whereby Registrant agreed to guaranty certain obligations and duties of its subsidiaries under such receivables securitization facility, to allow the Reorganization.
 
In connection with the Reorganization, the certificate of incorporation of the Predecessor was amended to change the name of the Predecessor to "Old ABI, Inc." On September 26, 2007 (effective September 26, 2007), Acuity Brands Holdings, Inc. (the "Registrant") filed with the Delaware Secretary of State a Certificate of Amendment (the "Certificate of Amendment"). In accordance with the Certificate of Amendment, the Registrant's Certificate of Incorporation was amended to change the corporate name of the Registrant from "Acuity Brands Holdings, Inc." to "Acuity Brands, Inc." The disclosure regarding the amendment to the certificate of incorporation in Item 1.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is incorporated into this Item 5.03 by reference.
The provisions of the bylaws of the Registrant following the Merger are identical with the provisions of the bylaws of the Predecessor in effect immediately prior to the Merger. The Bylaws of the Registrant are attached hereto as Exhibit 3.3.

C. PARTICIPATING PREFERRED STOCK
There is hereby established a series of Preferred Stock, $.01 par value, of the Corporation, and the designation and certain terms, powers, preferences and other rights of the shares of such series, and certain qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereon, are hereby fixed as follows:
(i) The distinctive serial designation of this series shall be "Participating Preferred Stock" (hereinafter called "this Series"). Each share of this Series shall be identical in all respects with the other shares of this Series except as to the dates from and after which dividends thereon shall be cumulative.
(ii) The number of shares in this Series shall initially be 5,000,000, which number may from time to time be increased or decreased (but not below the number then outstanding) by the
 
Board of Directors. Shares of this Series purchased by the Corporation shall be canceled and shall revert to authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock undesignated as to series. Shares of this Series may be issued in fractional shares, which fractional shares shall entitle the holder, in proportion to such holder's fractional share, to all rights of a holder of a whole share of this Series.
(iii) The holders of full or fractional shares of this Series shall be entitled to receive, when and as declared by the Board of Directors, but only out of funds legally available therefor, dividends, (A) on each date that dividends or other distributions (other than dividends or distributions payable in Common Stock of the Corporation) are payable on or in respect of Common Stock comprising part of the Reference Package (as defined below), in an amount per whole share of this Series equal to the aggregate amount of dividends or other distributions (other than dividends or distributions payable in Common Stock of the Corporation) that would be payable on such date to a holder of the Reference Package and (B) on the last day of March, June, September and December in each year, in an amount per whole share of this Series equal to the excess (if any) of $25.00 over the aggregate dividends paid per whole share of this Series during the three month period ending on such last day. Each such dividend shall be paid to the holders of record of shares of this Series on the date, not exceeding sixty days preceding such dividend or distribution payment date, fixed for the purpose by the Board of Directors in advance of payment of each particular dividend or distribution. Dividends on each full and each fractional share of this Series shall be cumulative from the date such full or fractional share is originally issued; provided that any such full or fractional share originally issued after a dividend record date and on or prior to the dividend payment date to which such record date relates shall not be entitled to receive the dividend payable on such dividend payment date or any amount in respect of the period from such original issuance to such dividend payment date.
The term "Reference Package" shall initially mean 100 shares of Common Stock, par value $.01 per share ("Common Stock"), of the Corporation. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Close of Business on September 27, 2007 (A) declare or pay a dividend on any Common Stock payable in Common Stock, (B) subdivide any Common Stock or (C) combine any Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then and in each such case the Reference Package after such event shall be the Common Stock that a holder of the Reference Package immediately prior to such event would hold thereafter as a result thereof.
Holders of shares of this Series shall not be entitled to any dividends, whether payable in cash, property or stock, in excess of full cumulative dividends, as herein provided on this Series.
So long as any shares of this Series are outstanding, no dividend (other than a dividend in Common Stock or in any other stock ranking junior to this Series as to dividends and upon liquidation) shall be declared or paid or set aside for payment or other distribution declared or made upon the Common Stock or upon any other stock ranking junior to this Series as to dividends or upon liquidation, unless the full cumulative dividends (including the dividend to be paid upon payment of such dividend or other distribution) on all outstanding shares of this Series shall have been, or shall contemporaneously be, paid. When dividends are not paid in full upon this Series and other stock ranking on a parity as to dividends with this Series, all dividends
 
declared upon shares of this Series and any other stock ranking on a parity as to dividends shall be declared pro rata so that in all cases the amount of dividends declared per share on this Series and such other stock shall bear to each other the same ratio that accumulated dividends per share on the shares of the Series and such other stock bear to each other. Neither the Common Stock nor any other stock of the Corporation ranking junior to or on a parity with this Series as to dividends or upon liquidation shall be redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired for any consideration (or any moneys be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any shares of any such stock) by the Corporation (except by conversion into or exchange for stock of the Corporation ranking junior to this Series as to dividends and upon liquidation), unless the full cumulative dividends (including the dividend to be paid upon payment of such dividend, distribution, redemption, purchase or other acquisition) on all outstanding shares of this Series shall have been, or shall contemporaneously be, paid.
(iv) In the event of any merger, consolidation, reclassification or other transaction in which the shares of Common Stock are exchanged for or changed into other stock or securities, cash and/or any other property, then in any such case the shares of this Series shall at the same time be similarly exchanged or changed in an amount per whole share equal to the aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash and/or any other property (payable in kind), as the case may be, that a holder of the Reference Package would be entitled to receive as a result of such transaction.
(v) In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, the holders of full and fractional shares of this Series shall be entitled, before any distribution or payment is made on any date to the holders of the Common Stock or any other stock of the Corporation ranking junior to this Series upon liquidation, to be paid in full an amount per whole share of this Series equal to the greater of (A) $10,000.00 or (B) the aggregate amount distributed or to be distributed prior to such date in connection with such liquidation, dissolution or winding up to a holder of the Reference Package (such greater amount being hereinafter referred to as the "Liquidation Preference"), together with accrued dividends to such distribution or payment date, whether or not earned or declared. If such payment shall have been made in full to all holders of shares of this Series, the holders of shares of this Series as such shall have no right or claim to any of the remaining assets of the Corporation.
In the event the assets of the Corporation available for distribution to the holders of shares of this Series upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, shall be insufficient to pay in full all amounts to which such holders are entitled pursuant to the first paragraph of this Section (v), no such distribution shall be made on account of any shares of any other class or series of Preferred Stock ranking on a parity with the shares of this Series upon such liquidation, dissolution or winding up unless proportionate distributive amounts shall be paid on account of the shares of this Series, ratably in proportion to the full distributable amounts for which holders of all such parity shares are respectively entitled upon such liquidation, dissolution or winding up.
Upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, the holders of shares of this Series then outstanding shall be entitled to be paid out of assets of the Corporation
 
available for distribution to its stockholders all amounts to which such holders are entitled pursuant to the first paragraph of this Section (v) before any payment shall be made to the holders of Common Stock or any other stock of the Corporation ranking junior upon liquidation to this Series.
For the purposes of this Section (v), the consolidation or merger of, or binding share exchange by, the Corporation with any other corporation shall not be deemed to constitute a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation.
(vi) The shares of this Series shall not be redeemable.
(vii) In addition to any other vote or consent of stockholders required by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, of the Corporation, each whole share of this Series shall, on any matter, vote as a class with any other capital stock comprising part of the Reference Package and voting on such matter and shall have the number of votes thereon that a holder of the Reference Package would have.
All corporate powers shall be exercised by the board of directors of the Corporation, except as otherwise specifically required by law or as otherwise provided in this Certificate of Incorporation. Any meeting of stockholders may be postponed by action of the board of directors at any time in advance of such meeting. The board of directors of the Corporation shall have the power to adopt such rules and regulations for the conduct of the meetings and management of the affairs of the Corporation as they may deem proper and the power to adjourn any meeting of stockholders without a vote of the stockholders, which powers may be delegated by the board of directors to the chairman of such meeting either in such rules and regulations or pursuant to the by-laws of the Corporation.
Special meetings of stockholders of the Corporation may be called at any time by, but only by, the board of directors of the Corporation, to be held at such date, time and place either within or without the State of Delaware as may be stated in the notice of the meeting.
The board of directors of the Corporation is authorized to adopt, amend or repeal by-laws of the Corporation. No adoption, amendment or repeal of a by-law by action of stockholders shall be effective unless approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than 80% of the voting power of all outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Corporation and all other outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote on such matter, with such outstanding shares of Common Stock and other stock considered for this purpose as a single class. Any vote of stockholders required by this Article V shall be in addition to any other vote of stockholders that may be required by law, this Certificate of Incorporation, the by-laws of the Corporation, any agreement with a national securities exchange or otherwise.
 
Elections of directors need not be by written ballot except and to the extent provided in the by-laws of the Corporation.
The directors of the Corporation shall be divided into three classes. The number of directors of the Corporation and the number of directors in each class of directors shall be fixed only by resolution of the board of directors of the Corporation from time to time. The initial term of office of the first such class of directors shall expire at the first annual meeting of stockholders, the initial term of office of the second such class of directors shall expire at the second annual meeting of stockholders and the initial term of office of the third such class of directors shall expire at the third annual meeting of stockholders, with each such class of directors to hold office until their successors have been duly elected and qualified. At each annual meeting of stockholders, directors elected to succeed the directors whose terms expire at such annual meeting shall be elected to hold office for a term expiring at the annual meeting of stockholders in the third year following the year of their election and until their successors have been duly elected and qualified. If the number of directors is changed, any increase or decrease shall be apportioned among the classes in such manner as the board of directors of the Corporation shall determine, but no decrease in the number of directors may shorten the term of any incumbent director.
No director who is part of any such class of directors may be removed except both for cause and with the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than 80% of the voting power of all outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, considered for this purpose as a single class.
Vacancies and newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors or from any other cause (other than vacancies and newly created directorships which the holders of any class or classes of stock or series thereof are expressly entitled by this Certificate of Incorporation to fill) shall be filled by, and only by, a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by the sole remaining director (and not by stockholders). Any director appointed to fill a vacancy or a newly created directorship shall hold office until the next election of the class of directors of the director which such director replaced or the class of directors to which such director was appointed, and until his or her successor is elected and qualified or until his or her earlier resignation or removal.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the holders of any class or series of Preferred Stock of the Corporation shall be entitled, voting separately as a class, to elect any directors of the Corporation, then the number of directors that may be elected by such holders voting separately as a class shall be in addition to the number fixed pursuant to a resolution of the board of directors of the Corporation. Except as otherwise provided in the terms of such class or series, (i) the terms of the directors elected by such holders voting separately as a class shall
 
expire at the annual meeting of stockholders next succeeding their election without regard to the classification of other directors and (ii) any director or directors elected by such holders voting separately as a class may be removed, without cause, by the holders of a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote separately as a class in an election of such directors.
No action of stockholders of the Corporation required or permitted to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation may be taken without a meeting of stockholders, without prior notice and without a vote, and the power of stockholders of the Corporation to consent in writing to the taking of any action without a meeting is specifically denied. Notwithstanding this Article VIII, the holders of any series of Preferred Stock of the Corporation shall be entitled to take action by written consent to such extent, if any, as may be provided in the terms of such series.
A. In addition to any approval of the board of directors or any stockholder vote or consent required by the laws of the State of Delaware or any other provision of this Certificate of Incorporation or otherwise, there shall be required for the approval, adoption, or authorization of a Business Combination with an Interested Person the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of a majority of the shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote in elections of directors considered separately for the purposes of this Article IX, which are not beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by such Interested Person; , that said voting requirement shall not be applicable if all of the conditions specified in subparagraphs (1) and (2) below are met or if all of the conditions specified in subparagraph (3) are met:
provided, however
(1) The consideration to be received per share in such Business Combination by holders of the stock of the Corporation is payable in cash or Acceptable Securities, or a combination of both, and the Acceptable Securities (plus the cash, if any) have a fair market value per share of the Corporation's stock of not less than either:
(a) the highest price (including the highest per share brokerage commissions, transfer tax, and soliciting dealers fees) paid by said Interested Person in acquiring any of the Corporation's stock; or
(b) a price per share obtained by multiplying the aggregate earnings per share of stock of the Corporation (appropriately adjusted for any subdivision of shares, stock dividend, or combination of shares during the period) for the four full consecutive fiscal quarters immediately preceding the record date for solicitation of votes or consents on such Business Combination by the figure obtained by dividing the highest per share price (including the highest per share brokerage commissions, transfer tax, and soliciting dealers fees) paid by such Interested
 
Person acquiring any of the Corporation's stock by the aggregate earnings per share of the Corporation for the four full consecutive fiscal quarters immediately preceding the time when the Interested Person shall have become the beneficial owner of five percent (5%) or more of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote in elections of directors.
If any securities were issued by an Interested Person in exchange for stock of the Corporation prior to the proposed Business Combination, the fair market value of said securities at the time of issue shall be used in determining the per share price paid for said stock.
(2) After the Interested Person has become the beneficial owner of five percent (5%) or more of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote in the election of directors and prior to the consummation of such Business Combination, there shall have been no reduction in the rate of dividends payable on the Corporation's stock which would result in a quarterly dividend rate per share which is less than the average quarterly dividend rate per share for the four full consecutive fiscal quarters immediately preceding the time when the Interested Person shall have become the beneficial owner of five percent (5%) or more of the stock of the Corporation unless such reduction in the rate of dividends has been approved by the board of directors of the Corporation and a majority of the members of the board of directors approving such reduction were duly elected and acting members of the board of directors prior to the time that such Interested Person shall have become a beneficial owner of five percent (5%) or more of the shares of the Corporation. For the purposes of this paragraph, "quarterly dividend rate per share" for any quarterly dividend shall be equal to the percentage said quarterly dividend per share bears to the earnings per share for the four full fiscal quarters immediately preceding the declaration of said quarterly dividend.
(3) The board of directors of the Corporation has approved a memorandum of understanding with such other Interested Person with respect to such Business Combination prior to the time that such Interested Person shall have become a beneficial owner of five percent (5%) or more of the shares of stock entitled to vote in elections of directors, or thereafter if such Business Combination is otherwise approved by the board of directors of the Corporation, provided that a majority of the members of the board of directors voting for the approval of such transaction were duly elected and acting members of the board of directors prior to the time that such Interested Person shall have become a beneficial owner of five percent (5%) or more of the shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote in elections of directors.
B. For the purposes of this Article IX:
(1) "Affiliate" and "associate" shall have the respective meanings given those terms in Rule 12b-2 of the General Rules and Regulations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
(2) A person shall be the "beneficial owner" and "beneficially owns" shares of stock of the Corporation (other than shares of the Corporation's stock held in its treasury) (a) which such person and its affiliates and associates beneficially own, directly or indirectly, whether of record or not, (b) which such person or any of its affiliates or associates has the right
 
to acquire, pursuant to any agreement upon the exercise of conversion rights, warrants, or options, or otherwise, (c) which such person or any of its affiliates or associates has the right to sell or vote pursuant to any agreement, or (d) which are beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by any other person with which such first mentioned person or any of its affiliates or associates has any agreement, arrangement, or understanding for the purpose of acquiring, holding, voting, or disposing of securities of the Corporation.
(3) "Business Combination" is
(a) any merger or consolidation of the Corporation or any subsidiary of the Corporation with or into any Interested Person (regardless of the identity of the surviving corporation);

(3) For nominations or other business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder pursuant to clause (c) of the foregoing paragraph, (1) the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation, (2) such business must be a proper matter for stockholder action under the Delaware General Corporation Law, (3) if the stockholder, or the beneficial owner on whose behalf any such proposal or nomination is made, has provided the Corporation with a Solicitation Notice, as that term is defined in subclause (c)(iii) of this paragraph, such stockholder or beneficial owner must, in the case of a proposal, have delivered a proxy statement and form of proxy to holders of at least the percentage of the Corporation's voting shares required under applicable law to carry any such proposal, or, in the case of a nomination or nominations, have delivered a proxy statement and form of proxy to holders of a percentage of the Corporation's voting shares reasonably believed by such stockholder or beneficial holder to be sufficient to elect the nominee or nominees proposed to be nominated by such stockholder, and must, in either case, have included in such materials the Solicitation Notice and (4) if no Solicitation Notice relating thereto has been timely provided pursuant to this section, the stockholder or beneficial owner proposing such business or nomination must not have solicited a number of proxies sufficient to have required the delivery of such a Solicitation Notice under this section. To be timely, a stockholder's notice shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not less than 45 or more than 75 days prior to the first anniversary (the "Anniversary") of the date on which the Corporation first mailed its proxy materials for the preceding year's annual meeting of

Such stockholder's notice shall set forth (a) as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election or reelection as a director all information relating to such person as would be required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for the election of such nominees as directors pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and such person's written consent to serve as a director if elected; (b) as to any other business that the stockholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a brief description of such business, the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any material interest in such business of such stockholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made; (c) as to the stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made (i) the name and address of such stockholder, as they appear on the Corporation's books, and of such beneficial owner, (ii) the class and number of shares of the Corporation that are owned beneficially and of record by such stockholder and such beneficial owner, and (iii) whether either such stockholder or beneficial owner intends to deliver a proxy statement and form of proxy to holders of, in the case of a proposal, at least the percentage of the Corporation's voting shares required under applicable law to carry the proposal or, in the case of a nomination or nominations, a sufficient number of holders of the Corporation's voting shares to elect such nominee or nominees (an affirmative statement of such intent, a "Solicitation Notice").

Right to Indemnification
Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a "proceeding"), by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or an officer of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer or trustee of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan (hereinafter an "indemnitee"), whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer or trustee or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer or trustee, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the Delaware General Corporation Law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than such law permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment), against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such indemnitee in connection therewith; provided, however, that, except as provided in Section 3 of this Article VII with respect to proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification, the Corporation shall indemnify any such indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.
Section 2. .
Right to Advancement of Expenses
In addition to the right to indemnification conferred in Section 1 of this Article VII, an indemnitee shall also have the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses (including attorney's fees) incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition (hereinafter an "advancement of expenses"); provided, however, that, if the Delaware General Corporation Law requires, an advancement of expenses incurred by an indemnitee in his or her capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such indemnitee, including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking (hereinafter an "undertaking"), by or on behalf of such indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal (hereinafter a "final adjudication") that such indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under this Section 2 or otherwise.
Section 3. .
Right of Indemnitee to Bring Suit
If a claim under Section 1 or 2 of this Article VII is not paid in full by the Corporation within sixty (60) days after a written claim has been received by the Corporation, except in the case of a claim for an advancement of expenses, in which case the applicable period shall be twenty (20) days, the indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim. If successful in whole or in part in any such suit, or in a suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit. In (i) any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (but not in a suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to an advancement of expenses) it shall be a defense that, and (ii) in any suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the Corporation shall be entitled to recover such expenses upon a final adjudication that, the indemnitee has not met any applicable standard for indemnification set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its directors who are not parties to such action, a committee of such directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such suit that indemnification of the indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its directors who are not parties to such action, a committee of such directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that the indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought by the indemnitee, be a defense to such suit. In any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, or brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden of proving that the indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses, under this Article VII or otherwise shall be on the Corporation.
Section 4. .
Non-Exclusivity of Rights
The rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses conferred in this Article VII shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, the Corporation's certificate of incorporation, By-laws, agreement, vote of stockholders or directors or otherwise.
Section 5. .
Insurance
The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the Delaware General Corporation Law.
Section 6. .
Indemnification of Employees and Agents of the Corporation
The Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board of Directors, grant rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses to any employee or agent of the Corporation to the fullest extent of the provisions of this Article with respect to the indemnification and advancement of expenses of directors and officers of the Corporation.
Section 7. .
Nature of Rights
The rights conferred upon indemnitees in this Article VII shall be contract rights and such rights shall continue as to an indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, officer or trustee and shall inure to the benefit of the indemnitee's heirs, executors and administrators. Any amendment, alteration or repeal of this Article VII that adversely affects any right of an indemnitee or its successors shall be prospective only and shall not limit or eliminate any such right with respect to any proceeding involving any occurrence or alleged occurrence of any action or omission to act that took place prior to such amendment or repeal.
Section 1. .
Facsimile Signatures

Section 3. .
Reliance upon Books, Reports and Records

Section 4. .
Fiscal Year
The fiscal year of the Corporation shall be as fixed by the Board of Directors.

(c) Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, on or after the Separation Time and prior to the Expiration Time, the Rights (i) may be exercised and (ii) may be transferred independent of shares of Common Stock.

Exhibit A
 
(d) Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, Rights may be exercised on any Business Day on or after the Separation Time and prior to the Expiration Time by submitting to the Rights Agent the Rights Certificate evidencing such Rights with an Election to Exercise (an "Election to Exercise") substantially in the form attached to the Rights Certificate duly and properly completed, accompanied by payment in cash, or by certified or official bank check or money order payable to the order of the Company, of a sum equal to the Exercise Price multiplied by the number of Rights being exercised and a sum sufficient to cover any tax or charge which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the transfer or delivery of Rights Certificates or the issuance or delivery of certificates (or, if uncertificated, the registration on the stock transfer books of the Company) for shares or depositary receipts (or both) in a name other than that of the holder of the Rights being exercised.
(e) Upon receipt of a Rights Certificate, with an Election to Exercise duly and properly completed accompanied by payment as set forth in Section 2.2(d), and subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Rights Agent will thereupon promptly (i)(A) requisition from the transfer agent of the Company stock certificates evidencing such number of shares or other securities to be purchased or, in the case of uncertificated shares or other securities, requisition from the transfer agent of the Company a notice setting forth such number of shares or other securities to be purchased for which registration will be made on the stock transfer books of the Company (the Company hereby irrevocably authorizing its transfer agents to comply with all such requisitions) and (B) if the Company elects pursuant to Section 5.5 not to issue certificates (or effect registration on the stock transfer books of the Company) representing fractional shares,
 
requisition from the depositary selected by the Company depositary receipts representing the fractional shares to be purchased or requisition from the Company the amount of cash to be paid in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section 5.5 and (ii) after receipt of such certificates, depositary receipts, notices and/or cash, deliver the same to or upon the order of the registered holder of such Rights Certificate, registered (in the case of certificates, depositary receipts or notices) in such name or names as may be designated by such holder.

(g) The Company covenants and agrees that it will (i) take all such action as may be necessary to ensure that all shares delivered (or evidenced by registration on the stock transfer books of the Company) upon exercise of Rights shall, at the time of delivery of the certificates (or registration) for such shares (subject to payment of the Exercise Price), be duly and validly authorized, executed, issued and delivered (or registered) and fully paid and nonassessable; (ii) take all such action as may be necessary to comply with any applicable requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder, and any other applicable law, rule or regulation, in connection with the issuance of any securities upon exercise of Rights; and (iii) pay when due and payable any and all federal and state taxes and governmental charges which may be payable in respect of the original issuance or delivery of the Rights Certificates or of any shares issued upon the exercise of Rights, , that the Company shall not be required to pay any tax or charge which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the transfer or delivery of Rights Certificates or the issuance or delivery of certificates (or the registration) for shares in a name other than that of the holder of the Rights being transferred or exercised.

2.3 . (a) In the event the Company shall at any time after the Record Time and prior to the Separation Time (i) declare or pay a dividend on Common Stock payable in Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock or (iii) combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares of Common Stock, (x) the Exercise Price in effect after such adjustment will be equal to the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment divided by the number of shares of Common Stock (the "Expansion Factor") that a holder of one share of Common Stock immediately prior to such dividend, subdivision or combination would hold thereafter as a result thereof and (y) each Right held prior to such adjustment will become that number of Rights equal to the Expansion Factor, and the adjusted number of Rights will be deemed to be distributed among the shares of Common Stock with respect to which the original Rights were associated (if they remain outstanding) and the shares issued in respect of such dividend, subdivision or combination, so that each such share of Common Stock will have exactly one Right associated with it. Each adjustment made pursuant to this paragraph shall be made as of the payment or effective date for the applicable dividend, subdivision or combination.
Adjustments to Exercise Price; Number of Rights
In the event the Company shall at any time after the Record Time and prior to the Separation Time issue any shares of Common Stock otherwise than in a transaction referred to in the preceding paragraph, each such share of Common Stock so issued shall automatically have one new Right associated with it, which Right shall be evidenced by the certificate representing such share (or, if the Common Stock shall be uncertificated, such Right shall be evidenced by the registration of such Common Stock on the stock transfer books of the Company). Rights shall be issued by the Company in respect of shares of Common Stock that are issued or sold by the Company after the Separation Time only to the extent provided in Section 5.3.
 
(b) In the event the Company shall at any time after the Record Time and prior to the Separation Time issue or distribute any securities or assets in respect of, in lieu of or in exchange for Common Stock (other than pursuant to any non-extraordinary periodic cash dividend or a dividend paid solely in Common Stock) whether by dividend, in a reclassification or recapitalization (including any such transaction involving a merger, consolidation or share exchange), or otherwise, the Company shall make such adjustments, if any, in the Exercise Price, number of Rights and/or securities or other property purchasable upon exercise of Rights as the Board of Directors of the Company, in its sole discretion, may deem to be appropriate under the circumstances in order to adequately protect the interests of the holders of Rights generally, and the Company and the Rights Agent, subject to Section 5.4, shall amend this Agreement as necessary to provide for such adjustments.
(c) Each adjustment to the Exercise Price made pursuant to this Section 2.3 shall be calculated to the nearest cent. Whenever an adjustment to the Exercise Price is made pursuant to this Section 2.3 or any event affecting the Rights or their exercisability (including, without limitation, an event which causes the Rights to become null and void), the Company shall (i) promptly prepare a certificate setting forth such adjustment or describing such event and a brief, reasonably detailed statement of the facts, computations and methodology accounting for such adjustment and (ii) promptly file with the Rights Agent and with each transfer agent for the Common Stock a copy of such certificate. The Rights Agent shall be fully protected in relying on such certificate and on any adjustment therein contained and shall have no duty with respect to and shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any adjustment unless and until it shall have received such a certificate.
 
(d) Rights certificates shall represent the securities purchasable under the terms of this Agreement, including any adjustment or change in the securities purchasable upon exercise of the Rights, even though such certificates may continue to express the securities purchasable at the time of issuance of the initial Rights Certificates.
2.4 . Each Person in whose name any certificate for shares is issued (or registration on the stock transfer books of the Company is effected) upon the exercise of Rights shall for all purposes be deemed to have become the holder of record of the shares represented thereby on the date upon which the Rights Certificate evidencing such Rights was duly surrendered and payment of the Exercise Price for such Rights (and any applicable taxes and other governmental charges payable by the exercising holder hereunder) was made; , , that if the date of such surrender and payment is a date upon which the stock transfer books of the Company are closed, such Person shall be deemed to have become the record holder of such shares on, and such certificate (or registration) shall be dated, the next succeeding Business Day on which the stock transfer books of the Company are open.

Until such notice is received by the Rights Agent, the Rights Agent may presume conclusively that the Separation Time has not occurred.

The Rights Agent is hereby appointed "Rights Registrar" for the purpose of maintaining the Rights Register for the Company and registering Rights and transfers of Rights after the Separation Time as herein provided. In the event that the Rights Agent shall cease to be the Rights Registrar, the Rights Agent will have the right to examine the Rights Register at all reasonable times after the Separation Time.

(d) Every new Rights Certificate issued pursuant to this Section 2.7 in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Rights Certificate shall evidence an original additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Rights Certificate shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and, subject to Section 3.1(b) shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Agreement equally and proportionately with any and all other Rights duly issued hereunder.
2.8 . Prior to due presentment of a Rights Certificate (or, prior to the Separation Time, the associated Common Stock certificate or notice of transfer,
Persons Deemed Owners
 
if uncertificated) for registration of transfer, the Company, the Rights Agent and any agent of the Company or the Rights Agent may deem and treat the Person in whose name such Rights Certificate (or, prior to the Separation Time, such Common Stock certificate or Common Stock registration, if uncertificated) is registered as the absolute owner thereof and of the Rights evidenced thereby for all purposes whatsoever, including the payment of the Redemption Price and neither the Company nor the Rights Agent shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.

Agreement of Rights Holders
(a) prior to the Separation Time, each Right will be transferable only together with, and will be transferred by a transfer of, the associated share of Common Stock;
(b) after the Separation Time, the Rights Certificates will be transferable only on the Rights Register as provided herein;
(c) prior to due presentment of a Rights Certificate (or, prior to the Separation Time, the associated Common Stock certificate or Common Stock registration, if uncertificated) for registration of transfer, the Company, the Rights Agent and any agent of the Company or the Rights Agent may deem and treat the Person in whose name the Rights Certificate (or, prior to the Separation Time, the associated Common Stock certificate or Common Stock registration, if uncertificated) is registered as the absolute owner thereof and of the Rights evidenced thereby for all purposes whatsoever, and neither the Company nor the Rights Agent shall be affected by any notice to the contrary;
(d) Rights beneficially owned by certain Persons will, under the circumstances set forth in Section 3.1(b), become null and void; and
(e) this Agreement may be supplemented or amended from time to time pursuant to Section 2.3(b) or 5.4 hereof.
 
3.1 . (a) In the event that prior to the Expiration Time a Flip-in Date shall occur, except as provided in this Section 3.1, each Right shall constitute the right to purchase from the Company, upon exercise thereof in accordance with the terms hereof (but subject to Section 5.10), that number of shares of Common Stock having an aggregate Market Price on the Stock Acquisition Date that gave rise to the Flip-in Date equal to twice the Exercise Price for an amount in cash equal to the Exercise Price (such right to be appropriately adjusted in order to protect the interests of the holders of Rights generally in the event that on or after such Stock Acquisition Date any of the events described in Section 2.3(a) or (b), or any analogous event, shall have occurred with respect to the Common Stock).
Flip-in
(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Rights that are or were Beneficially Owned on or after the Stock Acquisition Date by an Acquiring Person or an Affiliate or Associate thereof or by any transferee, direct or indirect, of any of the foregoing shall become null and void and any holder of such Rights (including transferees) shall thereafter have no right to exercise or transfer such Rights under any provision of this Agreement. If any Rights Certificate is presented for assignment or exercise and the Person presenting the same will not complete the certification set forth at the end of the form of assignment or notice of election to exercise and provide such additional evidence of the identity of the Beneficial Owner and its Affiliates and Associates (or former Beneficial Owners and their Affiliates and Associates) as the Company or the Rights Agent shall reasonably request, then the Company shall be entitled conclusively to deem the Beneficial Owner thereof to be an Acquiring Person or an Affiliate or Associate thereof or a transferee of any of the foregoing and accordingly will deem the Rights
 
evidenced thereby to be null and void and not transferable or exercisable. The Company shall give the Rights Agent written notice of the identity of any such Acquiring Person, Associate or Affiliate, or the nominee of any of the foregoing, and the Rights Agent may rely on such notice in carrying out its duties under this Agreement and shall be deemed not to have any knowledge of the identity of any such Acquiring Person, Associate or Affiliate, or the nominee of any of the foregoing unless and until it shall have received such notice.
(c) The Board of Directors of the Company may, at its option, at any time after a Flip-in Date and prior to the time that an Acquiring Person becomes the Beneficial Owner of more than 50% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock elect to exchange all (but not less than all) the then outstanding Rights (which shall not include Rights that have become null and void pursuant to the provisions of Section 3.1(b)) for shares of Common Stock at an exchange ratio of one share of Common Stock per Right, appropriately adjusted in order to protect the interests of holders of Rights generally in the event that after the Separation Time any of the events described in Section 2.3(a) or (b), or any analogous event, shall have occurred with respect to the Common Stock (such exchange ratio, as adjusted from time to time, being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Ratio").
Immediately upon the action of the Board of Directors of the Company electing to exchange the Rights, without any further action and without any notice, the right to exercise the Rights will terminate and each Right (other than Rights that have become null and void pursuant to Section 3.1(b)), whether or not previously exercised, will thereafter represent only the right to receive a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio. Promptly after the action of the Board of Directors electing to exchange the Rights, the Company shall give written notice thereof (specifying the steps to be taken to receive shares of Common Stock in exchange
 
for Rights) to the Rights Agent and the holders of the Rights (other than Rights that have become null and void pursuant to Section 3.1(b)) outstanding immediately prior thereto by mailing such notice in accordance with Section 5.9.
Each Person in whose name any certificate for shares is issued (or for whom any registration on the stock transfer books of the Company is made) upon the exchange of Rights pursuant to this Section 3.1(c) or Section 3.1(d) shall for all purposes be deemed to have become the holder of record of the shares represented thereby on, and such certificate (or registration on the stock transfer books of the Company) shall be dated (or registered as of), the date upon which the Rights Certificate evidencing such Rights was duly surrendered and payment of any applicable taxes and other governmental charges payable by the holder was made; , , that if the date of such surrender and payment is a date upon which the stock transfer books of the Company are closed, such Person shall be deemed to have become the record holder of such shares on, and such certificate (or registration on the stock transfer books of the Company) shall be dated (or registered as of), the next succeeding Business Day on which the stock transfer books of the Company are open.
provided

(d) Whenever the Company shall become obligated under Section 3.1(a) or (c) to issue shares of Common Stock upon exercise of or in exchange for Rights, the Company, at its option, may substitute therefor shares of Preferred Stock, at an initial rate of one one-hundredth of a share of Preferred Stock for each share of Common Stock so issuable, as appropriately adjusted to reflect adjustments in the voting rights of the Preferred Stock pursuant to the terms thereof, so that the fraction of a share of Preferred Stock delivered in lieu of each share of Common Stock shall have the same voting rights as one share of Common Stock.
 
(e) In the event that there shall not be sufficient treasury shares or authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock of the Company to permit the exercise or exchange in full of the Rights in accordance with Section 3.1(a) or if the Company so elects to make the exchange referred to in Section 3.1(c), the Company shall either (i) call a meeting of stockholders seeking approval to cause sufficient additional shares to be authorized (provided that if such approval is not obtained the Company will take the action specified in clause (ii) of this sentence) or (ii) take such action as shall be necessary to ensure and provide, to the extent permitted by applicable law and any agreements or instruments in effect on the Stock Acquisition Date to which it is a party, that each Right shall thereafter constitute the right to receive, (x) at the Company's option, either (A) in return for the Exercise Price, debt or equity securities or other assets (or a combination thereof) having a fair value equal to twice the Exercise Price, or (B) without payment of consideration (except as otherwise required by applicable law), debt or equity securities or other assets (or a combination thereof) having a fair value equal to the Exercise Price, or (y) if the Board of Directors of the Company elects to exchange the Rights in accordance with Section 3.1(c), debt or equity securities or other assets (or a combination thereof) having a fair value equal to the product of the Market Price of a share of Common Stock on the Flip-in Date times the Exchange Ratio in effect on the Flip-in Date, where in any case set forth in (x) or (y) above the fair value of such debt or equity securities or other assets shall be as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company, after consultation with a nationally recognized investment banking firm.
3.2 . (a) Prior to the Expiration Time, the Company shall not enter into any agreement with respect to, consummate or permit to occur any Flip-over Transaction or Event unless and until it shall have entered into a supplemental agreement with the Flip-over
Flip-over
 
Entity, for the benefit of the holders of the Rights, providing that, upon consummation or occurrence of the Flip-over Transaction or Event (i) each Right shall thereafter constitute the right to purchase from the Flip-over Entity, upon exercise thereof in accordance with the terms hereof, that number of shares of Flip-over Stock of the Flip-over Entity having an aggregate Market Price on the date of consummation or occurrence of such Flip-over Transaction or Event equal to twice the Exercise Price for an amount in cash equal to the Exercise Price (such right to be appropriately adjusted in order to protect the interests of the holders of Rights generally in the event that after such date of consummation or occurrence any of the events described in Section 2.3(a) or (b), or any analogous event, shall have occurred with respect to the Flip-over Stock) and (ii) the Flip-over Entity shall thereafter be liable for, and shall assume, by virtue of such Flip-over Transaction or Event and such supplemental agreement, all the obligations and duties of the Company pursuant to this Agreement. The provisions of this Section 3.2 shall apply to successive Flip-over Transactions or Events.
(b) Prior to the Expiration Time, the Company shall not enter into any agreement with respect to, consummate or permit to occur any Flip-over Transaction or Event if at the time thereof there are any rights, warrants or securities outstanding or any other arrangements, agreements or instruments that would eliminate or otherwise diminish in any material respect the benefits intended to be afforded by this Rights Agreement to the holders of Rights upon consummation of such transaction.
4.1 . (a) The Company hereby appoints the Rights Agent to act as agent for the Company in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof, and the Rights Agent
General
 
hereby accepts such appointment. The Company agrees to pay to the Rights Agent reasonable compensation for all services rendered by it hereunder and, from time to time, on demand of the Rights Agent, its reasonable expenses and counsel fees and other disbursements incurred in the preparation, delivery, amendment, administration and execution of this Agreement and the exercise and performance of its duties hereunder. The Company also agrees to indemnify the Rights Agent for, and to hold it harmless against, any loss, liability, damage, judgment, fine, penalty, claim, demand, settlement, cost or expense (including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) incurred without gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on the part of the Rights Agent (which gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct must be determined by a final, non-appealable order, judgment, decree or ruling of a court of competent jurisdiction), for any action taken, suffered or omitted to be done by the Rights Agent in connection with the acceptance, administration, exercise and performance of its duties under this Agreement, including, without limitation, the costs and expenses of defending against and appealing any claim of liability arising therefrom, directly or indirectly. The indemnity provided herein shall survive termination of this Agreement and the termination, exercise or expiration of the Rights and the resignation, replacement or removal of the Rights Agent. The costs and expenses incurred in enforcing this right of indemnification shall be paid by the Company. Anything to the contrary contained herein notwithstanding, in no event shall the Rights Agent be liable for special, punitive, indirect, incidental or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever (including but not limited to lost profits), even if the Rights Agent has been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage. Any liability of the Rights Agent under this Rights Agreement will be limited to the amount of fees paid by the Company to the Rights Agent.
 
(b) The Rights Agent shall be authorized and protected and shall incur no liability for or in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by it in connection with the acceptance and administration of this Agreement and the exercise and performance of its duties hereunder in reliance upon any certificate for securities (or registration on the stock transfer books of the Company) purchasable upon exercise of Rights, Rights Certificate, certificate for other securities of the Company, instrument of assignment or transfer, power of attorney, endorsement, affidavit, letter, notice, direction, consent, certificate, statement, or other paper or document believed by it to be genuine and to be signed, executed and, where necessary, verified or acknowledged, by the proper Person or Persons or otherwise upon the advice or opinion of counsel as set forth in Section 4.3. The Rights Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any event of which it was supposed to receive notice thereof hereunder, and the Rights Agent shall be fully protected and shall incur no liability for failing to take action in connection therewith unless and until it has received such notice in writing.
4.2 . (a) Any Person into which the Rights Agent or any successor Rights Agent may be merged or with which it may be consolidated, or any Person resulting from any merger or consolidation to which the Rights Agent or any successor Rights Agent is a party, or any Person succeeding to the shareholder services business of the Rights Agent or any successor Rights Agent, will be the successor to the Rights Agent under this Agreement without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto, provided that such Person would be eligible for appointment as a successor Rights Agent under the provisions of Section 4.4 hereof. In case at the time such successor Rights Agent succeeds to the agency created by this Agreement any of the Rights Certificates have been countersigned but not delivered, any such

successor Rights Agent may adopt the countersignature of the predecessor Rights Agent and deliver such Rights Certificates so countersigned; and in case at that time any of the Rights Certificates have not been countersigned, any successor Rights Agent may countersign such Rights Certificates either in the name of the predecessor Rights Agent or in the name of the successor Rights Agent; and in all such cases such Rights Certificates will have the full force provided in the Rights Certificates and in this Agreement.
(b) In case at any time the name of the Rights Agent is changed and at such time any of the Rights Certificates shall have been countersigned but not delivered, the Rights Agent may adopt the countersignature under its prior name and deliver Rights Certificates so countersigned; and in case at that time any of the Rights Certificates shall not have been countersigned, the Rights Agent may countersign such Rights Certificates either in its prior name or in its changed name; and in all such cases such Rights Certificates shall have the full force provided in the Rights Certificates and in this Agreement.
4.3 . The Rights Agent undertakes to perform only the duties and obligations expressly imposed by this Agreement (and no implied duties) upon the following terms and conditions, by all of which the Company and the holders of Rights Certificates, by their acceptance thereof, shall be bound:
Duties of Rights Agent
(a) The Rights Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be legal counsel for the Company or an employee of the Rights Agent), and the advice or opinion of such counsel will be full and complete authorization and protection to the Rights Agent and the Rights Agent shall incur no liability for or in respect of any action taken, suffered, or omitted by it in accordance with such advice or opinion.
 
(b) Whenever in the performance of its duties under this Agreement the Rights Agent deems it necessary or desirable that any fact or matter (including, without limitation, the identity of any Acquiring Person and the determination of Market Price) be proved or established by the Company prior to taking, suffering or omitting to take any action hereunder, such fact or matter (unless other evidence in respect thereof be herein specifically prescribed) may be deemed to be conclusively proved and established by a certificate signed by a Person believed by the Rights Agent to be the Chairman of the Board, the President or any Vice President and by the Treasurer or any Assistant Treasurer or the Secretary or any Assistant Secretary of the Company and delivered to the Rights Agent; and such certificate will be full and complete authorization and protection to the Rights Agent and the Rights Agent shall incur no liability for or in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by it under the provisions of this Agreement in reliance upon such certificate.
(c) The Rights Agent will be liable hereunder only for its own gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct (as determined by a final, non-appealable order, judgment, decree or ruling of a court of competent jurisdiction).
(d) The Rights Agent will not be liable for or by reason of any of the statements of fact or recitals contained in this Agreement or in the certificates, if any, for securities purchasable upon exercise of Rights or the Rights Certificates (except its countersignature thereof) or be required to verify the same, but all such statements and recitals are and will be deemed to have been made by the Company only.
(e) The Rights Agent shall not have any liability or be under any responsibility in respect of the validity of this Agreement or the execution and delivery hereof (except the due execution hereof by the Rights Agent) or in respect of the validity or execution
 
of any certificate, if any, for securities purchasable upon exercise of Rights or Rights Certificate (except its countersignature thereof); nor will it be responsible for any breach by the Company of any covenant or condition contained in this Agreement or in any Rights Certificate; nor will it be responsible for any change in the exercisability of the Rights (including the Rights becoming null and void pursuant to this Agreement) or any change or adjustment in the terms of the Rights including the manner, method or amount thereof provided for in Sections 2.3, 3.1 or 3.2 hereof or the ascertaining of the existence of facts that would require any such change or adjustment (except with respect to the exercise of Rights after receipt of the certificate contemplated by Section 2.3 describing any such change or adjustment upon which the Rights Agent may rely); nor will it by any act hereunder be deemed to make any representation or warranty as to the authorization or reservation of any securities purchasable upon exercise of Rights or any Rights or as to whether any securities purchasable upon exercise of Rights will, when issued, be duly and validly authorized, executed, issued and delivered and fully paid and nonassessable.
(f) The Company agrees that it will perform, execute, acknowledge and deliver or cause to be performed, executed, acknowledged and delivered all such further and other acts, instruments and assurances as may reasonably be required by the Rights Agent for the carrying out or performing by the Rights Agent of the provisions of this Agreement.
(g) The Rights Agent is hereby authorized and directed to accept instructions with respect to the performance of its duties hereunder from any Person believed by the Rights Agent to be the Chairman of the Board, the President or any Vice President or the Secretary or any Assistant Secretary or the Treasurer or any Assistant Treasurer of the Company, and to apply to such Persons for advice or instructions in connection with its duties, and such instructions shall be full authorization and protection to the Rights Agent and the Rights Agent shall incur no
 
liability for or in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by it in accordance with instructions of any such Person or for any delay in acting while waiting for those instructions. The Rights Agent shall be fully authorized and protected in relying upon the most recent instructions received by any such officer.
(h) The Rights Agent and any member, affiliate, stockholder, director, officer or employee of the Rights Agent may buy, sell or deal in Common Stock, Rights or other securities of the Company or become pecuniarily interested in any transaction in which the Company may be interested, or contract with or lend money to the Company or otherwise act as fully and freely as though it were not Rights Agent under this Agreement. Nothing herein shall preclude the Rights Agent or any such member, affiliate, stockholder, director, officer or employee from acting in any other capacity for the Company or for any other Person.
(i) The Rights Agent may execute and exercise any of the rights or powers hereby vested in it or perform any duty hereunder either itself (through its directors, officers and employees) or by or through its attorneys or agents, and the Rights Agent will not be answerable or accountable for any act, default, neglect or misconduct of any such attorneys or agents or for any loss to the Company or any other Person resulting from any such act, default, neglect or misconduct, absent gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct in the continued employment thereof (each as determined by a final, non-appealable order, judgment, decree or ruling of a court of competent jurisdiction).
(j) No provision of this Agreement shall require the Rights Agent to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder or in the exercise of its rights if it believes that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnification against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it.
 
4.4 . The Rights Agent may resign and be discharged from its duties under this Agreement upon 30 days' notice (or such lesser notice as is acceptable to the Company) in writing mailed to the Company and to each transfer agent of Common Stock known to the Rights Agent by registered or certified mail, and to the holders of the Rights in accordance with Section 5.9. The Company may remove the Rights Agent upon 30 days' notice in writing, mailed to the Rights Agent and to each transfer agent of the Common Stock known to the Rights Agent by registered or certified mail, and to the holders of the Rights in accordance with Section 5.9. If the Rights Agent should resign or be removed or otherwise become incapable of acting, the Company will appoint a successor to the Rights Agent. If the Company fails to make such appointment within a period of 30 days after such removal or after it has been notified in writing of such resignation or incapacity by the resigning or incapacitated Rights Agent or by the holder of any Rights (which holder shall, with such notice, submit such holder's Rights Certificate for inspection by the Company), then the holder of any Rights or the Rights Agent may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a new Rights Agent. Any successor Rights Agent, whether appointed by the Company or by such a court, shall be a Person (or an affiliate of such a Person) organized and doing business under the laws of the United States or any state of the United States, in good standing, which is authorized under such laws to exercise the powers of the Rights Agent contemplated by this Agreement and is subject to supervision or examination by federal or state authority and which has at the time of its appointment as Rights Agent a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000. After appointment, the successor Rights Agent will be vested with the same powers, rights, duties and responsibilities as if it had been originally named as Rights Agent without further act or deed; but the predecessor Rights Agent shall deliver and transfer to the successor Rights Agent any
Change of Rights Agent
 
property at the time held by it hereunder, and execute and deliver any further assurance, conveyance, act or deed necessary for the purpose. Not later than the effective date of any such appointment, the Company will file notice thereof in writing with the predecessor Rights Agent and each transfer agent of the Common Stock, and mail a notice thereof in writing to the holders of the Rights. Failure to give any notice provided for in this Section 4.4, however, or any defect therein, shall not affect the legality or validity of the resignation or removal of the Rights Agent or the appointment of the successor Rights Agent, as the case may be.
5.1 . (a) The Board of Directors of the Company may, at its option, at any time prior to the Flip-in Date, elect to redeem all (but not less than all) the then outstanding Rights at the Redemption Price and the Company, at its option, may pay the Redemption Price either in cash or shares of Common Stock or other securities of the Company deemed by the Board of Directors, in the exercise of its sole discretion, to be at least equivalent in value to the Redemption Price.
Redemption
(b) Immediately upon the action of the Board of Directors of the Company electing to redeem the Rights (or, if the resolution of the Board of Directors electing to redeem the Rights states that the redemption will not be effective until the occurrence of a specified future time or event, upon the occurrence of such future time or event), without any further action and without any notice, the right to exercise the Rights will terminate and each Right, whether or not previously exercised, will thereafter represent only the right to receive the Redemption Price in cash or securities, as determined by the Board of Directors. Promptly after the Rights are redeemed, the Company shall give notice of such redemption to the Rights Agent and the holders of the then outstanding Rights by mailing such notice in accordance with Section 5.9.
 
5.2 . The Rights and this Agreement shall expire at the Expiration Time and no Person shall have any rights pursuant to this Agreement or any Right after the Expiration Time, except, if the Rights are exchanged or redeemed, as provided in Sections 3.1 or 5.1 hereof, respectively.
Expiration
5.3 . Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this Agreement or of the Rights to the contrary, the Company may, at its option, issue new Rights Certificates evidencing Rights in such form as may be approved by its Board of Directors to reflect any adjustment or change in the number or kind or class of shares of stock purchasable upon exercise of Rights made in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. In addition, in connection with the issuance or sale of shares of Common Stock by the Company following the Separation Time and prior to the Expiration Time pursuant to the terms of securities convertible or redeemable into shares of Common Stock or to options, in each case issued or granted prior to, and outstanding at, the Separation Time, the Company shall issue to the holders of such shares of Common Stock, Rights Certificates representing the appropriate number of Rights in connection with the issuance or sale of such shares of Common Stock; , , in each case, (i) no such Rights Certificate shall be issued, if, and to the extent that, the Company shall be advised by counsel that such issuance would create a significant risk of material adverse tax consequences to the Company or to the Person to whom such Rights Certificates would be issued, (ii) no such Rights Certificates shall be issued if, and to the extent that, appropriate adjustment shall have otherwise been made in lieu of the issuance thereof, and (iii) the Company shall have no obligation to distribute Rights Certificates to any Acquiring Person or Affiliate or Associate of an Acquiring Person or any transferee of any of the foregoing.
Issuance of New Rights Certificates
provided
however
 
5.4 . Subject to the last sentence of this Section 5.4, the Company may, and the Rights Agent, if so directed by the Company, shall from time to time supplement or amend this Agreement without the approval of any holders of Rights (i) prior to the Flip-in Date, in any respect and (ii) on or after the Flip-in Date, to make any changes that the Company may deem necessary or desirable and which shall not materially adversely affect the interests of the holders of Rights generally or in order to cure any ambiguity or to correct or supplement any provision contained herein which may be inconsistent with any other provisions herein or otherwise defective. The Rights Agent will, upon the delivery of a certificate from an appropriate officer of the Company that states that the proposed supplement or amendment complies with this Section 5.4, duly execute and deliver any supplement or amendment hereto requested by the Company which satisfies the terms of the preceding sentence. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, the Rights Agent may, but shall not be obligated to, enter into any supplement or amendment that affects the Rights Agent's own rights, duties or immunities under this Agreement and it shall not be bound by any such supplement or amendment not executed by it.
Supplements and Amendments
5.5 . If the Company elects not to issue certificates representing (or register on the stock transfer books of the Company) fractional shares upon exercise or redemption of Rights, the Company shall, in lieu thereof, in the sole discretion of the Board of Directors, either (a) evidence such fractional shares by depositary receipts issued pursuant to an appropriate agreement between the Company and a depositary selected by it, providing that each holder of a depositary receipt shall have all of the rights, privileges and
Fractional Shares
 
preferences to which such holder would be entitled as a beneficial owner of such fractional share, or (b) pay to the registered holder of such Rights the appropriate fraction of the Market Price per share in cash. Whenever a payment for fractional Rights or fractional Shares is to be made by the Rights Agent, the Company shall (i) promptly prepare and deliver to the Rights Agent a certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the facts related to such payment and the prices and/or formulas utilized in calculating such payments, and (ii) provide sufficient monies to the Rights Agent in the form of fully collected funds to make such payments. The Rights Agent shall be fully protected in relying upon such a certificate and shall have no duty with respect to, and shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any payment for fractional Rights or fractional shares under any Section of this Agreement relating to the payment of fractional Rights or fractional shares unless and until the Rights Agent shall have received such a certificate and sufficient monies.
5.6 . Subject to the terms of this Agreement (including Sections 3.1(b) and 5.14), rights of action in respect of this Agreement, other than rights of action vested solely in the Rights Agent, are vested in the respective holders of the Rights; and any holder of any Rights, without the consent of the Rights Agent or of the holder of any other Rights, may, on such holder's own behalf and for such holder's own benefit and the benefit of other holders of Rights, enforce, and may institute and maintain any suit, action or proceeding against the Company to enforce, or otherwise act in respect of, such holder's right to exercise such holder's Rights in the manner provided in such holder's Rights Certificate and in this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing or any remedies available to the holders of Rights, it is specifically acknowledged that the holders of Rights would not have an adequate remedy at law for any breach by the Company of this Agreement and will be entitled to specific performance of the obligations under, and injunctive relief against actual or threatened violations by the Company of, the obligations of any Person subject to this Agreement.

5.7 .

In case the Company shall propose on or after the Separation Time and prior to the Expiration Time (i) to effect or permit a Flip-over Transaction or Event or (ii) to effect the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, then, in each such case, the Company shall give to each holder of a Right, in accordance with Section 5.9 hereof, a notice of such proposed action, which shall specify the date on which such Flip-over Transaction or Event, liquidation, dissolution, or winding up is to take place, and such notice shall be so given at least 20 Business Days prior to the date of the taking of such proposed action.

EXHIBIT B
PARTICIPATING PREFERRED STOCK
There is hereby established a series of Preferred Stock, $.01 par value, of the Corporation, and the designation and certain terms, powers, preferences and other rights of the shares of such series, and certain qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereon, are hereby fixed as follows:
(i) The distinctive serial designation of this series shall be "Participating Preferred Stock" (hereinafter called "this Series"). Each share of this Series shall be identical in all respects with the other shares of this Series except as to the dates from and after which dividends thereon shall be cumulative.
(ii) The number of shares in this Series shall initially be 5,000,000, which number may from time to time be increased or decreased (but not below the number then outstanding) by the Board of Directors. Shares of this Series purchased by the Corporation shall be canceled and shall revert to authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock undesignated as to series. Shares of this Series may be issued in fractional shares, which fractional shares shall entitle the holder, in proportion to such holder's fractional share, to all rights of a holder of a whole share of this Series.
(iii) The holders of full or fractional shares of this Series shall be entitled to receive, when and as declared by the Board of Directors, but only out of funds legally available therefor, dividends, (A) on each date that dividends or other distributions (other than dividends or distributions payable in Common Stock of the Corporation) are payable on or in respect of Common Stock comprising part of the Reference Package (as defined below), in an amount per whole share of this Series equal to the aggregate amount of dividends or other distributions (other than dividends or distributions payable in Common Stock of the Corporation) that would be payable on such date to a holder of the Reference Package and (B) on the last day of March, June, September and December in each year, in an amount per whole share of this Series equal to the excess (if any) of $25.00 over the aggregate dividends paid per whole share of this Series during the three month period ending on such last day. Each such dividend shall be paid to the holders of record of shares of this Series on the date, not exceeding sixty days preceding such dividend or distribution payment date, fixed for the purpose by the Board of Directors in advance of payment of each particular dividend or distribution. Dividends on each full and each fractional share of this Series shall be cumulative from the date such full or fractional share is originally issued; provided that any such full or fractional share originally issued after a dividend record date and on or prior to the dividend payment date to which such record date relates shall not be entitled to receive the dividend payable on such dividend payment date or any amount in respect of the period from such original issuance to such dividend payment date.
The term "Reference Package" shall initially mean 100 shares of Common Stock, par value $.01 per share ("Common Stock"), of the Corporation. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Close of Business on September 27, 2007 (A) declare or pay a dividend on any Common Stock payable in Common Stock, (B) subdivide any Common Stock or (C) combine any Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then and in each such case the Reference Package after such event shall be the Common Stock that a holder of the Reference Package immediately prior to such event would hold thereafter as a result thereof.
Holders of shares of this Series shall not be entitled to any dividends, whether payable in cash, property or stock, in excess of full cumulative dividends, as herein provided on this Series.
So long as any shares of this Series are outstanding, no dividend (other than a dividend in Common Stock or in any other stock ranking junior to this Series as to dividends and upon liquidation) shall be declared or paid or set aside for payment or other distribution declared or made upon the Common Stock or upon any other stock ranking junior to this Series as to dividends or upon liquidation, unless the full cumulative dividends (including the dividend to be paid upon payment of such dividend or other distribution) on all outstanding shares of this Series shall have been, or shall contemporaneously be, paid. When dividends are not paid in full upon this Series and other stock ranking on a parity as to dividends with this Series, all dividends declared upon shares of this Series and any other stock ranking on a parity as to dividends shall be declared pro rata so that in all cases the amount of dividends declared per share on this Series and such other stock shall bear to each other the same ratio that accumulated dividends per share on the shares of the Series and such other stock bear to each other. Neither the Common Stock nor any other stock of the Corporation ranking junior to or on a parity with this Series as to dividends or upon liquidation shall be redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired for any consideration (or any moneys be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any shares of any such stock) by the Corporation (except by conversion into or exchange for stock of the Corporation ranking junior to this Series as to dividends and upon liquidation), unless the full cumulative dividends (including the dividend to be paid upon payment of such dividend, distribution, redemption, purchase or other acquisition) on all outstanding shares of this Series shall have been, or shall contemporaneously be, paid.
(iv) In the event of any merger, consolidation, reclassification or other transaction in which the shares of Common Stock are exchanged for or changed into other stock or securities, cash and/or any other property, then in any such case the shares of this Series shall at the same time be similarly exchanged or changed in an amount per whole share equal to the aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash and/or any other property (payable in kind), as the case may be, that a holder of the Reference Package would be entitled to receive as a result of such transaction.
(v) In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, the holders of full and fractional shares of this Series shall be entitled, before any distribution or payment is made on any date to the holders of the Common Stock or any other stock of the Corporation ranking junior to this Series upon liquidation, to be paid in full an amount per whole share of this Series equal to the greater of
 
(A) $10,000.00 or (B) the aggregate amount distributed or to be distributed prior to such date in connection with such liquidation, dissolution or winding up to a holder of the Reference Package (such greater amount being hereinafter referred to as the "Liquidation Preference"), together with accrued dividends to such distribution or payment date, whether or not earned or declared. If such payment shall have been made in full to all holders of shares of this Series, the holders of shares of this Series as such shall have no right or claim to any of the remaining assets of the Corporation.
In the event the assets of the Corporation available for distribution to the holders of shares of this Series upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, shall be insufficient to pay in full all amounts to which such holders are entitled pursuant to the first paragraph of this Section (v), no such distribution shall be made on account of any shares of any other class or series of Preferred Stock ranking on a parity with the shares of this Series upon such liquidation, dissolution or winding up unless proportionate distributive amounts shall be paid on account of the shares of this Series, ratably in proportion to the full distributable amounts for which holders of all such parity shares are respectively entitled upon such liquidation, dissolution or winding up.
Upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, the holders of shares of this Series then outstanding shall be entitled to be paid out of assets of the Corporation available for distribution to its stockholders all amounts to which such holders are entitled pursuant to the first paragraph of this Section (v) before any payment shall be made to the holders of Common Stock or any other stock of the Corporation ranking junior upon liquidation to this Series.
For the purposes of this Section (v), the consolidation or merger of, or binding share exchange by, the Corporation with any other corporation shall not be deemed to constitute a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation.
(vi) The shares of this Series shall not be redeemable.
(vii) In addition to any other vote or consent of stockholders required by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, of the Corporation, each whole share of this Series shall, on any matter, vote as a class with any other capital stock comprising part of the Reference Package and voting on such matter and shall have the number of votes thereon that a holder of the Reference Package would have.

Exhibit 99.1
Acuity Brands Announces Formation of New Holding Company
ATLANTASeptember 26, 2007Acuity Brands, Inc. (NYSE: AYI) announced today that effective September 26, 2007, it reorganized by creating a new holding company structure. In addition, in connection with the holding company reorganization, the Company completed reorganizations of its subsidiaries to facilitate the previously announced spin-off of Zep Inc.
The primary purposes of the reorganizations were to properly separate the assets and liabilities of the Company's business units into separate subsidiaries and to create a more efficient holding company structure. The business operations of Acuity Brands, Inc. and its subsidiaries will not change as a result of the reorganizations.
As part of the holding company reorganization, a new parent company, Acuity Brands, Inc., was formed. Outstanding shares of the capital stock of the former parent company, which was also named Acuity Brands, Inc., were automatically converted, on a share for share basis, into identical shares of common stock of the new holding company. The new holding company assumed the obligations of the former Acuity Brands, Inc. under the 6.00% notes due 2009 and the 8.375% notes due 2010.
The certificate of incorporation, the bylaws, the executive officers and the board of directors of the new holding company are the same as those of the former Acuity Brands, Inc. in effect immediately prior to the reorganization. The common stock of the new holding company will continue to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "AYI." The rights, privileges and interests of the Company's stockholders will remain the same with respect to the new holding company. The change to the holding company structure was tax free to the Company's stockholders.

(404) 853-1423
October 8, 2007 (BUSINESS WIRE)  Acuity Brands, Inc. (NYSE: AYI) today announced that its Board of Directors has approved the completion of the previously announced spin-off of its specialty products business. The new company will be called Zep Inc., and it is expected to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "ZEP."
ATLANTA,
Acuity Brands will distribute pro rata to its stockholders all of the shares of Zep common stock by means of a stock dividend on October 31, 2007. The stock dividend of one share of Zep common stock for every two shares of Acuity Brands common stock will be paid pro rata to holders of Acuity Brands common stock who hold their shares at the close of business on October 17, 2007, which is the record date for the distribution. No fractional shares of Zep common stock will be distributed. Instead of fractional shares, Zep stockholders will receive cash. Following the distribution, Acuity Brands will not own any shares of Zep, and Zep will be an independent company. Payment of the stock dividend is subject to Zep's registration statement on Form 10 being declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York Stock Exchange approving shares of Zep's common stock for listing.
Shares of Acuity Brands will trade "regular way" throughout the period leading up to and including the distribution date. Anyone who buys or sells shares of Acuity Brands common stock in the "regular way" market prior to and on the distribution date will be buying or selling Acuity Brands stock that includes the entitlement to receive shares of Zep common stock at the distribution date. Accordingly, prior to the distribution date, Acuity Brands' stock price will reflect the benefit of the Zep distribution.
 
On November 1, 2007, the first day of trading following the distribution date, Acuity Brands stock will trade "regular way" without the benefit of the Zep distribution and Zep stock will trade "regular way" as a standalone company.
In addition, Acuity Brands has been advised by the NYSE that shares of Acuity Brands and Zep will trade on a "when issued" basis on the NYSE beginning during the week of October 17, 2007 and continuing throughout the period leading up to the distribution under the symbols "AYI wi" and "ZEP wi," respectively. Acuity Brands "when issued" trades will settle after the distribution date without the benefit of the Zep distribution. Zep "when issued" trades will settle after the distribution date with shares of Zep as a standalone company.
Holders of Acuity Brands common stock are encouraged to consult with their financial advisors regarding the specific implications of trading Acuity Brands common stock on or before the distribution date.
No action is required by holders of Acuity Brands stock to receive their shares of Zep common stock in the distribution, and Acuity Brands stockholders will not be required to surrender any Acuity Brands shares or pay anything in order to receive the dividend. Acuity Brands stockholders who are entitled to receive the stock dividend will receive a book-entry account statement reflecting their ownership of shares of Zep common stock or their brokerage account will be credited for the shares.
Acuity Brands has received an opinion of counsel that the spin-off will be tax-free to Acuity Brands and its stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes, except in respect of cash received in lieu of fractional share interests, which generally will be taxable. No IRS approval is required to complete the transaction.
On or about October 22, 2007, Acuity Brands will mail an information statement to all stockholders entitled to receive the dividend of Zep common stock. The information statement will describe the new company, the various risks involved, including the risks of holding Zep common stock, and other details of the transaction, including additional details regarding the distribution. The information statement is also included as part of the registration statement on Form 10, as amended, filed by Zep with the Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with the transaction and is available at the Commission's website at .

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
The information included pursuant to Item 2.03 is incorporated under this Item 1.01.
Item 1.02. Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement.
As of October 19, 2007, in connection with our entry into the new unsecured revolving credit facility described in Item 2.03 hereof, we terminated the $200 million five-year revolving credit facility, dated as of April 2, 2004, with the syndicate of banks including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as administrative agent. The prior credit facility would have expired on January 31, 2009.
Item 2.03. Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation Under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
On October 19, 2007, we entered into a new $250 million five-year unsecured revolving credit facility ("Revolving Credit Facility") with a syndicate of commercial banks consisting of Bank of America, Branch Banking and Trust Company, JPMorgan Chase Bank ( "Administrative Agent"), KeyBank, Wachovia Bank, and Wells Fargo Bank. The material terms of the Revolving Credit Facility are as set forth below. Additionally, on the same date we amended and extended for a one-year period the Credit and Security Agreement ("Receivables Facility") as set forth below. Counterparties to the Receivables Facility include Variable Funding Capital Company LLC, as Lender, and Wachovia Bank as backstop liquidity provider and agent for the Lender.
Generally, amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a "base rate" or a "Eurocurrency Rate". Base rate advances are denominated in U.S. Dollars, and amounts outstanding bear interest at a fluctuating rate equal to JPMorgan's base rate. Eurocurrency rate advances can be denominated in a variety of currencies, including U.S. Dollars, and amounts outstanding bear interest at a periodic fixed rate equal to LIBOR for the applicable currency plus an applicable margin. The applicable margins are based on our leverage ratio, as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility, with such margins ranging from 0.32% to 0.80%. Interest on both base rate and Eurocurrency rate advances are payable upon the earlier of maturity of the outstanding loan or quarterly if the loan is for a period greater than three months. The Revolving Credit Facility will mature and all amounts outstanding thereunder will be due and payable on October 19, 2012.
We are required to pay certain fees in connection with the Revolving Credit Facility. For example, we must pay an annual facility fee. Such fee is payable quarterly in arrears and is determined by our leverage ratio as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility. This facility fee ranges from 0.08% to 0.20% of the aggregate $250 million commitment of the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility. Additionally, we are also required to pay certain fees to the Agent for administrative services.
The Revolving Credit Facility contains customary covenants regarding the preservation and maintenance of our corporate existence, material compliance with laws, payment of taxes, and maintenance of insurance and of our properties. Further, the Revolving Credit Facility contains financial covenants including a leverage ratio ("Maximum Leverage Ratio") of total indebtedness to EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization expense), as such terms are defined in the Revolving Credit Facility agreement, and a minimum interest coverage ratio. These ratios are computed at the end of each fiscal quarter for the most recent 12-month period. The Revolving Credit Facility allows for a Maximum Leverage Ratio of 3.50x and a Minimum Interest Coverage Ratio of 2.50x. The Revolving Credit Facility includes customary events of default, including, but not limited to, the failure to pay any interest, principal or fees when due, the failure to perform any covenant or agreement, inaccurate or false representations or warranties, insolvency or bankruptcy, change of control, the occurrence of certain ERISA events and judgment defaults.
Additionally, on October 19, 2007, the Company amended the Receivables Facility agreement and then renewed the agreement for a one-year period. The Receivables Facility was amended to allow for borrowings of funds, on an on-going basis, up to $75 million versus the previous maximum borrowing amount of $100 million. Also, the Receivables Facility was amended to include only an undivided interest in a defined pool of trade accounts receivable of Acuity Brands Lighting as security for borrowings under the Receivables Facility; the trade accounts receivable of Acuity Specialty Products were excluded from the amended agreement. Interest rates under the Receivables Facility vary with asset-backed commercial paper rates plus an applicable margin of 0.325%. The commitment fees on the Receivables Facility are 0.125% per annum on the average unused balances.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.

On October 31, 2007, Acuity Brands, Inc. ("Acuity Brands" or the "Company") completed the spin-off of Zep Inc. ("Zep"). The Company distributed all of the shares of Zep common stock, par value $.01 per share, to the Company's stockholders of record as of October 17, 2007. The Company's stockholders received one share, together with an associated preferred stock purchase right, for every two shares of the Company's common stock. Stockholders will receive cash in lieu of fractional shares for amounts less than one full Zep share. The Company has received a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service and an opinion of counsel that, based on certain facts, assumptions, representations, and undertakings, the distribution will be tax-free to Acuity Brands and its stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes, except with respect to cash received in lieu of fractional share interests, which generally will be taxable. Zep's common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "ZEP."
On the date of the spin-off, October 31, 2007 (the "Distribution Date"), the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Distribution (the "Distribution Agreement") with Zep which provides the principal corporate transactions required to effect the spin-off and certain other agreements relating to the continuing relationship with Zep after the spin-off. Pursuant to the Distribution Agreement:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A copy of the Distribution Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
Additionally, in connection with the Distribution, the Company entered into a Tax Disaffiliation Agreement (the "Tax Disaffiliation Agreement") with Zep which provides each party rights and obligations with respect to deficiencies and refunds, if any, of federal, state, local, or foreign taxes for periods before and after the spin-off. The Tax Disaffiliation Agreement, provides that, subject to the terms and conditions in the agreement:
 
 
 
 
 
A copy of the Tax Disaffiliation Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
 
The information included in Item 1.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is incorporated herein by reference to this Item 2.01.
The unaudited pro forma financial information of Acuity Brands required under Item 9.01 of this report is filed as exhibit 99.2 to this current report.
 
As of October 31, 2007, Mr. Earnest W. Deavenport, Jr. resigned from the Acuity Brands Board of Directors to become a member of the Zep Board of Directors.
In addition, as of October 31, 2007, John K. Morgan resigned his position as Executive Vice President of Acuity Brands. Mr. Morgan will serve as Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Zep.
 
On November 1, 2007, Acuity Brands issued a press release announcing the completion of the spin-off of Zep and that each Acuity Brands stockholder of record as of October 17, 2007 received one share of Zep common stock together with an associated preferred stock purchase right, for every two shares of Acuity Brands stock held on that date. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
(b) Pro Forma Financial Information
Due to the October 31, 2007 spin-off of Zep Inc. ("Zep"), the financial statements of Acuity Brands, Inc. ("Acuity Brands" or "the Company") issued subsequent to that date will report, for all periods presented within those statements, the historical operating results of the Acuity Specialty Products, Inc. segment as discontinued operations. The following Acuity Brands, Inc. Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Statements reflecting the spin-off are based on and should be read in conjunction with the Company's historical Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes appearing in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2007 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on October 30, 2007 (File No. 001-16583).
The Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended August 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005 are prepared as though the spin-off occurred as of the beginning of each period presented. The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of August 31, 2007, is prepared as if the spin-off occurred as of August 31, 2007. Pro forma adjustments are described in the Notes to Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Statements.
The following Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Statements are presented for illustrative and informational purposes only and are not intended to represent or be indicative of the financial condition or results of operations which would actually have been recorded if the spin-off had occurred at the beginning of each period presented. In addition, the Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Statements are not intended to represent the Company's financial position or results of operations for any future date or period.
 The discontinued operations as presented in this Form 8-K and in Acuity Brands' historical financial statements differ from the Combined Financial Statements of Zep included in the information statement included as exhibit 99.1 to Zep's Registration Statement on Form 10 filed with the SEC on October 10, 2007 as follows:
Comparison to Zep Inc. Form 10
 
Allocation of corporate expenses to discontinued operations must be made in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144: andEITF 87-24 ("EITF 87-24") rather than SAB 55. Therefore, the allocation of corporate expenses to Acuity Brands' discontinued operations was limited to those corporate costs which could be specifically linked to the operations of the specialty products business. As a result of the spin-off and the presentation of the specialty products business apart from Acuity Brands' continuing operations, the Company's historical corporate selling, distribution, and administrative expenses, which include all of specialty products share based compensation expense, will be reduced by $5.2 million, $3.9 million, and $3.3 million for the years ended August 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively.

(c) Section 2.4(a) shall not apply to any payment of foreign Income Tax that is due after the Distribution Date in connection with the filing of any SpinCo Separate Return for any Straddle Period. Rather, within sixty (60) days after the Distribution Date, Parent shall provide a statement to SpinCo containing a reasonably detailed estimate of the amount of such foreign Income Taxes attributable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Distribution Date.

(b) Transactions occurring, or actions taken, on the Distribution Date but after the Distribution outside the ordinary course of business by, or with respect to, SpinCo or any of its Affiliates shall be deemed subject to the "next day rule" of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) (and under any comparable or similar provision under state, local or foreign laws or regulations, provided that if there is no comparable or similar provision under state, local or foreign laws or regulations, then the transaction will be deemed subject to the "next day rule" and as such shall for purposes of this Agreement be treated (and consistently reported by the parties) as occurring in a Post-Distribution Tax Period of SpinCo or a SpinCo Affiliate, as appropriate).
(c) Any Taxes for a Straddle Period shall, for purposes of this Agreement, be apportioned between the portion of the period ending on and including the Distribution Date and the portion of the period beginning after the Distribution Date, and each such portion of such period shall be deemed to be a taxable period (whether or not it is in fact a taxable period). Any allocation of income or deductions required to determine any Income Taxes for a Straddle Period shall be made by means of a closing of the books and records of SpinCo and its Affiliates as of the close of business on the Distribution Date, provided that (i) Parent may elect to allocate Tax Items (other than any extraordinary Tax Items) ratably in the month in which the Distribution occurs (and if Parent so elects, SpinCo shall so elect) as described in Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-76(b)(2)(iii) and corresponding provisions of state, local, and foreign Tax laws; and (ii) subject to clause (i), exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis, and not on a closing of the books method (including, but not limited to, depreciation and amortization deductions) shall be allocated between the period ending on and including the Distribution Date and the period beginning after the Distribution Date based on the number of days for the portion of the Straddle Period ending on and including the Distribution Date, on the one hand, and the number of days for the portion of the Straddle Period beginning after the Distribution Date, on the other hand.
(d) Tax attributes determined on a consolidated or combined basis for taxable periods ending before or including the Distribution Date shall be allocated to Parent and its Affiliates, and SpinCo and its Affiliates, in accordance with the Code and the Treasury
 
Regulations (and any applicable state, local, or foreign law or regulation). Parent shall reasonably determine the amounts and proper allocation of such attributes. Parent and SpinCo agree to compute their Tax liabilities for taxable periods after the Distribution Date consistent with that determination and allocation, and treat the Tax Items as reflected on any federal (or applicable state, local or foreign) Income Tax Return filed by the parties as presumptively correct.
Section 2.6 . Except as provided in Section 2.7:

(b) Parent and SpinCo shall each forward to the other party, or reimburse such other party for, any refunds received by the first party and due to such other party pursuant to this Section. Where a refund is received in the form of a credit against other or future Tax liabilities, reimbursement with respect to such refund shall be due in each case on the due date for payment of the Tax against which such refund has been credited. All payments made pursuant to this Section 2.6 shall describe in reasonable detail the basis for the calculation of the amount being paid.
(c) If one party reasonably so requests, the other party (at the first party's expense) shall file for and pursue any refund to which the first party is entitled under this Section, provided that the other party need not pursue any refund on behalf of the first party unless the first party provides the other party a certification by an appropriate officer of the first party setting forth the first party' s belief (together with supporting analysis) that the Tax treatment of the Tax Items on which the entitlement to such refund is based is more likely than not correct, and is not a Tax Item arising from a Reportable Transaction.
(d) If the other party pays any amount to the first party under this Section 2.6 and, as a result of a subsequent Final Determination, the first party is not entitled to some or all of such amount, the other party shall notify the first party of the amount to be repaid to the other party, and the first party shall then repay such amount to the other party, together with any interest, fines, additions to Tax, penalties or any other additional amounts imposed by a Taxing Authority relating thereto.
Section 2.7 .
Carrybacks
(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, SpinCo shall file (or cause to be filed) on a timely basis any available election to waive the carryback of net operating losses, Tax credits or other Tax Items by SpinCo or any Affiliate from a Post-Distribution Tax Period to a Straddle Period or Pre-Distribution Tax Period.
(b) If, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.7(a), SpinCo is required to carry back losses or credits, SpinCo shall be entitled to any refund of any Tax obtained
 
by Parent or a Parent Affiliate as a result of the carryback of losses or credits of SpinCo or a SpinCo Affiliate from any Post-Distribution Tax Period to any Pre-Distribution Tax Period or Straddle Period. Such refund is limited to the net amount received by Parent or a Parent Affiliate (by refund, offset against other Taxes, or otherwise), net of any Tax Detriment incurred by Parent or such Affiliate resulting from such refund. Upon request by SpinCo, Parent shall advise SpinCo of an estimate of any Tax Detriment Parent projects will be associated with any carryback of losses or credits of SpinCo and its Affiliates provided in this Section 2.7(b).
(c) If SpinCo has a Tax Item that must be carried back to any Pre-Distribution Tax Period, SpinCo shall notify in writing Parent that such Tax Item must be carried back. Such notification shall include a description in reasonable detail of the grounds for the refund and the amount thereof, and a certification by an appropriate officer of SpinCo setting forth SpinCo's belief (together with supporting analysis) that the Tax treatment of such Tax Item is more likely than not correct, and is not a Tax Item arising from a Reportable Transaction.
(d) If Parent pays any amount to SpinCo under Section 2.7(b) and, as a result of a subsequent Final Determination, SpinCo is not entitled to some or all of such amount, Parent shall notify SpinCo of the amount to be repaid to Parent, and SpinCo shall then repay such amount to Parent, together with any interest, fines, additions to Tax, penalties or any other additional amounts imposed by a Taxing Authority relating thereto.

Under those procedures, SpinCo may irrevocably elect, in its sole discretion, to require the Tax Advisor or the arbitrator to determine either (x) the amount of a settlement with the relevant Taxing Authority that would most accurately reflect the litigation risk of the relevant issue, or (y) the most likely outcome of the issue if it were litigated without a settlement. In either such case, SpinCo shall be liable to Parent, or Parent shall be liable to SpinCo, based solely on the determination of the Tax Advisor or the arbitrator as if a settlement or litigation implementing such determination had actually occurred, without regard to the actual settlement. For the avoidance of doubt, this clause (ii) shall not limit Parent's ability to settle a Tax Contest.
(b) Parent and SpinCo shall jointly control Tax Contests relating to Tax liability arising from the failure of the Distribution to qualify for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code, if SpinCo potentially would be liable to Parent under Article II as a result of such Tax Contest. Neither party shall have the right to settle any such Tax Contest without the consent of the other party.
(c) SpinCo shall have sole control over any Tax Contest relating to the SpinCo Separate Returns (other than U.S. state and local Income Tax Returns for taxable periods
 
ending on or before the Distribution Date); , , that if Parent is responsible under this Agreement for any Taxes relating to such Tax Contest, then:

(ii) If Parent disagrees with SpinCo's decision to settle such Tax Contest, it shall have the right to contest its liability to SpinCo under Article II notwithstanding the settlement. Parent shall provide written notice to SpinCo of its intention to contest its liability as a result of any settlement (and its irrevocable election described below) prior to the time such settlement is entered into. Any such contest by Parent shall be made under the procedures set forth in Article VI. Under those procedures, Parent may irrevocably elect, in its sole discretion, to require the Tax Advisor or the arbitrator to determine either (x) the amount of a settlement with the relevant Taxing Authority that would most accurately reflect the litigation risk of the relevant issue, or (y) the most likely outcome of the issue if it were litigated without a settlement. In either such case, Parent shall be liable to SpinCo, or SpinCo shall be liable to Parent, based solely on the determination of the Tax Advisor or the arbitrator as if a settlement or litigation implementing such determination had actually occurred, without regard to the actual settlement. For the avoidance of doubt, this clause (ii) shall not limit SpinCo's ability to settle a Tax Contest.
(d) Any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in handling, settling or contesting any Tax Contest shall be borne ratably by the parties based on their ultimate liability under this Agreement for the Taxes to which the Tax Contest relates; , , that (x) if SpinCo contests a settlement made by Parent as provided in clause (ii) of paragraph (a), Parent shall bear the costs relating to SpinCo's contest of such settlement unless Parent substantially prevails in such contest and (y) if Parent contests a settlement made by SpinCo as provided in clause (ii) of paragraph (c), SpinCo shall bear the costs related to Parent's contest of such settlement unless SpinCo substantially prevails in such contest.

The Indemnitee shall provide to the Indemnifying Party notice of such claim within ten (10) days of the date on which it first becomes so entitled to claim such payment, including a description of such claim and a detailed calculation of the amount of the indemnification payment that is claimed; , , that no

delay on the part of the Indemnitee in notifying the Indemnifying Party shall relieve the Indemnifying Party from any obligation hereunder unless (and then solely to the extent) the Indemnifying Party is actually and materially prejudiced thereby. Except as provided in paragraph (b), the Indemnifying Party shall make the claimed payment to the Indemnitee within ten (10) days after receiving such notice, unless the Indemnifying Party reasonably disputes its liability for, or the amount of, such payment.
(b) If the Indemnitee will be obligated to make the payment described in paragraph (a) to a Taxing Authority or other third party (including expenses reimbursable under this Agreement), the Indemnifying Party shall not be obligated to pay the Indemnitee more than five (5) days before the Indemnitee incurs such expense or makes such payment. If the Indemnitee's claim for payment arises from a payment that the Indemnifying Party will receive from a third party, such as a refund, the Indemnifying Party shall not be obligated to pay the Indemnitee until five (5) days after the Indemnifying Party receives such payment.
(c) In the case of a claim under Article II where no payment will be made to or received from a Taxing Authority, paragraph (b) shall be applied to the payments that would be made to or from a Taxing Authority if the SpinCo Group were treated as a standalone group for all taxable periods.
Section 5.4 .

The amount of all indemnification obligations under this Agreement shall be decreased to take into account the Tax Benefits to the Indemnitee of the deductibility or creditability of any indemnified item and shall be increased where necessary so that, after all the required deductions have been made and Taxes imposed, the Indemnitee receives the net amount it would have been entitled to receive under this Agreement in the absence of such deductions and Taxes. Any payments made to one party by another party pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated by the parties for all Tax purposes as a distribution by, or capital contribution to, SpinCo, as the case may be, made immediately prior to the Distribution, except to the extent otherwise required by a Final Determination.

Exhibit 99.1
Acuity Brands Completes Spin-off of Zep Inc. and Announces Additional Stock Repurchase Program
ATLANTANov. 1, 2007Acuity Brands, Inc. (NYSE: AYI) today announced that it completed the spin-off of Zep Inc. (NYSE: ZEP) to the stockholders of Acuity Brands. The spin-off was completed on October 31, 2007 when each stockholder of record as of October 17, 2007 received one share of Zep common stock, together with an associated preferred stock purchase right, for every two shares of Acuity Brands stock held on that date. Stockholders of Acuity Brands will receive cash in lieu of fractional shares of Zep stock. As a result of the distribution, Zep is now an independent public company. Immediately prior to the spin-off, Acuity Brands received a dividend of $62.5 million from Zep.
Vernon J. Nagel, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Acuity Brands, said, "The completion of the spin-off provides for greater strategic clarity at Acuity Brands. We believe this transaction will meaningfully enhance value for stockholders because it will enable both Acuity Brands Lighting and Zep to more aggressively pursue their own distinct strategic initiatives and individual profitable growth opportunities with a sharpened focus."
Effective October 31, 2007, the Board of Directors of Acuity Brands authorized the repurchase of an additional 2,000,000 shares, or almost 5%, of the Company's outstanding common stock. Also, the Company has authorization to buy back a remaining 811,400 shares of outstanding common stock under the repurchase program announced in August of this year. During the first two months of the current fiscal quarter, the Company repurchased under the previously announced share repurchase program nearly 1.2 million outstanding shares.
Under the share repurchase programs, the Company expects to acquire shares primarily through open market transactions, subject to market conditions and other factors. The Company may enter into Rule 10b5-1 plans to facilitate open market repurchases under the programs. A Rule 10b5-1 plan would generally permit the Company to repurchase shares at times when it might otherwise be prevented from doing so under certain securities laws provided the plan is adopted when the Company is not in possession of material non-public information. Shares repurchased under the programs may be retired or used for general corporate purposes, which may include the Company's share-based compensation and employee benefit plans.
Mr. Nagel continued, "The Board's approval of this additional share repurchase program is a reflection of our confidence in the Company's future and its ability to continue to generate strong cash flow from operations. We believe that the repurchase program supports Acuity Brands' objective to maximize long-term stockholder value, while continuing to fund investments to better serve our customers, to grow our businesses, and to improve our operating and financial performance."
Acuity Brands, Inc. owns and operates Acuity Brands Lighting. With fiscal year 2007 net sales of approximately $2.0 billion, Acuity Brands Lighting is one of the world's leading providers of lighting fixtures and related services and includes brands such as Lithonia Lighting(R), Holophane(R), Peerless(R), Mark Architectural Lighting(R), Hydrel(R), American Electric Lighting(R), Gotham(R), Carandini(R), SpecLight(R), MetalOptics(R), Antique Street Lamps(TM), and Synergy Lighting Controls(R).

Acuity Brands, Inc.
(404) 853-1423
ATLANTA  January 8, 2008  Acuity Brands, Inc. (NYSE: AYI) today announced results for the first quarter of fiscal 2008, including a 37 percent increase in adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations to $0.93 compared with $0.68 for the prior year period. Adjusted diluted EPS for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 excludes a $14.6 million pre-tax special charge, or $0.21 per diluted share, as explained below. Net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 increased 6.6 percent to a record $508.9 million compared with $477.6 million for the year-ago period. The results for both periods exclude the specialty chemicals business, which was spun off to the shareholders of Acuity Brands on October 31, 2007 as Zep Inc. The historical results of the specialty chemicals business are now reported in discontinued operations of the Company.
Vernon J. Nagel, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Acuity Brands said, "We are very pleased to report record quarterly results from continuing operations excluding the special charge for the first quarter. This is our 11th quarter in a row of quarter-over-quarter record results. Our strong first quarter performance reflects the benefits from programs implemented to create greater value for our customers, to invest in our associates to be more customer-focused and productive, and to more effectively deploy our assets to generate greater returns for our stakeholders."
Income from continuing operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2008, which includes the special charge, was $30.9 million, or $0.72 per diluted share, compared to the prior year's first quarter income from continuing operations of $29.5 million, or $0.68 per diluted share. The $14.6 million ($0.21 per diluted share) special charge included in fiscal 2008 first quarter income from continuing operations is related to recent and planned actions to streamline and simplify the Company's organizational structure and
 
operations as a result of the spin-off of Zep Inc, including eliminating most of the corporate office space. The Company expects to realize annual cost savings of approximately $14 million as a result of its reorganization efforts. While the Company expects to realize benefits from a more simplified organization throughout the remainder of fiscal 2008, the full benefits are expected to be realized beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2009.
The year-over-year increase in net sales reflects a more favorable mix of products sold and more favorable pricing as well as unit volume growth in shipments of non-residential lighting fixtures, partially offset by a decline in sales of residential fixtures and related products. Additionally, net sales from the recent acquisition of Mark Architectural Lighting contributed 1.2 percentage points of year-over-year growth in net sales.
Operating profit for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 was $54.9 million, or 10.8 percent of net sales. Excluding the special charge, adjusted operating profit for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 was $69.5 million, or 13.7 percent of net sales. The year-over-year 250 basis point improvement in the adjusted operating profit margin was due primarily to a better mix of products sold driven by new products, more favorable pricing, incremental profit contribution on unit volume growth, and improved productivity.
Acuity Brands completed the spin-off of Zep Inc. (the business formerly known as Acuity Specialty Products) on October 31, 2007. Therefore, the Company reflects the results of Zep Inc. as a discontinued operation reported as a one-line item on the income statement. For the first quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company reported income from discontinued operations of $0.1 million, or effectively no impact on diluted earnings per share, compared to the prior year's first quarter income of $4.1 million, or $0.09 per diluted share. Income from discontinued operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 includes non-tax-deductible spin-off costs of $5.5 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, primarily for legal and professional fees.
Including the results of discontinued operations, the Company reported first quarter fiscal 2008 diluted earnings per share of $0.72, or $31.1 million of net income, compared to $0.77 diluted earnings per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2007, or $33.6 million of net
 
income. Reported earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 includes the special charge of $0.21 per diluted share.
Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the first fiscal quarter totaled $201.7 million, a decrease of $12.0 million from the $213.7 million at the beginning of the fiscal year. During the first quarter, the Company repurchased approximately two million shares of outstanding common stock at a cost of $93.1 million. The use of cash for stock repurchases was partially offset by a $62.5 million cash dividend received from Zep Inc. prior to the spin-off.
Outlook
Mr. Nagel commented, "While we anticipate that the second quarter will once again be challenging due primarily to normal seasonal factors, including inconsistent customer demand and the potential for inventory rebalancing by certain customers, we believe that our consolidated first quarter results support our positive performance expectations for 2008. Additionally, our backlog at the end of the first quarter was $171 million, a 7 percent increase over the prior year, and incoming order rates for lighting fixtures, while sometimes inconsistent, continue to be encouraging.
"Overall, we remain positive about our performance for the remainder of fiscal 2008. Clearly, certain of our markets are experiencing economic headwinds that will influence demand. However, we believe we can drive profitable growth by providing our customers with superior value through ongoing programs to enhance service, improve product quality, and accelerate the introduction of new, innovative and energy-efficient products and services, while maintaining our disciplined approach to pricing. In addition, results going forward should benefit from previous price increases and our on-going initiatives to improve productivity and contain costs, including expected savings from reorganization efforts associated with the special charge taken this quarter. Based on current order rates and third-party projections of construction activity, we also anticipate continued positive unit volume growth in key areas of the non-residential construction market through the remainder of the fiscal year.
 
"While we are positive about our future prospects, we, of course, are not without challenges in 2008. We continue to monitor economic factors such as costs for energy, raw materials and components; the uncertainty caused by the potential for more strict lending standards for commercial projects; the potential for a slowing U.S. economy, which could impact the pace of growth in non-residential construction; the potential economic repercussions that could result from instability caused by worldwide political events; the risk for changes in competitive pricing dynamics; and the impact of the significant decline in the residential housing market. However, all this notwithstanding, we believe that we are positioned to continue to prosper because of benefits from our intense focus on expanding our industry-leading, energy-efficient product portfolio, providing our customers with unparalleled service, improving company-wide productivity, and further penetration of growing markets such as lighting renovation. As such, we expect to meet or exceed our longer-term financial goals including operating margin expansion, earnings growth, and cash flow generation."
Please see the Company's Form 10-Q to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission by the end of day on Wednesday for more information on fiscal 2008 first quarter results. You may access the 10-Q through the Company's website at .

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Acuity Brands' management included in the above news release the terms "adjusted diluted EPS", "adjusted operating profit", and "adjusted operating profit margin" which are non-GAAP financial measures provided to enhance the user's overall understanding of the Company's current financial performance and prospects for the future. Specifically, management believes the non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors by excluding or adjusting certain items affecting reported operating results that were unusual and not indicative of the Company's core operating results. The non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, results prepared in accordance with GAAP. The most directly comparable GAAP measures for adjusted diluted EPS, adjusted operating profit, and adjusted operating profit margin are "diluted EPS from continuing operations", "operating profit", and "operating profit margin", respectively, all of which include the
 
impact of special items. The non-GAAP financial measures included in this news release have been reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure.
Conference Call
As previously announced, the Company will host a conference call to discuss first quarter results today at 10:00 a.m. ET. Interested parties may listen to this call live today or hear a replay at the Company's Web site: www.acuitybrands.com.

ATLANTA, January 10, 2008  The Board of Directors of Acuity Brands, Inc. (NYSE: AYI) today declared a quarterly dividend of 13 cents per share (an annualized rate of 52 cents per share). The dividend is payable on February 1, 2008 to shareholders of record on January 21, 2008. This represents a decrease of 2 cents per share and reflects the Company's previously announced plans to adjust the dividend amount following the spin-off of the specialty products business, now known as Zep Inc. (Zep), in anticipation that the future annual dividend amount paid by Zep combined with the future annual dividend amount paid by Acuity Brands would equal the annual dividend amount paid by Acuity Brands prior to the spin-off.

WHEREAS, the Company is aware that, in order to induce highly competent persons to serve the Company as directors, officers, employees or in other capacities, the Company must provide such persons with adequate protection through insurance and indemnification against inordinate risks of claims and actions against them arising out of their service to and activities on behalf of the Company;
WHEREAS, the Company recognizes that the increasing difficulty in obtaining directors' and officers' liability insurance, the increases in the cost of such insurance and the general reductions in the coverage of such insurance have increased the difficulty of attracting and retaining such persons;
WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company's stockholders that the Company act to assure such persons that there will be increased certainty of such protection in the future;
WHEREAS, it is reasonable, prudent and necessary for the Company contractually to obligate itself to indemnify such persons to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law so that they will continue to serve the Company free from undue concern that they will not be so indemnified; and
WHEREAS, the Indemnitee is willing to serve, continue to serve, and take on additional service for or on behalf of the Company or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries on the condition that he/she be so indemnified.
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants contained herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Company and Indemnitee do hereby agree as follows:
1. . The Indemnitee agrees to serve and/or continue to serve as a director, officer, employee or other agent of the Company faithfully and will discharge his/her duties and responsibilities to the best of his/her ability so long as the Indemnitee is duly elected or qualified in accordance with the provisions of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (the "Certificate"), and Amended and Restated By-laws, as amended (the "By-laws") of the Company, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as amended (the "DGCL"), and any other applicable law in effect on the date of this Agreement and from time to time, or until his/her earlier death, resignation or removal. The Indemnitee may at any time and for any reason resign from such position (subject to any other contractual obligation or other obligation imposed by operation by law), in which event the
Service by the Indemnitee
Company shall have no obligation under this Agreement to continue the employment or directorship of the Indemnitee. Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon the Indemnitee the right to continue in the employ of the Company or as a director of the Company or affect the right of the Company to terminate the Indemnitee's employment at any time in the sole discretion of the Company, with or without cause, subject to any contract rights of the Indemnitee created or existing otherwise than under this Agreement.
2. . The Company shall indemnify the Indemnitee against all Expenses (as defined below), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee as provided in this Agreement to the fullest extent permitted by the Certificate, By-laws and DGCL or other applicable law in effect on the date of this Agreement and to any greater extent that applicable law may in the future from time to time permit. Without diminishing the scope of the indemnification provided by this Section 2, the rights of indemnification of the Indemnitee provided hereunder shall include, but shall not be limited to, those rights hereinafter set forth, except that no indemnification shall be paid to the Indemnitee:
Indemnification
(a) on account of any action, suit or proceeding in which judgment is rendered against the Indemnitee for disgorgement of profits made from the purchase or sale by the Indemnitee of securities of the Company pursuant to the provisions of Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Act"), or similar provisions of any federal, state or local statutory law;
(b) on account of conduct of the Indemnitee which is finally adjudged by a court of competent jurisdiction to have been knowingly fraudulent or to constitute willful misconduct;
(c) in any circumstance where such indemnification is expressly prohibited by applicable law;
(d) with respect to liability for which payment is actually made to the Indemnitee under a valid and collectible insurance policy of the Company or under a valid and enforceable indemnity clause, By-law or agreement (other than this Agreement) of the Company, except in respect of any liability in excess of payment under such insurance policy, indemnity clause, By-law or agreement;
(e) if a final decision by a court having jurisdiction in the matter shall determine that such indemnification is not lawful (and, in this respect, both the Company and the Indemnitee have been advised that it is the position of the Securities and Exchange Commission that indemnification for liabilities arising under the federal securities laws is against public policy and is, therefore, unenforceable, and that claims for indemnification should be submitted to the appropriate court for adjudication); or
(f) in connection with any action, suit or proceeding by the Indemnitee against the Company or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries or the directors, officers, employees or other Indemnitees of the Company or any of its
 
direct or indirect subsidiaries, (i) unless such indemnification is expressly required to be made by law, (ii) unless the proceeding was authorized by the Board of Directors of the Company, (iii) unless such indemnification is provided by the Company, in its sole discretion, pursuant to the powers vested in the Company under applicable law, or (iv) except as provided in Sections 11 and 13 hereof.
3. . The Indemnitee shall be entitled to the indemnification rights provided in this Section 3 if the Indemnitee was or is a party or witness or is threatened to be a party or witness to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative in nature, other than an action by or in the right of the Company, by reason of the fact that the Indemnitee is or was a director, officer, employee, agent or fiduciary of the Company, or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries, or is or was serving at the request of the Company, or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries, as a director, officer, employee, agent or fiduciary of any other entity, including, but not limited to, another corporation, partnership, limited liability company, employee benefit plan, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or by reason of any act or omission by him/her in such capacity. Pursuant to this Section 3, the Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all Expenses, judgments, penalties (including excise and similar taxes), fines and amounts paid in settlement which were actually and reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with such action, suit or proceeding (including, but not limited to, the investigation, defense or appeal thereof), if the Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner the Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his/her conduct was unlawful.
Actions or Proceedings Other Than an Action by or in the Right of the Company
4. . The Indemnitee shall be entitled to the indemnification rights provided in this Section 4 if the Indemnitee was or is a party or witness or is threatened to be made a party or witness to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding brought by or in the right of the Company to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that the Indemnitee is or was a director, officer, employee, agent or fiduciary of the Company, or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries, or is or was serving at the request of the Company, or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries, as a director, officer, employee, agent or fiduciary of another entity, including, but not limited to, another corporation, partnership, limited liability company, employee benefit plan, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or by reason of any act or omission by him/her in any such capacity. Pursuant to this Section 4, the Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him/her in connection with the defense or settlement of such action, suit or proceeding (including, but not limited to the investigation, defense or appeal thereof), if the Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner the Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company; provided, however, that no such indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which the Indemnitee shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Company, unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or the court in which such action, suit or proceeding was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, the Indemnitee is fairly and reasonably entitled to be
Actions by or in the Right of the Company
 
indemnified against such Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him/her which such court shall deem proper.
5. . For purposes of this Agreement, the Indemnitee shall be deemed to have acted in good faith and in a manner the Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company, or, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding to have had no reasonable cause to believe the Indemnitee's conduct was unlawful, if such action was based on a reasonable reliance upon (i) the records of the Company and (ii) information, opinions, reports or statements presented to the Company by any of the Company's officer's or employees, or committees.
Good Faith Definition
6. . Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Agreement, to the extent that the Indemnitee has served on behalf of the Company, or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries, as a witness or other participant in any class action or proceeding, or has been successful, on the merits or otherwise, in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in Sections 3 and 4 hereof, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, including, but not limited to, the dismissal of any action without prejudice, the Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee in connection therewith, regardless of whether or not the Indemnitee has met the applicable standards of Section 3 or 4 and without any determination pursuant to Section 8.
Indemnification for Expenses of Successful Party
7. . If the Indemnitee is entitled under any provision of this Agreement to indemnification by the Company for some or a portion of the Expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with the investigation, defense, appeal or settlement of such suit, action, investigation or proceeding described in Section 3 or 4 hereof, but is not entitled to indemnification for the total amount thereof, the Company shall nevertheless indemnify the Indemnitee for the portion of such Expenses, judgments, penalties, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee to which the Indemnitee is entitled.
Partial Indemnification
8. . (a) To obtain indemnification under this Agreement, Indemnitee shall submit to the Company a written request, including documentation and information which is reasonably available to Indemnitee and is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification. The Secretary of the Company shall, promptly upon receipt of a request for indemnification, advise the Board of Directors in writing that Indemnitee has requested indemnification. Any Expenses incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with the Indemnitee's request for indemnification hereunder shall be borne by the Company. The Company hereby indemnifies and agrees to hold the Indemnitee harmless for any Expenses incurred by Indemnitee under the immediately preceding sentence irrespective of the outcome of the determination of the Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification.
Procedure for Determination of Entitlement to Indemnification
(b) Upon written request by the Indemnitee for indemnification pursuant to Section 3 or 4 hereof, the entitlement of the Indemnitee to indemnification pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be determined by the following person or persons, who shall be empowered to make such determination: (i) if a Change in Control (as hereinafter defined) shall have occurred,
 
by Independent Counsel (as hereinafter defined) (unless the Indemnitee shall request in writing that such determination be made by the Board of Directors (or a committee thereof) in the manner provided for in clause (ii) of this Section 8(b)) in a written opinion to the Board of Directors, a copy of which shall be delivered to the Indemnitee; or (ii) if a Change in Control shall not have occurred, (A)(1) by the Board of Directors of the Company, by a majority vote of Disinterested Directors (as hereinafter defined) even though less than a quorum, or (2) by a committee of Disinterested Directors designated by majority vote of Disinterested Directors, even though less than a quorum, or (B) if there are no such Disinterested Directors or, even if there are such Disinterested Directors, if the Board of Directors, by the majority vote of Disinterested Directors, so directs, by Independent Counsel in a written opinion to the Board of Directors, a copy of which shall be delivered to the Indemnitee. Such Independent Counsel shall be selected by the Board of Directors and approved by the Indemnitee. Upon failure of the Board of Directors to so select, or upon failure of the Indemnitee to so approve, such Independent Counsel shall be selected by the Chancellor of the State of Delaware or such other person as the Chancellor shall designate to make such selection. Such determination of entitlement to indemnification shall be made not later than 45 days after receipt by the Company of a written request for indemnification. If the person making such determination shall determine that the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification as to part (but not all) of the application for indemnification, such person shall reasonably prorate such part of indemnification among such claims, issues or matters. If it is so determined that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, payment to Indemnitee shall be made within ten days after such determination.
9. .(a) In making a determination with respect to entitlement to indemnification, the Indemnitee shall be presumed to be entitled to indemnification hereunder and the Company shall have the burden of proof in the making of any determination contrary to such presumption.
Presumptions and Effect of Certain Proceedings
(b) If the Board of Directors, or such other person or persons empowered pursuant to Section 8 to make the determination of whether Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, shall have failed to make a determination as to entitlement to indemnification within 45 days after receipt by the Company of such request, the requisite determination of entitlement to indemnification shall be deemed to have been made and the Indemnitee shall be absolutely entitled to such indemnification, absent actual fraud in the request for indemnification or a prohibition of indemnification under applicable law. The termination of any action, suit, investigation or proceeding described in Section 3 or 4 hereof by judgment, order, settlement or conviction, or upon a plea of or its equivalent, shall not, of itself: (a) create a presumption that the Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner which he/she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, that the Indemnitee has reasonable cause to believe that the Indemnitee's conduct was unlawful; or (b) otherwise adversely affect the rights of the Indemnitee to indemnification, except as may be provided herein.
nolo contendere
10. . All reasonable Expenses actually incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with any threatened or pending action, suit or proceeding shall be paid by the Company in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding, if so requested by the Indemnitee, within 20 days after the receipt by the Company of a statement or
Advancement of Expenses
 
statements from the Indemnitee requesting such advance or advances. The Indemnitee may submit such statements from time to time. The Indemnitee's entitlement to such Expenses shall include those incurred in connection with any proceeding by the Indemnitee seeking an adjudication or award in arbitration pursuant to this Agreement. Such statement or statements shall reasonably evidence the Expenses incurred by the Indemnitee in connection therewith and shall include or be accompanied by a written affirmation by Indemnitee of Indemnitee's good faith belief that Indemnitee has met the standard of conduct necessary for indemnification under this Agreement and an undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnitee to repay such amount if it is ultimately determined that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified against such Expenses by the Company pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise. Each written undertaking to pay amounts advanced must be an unlimited general obligation but need not be secured, and shall be accepted without reference to financial ability to make repayment.
11. . In the event that a determination is made that the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification hereunder or if the payment has not been timely made following a determination of entitlement to indemnification pursuant to Sections 8 and 9, or if Expenses are not advanced pursuant to Section 10, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to a final adjudication in an appropriate court of the State of Delaware or any other court of competent jurisdiction of the Indemnitee's entitlement to such indemnification or advance. Alternatively, the Indemnitee may, at the Indemnitee's option, seek an award in arbitration to be conducted by a single arbitrator in Atlanta, Georgia pursuant to the rules of the American Arbitration Association, such award to be made within 60 days following the filing of the demand for arbitration. The Company shall not unreasonably oppose the Indemnitee's right to seek any such adjudication or award in arbitration or any other claim. Such judicial proceeding or arbitration shall be made , and the Indemnitee shall not be prejudiced by reason of a determination (if so made) that the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification. If a determination is made or deemed to have been made pursuant to the terms of Section 8 or Section 9 hereof that the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, the Company shall be bound by such determination and shall be precluded from asserting that such determination has not been made or that the procedure by which such determination was made is not valid, binding and enforceable. The Company further agrees to stipulate in any such court or before any such arbitrator that the Company is bound by all the provisions of this Agreement and is precluded from making any assertions to the contrary. If the court or arbitrator shall determine that the Indemnitee is entitled to any indemnification hereunder, the Company shall pay all reasonable Expenses actually incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with such adjudication or award in arbitration (including, but not limited to, any appellate proceedings).
Remedies of the Indemnitee in Cases of Determination not to Indemnify or to Advance Expenses
de novo
12. . Promptly after receipt by the Indemnitee of notice of the commencement of any action, suit or proceeding, the Indemnitee will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the Company under this Agreement, notify the Company in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission to so notify the Company will not relieve the Company from any liability that it may have to the Indemnitee otherwise than under this Agreement or otherwise, except to the extent that the Company may suffer material prejudice by reason of such failure. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, with respect to any such action, suit or proceeding as to which the Indemnitee gives notice to the Company of the commencement thereof:
Notification and Defense of Claim
 
(a) The Company will be entitled to participate therein at its own expense.
(b) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 12(b), to the extent that it may wish, the Company, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, shall be entitled to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee. After notice from the Company to the Indemnitee of its election to so assume the defense thereof, the Company shall not be liable to the Indemnitee under this Agreement for any legal or other Expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation or as otherwise provided below. The Indemnitee shall have the right to employ the Indemnitee's own counsel in such action or lawsuit, but the fees and Expenses of such counsel incurred after notice from the Company of its assumption of the defense thereof shall be at the expense of the Indemnitee unless (i) the employment of counsel by the Indemnitee has been authorized in writing by the Company, (ii) the Indemnitee shall have reasonably concluded that there may be a conflict of interest between the Company and the Indemnitee in the conduct of the defense of such action and such determination by the Indemnitee shall be supported by an opinion of counsel, which opinion shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company, or (iii) the Company shall not in fact have employed counsel to assume the defense of the action, in each of which cases the fees and Expenses of counsel shall be at the expense of the Company. The Company shall not be entitled to assume the defense of any action, suit or proceeding brought by or on behalf of the Company or as to which the Indemnitee shall have reached the conclusion provided for in clause (ii) above.
(c) The Company shall not be liable to indemnify the Indemnitee under this Agreement for any amounts paid in settlement of any action, suit or proceeding effected without its written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Company shall not be required to obtain the consent of Indemnitee to settle any action, suit or proceeding which the Company has undertaken to defend if the Company assumes full and sole responsibility for such settlement and such settlement grants Indemnitee a complete and unqualified release in respect of any potential liability.
(d) If, at the time of the receipt of a notice of a claim pursuant to this Section 12, the Company has director and officer liability insurance in effect, the Company shall give prompt notice of the commencement of such proceeding to the insurers in accordance with the procedures set forth in the respective policies. The Company shall thereafter take all necessary or desirable action to cause such insurers to pay, on behalf of the Indemnitee, all amounts payable as a result of such proceeding in accordance with the terms of the policies.
13. . The indemnification and advancement of Expenses provided by this Agreement are cumulative, and not exclusive, and are in addition to any other rights to which the Indemnitee may now or in the future be entitled under any
Other Right to Indemnification
 
provision of the By-laws or Certificate of the Company, any vote of stockholders or Disinterested Directors, any provision of law or otherwise. Except as required by applicable law, the Company shall not adopt any amendment to its By-laws or Certificate the effect of which would be to deny, diminish or encumber the Indemnitee's right to indemnification under this Agreement.
14. . The Company shall maintain directors' and officers' liability insurance for so long as the Indemnitee's services are covered hereunder, provided and to the extent that such insurance is available on a commercially reasonable basis. In the event the Company maintains directors' and officers' liability insurance, Indemnitee shall be named as an insured in such manner as to provide Indemnitee the same rights and benefits as are accorded to the most favorably insured of the Company's officers or directors. However, the Company agrees that the provisions hereof shall remain in effect regardless of whether liability or other insurance coverage is at any time obtained or retained by the Company; except that any payments made to, or on behalf of, Indemnitee under an insurance policy shall reduce the obligations of the Company hereunder.
Director and Officer Liability Insurance
15. . The Company will indemnify the Indemnitee's spouse to whom the Indemnitee is legally married at any time the Indemnitee is covered under the indemnification provided in this Agreement (even if Indemnitee did not remain married to him or her during the entire period of coverage) against any pending or threatened action, suit, proceeding or investigation for the same period, to the same extent and subject to the same standards, limitations, obligations and conditions under which the Indemnitee is provided indemnification herein, if the Indemnitee's spouse (or former spouse) becomes involved in a pending or threatened action, suit, proceeding or investigation solely by reason of his or her status as Indemnitee's spouse, including, without limitation, any pending or threatened action, suit, proceeding or investigation that seeks damages recoverable from marital community property, jointly-owned property or property purported to have been transferred from the Indemnitee to his/her spouse (or former spouse). The Indemnitee's spouse or former spouse also may be entitled to advancement of Expenses to the same extent that Indemnitee is entitled to advancement of Expenses herein. The Company may maintain insurance to cover its obligation hereunder with respect to Indemnitee's spouse (or former spouse) or set aside assets in a trust or escrow fund for that purpose.
Spousal Indemnification
16. . This Agreement is intended to be broader than any statutory indemnification rights applicable in the State of Delaware and shall be in addition to any other rights Indemnitee may have under the Company's Certificate, By-laws, applicable law or otherwise. To the extent that a change in applicable law (whether by statute or judicial decision) permits greater indemnification by agreement than would be afforded currently under the Company's Certificate, By-laws, applicable law or this Agreement, it is the intent of the parties that Indemnitee enjoy by this Agreement the greater benefits so afforded by such change. In the event of any change in applicable law, statute or rule which narrows the right of a Delaware corporation to indemnify a member of its Board of Directors or an officer, employee, agent or fiduciary, such change, to the extent not otherwise required by such law, statute or rule to be applied to this Agreement, shall have no effect on this Agreement or the parties' rights and obligations hereunder.
Intent
 
17. . In the event that the Indemnitee is subject to or intervenes in any action, suit or proceeding in which the validity or enforceability of this Agreement is at issue or seeks an adjudication or award in arbitration to enforce the Indemnitee's rights under, or to recover damages for breach of, this Agreement the Indemnitee, if he/she prevails in whole or in part in such action, shall be entitled to recover from the Company and shall be indemnified by the Company against any actual expenses for attorneys' fees and disbursements reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee.
Attorney's Fees and Other Expenses to Enforce Agreement
18. . The provisions of this Agreement shall cover claims, actions, suits or proceedings whether now pending or hereafter commenced and shall be retroactive to cover acts or omissions or alleged acts or omissions which heretofore have taken place. The Company shall be liable under this Agreement, pursuant to Sections 3 and 4 hereof, for all acts of the Indemnitee while serving as a director and/or officer, notwithstanding the termination of the Indemnitee's service, if such act was performed or omitted to be performed during the term of the Indemnitee's service to the Company.
Effective Date
19. . This Agreement shall survive and continue even though the Indemnitee may have terminated his/her service as a director, officer, employee, agent or fiduciary of the Company or as a director, officer, employee, agent or fiduciary of any other entity, including, but not limited to another corporation, partnership, limited liability company, employee benefit plan, joint venture, trust or other enterprise or by reason of any act or omission by the Indemnitee in any such capacity. This Agreement shall be binding upon the Company and its successors and assigns, including, without limitation, any corporation or other entity which may have acquired all or substantially all of the Company's assets or business or into which the Company may be consolidated or merged, and shall inure to the benefit of the Indemnitee and his/her spouse, successors, assigns, heirs, devisees, executors, administrators or other legal representations. The Company shall require any successor or assignee (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company, by written agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company and the Indemnitee, expressly to assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform if no such succession or assignment had taken place.
Duration of Agreement
20. . Except as expressly required by any Federal or state securities laws or other Federal or state law, neither party shall disclose any payments under this Agreement unless prior approval of the other party is obtained.
Disclosure of Payments
21. . If any provision or provisions of this Agreement shall be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever, (a) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement (including, but not limited to, all portions of any Sections of this Agreement containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby and (b) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this Agreement (including, but not limited to, all portions of any paragraph of this Agreement containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that are not themselves invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent manifest by the provision held invalid, illegal or unenforceable.
Severability
 
22. . This Agreement may be executed by one or more counterparts, each of which shall for all purposes be deemed to be an original but all of which together shall constitute one and the same Agreement. Only one such counterpart signed by the party against whom enforceability is sought shall be required to be produced to evidence the existence of this Agreement.

Acuity Brands, Inc.
(404) 853-1423
ATLANTA  April 3, 2008  Acuity Brands, Inc. (NYSE: AYI) today announced record results for the second quarter of fiscal 2008, including a 64 percent increase in diluted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations of $0.82 compared with $0.50 for the prior year period. Income from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal 2008 rose 55 percent to $34.1 million compared with $22.0 million for the prior year second quarter. The Company generated record second quarter net sales of $482.6 million, an 8.6 percent increase over $444.3 million reported in the year-ago period. The results for both periods exclude the specialty chemicals business, which was spun off to the shareholders of Acuity Brands on October 31, 2007 as Zep Inc. The historical results of the specialty chemicals business are now reported in discontinued operations of the Company.
Vernon J. Nagel, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Acuity Brands said, "We are very pleased to report record quarter-over-quarter results from continuing operations for the 12th quarter in a row. Our strong second quarter performance reflects the benefits from programs implemented to create greater value for our customers, to invest in our associates to be more customer-focused and productive, and to more effectively deploy our assets to generate greater returns for our stakeholders."
The year-over-year increase in net sales reflects an enhanced mix of products sold, more favorable pricing, and unit volume growth. Additionally, net sales from the prior year's acquisition of Mark Architectural Lighting and favorable foreign currency translation of international sales each contributed approximately one percentage point to the year-over-year growth in net sales.
Operating profit for the second quarter of fiscal 2008 was $60.7 million, or 12.6 percent of net sales, as compared to prior year's $39.7 million, or 8.9 percent of net sales. The
 
year-over-year 370 basis point improvement in operating profit margin was due to several factors including: a better mix of products sold driven by new products; more favorable pricing; incremental profit contribution on unit volume growth; and improved productivity.
The Company also achieved record results for the first half of fiscal year 2008 including diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, income from continuing operations, and net sales. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the six months ended February 29, 2008 was $1.54, an increase of 31 percent compared to $1.18 per share for the prior year period. Income from continuing operations for the first half of fiscal 2008 rose to $65.1 million, an increase of 26 percent versus the year-ago period while net sales climbed 7.5 percent to $991.4 million. Results for the first half of fiscal 2008 include a special charge of $14.6 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, recorded in the first quarter. The special charge relates to actions to streamline and simplify the Company's organizational structure and operations as a result of the spin-off of Zep Inc. The Company expects to realize annual cost savings of approximately $14 million as a result of its reorganization efforts. The full benefits are expected to be realized beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2009.
Acuity Brands completed the spin-off of Zep Inc. on October 31, 2007. Therefore, the Company reflects the results of Zep Inc. as a discontinued operation reported as a one-line item on the income statement. For the first half of fiscal 2008, the Company reported income from discontinued operations of $0.1 million, or effectively no impact on diluted earnings per share, compared to the prior year's first half income of $6.4 million, or $0.15 per diluted share. Income from discontinued operations for the first half of fiscal 2008 includes non-tax-deductible spin-off costs of $5.5 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, primarily for legal and professional fees.
Including the results of discontinued operations, the Company reported first half fiscal 2008 diluted earnings per share of $1.55, or $65.2 million of net income, compared to $1.32 diluted earnings per share in the first half of fiscal 2007, or $57.9 million of net income.
Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the second quarter totaled $185.1 million, a decrease of $28.6 million from the $213.7 million at the beginning of the fiscal year. During the six months ending February 29, 2008, the Company repurchased nearly 2.9 million shares of outstanding common stock at a cost of approximately $130 million. The
 
 
use of cash for stock repurchases was partially offset by a $62.5 million cash dividend received from Zep Inc. prior to the spin-off.
Outlook
Mr. Nagel commented, "We remain positive about our performance for the remainder of fiscal 2008. As such, this year we expect to meet or exceed our long-term financial goals including operating margin expansion, earnings growth, and cash flow generation.
"Our backlog at the end of the second quarter was $163 million, down 2 percent versus the prior year; the decline was due primarily to improved cycle times, the timing of certain orders, and a reduction in late backlog. More importantly, incoming orders in March continued at a positive pace compared with the year ago period. To help offset a recent spike in various commodity prices, we recently announced a price increase ranging between 3 and 10 percent, effective early May. Also, we expect to realize benefits from our on-going initiatives to improve productivity and contain costs, including expected savings from efforts to streamline the organization announced in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. In addition, we continue to position the Company, by expanding our extensive product offerings and enhancing our service capabilities, to benefit from opportunities in the growing renovation and the lighting retrofit markets as businesses seek to reduce energy costs and improve aesthetics.
"Looking ahead to the second half of 2008 and beyond, we continue to see challenges as well as opportunities. While the United States economy is experiencing a slowdown resulting from the disruption in the housing and credit markets, it is impossible to predict the precise timing or impact on the growth rate of non-residential construction, the Company's primary market. Several factors influence the future rate of growth of new construction in the non-residential market including: economic vitality, employment, commercial property values and rental rates, occupancy rates, the cost and availability of financing for new construction, the costs of building materials, and to a lesser degree the relative strength of the housing market. Concerns by building owners and developers regarding several of these factors, particularly current economic vitality, as well as availability of capital to fund projects, contributed to the decline in reported non-residential contract awards for February 2008, potentially a harbinger for decline in future commercial construction activity in certain sectors of the market. Although these concerns are worrisome, the Federal Reserve and the U.S. Treasury implemented a number of actions designed to boost investor and public confidence about the overall
 
 
direction of the U.S. economy, including lowering interest rates and increasing liquidity in the financial markets. We expect these actions will have a positive influence on the longer-term trends for overall construction in North America."
Mr. Nagel concluded, "We believe both past and future actions to provide customers with superior value propositions, create new and innovative products and services, expand into new markets, and simplify and streamline the organization will enhance the Company's opportunity to prosper over the long-term."

Important Notice Concerning Your Rights Under The
Acuity Brands, Inc. (401k) Plan
April 2008
1. This notice is to inform you that the will be migrated to an enhanced recordkeeping system at Merrill Lynch.
Acuity Brands, Inc. 401(k) Plan
2. Because of the time necessary to implement this transition, you temporarily will be unable to direct or diversify investments in your account, obtain a loan from the plan, or obtain a distribution from the plan. This period, during which you will be unable to exercise these rights otherwise available under the plan, is called a "blackout period." Whether or not you are planning retirement in the near future, we encourage you to carefully consider how this blackout period may affect your retirement planning, as well as your overall financial plan.
3. The blackout period for the plan will begin on Thursday, May 8, 2008, at 2 p.m. Eastern time and end on Wednesday, May 14, 2008, at 8 a.m. Eastern time.
4. During this blackout period you will be unable to direct or diversify the assets held in your plan account. For this reason, it is very important that you review and consider the appropriateness of your current investments in light of your inability to direct or diversify those investments during the blackout period. For your long-term retirement security, you should give careful consideration to the importance of a well-balanced and diversified investment portfolio, taking into account all your assets, income and investments. You should be aware that there is a risk to holding substantial portions of your assets in the securities of any one company, as individual securities tend to have wider price swings, up and down, in short periods of time, than investments in diversified funds. Stocks that have wide price swings might have a large loss during the blackout period, and you would not be able to direct the sale of such stocks from your account during the blackout period.

Acuity Brands, Inc.
(404) 853-1423
ATLANTA  July 2, 2008  Acuity Brands, Inc. (NYSE: AYI) today announced record results for the third quarter of fiscal 2008, including a 29 percent increase in diluted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations of $1.01 compared with $0.78 for the prior year period. Income from continuing operations for the third quarter of fiscal 2008 rose 21 percent to $41.7 million compared with $34.3 million for the prior year third quarter. Prior year's third quarter EPS from continuing operations included $0.10 from a pre-tax gain of $6.6 million for a favorable legal settlement at Acuity Brands Lighting related to a long-standing commercial dispute. Excluding the favorable legal settlement in the prior year, 2008 third quarter diluted EPS increased 49 percent versus the year ago period while income from continuing operations rose 39 percent. The Company generated record third quarter net sales of $512.4 million, a 2 percent increase over $502.4 million reported in the year-ago period.
Vernon J. Nagel, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Acuity Brands remarked, "We are very pleased to report record year-over-year results from continuing operations for the 13th quarter in a row. Our strong third quarter earnings performance reflects continuing benefits from programs to introduce new and innovative products, enhance customer service, and increase productivity. The results are even more impressive given the turbulent economic conditions which prevail in the residential home market and new store construction for certain retail channels. We believe weak demand in these two areas reduced our growth in net sales by approximately four percentage points."
The results for both periods exclude the specialty chemicals business, which was spun off to the shareholders of Acuity Brands on October 31, 2007 as Zep Inc. The historical results of the specialty chemicals business are now reported in discontinued operations of the Company.
The year-over-year increase in net sales reflects more favorable pricing and an enhanced mix of products sold, highlighted by greater shipments of the Company's proprietary energy-efficient fixtures for new construction and the relighting of existing non-residential buildings. Net sales from the prior year's acquisition
 
of Mark Architectural Lighting and favorable foreign currency translation of international sales each contributed approximately one percentage point to the year-over-year growth in net sales. The Company estimates that total net sales growth was negatively impacted by four percentage points in the current quarter versus the year ago period as a result of lower shipment volumes for residential related fixtures and for new store construction in certain retail channels. Additionally, the Company estimates that year-over-year net sales growth in other segments of the non-residential market approximated 4 percent and was due primarily from pricing actions and an enhanced mix of products sold, while unit volumes were essentially flat.
Operating profit for the third quarter of fiscal 2008 was $71.7 million, or 14.0 percent of net sales, as compared to prior year's $59.7 million, or 11.9 percent of net sales. The year-over-year 210 basis point improvement in operating profit margin was due primarily to a better mix of products sold driven by new products, more favorable pricing, and improved productivity. Excluding the gain from the favorable legal settlement in the prior year, the operating profit margin rose 340 basis points year-over-year.
The Company also achieved record results for the first nine months of fiscal year 2008 including diluted EPS from continuing operations, income from continuing operations, and net sales. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the nine months ended May 31, 2008 was $2.55, an increase of 30 percent compared to $1.96 for the prior year period. Income from continuing operations for the first nine months of fiscal 2008 rose to $106.7 million, an increase of 24 percent versus the year-ago period, while net sales climbed 6 percent to $1,503.9 million. Results for the first nine months of fiscal 2008 include a special charge of $14.6 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, recorded in the first quarter. The special charge relates to actions to streamline and simplify the Company's organizational structure and operations as a result of the spin-off of Zep Inc. The Company expects to realize annual cost savings of approximately $14 million as a result of its reorganization efforts. The full benefits are expected to be realized beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2009.
Acuity Brands completed the spin-off of Zep Inc. on October 31, 2007. Therefore, the Company reflects the results of Zep Inc. as a discontinued operation reported as a one-line item on the income statement. For the first nine months of fiscal 2008, the Company reported a loss from discontinued operations of $0.4 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, compared to the prior year's first nine months income of $10.8 million, or $0.25 per diluted share. Income from discontinued operations for the first nine months of fiscal 2008 includes non-tax-deductible spin-off costs of $5.5 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, primarily for legal and professional fees.
Including the results of discontinued operations, the Company reported diluted EPS of $1.00 for the third quarter of fiscal 2008, or $41.1 million of net income, compared to diluted EPS of $0.88 for the third quarter of fiscal 2007, or $38.7 million of net income. Including the results of discontinued operations, the Company reported diluted EPS of $2.54 for the first nine months of fiscal 2008, or $106.4 million of net income, compared to diluted EPS of $2.20 for the first nine months of fiscal 2007, or $96.6 million of net income.
 
 
Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the third quarter totaled $216.3 million, an increase of $2.6 million from the $213.7 million at the beginning of the fiscal year. During the nine months ending May 31, 2008, the Company repurchased approximately 3.0 million shares of outstanding common stock at a cost of approximately $131 million. Stock repurchases were partially funded by a $58.4 million net cash dividend received from Zep Inc., which includes $62.5 million received from Zep Inc. prior to the spin-off that was partially offset by $4.1 million paid to Zep Inc. during the third quarter of fiscal 2008 in accordance with the terms of the spin-off distribution agreement.
Outlook
Mr. Nagel commented, "Looking ahead, various leading indicators such as employment, housing demand, consumer sentiment, bank lending standards, and commodity prices are signaling a slowdown in future non-residential construction activity, our primary market. Accordingly, we anticipate unit sales growth to be challenging for the remainder of fiscal year 2008 and into 2009. The Company's backlog at May 31, 2008 was approximately $182 million, down 4 percent compared with the prior year. While positive factors such as a decline in past due orders and reduced lead times resulting from our improved delivery performance contributed to this decline, we have experienced modest softness in incoming orders over the past couple of months and expect them to remain soft for the foreseeable future. In addition, we expect to experience pressure on gross margins in the fourth quarter as a result of significant increases in commodity costs such as steel, aluminum, plastics, and copper as well as higher freight costs due to the significant rise in the price of diesel fuel.
"Despite these near-term economic challenges, we see opportunity for continued performance improvement allowing us to meet or exceed our long-term financial goals including annual operating margin expansion, earnings growth, and cash flow generation. We believe these opportunities exist as a result of our ongoing efforts to provide customers with superior value propositions, the creation of new and innovative products and services, and the expansion into new markets. We continue to invest and deploy resources to capitalize on growth opportunities in the renovation and relighting markets offering new proprietary energy-saving products and services to our customers while also providing an aesthetically superior lighting environment. We also see growth opportunities by furthering our market presence, such as our expansion into the New York City metropolitan area where we have historically had limited participation in this large and dynamic market."
 
 
Mr. Nagel concluded, "Looking beyond 2008, we remain positive about our future performance. Clearly, headwinds that prevail in certain markets will influence demand and escalating commodity costs are worrisome. While we announced a price increase ranging between three and ten percent effective in early May, we expect to announce additional price increases to help offset rising commodity prices. We intend to maintain our disciplined approach to pricing to recover increases in costs and to earn appropriate margins for our differentiated products and services. Additionally, we expect to realize benefits from our on-going initiatives to introduce new and innovative products, improve productivity, and contain costs. Our past and future actions to create value for our customers, to invest in our associates to be more customer-focused and productive, and to more effectively deploy assets to generate greater returns for our shareholders should enhance the Company's opportunity to prosper over the long-term."
Non-GAAP Financial Comparisons
Acuity Brands' management included in the above news release year-over-year comparisons of third quarter diluted EPS, income from continuing operations, and operating profit margin excluding the impact of the prior year's third quarter gain resulting from a favorable legal settlement. The comparisons are computed using non-GAAP financial measures, however, management has provided such comparisons to enhance the user's overall understanding of the Company's current financial performance and prospects for the future. Specifically, management believes the non-GAAP financial comparisons provide useful information to investors by excluding or adjusting certain items affecting reported operating results that were unusual and not indicative of the Company's core operating results. The non-GAAP financial comparisons should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, results prepared in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial comparisons included in this news release have been reconciled to the nearest GAAP measures in the following financial statement tables.

Right to Indemnification
Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a "proceeding"), by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or an officer of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer or trustee of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan (hereinafter an "indemnitee"), whether the basis of such
 
proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer or trustee or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer or trustee, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the Delaware General Corporation Law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than such law permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment), against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such indemnitee in connection therewith; provided, however, that, except as provided in Section 3 of this Article VII with respect to proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification, the Corporation shall indemnify any such indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.
Section 2. .
Right to Advancement of Expenses
In addition to the right to indemnification conferred in Section 1 of this Article VII, an indemnitee shall also have the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses (including attorney's fees) incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition (hereinafter an "advancement of expenses"); provided, however, that, if the Delaware General Corporation Law requires, an advancement of expenses incurred by an indemnitee in his or her capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such indemnitee, including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking (hereinafter an "undertaking"), by or on behalf of such indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal (hereinafter a "final adjudication") that such indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under this Section 2 or otherwise.
Section 3. .
Right of Indemnitee to Bring Suit
If a claim under Section 1 or 2 of this Article VII is not paid in full by the Corporation within sixty (60) days after a written claim has been received by the Corporation, except in the case of a claim for an advancement of expenses, in which case the applicable period shall be twenty (20) days, the indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim. If successful in whole or in part in any such suit, or in a suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit. In (i) any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (but not in a suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to an advancement of expenses) it shall be a defense that, and (ii) in any suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the Corporation shall be entitled to recover such expenses upon a final adjudication that, the indemnitee has not met any applicable standard for indemnification set forth in the Delaware General
 
Corporation Law. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its directors who are not parties to such action, a committee of such directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such suit that indemnification of the indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its directors who are not parties to such action, a committee of such directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that the indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought by the indemnitee, be a defense to such suit. In any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, or brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden of proving that the indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses, under this Article VII or otherwise shall be on the Corporation.
Section 4. .
Non-Exclusivity of Rights
The rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses conferred in this Article VII shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, the Corporation's certificate of incorporation, By-laws, agreement, vote of stockholders or directors or otherwise.
Section 5. .
Insurance
The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the Delaware General Corporation Law.
Section 6. .
Indemnification of Employees and Agents of the Corporation
The Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board of Directors, grant rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses to any employee or agent of the Corporation to the fullest extent of the provisions of this Article with respect to the indemnification and advancement of expenses of directors and officers of the Corporation.
Section 7. .
Nature of Rights
The rights conferred upon indemnitees in this Article VII shall be contract rights and such rights shall continue as to an indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, officer or trustee and shall inure to the benefit of the indemnitee's heirs, executors and administrators. Any amendment, alteration or repeal of this Article VII that adversely affects any right of an indemnitee or its successors shall be prospective only and shall not limit or eliminate any such right with respect to any proceeding involving any occurrence or alleged occurrence of any action or omission to act that took place prior to such amendment or repeal.

Acuity Brands, Inc.
(404) 853-1423
ATLANTA, October 07, 2008  Acuity Brands, Inc. (NYSE: AYI) today announced record diluted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 of $1.02 compared with $0.97 for the prior year period, an increase of 5 percent. The Company generated fourth quarter net sales of $522.8 million, a 3 percent decrease compared with the $540.4 million reported in the year-ago period.
Operating profit increased $4.2 million, or 6.0%, to a quarterly record of $73.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with 2007. Operating profit margin expanded over 120 basis points to 14.1% in the fourth quarter compared to the year-ago period. The benefits from a better mix of products sold, more favorable pricing, and productivity improvements helped to offset a recent escalation of raw material and component costs, lower shipment volume, and continued investments to capitalize on growth opportunities in markets such as renovation and relighting.
Vernon J. Nagel, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Acuity Brands remarked, "We are very pleased to report record year-over-year diluted EPS from continuing operations, operating profit, and operating profit margin for the 14th quarter in a row. Our quarterly operating profit margin exceeded 14 percent for the first time in our history. These quarterly results are even more impressive given the significant rise in commodity prices and the turbulent economic conditions in the U.S. Many of our markets continued to grow in our fourth quarter but at a slower rate than we have experienced over the last few years. However, the growth in these markets was more than offset by the extremely weak demand that continues to prevail in the residential housing market and for new store construction in certain retail channels, which we estimate reduced our net sales by more than five percentage points."
 
Income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 declined 2 percent to $41.9 million compared with $42.9 million for the prior year fourth quarter. The decline was due to an unfavorable pre-tax change of $2.1 million between quarters due primarily to the negative impact of exchange rates on foreign currency transactions and other non-operating items.
Net interest expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 increased $0.4 million to $7.1 million from $6.7 million reported in the year-ago period due primarily to a decrease in interest income as a result of lower short-term interest rates.
The consolidated income tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2008 was 36.5% compared with 33.4% for the fourth quarter of 2007. The increase in the tax rate was due primarily to taxes associated with the repatriation of foreign cash and an increase in state income taxes resulting from changes in certain state tax laws as well as a change in the mix among the states where the Company's earnings were generated.
The results for both periods exclude the specialty chemicals business, which was spun off to the shareholders of Acuity Brands on October 31, 2007 as Zep Inc. The historical results of the specialty chemicals business are now reported as discontinued operations of the Company.
Streamlining Plans
Today, the Company announced plans to accelerate its ongoing programs to streamline operations including the consolidation of certain manufacturing facilities and the reduction of certain overhead costs. These actions will allow the Company to better leverage efficiencies in its supply chain and support areas, while funding continued investments in other areas that support future growth opportunities. As a result of these actions, the Company intends to record a special cash charge of approximately $17 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 related to the planned consolidation of certain manufacturing operations and a reduction in workforce. As a part of the manufacturing
 
 
consolidation, the Company also expects to incur an additional non-cash charge for the impairment of assets related to the closing of two manufacturing facilities and the downsizing of a third facility; however, the amount of such charge has not been determined at this time.
The Company expects to realize benefits from these streamlining actions during fiscal year 2009 that will exceed the amount of the cash charge. Upon completing the planned consolidation of the manufacturing operations, which is scheduled to be finished by the fiscal fourth quarter of 2009, the Company expects to realize annualized benefits of more than $36 million. The reduction in workforce will encompass approximately 800 personnel including both manufacturing positions and salaried positions in mostly non-customer interfacing areas of the business.
2008 Fiscal Year
Income from continuing operations for fiscal 2008 increased over 15 percent to $148.6 million compared with $128.7 million reported for fiscal 2007. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 22 percent to $3.57 compared with $2.93 reported for fiscal 2007. Consolidated net sales in fiscal 2008 were $2,026.6 million compared with $1,964.8 million reported in the year-ago period, an increase of $61.9 million, or 3 percent. Operating profit for fiscal 2008 was $261.1 million compared with operating profit of $222.4 million reported in the prior year, an increase of over $38.6 million, or 17 percent. Operating profit margin expanded more than 150 basis points over the prior year to a record 12.9%. Fiscal year 2008 results include a pre-tax special charge of $14.6 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, recorded in the first quarter related to actions to streamline and simplify the Company's organizational structure and operations as a result of the spin-off of Zep Inc. The special charge reduced 2008 operating margins by 70 basis points. Additionally, fiscal year 2007 results included a $6.6 million pre-tax gain, or $0.10 per diluted share, associated with a favorable legal settlement, as previously disclosed.
For fiscal 2008, the Company reported $2.1 million of other expense compared with $1.6 million of other income in the year-ago period, an unfavorable pre-tax change of $3.7
 
 
million. The year-over-year unfavorable change was due primarily to the negative impact of exchange rates on foreign currency transactions and other non-operating items.
Net interest expense for fiscal 2008 declined over $1.4 million to $28.4 million from $29.9 million reported in the year-ago period due primarily to an increase in interest income as a result of higher cash balances, partially offset by lower short-term interest rates.
The consolidated income tax rate for fiscal 2008 was 35.5% compared with 33.7% for fiscal 2007. The increase in the annual tax rate was due primarily to the repatriation of foreign cash and an increase in state income tax expense.
Acuity Brands completed the spin-off of Zep Inc. on October 31, 2007. Therefore, the Company reflects the results of Zep Inc. as a discontinued operation reported as a one-line item on the income statement. For fiscal 2008, the Company reported a loss from discontinued operations of $0.4 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, compared to the prior year's income of $19.4 million, or $0.44 per diluted share. Income from discontinued operations for fiscal 2008 included non-tax-deductible spin-off costs of $5.5 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, primarily for legal and professional fees.
Including the results of discontinued operations, the Company reported diluted EPS of $3.56 for fiscal 2008, or $148.3 million of net income, compared to diluted EPS of $3.37 for fiscal 2007, or $148.1 million of net income. The special charge recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 reduced net income and diluted EPS by $9.1 million and $0.21, respectively.
Cash and cash equivalents at August 31, 2008 totaled $297.1 million, an increase of $83.4 million, or 39 percent, since the beginning of the fiscal year. During fiscal year 2008, the Company generated record net cash flow from operating activities totaling $221.8 million, an increase of $13.1 million, or 6 percent, compared with fiscal 2007. During fiscal year 2008, the Company invested over $30 million in new capital equipment and acquisitions. Additionally, the Company paid over $22 million in
 
 
dividends to shareholders and funded over $155 million to repurchase approximately 3.6 million shares of its common stock. During fiscal 2008, the Company received approximately $59 million from a combined cash dividend related to the spin-off of Zep Inc. as well as cash generated by the business during the first two months of the fiscal year prior to its spin-off.
Commentary and Outlook
Mr. Nagel said, "We are pleased to report another year of record performance reflecting the crisp execution of our key strategic initiatives including programs to enhance customer service, introduce new and innovative products, and improve productivity. In addition to record earnings, we earned a 27 percent return on average shareholders' equity. We continued to manage our financial assets effectively, further reducing operating working capital as a percentage of net sales to 10 percent. We ended the year with a very strong balance sheet and tremendous financial flexibility with nearly $300 million of cash and a net debt to capital ratio of 10 percent. We believe our financial strength, which has never been stronger, will afford us the opportunity to aggressively invest in areas to expand our industry leading franchise, particularly in this volatile environment, where we see great opportunities to enhance the long-term prospects of our company.
"While our backlog at August 31, 2008 increased 4% to $177.1 million from a comparable $170.3 million at the end of the prior year, we believe the increase was influenced by orders placed in advance of a price increase that went into effect at the end of August. We continue to experience modest softness in incoming orders and expect them to remain soft for the foreseeable future due to the impact from the troubled housing market which continues to reverberate through the financial markets and the broader economy."
Mr. Nagel continued, "Looking forward, we see both challenges and opportunities. To meet the challenges and realize the opportunities, we are accelerating our continuous improvement efforts to streamline and enhance our company, reducing spending in certain areas and accelerating our investments in others offering greater growth potential. While
 
 
decisions to eliminate jobs are never easy, these actions are necessary for us to better leverage our supply chain capabilities, improve service to our customers, and enhance and focus our organizational capabilities. These actions will enable us to redeploy and invest our resources in other areas where we can create greater value for all stakeholders and accelerate our profitable growth opportunities, including a continued focus on industry-leading product innovation incorporating sustainable design, relighting, and customer connectivity. For example, we expect to introduce more new products during the coming year than in any other period in our history, many of which will incorporate LED ("light emitting diode") technology.
"The current market forecast for 2009 by independent third-parties projects a mid-to-upper single-digit percent decline in unit volume year-over-year due to a forecasted decrease in U.S. construction spending as a result of weak economic conditions and tighter lending requirements. The recent spike in commodities prices, particularly steel, is likely to pressure our margins. While we have taken actions to recover higher raw material and freight costs through price increases, we do not believe competitive market forces will allow us to pass on more than these expected cost increases. As such, if one were to assume flat unit volume, a mere recovery of just material and freight costs could negatively impact our operating margin percentage in 2009 by more than 50 basis points compared with 2008.
"Despite these challenges, we see opportunities. We continue to invest and deploy resources to capitalize on growth opportunities in the renovation and relight markets offering new proprietary energy-saving products and services to our customers while also providing an aesthetically superior lighting environment. We also see opportunities to expand our market presence in key markets, such as the New York City metropolitan area where we have historically had limited participation in this large and dynamic market. We expect cash flow from operations to remain strong in 2009 and we intend to invest between $35 million and $40 million in capital expenditures during the year. Also, we estimate the annual tax rate to approximate 35.5% for 2009.
"We believe our focus on productivity improvement, accelerated investments in innovative and energy-efficient products, expanded market presence in key sectors such
 
 
as the renovation and relight markets, and enhanced services to our customers will provide growth opportunities which will enable us to outperform the market. Additionally, we believe these actions and investments will position us to meet or exceed our long-term financial goals, including expanding our annual operating margin by 70 basis points or more, earnings growth of 15 percent or better, and cash flow generation in excess of our net income."
Mr. Nagel concluded, "Looking ahead to 2009 and beyond, we remain positive about our future performance. Clearly, headwinds that prevail in certain markets will influence demand in the nearer term. Nonetheless, our past and future actions to create value for our customers, to invest in our associates to be even more customer-focused and productive, and to more effectively deploy assets to generate greater returns for our shareholders should enhance the Company's opportunity to prosper over the long-term."
The Company's certifying public accountant's audit opinion with respect to the fiscal year-end financial statements will not be issued until the Company completes its annual report on Form 10-K, including its evaluation of internal controls over financial reporting. Accordingly, the financial results reported in this earnings release are preliminary pending completion of the audit.
Non-GAAP Financial Comparisons
Following the financial statement tables, management has included an additional table reconciling certain non-GAAP financial comparisons to the nearest GAAP measures. The year-over-year non-GAAP comparisons for fiscal year diluted EPS, income from continuing operations, and operating profit margin exclude the impact of the prior year's gain resulting from a favorable legal settlement and the current year's special charge related to actions to streamline and simplify the Company's organizational structure and operations. Management has provided such comparisons to enhance the user's overall understanding of the Company's current financial performance and prospects for the future. Specifically, management believes the non-GAAP financial comparisons provide useful information to investors by excluding or adjusting certain items affecting reported operating results that were unusual and not indicative of the Company's core operating results. The non-GAAP financial comparisons should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, results prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Thank you, Dan. Good morning everyone. Ricky and I would like to make a few comments and then we will answer your questions.
First, on behalf of our associates worldwide, I'm again pleased to announce record earnings for both our fourth quarter and full year 2008. 2008 was another outstanding year for Acuity Brands. In fact, we again exceeded all of our longer term financial targets. In addition to our record results, we achieved great success in a number of strategic priorities, including accelerating programs to introduce new, more energy efficient products and services, enhanced customer service, expanded to new markets and improved productivity, as well as the spinoff of our chemical business. These accomplishments will better position the company strategically to produce upper quartile results more consistently. Also, this is our 14th quarter in a row of record operating profit, operating profit margin and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations. A great accomplishment, considering the number of significant challenges we faced this quarter.
I know many of you you have already seen our results and Ricky will provide more detail later in this call but I would like to make a few comments on key highlights. First, for the fourth quarter. Net sales for the quarter were $523 million, down 3% compared with the year-ago period. Operating profit was $73.7 million, up 6%, while margins were 14.1%, up 120 basis points to an all-time high. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.02, up more than 5% from the year-ago period. For the full year in 2008, net sales at Acuity Brands Lighting exceeded $2 billion for the first time, up more than 3% from 2007. Consolidated operating profit margins, excluding the special charge in the first quarter following the spinoff of Zep, were 13.6, exceeding 13% for the first time ever for a full year. Adjusted income from continuing operations excluding the special charge was almost $158 million, up approximately 27% from 2007. And adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding the special charge, were $3.78, up 34%.
We are pleased to report we generated almost $222 million in cash flow from operations in 2008, a record. This was up more than 6% over 2007. Our free cash flow exceeded net income for the sixth time in the last seven years, a key metric for us. Our cash balance was almost $300 million at the end of August, up more than $83 million or almost 40% from the end of August last year. In addition, our consolidated cash flow return on investment expanded 620 basis points to over 30%, an all-time high.
Looking beyond our financial results to our operational improvements, we made great progress in four key areas of strategic focus. Customer service, pricing and margin management, product portfolio expansion, including significant additions to our stable of sustainable and energy efficient products, and company-wide productivity, All of which contributed to our record financial performance in 2008. Throughout most of the year, we enjoyed growth in net sales, particularly in targeted sectors and geographies of the construction market. Our growth was driven primarily by our focus on disciplined pricing, the continued introduction of and demand for our sustainable and highly energy efficient products and our enhanced customer service. The growth in 2008 was even more notable, given the continued decline in construction activity in the residential housing market, along with the pronounced slowdown in new store construction in the retail sector due to curtailed consumer spending. While it is impossible for us to know the precise impact that declining demand associated with these two important sectors had on our net sales, we believe this weakness reduced our total net sales by more than 5% in the fourth quarter of 2008, compared with the year-ago period. The fourth quarter was our first quarter with reduced sales compared with the year-ago period, reflecting the extraordinary challenges in these sectors of the construction market.
For the full year, we estimate the impact of declines associated with the residential housing market and new store construction for certain retailers reduced our net sales by almost 3% or more than $50 million in 2008. For the fourth quarter, if one excludes the estimated impact of the decline associated with both the residential housing market and new store construction for retail, we believe our net sales grew more than 2% in other areas of the non-residential market. While it is impossible again to calculate precisely the impact of our pricing actions, product mix and unit volume growth, we believe pricing and product mix more than offset about a 1% decline in unit volume. The decline in unit volume in the fourth quarter which was pronounced in a few key geographies, particularly the Midwest, where the economy is particularly weak, was mostly offset by steady growth in a number of other areas in North America.
I will talk more about our future growth strategies and expectations for the construction market later in the call. From a profitability perspective, we delivered excellent results driven by the execution of our strategies to be the innovative leader in new energy efficient lighting fixture products, expand our presence in key channels and new markets, improve our service, drive productivity gains and maintained our disciplined approach to pricing. For each quarter in the year, including the fourth quarter, we posted record period over period results for operating profit, margin and diluted earnings per share from Continuing Operations. Our results in the fourth quarter were even more notable, given the decline in net sales, and that we absorbed over $5 million in additional costs for steel and fuel in the quarter. We estimate that steel costs shot up more than 40% in the quarter, the magnitude and speed of the increase were unprecedented, and will continue to impact us in 2009. While we reacted immediately, implementing price increases ranging from 5 to 10%, effective the end of August, there was no opportunity to realize the benefit of this pricing action and offset any of these cost increases within the quarter.

In spite of these challenges, operating profit margin for the fourth quarter was 14.1%, and adjusted operating profit margin was 13.6% for the full year, excluding the impact of the special charge. Both period records went up 120 and 260 basis points respectively over the year-ago period. Looking at our fourth quarter results from another perspective, we generated $4.2 million of incremental operating profit on a decrease in net sales of almost $18 million, while absorbing approximately $5 million in additional cost for raw material and fuel, and continuing to make incremental investments in key programs as part of our strategic growth plan. While our financial results were strong, economic uncertainty and market volatility accelerated throughout the world, particularly in the fourth quarter, impacting the many markets we serve.
Given this level of economic uncertainty, nut truly sensing an opportunity to expand our industry-leading franchise, both through organic growth as well as targeted acquisitions, we announced today the acceleration of our ongoing efforts to streamline the organization to provide greater value to our key stakeholders. These streamlining actions include the consolidation of certain manufacturing facilities and the reduction of overhead. These actions will allow us to better leverage our supply chain capabilities, more effectively deploy capital and resources into higher growth areas and accelerate and increase the funding of future product development and expansion into new markets, particularly relight, which has huge growth potential. Also, these actions will free up additional resources to invest through acquisitions in exciting growth areas within the lighting industry. Upon completion of the planned plant consolidations, which are scheduled to be finished by our fiscal fourth quarter of 2009, we expect to realize annualized savings of more than $36 million.
While it is never easy to impact the lives of people through consolidation, we feel it is necessary, particularly during this period of uncertainty, to be proactive in order to more aggressively pursue emerging opportunities, use our considerable resources to expand our market position, and better serve our customers. Ricky will provide more detail on these actions. I would like to now turn the call over to Ricky to make a few brief comments on our overall financial performance before I make some remarks regarding our strategic plans and our outlook for 2009. Ricky?
 
 
Ricky Reece
- Acuity Brands, Inc. - SVP, CFO
Thank you, Vern and good morning everyone. Vern previously discussed key highlights of our results so I'll not repeat that information. However, I will touch on a few additional items regarding our fourth quarter results.
Gross profit for the fourth quarter was $212.4 million, or 40.6% of sales. This gross profit margin reflects an increase of 170 basis points, compared with the year-ago period. This improvement in gross profit is after overcoming the challenges of unprecedented increases in raw material and freight costs. This margin improvement reflects the benefits we are realizing from our pricing discipline, richer mix of products sold and productivity gains. Selling, distribution and administrative costs were $138.7 million in the quarter ended August 31, 2008, a reduction of $2 million compared with $140.6 million in the prior year period.
This reduced cost reflects the benefits from simplification of our administrative structure, as a result of the spinoff of Zep, and tight management of discretionary expenses, partially offset by increased commission expense, due to higher commission rates paid on the richer mix of products as well as the investments we are making in our business to drive profitable growth which Vern previously discussed. As a percent of sales, operating expense for the quarter was 26.5%, compared to 26% in the prior year. This 50 basis point increase reflects the impact of the higher commission rates, and the strategic investments.
I will next spend a minute discussing items in the fourth quarter below the operating earnings line. First, net interest expense in the fourth quarter increased $400,000 to $7.1 million from the year-ago period, primarily due to lower interest income as a result of lower short-term interest rates. Second, other expenses related to the impact of exchange rates on foreign currency transactions and gain and losses on the sale of fixed assets, resulted in a pretax unfavorable swing of $2.1 million between this quarter and last year. Lastly, the income tax rate increased in the quarter to 36.5%, compared with 33.4% for the fourth quarter of 2007. This increase was due to taxes associated with the repatriation of foreign cash and increases in state income taxes.
We enjoyed strong cash flow generation in the quarter with cash flow from operations in excess of $111 million, an increase of more than 18% compared with the prior year period. Our overall trade cycle days ended the year at 30 days, a three day reduction from the end of last year. Operating working capital as a percent of sales was approximately 10%, which is a further indication of the improvements we are making in our supply chain and transaction processes. For the fiscal year, we generated cash flow from operations of approximately $222 million, and received a dividend from Zep related to the spinoff of approximately $58 million.
Capital expenditures and acquisitions consumed about $30 million of cash for the year. We returned a significant portion of this free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends of $22.5 million, and the repurchase of 3.6 million shares for $155.7 million. We continue to maintain

strong financial flexibility as reflected by our net debt-to-capital ratio, which was 10% at August 31st, 2008. From a liquidity standpoint, we have cash of $297 million, and availability under our revolving credit facility of $241 million as of August 31st, 2008. In addition, we continue to generate strong cash flow from operations. This is a very good place to be right now, with all the uncertainty in the financial markets.
I will conclude my prepared remarks with some additional information regarding our planned streamlining actions. As a result of these planned actions, we expect to record a pretax cash charge of approximately $17 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. We also expect to record an additional non-cash charge for the impairment of assets related to the consolidation of manufacturing facilities. However, the amount of such charge has not yet been determined. The cash charge consists primarily of severance to the approximately 800 people directly affected by these actions and will be paid out throughout much of fiscal year 2009. Regarding the benefits from these actions, as Vern said previously, we expect to realize approximately $36 million in annual savings once the actions are fully implemented. For fiscal year 2009, we expect to realize savings of approximately $23 million, which is net of approximately $2.5 million in additional period costs that we will incur in the first two fiscal quarters of 2009 related to the planned actions that in accordance with the accounting rules we are not able to include in the charge. Of the fiscal year 2009 savings of $23 million, approximately three-quarters or $18 million will be realized in the second half of the fiscal year, as the plant consolidations are fully implemented.
Thank you and I'll now turn the call back to Vern.

Thank you, Ricky. As we look forward we continue to see challenges but more importantly, opportunities. Clearly, economies worldwide are in a state of flux with uncertainty comes great volatility. Some economists suggest we are in a recession. Of course, time will tell. What we do know is key indicators for our traditional markets, both residential and non-residential construction, are signaling a decline in available market in 2009.
All the data we see shows the economy in the United States and the many other parts of the world experiencing a slowdown due to political uncertainties, the disruption in the housing and financial markets, and higher commodity prices. Clearly, it is impossible to know the precise effect these items could have on the future growth rate of the construction markets, or for how long into the future these conditions may prevail. But it is clear, those factors which influence the future growth rate of new construction including the future vitality of the economy, job creation, consumer sentiment, occupancy rates and the availability of capital are all in a current state of flux around signaling slower growth ahead or in some markets continuing declines in demand. This information is all widely known. All this seems to support the forecast by independent third parties that unit volume for construction put in place in the non-residential construction market could be down mid-to upper single digit percentages in 2009 compared with 2008. Additionally, housing starts, which were down 30% in our fiscal 2008, are expected to decline again in 2009, albeit at a slower pace.
So, the two key questions many shareholders may have are how will Acuity Brands perform in this environment? And most importantly, what are our strategies to drive profitable growth? Given these uncertain and volatile economic and market conditions, we would like to share with you a few key observations. First, we expect the current uncertainty and volatility to persist for the foreseeable future, impacting our key markets in 2009, particularly housing and new store construction for large retailers. It seems logical that overall construction activity will be down in fiscal 2009 as predicted by many economists and independent forecasting entities. Second, we expect material costs to continue to be high, particularly in the first half of fiscal 2009. Based on current pricing conditions, we could see our costs for raw materials, particularly steel and fuel and certain other components increasing mid single digits as a percentage of net sales. Obviously, these two factors will create significant headwind for all companies serving the new construction market in North America and Europe.
However, we see tremendous opportunity in this environment. And our strategy is to leverage our industry-leading products and market presence as well as our considerable financial strength to capitalize on those opportunities. So, our strategy to drive profitable growth in 2009 and beyond is to focus on the following four key areas. Customer service, organizational productivity, new and innovative and energy-efficient products, and expansion into new markets, particularly renovation and relight. These four areas have been to varying degrees key elements of our strategy for the last few years, yielding growth and upper quartile financial performance and we expect that to continue.
First, with regard to customer service and productivity, I cannot stress enough the positive impact our focused approach on providing customers with the very best value in the marketplace has had on our performance over the last three years. This has been due to a combination of innovative products, great quality, superior delivery and competitive pricing. Further, we continue to better align our organization in a manner which accelerates our continuous improvements efforts in these critical areas of focus. Additionally, we believe the acceleration of our streamlining actions will allow us to enhance efficiencies while continuing to provide our customers with superior value. Our efforts in these areas have proven to be a winning formula for us.

Second, we have consistently stated over the last three years that a key driver in the improvement of our profitability has been the introduction of new products and a better mix of products sold. New, innovative and highly energy efficient products that provide a superior lighting experience will continue to be key to our future success. In that regard, we intend to introduce more new products in 2009 than we have during any previous year in our company's long history, enhancing our industry's leading position. While these products will positively impact or 2009 results, particularly in the second half, they will have a meaningful impact on 2010 and beyond.
Third, we intend to accelerate our expansion into new markets, including New York City and renovation and relight as well as enhance our value proposition targeted at more traditional segments of the market to better serve the needs of our existing customer base. We made great progress in a number of these areas in 2008, setting the stage for even more success in 2009. Of particular note is relight which is a virtually untapped market. We continue to see great opportunity as high energy costs, the desire for better lighting and greater awareness of the need for more sustainable lighting solutions comes to the forefront of thinking by business and government leaders and building owners throughout the world. For Acuity Brands we feel we are positioned well to not only participate in this evolving industry, but to accelerate that change in growth by providing unique and innovative solutions to meet the needs of our growing customer base.
Today we offer a full array of products and services to meet the growing needs of the renovation and relight market, which some estimate to be in excess of $70 billion in size. We are encouraged by the traction we have already gained in these markets where we estimate that our revenues in 2008 exceeded $70 million. A key element of our growth strategy in 2009 is to accelerate our investment in these areas, both in terms of market coverage as well as new products and services. So what does all of this mean for Acuity Brands in 2009? While our company policy is not to give annual earnings guidance, instead focusing on those key strategic and tactical actions that can best help us achieve our long-term financial goals on a consistent basis, we do have the following observations which may provide you with insight into our focus for 2009.
As we noted in our press release, we expect our price increases in 2009 to offset raw material and other cost increases only. To be clear, the news reporting agencies picked it up incorrectly. We do expect to fully recover our cost increases by increasing our prices in 2009. We expect to continue to drive productivity in our business, as we have consistently done in the past, targeting 70 basis points or more of margin improvement on the base business, which as I noted above, some believe could be declining in 2009. Excluding the streamlining charge, we expect to realize $23 million or about 110 basis points of margin improvement on 2008 net sales from the streamlining efforts announced today. Which should enable us to meaningfully exceed our productivity target of 70 basis points or more of improvement in 2009. We expect unit volume in the new construction portion of the market to be down.
How much, we don't know. But we are anticipating declines as forecasted by Dodge and other independent groups. However, we expect to drive additional revenue growth by expanding our presence in existing channels and geographies, entering new markets such as renovation and relight and accelerating our introduction of new products and services, which will be introduced at a record pace for us in 2009. Our hope is through these various growth initiatives we can partially offset the impact of the potentially contracting market. We have a demonstrated track record of successfully executing our strategies, the uncertainty and volatility currently in the marketplace make it a challenge to precisely quantify how successful we will be in achieving our goals in 2009. However, in summary, we believe the execution of our longer term strategies to focus on productivity improvement, accelerate investments in energy efficient products, expand market presence in key sectors such as renovation and relight market and enhance services to our customers will provide growth opportunities which will enable us to outperform the market in 2009.
Additionally, we believe these actions and the investments will position over the longer term to meet or exceed our financial goals, including expanding our annual operating margin by 70 basis points or more, earnings growth of 15% or more and cash flow generation in excess of our net income. As we look beyond the current environment because this too shall pass, we believe the lighting industry will experience solid growth over the next decade, particularly as energy and environmental concerns come to the forefront. Lastly, we believe our past and future actions to create value for our customers, invest in our associates to be even more customer focused and productive and more effectively deploy our resources to generate greater returns for our shareholders should enhance the company's opportunity to prosper over the long term. Our record results over the last 14 quarters support our focus and strategies.
Thank you, and with that, we will entertain any questions you have.

Hi, Matt.
 
 
Ricky Reece
- Acuity Brands, Inc. - SVP, CFO
Good morning.
 
 
Matt McCall
- BB&T Capital Markets - Analyst
If we look at the gross margin performance, I think last quarter you had talked about expectations of sequential pressure of up to 100 basis points and it sounded like the steel environment didn't get any better. Help me understand how  I think you were flat sequentially versus Q3. Help me understand how that gap closed so quickly.
 
 
Vern Nagel
- Acuity Brands, Inc. - Chairman, CEO, President
Well, the fact of the matter is, we continued to drive sales of our new products and these new products obviously have features and benefits as well as price points that are interesting to the marketplace and so our mix of products sold continued to really be beneficial. As you know, we put a price increase in place in May and that had a positive impact on our results for the fourth quarter of this year, and I believe that as we look at our productivity and other areas of our business, our spend productivity as well as just being more efficient in our facilities, all of those served us well in the fourth quarter to help drive the kind of margin performance that you saw.
 
 
Matt McCall
- BB&T Capital Markets - Analyst
Okay. Okay. The SG&A lining last quarter we talked about  I believe you referenced expectations for 09 dollars to be up about 3 to 4% and as you continue to invest in some of these initiatives, it sounds like the new products are going to continue to push your spending higher. Is that 3 to 4% spending number still a good number for 09?
 
 
Ricky Reece
- Acuity Brands, Inc. - SVP, CFO
I don't know that we in fact gave that kind of indication. I would say that from a salary perspective, as you obviously know, we have taken a number of actions with our streamlining program to really get at our spending and to better understand how we do some of these things and really to drive investment in new products and in expansion of newer markets. So from our perspective, I think it's best that you focus on our overall margin in some of the areas that we're suggesting to get a better insight into what that's going to look like.
 
 
Matt McCall
- BB&T Capital Markets - - Analyst
Okay. Okay. Then on the consolidation side, it sounds like you're talking only about manufacturing facilities. Opportunities beyond that, the distribution structure I think you referenced in the past. Any further opportunities that could show up in 09?
 
 
Ricky Reece
- Acuity Brands, Inc. - SVP, CFO
Matt, our team, our entire team continues to do in my view just an outstanding job of driving productivity and efficiencies into the organization. We continue to look throughout the company for ways that we can improve and enhance those capabilities. We are very aggressively investing in

new product development, market expansion, and so I would be reluctant to say at this point in time that tackling more than what we have on our plate right now is going to happen. But I think that we have proven over the last three years that we are committed to continuous improvement. The programs and plans and education that we have in place for our employees are paying off. They're paying off not just in terms of greater productivity, but greater opportunities for our customers. Again, I can't say enough how our customer service and our quality of our products has improved, allowing us to win more frequently in the marketplace and to drive better pricing. So we're going to tackle this streamlining  these streamlining actions now, and we'll continue to see what that affords us in the future.
 
 
Matt McCall
- BB&T Capital Markets - Analyst
Okay. And then one final one, Vern. You talked about expectations of outperforming the market in 2009 and I just wanted to clarify, in the release you say if one were to assume flat unit volume with the unit volume I'm making sure I'm thinking about the apples-to-apples unit volume here. You're talking about non-res construction down mid-to high single digits, residential construction still down but maybe not as bad as last year but is that meant to be kind of a guidance range if we assume flat unit volume, is that your expectation for next year?
 
 
Vern Nagel
- Acuity Brands, Inc. - Chairman, CEO, President
No, let's be clear. What we were attempting to do was give shareholders and you a sense of what our expectation of raw material costs could do and how it would impact potentially our financial performance. So what we were trying to do is say if one were to assume flat unit volume growth, and were you to look at our cost increases for steel and fuel and other certain components, we were estimating a mid-single digit increase on that. When you imagine that we believe we will through our pricing actions be able to fully recapture those cost increases, but not more than that, we think that the marketplace will be competitive and not allow capturing more than our cost increases. We wanted you to be able to understand and do your own math on what that impact would have on gross  excuse me, on our operating profit margins because you're increasing the top line through price increase, but you're getting virtually no bottom line improvements so your margins will decline by some amount. We just wanted to be very clear on that.
When it comes to the top line, the actual top line, as I said in here, we are focused  we're assuming that these forecasters have it right. But we don't know. So we're anticipating that unit volume will be down in 2009 on the base business, but it's our expectation through these other initiatives that we're going to work and focus on how do we offset that. Now, whether we're able to offset it all or not, we don't know. But we think that the programs that we have in place are well-targeted to helping us grow our revenue base in those areas at an accelerated pace. So what does all that look like at the end of the year? It really depends on your assumption of where you think the base business is going to go in 2009.

Just to be clear, in the press release and in the comments you referenced the longer term goals including the 15% EPS growth. Does 09 fall into the bucket or is it strictly restating the longer term goals with no explicit relevance to 09?

It is stating our longer term goals. Our expectation is is that the efforts and the focus that we have internally is that we expect to outperform the market. Don't quite know what that market is going to look like, but as you know, Chris, we have been very focused on internal improvements, redirecting those resources into new product development, very excited about our plans for 2009 in that regard. We are making strong in-roads into new markets such as New York City. The relight market, we've disclosed for the first time what our revenues look like in that space. It's difficult to  because we're just now establishing a baseline, but difficult to compare it to what it was like in 2006. We believe that we've had had very significant growth in that space and we expect to have very significant growth in 2009 there. But what is that precisely going to look like? We still are trying to understand the sales cycle, still trying to understand how aggressively we can penetrate this market. We are making considerable investment in people. As well as training to go after this market and so how fast can we grow that to help offset some of these other areas? Time will tell in that, frankly.

Okay. And then on just some of the movements around the operating margin, you have the 70 basis points longer term goal, I think 110 from the new streamlining charge and then some remainder, maybe 6 or 7 million from the streamlining you did in the first quarter, as well as the drag from raws. I mean, are those all additive? What's the subset? I guess the 110, that's inclusive of the 70, not additional?
 
 
Ricky Reece -
Acuity Brands, Inc. - SVP, CFO
Correct.
 
 
Vern Nagel -
Acuity Brands, Inc. - Chairman, CEO, President
That is correct.
 
 
Christopher Glynn -
Oppenheimer - Analyst
Okay.
 
 
Ricky Reece -
Acuity Brands, Inc. - SVP, CFO
That is correct. You're thinking about it exactly correct, what we try to do is give through our press release and our comments insight as to what our focus is. I think that the wild card for any investor is to have their own assumption about where these markets are going to go. But we are very committed to targeting growth in areas and we are very committed to driving productivity that we can deploy back into the business in the form of new products for customers, better service and better capability.
 
 
Christopher Glynn -
Oppenheimer - Analyst
Okay. So the pieces that you're looking at for the margin build are the 110 plus the realization of the first quarter 08 streamlining plus the raw's impact.
 
 
Ricky Reece -
Acuity Brands, Inc. - SVP, CFO
Yes.

All right. And then on the  you cite renovation a lot. Historically we've talked about relighting as a new market opportunity and renovation haven't really called that out before. I think it's been thought of as more of a traditional market. What brings that out to the forefront today?
 
 
Vern Nagel -
Acuity Brands, Inc. - Chairman, CEO, President
Well, renovation has always occurred and usually it's occurred when you have a typical change-out of a lessee and so when someone new moves into a commercial space, typically the lessor will provide them with some type of build-out allowance. We believe that the relight market represents an opportunity where existing owners and occupiers of this space now represent an opportunity to go in and say, let's proactively change out your lighting to provide you with better lighting, more energy efficient products, saving you energy and helping you meet your goals in terms of your own sustainability objectives. So we believe that proactively targeting companies that fit this bill is just a huge untapped market.
So what you're doing is you're going in and knocking on their door and you're saying here is why you ought to consider relighting your space. And for us, what we wanted to do was give insight for the first time as to what we think our revenues into that renovation and relight market look like. It's a baseline and we'll see just how fast we can penetrate that market and develop that market. We have ramped up our capabilities through our SAERIS business unit in terms of people and capability to provide turn key solutions into that market so customers who believe that it's appropriate for them to relight their space, we have the ability to provide to them full turnkey solutions with our distribution partners, with our agents, with our many folks that are helping us target this market.
 
 
Christopher Glynn -
Oppenheimer - Analyst
Thanks for that. Just lastly, how are you thinking about any risks associated to customer service through the streamlining efforts?
 
 
Vern Nagel -
Acuity Brands, Inc. - Chairman, CEO, President
Very good question. I believe that our organization is extremely focused on not only maintaining but improving our customer service capabilities. Much of what we are doing here, vis-a-vis the streamlining actions, really are not involving customer facing or direct customer facing activities. Obviously, the plant consolidations are an issue and making sure that we do those effectively is critical to us continuing to maintain a very high level of customer service. We believe that the plans that we have in place will allow us to do this in a streamless or seamless fashion.
 
 
Ricky Reece -
Acuity Brands, Inc. - SVP, CFO
Maybe a little bit of additional comment on that. Some of the opportunities that we are seeing and taking advantage of in this streamlining is the automation that we've continued to put throughout the business, many of you are aware we've been putting Oracle in. We now have pretty much got Oracle in all of the facilities and that's enabling us to take advantage of streamlining some of the transactional processes that are less cumbersome now than they were when we were operating Multiple Systems. We also have put a fair amount of technology in place with our supply chain as well as with our channel partners that are enabling us to be a lot more efficient in managing those people intensive transactions. So we're certainly leveraging some of the investments we made and are continuing to make in technology that are enabling us to take advantage of some of the efficiencies that brings.

Good morning, Glen.
 
 
Glen Wortman -
Sidoti & Co - Analyst
Can you guys just comment on get a little more specific on your intentions with the large cash position?
 
 
Ricky Reece -
Acuity Brands, Inc. - SVP, CFO
Yeah, our initial thoughts continue to be to use that cash when the $160 million of public debt becomes due early next calendar year, comes due on February 1st of 2009. So we are looking to go ahead and pay that off. We, as Vern commented, are seeing opportunities to invest in the business, both in organic growth through product development as well as some of the servicing capabilities but also seeing opportunities through acquisitions to utilize the cash in that area as well. And then lastly, we have been using the cash for dividends and stock buybacks and that will certainly be something we will consider as well as the right opportunities present themselves. So deleveraging, growing the business, both organically as well as acquisitions, and then returning to shareholders in dividends and stock buybacks.
 
 
Vern Nagel -
Acuity Brands, Inc. - Chairman, CEO, President
Glen, this is Vern. I would also add that we are in a very strong position from a financial perspective to execute over our strategies as Ricky is describing. While no one enjoys this type of market, we think it's an opportunity for great companies to take advantage of markets like this, to extend and expand their market share to better serve their customers. We intend to use not only our capabilities as an organization, but our financial capabilities in this time period, to really, again, extend out our franchise.
 
 
Glen Wortman -
Sidoti & Co - Analyst
Thank you.
 
 
Vern Nagel -
Acuity Brands, Inc. - Chairman, CEO, President
And we're fortunate  I was just going to say and we're north fortunate to be in that situation.
 
 
Glen Wortman -
Sidoti & Co - Analyst
Absolutely. Just also, with respect to the August price increase, so the early indications are that you'll probably  I know it was an announcement for about 5 to 10%, so you're expecting to realize maybe about 5% of that or what are you looking at?
 
 
Vern Nagel -
Acuity Brands, Inc. - Chairman, CEO, President
It really depends on the products and what type of products. Obviously, that price increase was driven significantly or primarily around the steel cost and fuel cost increases. Steel, during the fourth quarter, our fourth quarter of 2008, increased literally 100% over the fourth quarter of 2007. And so if you imagine that we're using north of 50 million pounds of steel a quarter, that just has a huge impact on us. So for us, the price increase and we want to be very clear about it, the price increase we believe will offset our cost increases in these and other areas. But that's probably about it, given where the market is, but we think that's a pretty significant event in and of itself.

Next question comes from Peter Lisnic with Robert Baird. Your line is open.
 
 
Peter Lisnic -
Robert W Baird - Analyst
Good morning, everyone.
 
 
Ricky Reece -
Acuity Brands, Inc. - SVP, CFO
Good morning, how are you?
 
 
Peter Lisnic -
Robert W Baird - Analyst
Good, how are you? Vern, I was wondering if you could maybe talk about free cash flow a little bit more in terms of 09, should we expect to see the same sort of conversion rate, if you will?
 
 
Ricky Reece -
Acuity Brands, Inc. - SVP, CFO
Well, our objective continues to be  it's a long-term goal  that our cash flow, so that's cash flow from operations, minus capital expenditures, will exceed our net income. We've done that for six out of the last seven years and we are very focused on continuing to drive our cash flow. It's highlighted I think even more particularly, given this environment, where, again, we see opportunities to use our financial strength to enhance our franchise.
 
 
Peter Lisnic -
Robert W Baird - Analyst
Okay. And then just on the materials cost side, with the pressure that you saw in the fourth quarter, it looked like at least in some cases steel costs have come down. Have you built any of the declines into your forecast or expectations for next year?
 
 
Ricky Reece -
Acuity Brands, Inc. - SVP, CFO
Well, unfortunately I too have read the newspapers. But I see what the invoices look like from our vendors and they don't reflect that decline. So at this stage, we are still seeing our costs at a very high level. Diesel fuel for us went up  I mean, just between quarters, I mean, third quarter to this quarter, diesel fuel was up 11%. I mean, that increase from the third quarter, the fourth quarter cost us a half a million dollars. So we're not at this point in time anticipating pricing coming down. If it happens, then of course we will respond to that.
 
 
Peter Lisnic -
Robert W Baird - Analyst
Okay. Fair enough. And then third question for you, in terms of the $70 million that you're so far realizing from the retrofit market, if you will, can you give us a sense as to where the early penetration has been and where the biggest opportunities are and what you're doing to address those opportunities?
F T
INAL
RANSCRIPT
 
 
Vern Nagel -
Acuity Brands, Inc. - Chairman, CEO, President
Yeah, to be clear, we are not a strong player in the retrofit market. We are a player in the renovation and relight market. Retrofit is someone that would come in and change out a ballast in a lamp, as least that's how we define it. We are far more focused on how do we provide [ESCOs] and our own capabilities with lighting products that will allow them to relight the space, to renovate the space. Our focus has been, at least internally, providing these capabilities to a lot of the retail space, where folks there have great cash flows but same store sales are declining so they're looking how do they improve their profitability. We think that relight really provides them with an opportunity to, again, not only have better lighting, which is really a key, but also to enjoy the energy savings while really driving their own sustainability goals.
We have just a plethora of product that we are providing to folks, ESCOs in the marketplace, capabilities that allow them to very effectively create a value proposition around relight projects. So we're seeing it in a number of areas. The good news is that our agents in the commercial and industrial space are ramping up their investments, separately identifying these opportunities and separately identifying resources against them. We have a number of distribution channel partners that are aggressively investing in the relight market, along with us. So just how aggressively can we grow this will depend, but I will tell you that there is considerable focus on this space by people who really know how to do it.
 
 
Peter Lisnic -
Robert W Baird - Analyst
It sounds like it's mostly businesses that are relatively cash rich that the current credit crisis or issues that we're going to at the margin doesn't have that big of an impact, is that safe to say this early in the point in the cycle?
 
 
Vern Nagel -
Acuity Brands, Inc. - Chairman, CEO, President
I would say that the clients that we are dealing with are large, major organizations. As we look at REITs and things of that nature, people that own office spaces, a lot of these things are of benefit to them and usually the price points that these projects happen to be at are I think very well within people's operating budgets and are not really going to put huge strains on them. And also when you imagine you have someone that has a very large national footprint, what they're going to do as they relight their spaces, they're going to target those areas where energy costs are particularly high. And as energy costs in areas that are now artificially low, as those caps come off, you'll do it in stages. So the paybacks are quite attractive in some of these areas where energy costs are high and that's where you're seeing the renovation and relight opportunities flourish.
 
 
Peter Lisnic -
Robert W Baird - Analyst
Okay. And then last question. We can obviously build our models and kind of read the papers and all that but I'm sort of wondering, you mentioned the dodge forecast and the industry forecast and all that, but what is your gut telling you about the next call it 12 to 18 months in terms of what you're seeing from your customers and just how do you feel about the business going forward?
 
 
Vern Nagel -
Acuity Brands, Inc. - Chairman, CEO, President
Well, obviously we are  we have over 14 different channels and access points to market in North America, another couple in Europe, and our people are in front of these customers every day. What we are hearing and what we're seeing is that it's very market, channel, sector, geography specific. I mean, if you look in the Midwest, where you take places like Detroit, and Milwaukee, we're down in the 20 to 30% range because the markets are just down. But if you take other markets like Dallas, Phoenix and Vegas and some of these other places where we continue to see very solid growth, because of the value proposition that's we have, so I think it really is very dependent upon which markets are you talking about and how fast can one fall while the other one gains.
I think the wild card also continues to be new product development. We continue to see very significant benefits from products that we introduce and the acceptance of these products. We are very excited about what 2009 represents in terms of not only products incorporating newer technologies such as LED, but even products that have improved features and benefits using traditional core lamp ballast technology, all very exciting. To me, how quickly can we accelerate the introduction of these products, the market acceptance of them will be a key in really determining how much we are able to offset a projected decline in the overall market.

Hi, good morning.
 
 
Vern Nagel -
Acuity Brands, Inc. - Chairman, CEO, President
Good morning, Mike.
 
 
Mike Meek -
Atlantic Investments - Analyst
Most of my questions have been asked and answered. Just one quick macro follow-up. Obviously there's been a ton of headlines over the last couple weeks about the commercial paper market seizing up. Have you guys seen any impact from that in your business in terms of people canceling orders or maybe the offhand distributor maybe in financial distress or anything of that sort?
 
 
Ricky Reece -
Acuity Brands, Inc. - SVP, CFO
Virtually  from a distributor perspective, virtually all of the distributors that we deal with are very strong financially. I mean, the who's who list of distributors in North America. So we feel pretty good about their position. Obviously, we monitor that very, very carefully. When it comes to cancellations, then I'll refer if you will to our agency force and what we're hearing is, again, it's very market dependent. We are hearing some situations where folks have taken delay as they secure financing or look at the economics of that. But we really haven't seen, if you will, any significant cancellation of business. I think the good news is that we're pretty diversified in that arena. When I look at our job business, we actually had very nice growth in the fourth quarter. And one could say that they're finishing out these projects. But again, it's very balanced between large, medium and small float type projects.

Good morning, Steve.
 
 
Steve Searle -
Conning Asset Management - Analyst
With your current plans to pay off your debt out of cash in February 09, you'll be arguably pretty underleveraged. Would you expect to add debt back to your capital structure longer term through acquisitions or share repurchases or other activity?
 
 
Ricky Reece -
Acuity Brands, Inc. - SVP, CFO
We have  your point's obviously accurate, that after that payoff with the cash that we're likely to have, we could be in a net positive cash situation. The $200 million that becomes due in August 2010 we probably would be looking, although that's a ways out and we'll have to see what the environment and all is like, but we probably would be looking at refinancing that and using that cash as well as our cash flow to reinvest in our profitable growth strategies and our share repurchases at some point the capital structure would be more efficient with some leverage. We target a 30%, 30 to 40% total debt-to-cap kind of a ratio. We want to maintain our investment grade rating so we're sensitive to that, such that the markets will be available to us when opportunities present themselves, since the investment grade markets tend to be a lot more stable than the non-investment grade. So we would look to increase leverage when the opportunities present themselves to create value for the shareholders by investing that money.

KSA Capital Partners - Analyst
Yes, just wanted to clarify this $2.1 million pretax change that you referred to, how much of that was in the fourth quarter?
 
 
Ricky Reece
- Acuity Brands, Inc. - SVP, CFO
That is the fourth quarter's swing those items, fourth quarter this year versus last year in these non-operating items, primarily transactions, foreign currency transaction where we had a gain last year and a loss this year and similarly on sale of fixed assets, we went from a gain last year to a loss this year in the quarter. So that's a quarter swing.

Acuity Brands, Inc.
(404) 853-1423
ATLANTA  January 6, 2009  Acuity Brands, Inc. (NYSE: AYI) today announced results for the first quarter of fiscal 2009, including net sales of $452.0 million, a decline of 11 percent compared with $508.9 million for the year-ago period. Operating profit was $33.7 million and $54.9 million for the three months ended November 30, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 was $0.48 compared with $0.72 for the prior year. The results for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 include a $22.1 million pre-tax special charge, or $0.34 per diluted share, and prior year's first quarter includes a $14.6 million pre-tax special charge, or $0.21 per diluted share. The special charge in both periods relates to streamlining activities as explained below. Excluding the special charges for both periods, adjusted operating profit for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 was $55.8 million, or 12.3 percent of net sales, compared with the prior year's adjusted operating profit of $69.5 million, or 13.7 percent of net sales. Adjusted diluted EPS for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 was $0.82 compared with $0.93 for the prior year period, a decrease of 12 percent.
Mr. Nagel, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Acuity Brands, commented, "While our results in the first quarter of 2009 reflect the impact that turbulent global economic conditions are having on all manufacturing companies, these results also reflect the benefits we are realizing from our crisp execution allowing us to overcome many of the challenges we are facing. The speed of the decline in demand for lighting products and the dramatic rise in material and component costs during the quarter were unprecedented in our industry. While both negatively impacted our first quarter performance, benefits from our pricing and new product strategies, continuous improvement initiatives and streamlining efforts allowed us to partially mitigate the full impact of these events, resulting in adjusted operating profit margin in the first quarter of 2009 of over 12%."
 
The year-over-year 11 percent decline in net sales was due primarily to lower shipments, partially offset by an enhanced mix of products sold and price increases implemented to offset higher material costs. The decline in shipments was due primarily to the continued weakness in the residential market and reduced new store openings by retailers. The Company also recently began experiencing a decline in certain commercial and industrial markets as the global financial crisis and weakening economic environment adversely impacted the non-residential construction market, particularly for commercial buildings and warehouses. Additionally, unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations reduced net sales by approximately 1 percent.
Adjusted operating profit margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 was 12.3 percent compared with prior year's adjusted operating profit margin of 13.7 percent. The year-over-year 140 basis point decline in the adjusted operating profit margin was due primarily to lower profit contribution on reduced shipments and higher material and component costs, partially offset by price increases, a more favorable mix of products sold, and savings from streamlining and productivity initiatives. The Company estimates that the increase in raw material and component costs negatively impacted cost of goods sold by approximately $17 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2009.
Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the first fiscal quarter totaled $264.6 million, a decrease of $32.5 million from the $297.1 million at the beginning of the fiscal year. The decrease in cash was due primarily to increased inventory levels in an effort to maintain customer service levels in anticipation of the consolidation of certain manufacturing facilities, annual prepayments associated with non-qualified benefit obligations, investments, the effect of exchange rate changes on cash, and dividends to stockholders.
Special Charges
The fiscal 2009 first quarter special charge of $22.1 million relates primarily to the acceleration of actions to streamline the organization including consolidation of certain manufacturing facilities. The special charge includes a non-cash expense of $1.6 million for the impairment of assets associated with the closing of a facility which was previously announced. The Company expects to realize benefits from these actions during fiscal 2009 of approximately $28 million, primarily in the second half of the fiscal year following the consolidation of previously announced manufacturing operations that are scheduled to be completed by the fiscal fourth quarter. The Company expects
 
 
to realize annualized savings of approximately $45 million related to current year consolidation and streamlining efforts. In the first quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company incurred a special charge of $14.6 million related to actions to streamline and simplify the Company's organizational structure and operations following the spin-off of Zep Inc. The Company believes it has realized the previously anticipated annualized cost savings of approximately $14 million as a result of this reorganization effort.
Outlook
Mr. Nagel said, "We believe the precipitous decline in consumer confidence and the lack of credit availability, particularly during September and October, accelerated the slowdown in our core markets during the first quarter. While it is impossible to accurately forecast the full impact that these unusual events will have on our core markets in the foreseeable future or for how long, we believe unit volume for our core markets will be down at least in the middle teens for fiscal 2009.
"We anticipate that our second quarter will be challenging due primarily to the turbulent economic environment as well as normal seasonal factors, including inconsistent customer demand and the potential for inventory rebalancing by certain customers. Additionally, the spike in commodities prices, particularly steel, that occurred during the spring and summer months of 2008 is likely to continue to pressure our margins into the second quarter as these higher prices flow through our cost of goods sold as a result of the delayed timing of price increases associated with the purchase of such materials. Although we remain disciplined in our pricing for products and services, the recent decline in commodity prices will likely result in lower pricing which may negate our August 2008 price increase.
"Despite these challenges, we continue to see opportunities. During fiscal 2009, we expect to realize significant savings, primarily in the second half of the fiscal year, from previously announced actions to streamline our operations, including the consolidation of certain manufacturing operations. Additionally, we expect to continue to invest and deploy resources in profitable growth opportunities, including a continued focus on industry-leading product innovation incorporating sustainable design and increased service and product capabilities to better serve our existing customers as well as the renovation and relight market. We believe the Company is positioned well to capitalize on relight opportunities as well as infrastructure improvements, both of which were mentioned in a potential stimulus package by the Federal government. We also
 
 
continue to expand our market presence in key markets, such as the New York City metropolitan area where we have historically had limited participation. Additionally, yesterday's announced acquisition of the assets of Lighting Control & Design, Inc. will enhance our portfolio of lighting controls and energy management solutions, thus, providing opportunities to accelerate our growth in this expanding market."
Mr. Nagel concluded, "While the current turmoil in the economic environment will likely negatively impact performance during the near-term, we remain positive about our long-term future performance and our ability to outperform the market. Our past and future actions to create value for our customers, to invest in our associates to be even more customer-focused and productive, and to more effectively deploy assets to generate greater returns for our shareholders should enhance the Company's opportunity to prosper over the long-term."

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Acuity Brands' management included in the above news release the terms "adjusted diluted EPS", "adjusted operating profit", and "adjusted operating profit margin" which are non-GAAP financial measures provided to enhance the user's overall understanding of the Company's current financial performance and prospects for the future. Specifically, management believes the non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors by excluding or adjusting items related to streamlining and manufacturing consolidation activities which affected our reported operating results. We believe these special items impacted the comparability of the Company's core operating results and that these items are not reflective of fixed costs that the Company will incur over the long term. The non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, results prepared in accordance with GAAP. The most directly comparable GAAP measures for adjusted diluted EPS, adjusted operating profit, and adjusted operating profit margin are "diluted EPS", "operating profit", and "operating profit margin", respectively, all of which include the impact of special items. The non-GAAP financial measures included in this news release have been reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure.

Item 5.02. Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers; Election of Directors.
Acuity Brands, Inc. (the "Company") maintains a Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "LTIP") for the benefit of officers and other key management personnel and a Management Compensation and Incentive Plan (the "Incentive Plan") pursuant to which the Company's executive officers may receive cash incentive bonuses. For each executive officer, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors establishes: (1) a targeted equity award value under the LTIP, stated as a percentage of the officer's gross salary; and (2) a target percentage of gross salary for a cash incentive bonus payable under the Incentive Plan. Achievement of the targeted incentive bonuses and targeted long-term incentive equity awards is in each case dependent upon achievement of certain performance measures, and is subject to the discretion of the Compensation Committee for Vernon J. Nagel and Richard K. Reece.
On October 24, 2008, the Compensation Committee adopted plan rules for fiscal 2009 for executive officers to earn potential LTIP equity awards and Incentive Plan cash bonuses.

In addition to the election of Mr. Harnett, stockholders re-elected Peter C. Browning, John L. Clendenin, and Ray M. Robinson to the class of directors whose term expires at the annual meeting for fiscal year 2010. George C.

Date: January 13, 2009
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
On October 24, 2008, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Acuity Brands, Inc. adopted plan rules for potential equity awards to be earned by executive officers for performance during fiscal year 2009 under the Corporation's Long-Term Incentive Plan. The plan rules for each executive officer consist of a target award value, stated as a percentage of gross salary. The target award value for Vernon J. Nagel and Richard K. Reece is subject to the application of negative discretion by the Committee. The target award is based on achievement of specified financial performance measures, and the actual award earned increases above target or decreases below target based on the level of achievement of the financial performance measures, with no award earned (other than possible discretionary awards) if financial performance is below a specified threshold level.
The performance measure consists of a specified target for Diluted Earnings per Share for the Corporation. Achievement of the performance level is determined by the Compensation Committee following the completion of the fiscal year and award amounts are subject to the application of negative discretion for Mr. Nagel and Mr. Reece by the Committee. Awards are granted following completion of the fiscal year.
The percentage of gross salary used in determining the target award is based on competitive compensation information for positions of comparable responsibilities with comparably-sized manufacturing companies.

Acuity Brands, Inc.
(404) 853-1423
ATLANTA (March 18, 2009)  Acuity Brands, Inc. (NYSE: AYI; "Company") today announced that its wholly-owned subsidiary, Acuity Brands Lighting, Inc., has entered into an Agreement, subject to regulatory approval, to acquire 100% of the outstanding capital stock of Sensor Switch, Inc. ("Sensor Switch"), an industry-leading developer and manufacturer of lighting controls and energy management systems. Sensor Switch, based in Wallingford, Connecticut, offers a wide-breadth of products and solutions that substantially reduce energy consumption including occupancy sensors, photocontrols, and distributed lighting control devices.
Vernon J. Nagel, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Acuity Brands, said "The acquisition of Sensor Switch is part of our profitable growth strategy aimed at offering the most technologically advanced sustainable lighting solutions incorporating both controls and fixtures to maximize energy savings while delivering exceptional quality lighting for commercial, institutional, industrial and residential applications. We believe this acquisition will broaden our participation in both the new construction and building systems markets while greatly expanding our presence in the very large and dynamic renovation and relight market. We are acquiring a fast growing company, with a great team. The addition of Sensor Switch along with our recent acquisition of Lighting Control and Design allows us to expand our capabilities in offering a full array of intelligent lighting products and lighting control solutions in a time when energy management control is critical."
The terms of the agreement reflect total consideration for the purchase of approximately $205 million consisting of stock, cash, and a note payable. The cash payment will be funded from available cash and from borrowings under the Company's existing credit facility. The acquisition is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions both of which are expected to be achieved within the following 30 days.
 
 
Sensor Switch generated sales in excess of $37 million during its fiscal year ending October 31, 2008. The business has significantly outpaced the rate of growth in its core markets with a three-year annualized growth rate of approximately 30 percent and EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) margins well above industry norms. The acquisition is expected to be slightly accretive to results in the first full year of ownership.
Mr. Nagel concluded, "The demand for energy-efficient solutions is expected to continue to grow as a result of higher energy costs, greater environmental awareness, and increased regulation. Because lighting represents up to 40 percent of energy consumption in many commercial, institutional, and industrial facilities, we believe our enhanced portfolio of intelligent lighting fixtures and lighting controls will provide continuing profitable growth opportunities by providing this expanding customer base with a variety of solutions to meet their individual needs."
Acuity Brands, Inc. owns and operates Acuity Brands Lighting, Inc. and Acuity Brands Technology Services, Inc. With fiscal year 2008 net sales of approximately $2.0 billion, Acuity Brands Lighting and Acuity Brands Technology Services combined are one of the world's leading providers of lighting fixtures and related products and services and include brands such as Lithonia Lighting, Holophane, Peerless, Mark Architectural Lighting, Hydrel, American Electric Lighting, Gotham, Carandini, SpecLight, MetalOptics, Antique Street Lamps, Synergy Lighting Controls, Lighting Control & Design, SAERIS, and ROAM. Headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, Acuity Brands employs approximately 6,200 associates and has operations throughout North America and in Europe and Asia.

(404) 853-1423
ATLANTA  April 2, 2009  Acuity Brands, Inc. (NYSE: AYI) today announced results for the second quarter of fiscal 2009, including net sales of $386.1 million, a decline of 20 percent compared with $482.6 million for the year-ago period. Operating profit for the second quarter of fiscal 2009 was $28.6 million, or 7.4 percent of net sales, compared with $60.7 million, or 12.6 percent of net sales, for the year-ago period. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) for the second quarter of fiscal 2009 were $0.35 compared with $0.82 for the prior year. The results for the second quarter of fiscal 2009 include a $4.6 million pre-tax special charge, or $0.07 per diluted share. The special charge relates primarily to the further acceleration of previously announced streamlining activities as explained below. Fiscal 2009 second quarter adjusted operating profit, which excludes the special charge, was $33.2 million, or 8.6 percent of net sales.
The decline in net sales was due primarily to lower demand for lighting fixtures in most commercial and industrial markets and continued weakness in the residential housing market. The impact of the stronger dollar on international sales contributed approximately 2 percentage points to the year-over-year decline in net sales. Management estimates that an enhanced mix of products sold and price increases implemented in the prior year to offset higher material costs partially offset the decline in unit volume by approximately 2 percentage points. The acquisition of Lighting Control and Design contributed less than 1 percent to net sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2009.
Mr. Nagel, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Acuity Brands, commented, "Our performance for the second quarter of 2009 reflects the continued steep decline in construction activity as a direct result of deteriorating economic conditions around the globe. As we previously commented, profitability for the second quarter of fiscal 2009 was also negatively impacted by higher raw material and component costs resulting from last year's spike in commodity prices and due to its temporary duration we were not able to pass this
 
 
increase onto our customers in the form of higher prices. We estimate the impact of the higher raw material costs in our second quarter was over $6 million, or 1.6 percent of net sales. Benefits from our continuous improvement initiatives and streamlining efforts allowed us to partially mitigate the impact of these items."
Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the first half of fiscal 2009 were $0.83, a decrease of 46 percent compared with $1.54 per share for the prior year period. Income from continuing operations for the first half of fiscal 2009 declined to $33.8 million, a decrease of 48 percent versus the year-ago period while net sales declined 15 percent to $838.2 million.
Special Charges
The Company accelerated its previously announced streamlining efforts during the second quarter of fiscal 2009 with an additional reduction in the Company's workforce of approximately 200 associates and recorded a special charge of $4.6 million for related severance, amortization of retention pay, and benefits. Results for the first half of both fiscal 2009 and 2008 include special charges of $26.6 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, and $14.6 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, respectively. The special charges relate to actions to streamline and simplify the Company's organizational structure. Annualized cost savings of $14 million have been realized from streamlining actions taken during the first half of fiscal 2008. Management expects to realize more than $50 million of annualized cost savings as a result of the streamlining actions taken in fiscal 2009 of which approximately $20 million is expected to be realized in the second half of the current fiscal year following the consolidation of previously announced manufacturing operations that are scheduled to be substantially complete by the fiscal fourth quarter.
Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the second fiscal quarter totaled $72.3 million, a decrease of $224.8 million from the $297.1 million at the beginning of the fiscal year. The decrease in cash was due primarily to the retirement of $160 million in debt obligations and $31 million utilized for acquisitions and investments. Also contributing to the decline in cash were $12 million in capital expenditures and $11 million in dividends to stockholders.
 
 
Outlook
Mr. Nagel said, "Rising unemployment and tight credit markets as well as other factors have created great uncertainty regarding the direction and vitality of our economy. These factors have contributed to very low consumer and business confidence levels resulting in a decidedly bearish sentiment regarding future near-term construction activity. As a result of extreme volatility in the market place, the correlation of traditional measures for gauging future construction activity is making it difficult to forecast future shorter-term demand for lighting fixtures. Nevertheless, we expect the percentage decline in our full year revenues compared with the year ago period to be at least in the middle to upper teens.
"Our profitability in the second half of fiscal 2009 should benefit from seasonally higher sales, increased benefits from previously announced streamlining actions, and lower material costs as compared to the first half of the fiscal year, partially offset by a more competitive pricing environment. We expect cash flows to be positive in the second half of fiscal 2009 driven by inventory reductions following the completion of the consolidation of certain manufacturing facilities. Efforts to lower inventory may negatively impact profitability in the second half due to the under-absorption of costs as we temporarily produce fewer products than we sell. While the recent acquisition of Lighting Control and Design and the proposed acquisition of Sensor Switch, Inc. are important strategic additions with great longer-term potential, they are not expected to materially impact our results for the remainder of fiscal 2009.
"Our backlog at the end of the second quarter was $138 million, down 14 percent versus the prior year, and incoming orders in March are down nearly 20 percent compared with the year ago period.
"While the current turmoil in the economic environment will likely negatively impact results in the near-term, we remain very positive about the long-term future performance of our company and our ability to outperform the market. We continue to position the Company to optimize short-term performance while investing in and deploying resources to further our profitable growth opportunities for the long-term. We continue to focus on and invest in industry-leading product innovation incorporating sustainable design and increased service and product capabilities to better serve our existing customers as well as the renovation and relight market. With our recent acquisition of Lighting Control and Design and completion of our announced acquisition of Sensor Switch, Inc., we are creating a platform with extensive capabilities affording us the opportunity to be an industry leader. We will offer some of the
 
 
most technologically advanced sustainable lighting solutions incorporating both controls and fixtures to maximize energy savings while delivering exceptional quality. We believe these acquisitions will accelerate our participation in both the new construction market and the building energy management systems market while greatly expanding our presence in the very large and dynamic renovation and relight market."
Mr. Nagel concluded, "These are extraordinarily challenging times. However, our past and future actions to create value for our customers, invest in our associates to be even more customer-focused and productive, and more effectively deploy assets to generate greater returns for our shareholders should enhance the Company's opportunity to prosper over the long-term."
Please see the Company's Form 10-Q which is expected to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission by the end of day on Wednesday, April 8, 2009, for more information on fiscal 2009 second quarter results. You may access the 10-Q through the Company's website at .

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Acuity Brands' management included in the above news release the term "adjusted operating profit" which is a non-GAAP financial measure provided to enhance the user's overall understanding of the Company's current financial performance and prospects for the future. Specifically, management believes this non-GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors by excluding or adjusting items related to streamlining and manufacturing consolidation activities. We believe these special items impacted the comparability of the Company's core operating results and that these items are not reflective of fixed costs that the Company will incur over the long term. The non-GAAP financial measure should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, results prepared in accordance with GAAP. The most directly comparable GAAP measure for adjusted operating profit is "operating profit", which includes the impact of special items. The non-GAAP financial measure included in this news release has been reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure.

ATLANTA  July 2, 2009  Acuity Brands, Inc. (NYSE: AYI) today announced results for the third quarter of fiscal 2009, including net sales of $396.6 million, a decline of 23 percent compared with $512.4 million for the year-ago period. Recent acquisitions represented approximately two percent of net sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2009. As a result of the stronger dollar, the translation impact on international sales reduced fiscal 2009 third quarter net sales by approximately two percentage points as compared with the prior year period. Operating profit for the third quarter of fiscal 2009 was $41.5 million, or 10.5 percent of net sales, compared with $71.7 million, or 14.0 percent of net sales, for the year-ago period. Income from continuing operations for the third quarter of fiscal 2009 was $22.3 million compared with $41.7 million for the same period a year ago. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations for the third quarter of fiscal 2009 were $0.54 compared with $1.01 for the prior year period.
Mr. Nagel, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Acuity Brands, commented, "Net sales for the third quarter of 2009 continued to be impacted by the significant decline in construction activity, particularly in key markets such as commercial and office buildings. New construction continues to be impacted by lower economic activity and tight credit markets for real estate lending. We were able to partially mitigate the impact of lower sales, including realizing benefits from our continuous improvement initiatives and on-going streamlining efforts while continuing to invest in innovative and energy-efficient products. During the third quarter, we realized savings of approximately $10 million from streamlining actions taken in the first half of fiscal 2009. Additionally, results for the third quarter of fiscal 2009 were impacted by higher raw material and component costs, which we estimate were approximately $8 million higher than the prior year period. During the third quarter, we completed the acquisition of Sensor Switch, Inc. ("Sensor Switch"), an industry-leading developer and manufacturer of lighting controls and energy management systems. We believe the addition of Sensor Switch, along with our recent acquisition of Lighting Control & Design, allows us to expand our capabilities in offering a full array of intelligent lighting products and lighting control solutions in a time when energy management control is critical.
"
 
 
Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the nine months ended May 31, 2009 were $1.36, a decline of 47 percent compared with $2.55 for the prior year period. Income from continuing operations for the first nine months of fiscal 2009 was $56.1 million, a decrease of 47 percent versus the year-ago period, while net sales declined 18 percent to $1,234.8 million. Results for the first nine months of fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 include special charges of $26.6 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, and $14.6 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, respectively. The special charges relate to on-going actions to streamline and simplify the Company's organizational structure and operations. For the nine months ended May 31, 2009, the Company estimates that it realized savings of approximately $26 million from these actions of which an estimated $17 million relates to actions taken during fiscal 2009. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, the Company expects to realize an estimated $11 million of savings from streamlining actions taken during fiscal 2009. Management expects to realize more than $50 million of annualized cost savings from the streamlining actions taken in fiscal 2009, including the consolidation of previously announced manufacturing operations that are scheduled to be substantially complete by the end of the fiscal year.
The results for both periods exclude those of the specialty chemicals business, which was spun off to the shareholders of Acuity Brands on October 31, 2007 as Zep Inc. The historical results of the specialty chemicals business are reported in discontinued operations. The Company reported a diluted loss per share from discontinued operations of $0.01 in both the third quarter of fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008. The losses in both periods represent income tax adjustments associated with previous earnings generated by the specialty chemicals business. The Company reported a diluted loss per share from discontinued operations of $0.01 for the first nine months of both fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008.
Including the results of discontinued operations, the Company reported diluted EPS of $0.53 for the third quarter of fiscal 2009, or $22.0 million of net income, compared with diluted EPS of $1.00 for the third quarter of fiscal 2008, or $41.1 million of net income. Including the results of discontinued operations, the Company reported diluted EPS of $1.35 for the first nine months of fiscal 2009, or $55.8 million of net income, compared with diluted EPS of $2.54 for the first nine months of fiscal 2008, or $106.4 million of net income.
 
 
Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the third fiscal quarter totaled $28.3 million, a decrease of $268.8 million from the $297.1 million at the beginning of the fiscal year. The decrease in cash was due primarily to the retirement of the $160 million public notes that matured in February 2009 and $162 million utilized for acquisitions and other strategic investments. Total debt outstanding at May 31, 2009 was $294.8 million which included $60.8 million of borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facility and a $30 million three-year unsecured note issued to the seller of Sensor Switch as partial consideration for the acquisition of the business.
Outlook
Mr. Nagel commented, "Looking ahead, we continue to foresee a very difficult economic environment, particularly for non-residential construction activity, a primary market for us. Key indicators continue to signal declines for both residential and non-residential construction activity for the balance of 2009 and into 2010. Our backlog at the end of the third quarter was down 21 percent on a year-over-year comparable basis.
"We expect our profitability in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 to reflect additional benefits from previously announced streamlining actions and lower material costs as compared to the first nine months of the fiscal year. Also, we expect pricing to continue to become more competitive in certain channels and geographies. We forecast cash flows to remain positive through the remainder of fiscal 2009 due to forecasted earnings and lower operating working capital driven by inventory reductions following the completion of the consolidation of certain manufacturing facilities. While the recent acquisitions of Lighting Control & Design and Sensor Switch are important strategic additions with great longer-term potential, we do not expect them to materially impact our results for the remainder of fiscal 2009."
Mr. Nagel continued, "Although near-term results will continue to be negatively impacted by current economic conditions, we remain very positive about the long-term future performance of our company and our ability to outperform the market. We continue to position the Company to optimize short-term performance while investing in and deploying resources to further our profitable growth opportunities for the long-term. With our recent acquisitions, we are creating a lighting controls and energy management platform with extensive capabilities affording us the opportunity to be an industry leader in this rapidly growing market.
 
 
"We believe the execution of our longer-term strategies to focus on productivity improvement, accelerate investments in innovative and energy-efficient products, expand market presence in key sectors such as the renovation and relight market, and enhance services to our customers will provide growth opportunities which will enable us to outperform the market. Looking beyond the current environment, we believe the lighting and lighting-related industry will experience solid growth over the next decade, particularly as energy and environmental concerns come to the forefront, and we believe we are now well positioned to fully participate in this exciting industry."
Mr. Nagel concluded, "These are extraordinarily challenging times. However, our past and future actions to create value for our customers, invest in our associates to be even more customer-focused and productive, and more effectively deploy assets to generate greater returns for our shareholders should enhance the Company's opportunity to prosper over the long-term."

This Form 8-K/A is being filed to amend the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by Acuity Brands, Inc. on March 18, 2009 to include specific Item 3.02 disclosure that was inadvertently left out of the original filing.
 
On March 18, 2009, Acuity Brands, Inc. (the "Company"), Acuity Brands Lighting, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, Sensor Switch, Inc. and Brian Platner entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the "Agreement") pursuant to which Acuity Brands Lighting will acquire from Mr. Platner all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Sensor Switch (the "Acquisition").
In consideration for the Acquisition, Mr. Platner will receive the aggregate consideration of $205 million to be comprised of (i) 2 million shares of common stock of the Company, (ii) a $30 million note of Acuity Brands Lighting and (iii) approximately $131 million of cash. The purchase price is subject to a post-closing adjustment and may be increased or reduced as provided in the Agreement.
The Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, certain of which will survive closing for specified periods. In addition, the Agreement includes customary covenants and indemnification obligations, capped at specified amounts, and an escrow fund for the benefit of Acuity Brands Lighting and the Company following the closing of the Acquisition to satisfy certain indemnification obligations that may arise. Acuity Brands Lighting and the Company have also agreed to indemnify Mr. Platner under certain circumstances. Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, the Company has agreed to file a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to cover the resale of the shares being issued to Mr. Platner in the Acquisition.
The Acquisition is currently expected to close during the Company's fiscal third quarter of 2009, subject to certain conditions contained in the Agreement, including the continuing accuracy of representations and warranties and the completion of certain regulatory procedures.
The foregoing summary of the Agreement is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
 
As discussed above, on March 18, 2009 the Company entered into the Agreement pursuant to which 2 million shares of common stock of the Company would be sold to Mr. Platner as partial consideration for the $205 million Acquisition. 906,084 of such shares will be deposited into an escrow account, and will remain in such account for a period of up to 24 months, for the purpose of securing the indemnification obligations of Mr. Platner set forth in the Agreement and for securing the payment obligations of Mr. Platner pursuant to any post-closing adjustment as determined in accordance with the Agreement. The sale was exempted from registration pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, under which the shares will be issued as restricted securities to an accredited investor. Pursuant to the Agreement, Mr. Platner made certain investor representations to the Company, including that he qualified as an accredited investor. The Company also agreed to file a registration statement to register for resale all such shares sold to Mr. Platner.
 
On March 18, 2009, the Company issued a press release announcing the Acquisition. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference.

Acuity Brands, Inc.
(404) 853-1423
ATLANTA, October 07, 2009  Acuity Brands, Inc. (NYSE: AYI) today announced diluted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 of $0.68 compared with $1.02 for the prior year period. The Company reported fourth quarter net sales of $422.6 million, a decline of 19 percent compared with the $522.8 million reported in the year-ago period. Comparable shipment volumes declined approximately 17 percent versus the year-ago period. As a result of the stronger dollar, the translation impact on international sales reduced fiscal 2009 fourth quarter net sales by approximately one percentage point as compared with the prior year period. Recent acquisitions contributed approximately $15 million to fourth quarter net sales and essentially offset the negative impact from unfavorable price/mix changes.
Operating profit for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 was $49.9 million, or 11.8 percent of net sales, compared with $73.7 million, or 14.1 percent of net sales, for the year-ago period. Benefits from on-going streamlining efforts, productivity improvements, and lower incentive-based compensation helped to partially offset the full impact of the decline in shipment volume and unfavorable price/mix changes. During the fourth quarter, the Company realized savings of approximately $11 million from streamlining actions initiated in the first half of fiscal 2009. Income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 was $29.1 million compared with $41.9 million for the same period a year ago.
Mr. Nagel, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Acuity Brands, commented, "Our associates continue to demonstrate their resolve and skill by delivering superior value to our customers and solid performance for our shareholders while confronting extremely challenging market conditions. Net sales for the fourth quarter of 2009 were impacted by the significant decline in new construction activity due
 
 
to lower economic activity and tight lending standards for real estate. We were able to partially mitigate the impact of lower sales by maintaining our pricing discipline and realizing benefits from our continuous improvement initiatives and on-going streamlining efforts, while continuing to invest in innovative and energy-efficient products. I am particularly pleased with our strong operating profit margin for the fourth quarter."
The consolidated income tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2009 was 32.6 percent compared with 36.5 percent for the fourth quarter of 2008. The decrease in the tax rate was due primarily to the impact of favorable discrete tax items on the lower earnings amount. Additionally, last year's tax rate was negatively impacted by an unfavorable discrete item associated with the repatriation of foreign cash.
2009 Fiscal Year
Fiscal 2009 diluted EPS from continuing operations decreased 43 percent to $2.05 compared with $3.57 reported for fiscal 2008. Results for both fiscal year 2009 and 2008 include pre-tax special charges of $26.7 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, and $14.6 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, respectively. The special charges related to actions to streamline and simplify the Company's organizational structure and operations. Consolidated net sales in fiscal 2009 were $1,657.4 million compared with $2,026.6 million reported in the year-ago period, a decline of 18 percent. Operating profit for fiscal 2009 was $153.8 million compared with operating profit of $261.1 million reported in the prior year, a decrease of 41 percent. The special charges reduced operating margins for fiscal year 2009 and 2008 by 160 basis points and 70 basis points, respectively. Income from continuing operations for fiscal 2009 was $85.2 million compared with $148.6 million reported for fiscal 2008.
For fiscal 2009, the Company reported $2.1 million of other income compared with $2.1 million of other expense in the year-ago period representing a favorable change of over $4.2 million. The year-over-year favorable change was due primarily to the impact of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency items and other non-operating items.
The consolidated income tax rate for fiscal 2009 was 33.1 percent compared with 35.5 percent for fiscal 2008. The decrease in the annual tax rate was due primarily to the greater impact of tax credits and deductions on the lower earnings amount.
 
 
Acuity Brands completed the spin-off of Zep Inc. on October 31, 2007. Therefore, the Company reflects the results of Zep Inc. as a discontinued operation reported as a one-line item on the income statement. For fiscal years 2009 and 2008, the Company reported losses from discontinued operations of $0.3 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, and $0.4 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, respectively.
Including the results of discontinued operations, the Company reported diluted EPS of $2.04 for fiscal 2009, or $85.0 million of net income, compared to diluted EPS of $3.56 for fiscal 2008, or $148.3 million of net income.
For fiscal 2009, the Company generated over $71 million in free cash flow after $21 million of capital expenditures. Cash and cash equivalents at August 31, 2009 totaled $18.7 million, a decrease of $278.4 million since the beginning of the fiscal year. The decrease in cash was due primarily to the retirement of the $160 million public notes that matured in February 2009 and $162 million utilized for acquisitions and other strategic investments, partially offset by the free cash flow noted above. Total debt outstanding at August 31, 2009 was $231.6 million, a decrease of $132.4 million since the beginning of the fiscal year.
Outlook
Mr. Nagel commented, "Looking ahead to next year, we continue to foresee a difficult and challenging economic environment, particularly for non-residential construction activity, a primary market for us. Our backlog at the end of the fourth quarter was down 23 percent on a year-over-year comparable basis. Key indicators continue to signal declines for North American non-residential construction activity and our expectation is that the overall markets we serve will decline in the mid-teens in our coming fiscal year. In addition to the recent acquisitions which significantly increased our presence in the fast growing lighting controls market, we believe the execution of our strategies to accelerate investments in innovative and energy-efficient products, enhance services to our customers, and expand market presence in key sectors such as home centers and the renovation and relight market will provide growth opportunities which should enable us to outperform the overall markets we serve.
"We expect our profitability in fiscal 2010 to reflect additional benefits from recent acquisitions and streamlining actions initiated during 2009. Although pricing is likely to
 
 
become more competitive in certain channels and geographies, we expect to offset this negative impact through productivity improvements and lower material, component, and freight costs. We intend to invest approximately $35 million in capital expenditures during fiscal 2010, and we estimate the annual tax rate to approximate 35 percent for the year.
"Although fiscal 2010 results will continue to be negatively impacted by current economic conditions, we remain very positive about the long-term potential of our company and our ability to outperform the market. We continue to position the Company to optimize short-term performance while investing in and deploying resources to further our long-term profitable growth opportunities."
Mr. Nagel concluded, "Looking beyond the current environment, we believe the lighting and lighting-related industry will experience solid growth over the next decade, particularly as energy and environmental concerns come to the forefront, and we believe we are well positioned to fully participate in this exciting industry."
The Company's independent registered public accountant's audit opinion with respect to the fiscal year-end financial statements will not be issued until the Company completes its annual report on Form 10-K, including its evaluation of internal controls over financial reporting. Accordingly, the financial results reported in this earnings release are preliminary pending completion of the audit. In addition, the classification of the purchase price allocation for recent acquisitions, LC&D and Sensor Switch, remains subject to finalization.

On November 12, 2009, Acuity Brands, Inc.

ATLANTA, December 1, 2009  Acuity Brands, Inc. (NYSE: AYI) (the "Company") today announced that it has commenced a tender offer to purchase for cash any and all of the outstanding 8.375% Notes due 2010 (CUSIP No. 00508YAB8), for which the Company and Acuity Brands Lighting, Inc. are co-obligors (the "2010 Notes"). The tender offer is being made pursuant to an Offer to Purchase dated today (the "Offer to Purchase") and related Letter of Transmittal, which more fully set forth the terms and conditions of the tender offer.
The following table summarizes the material pricing terms of the Tender Offer:
 
The tender offer is scheduled to expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on December 9, 2009, unless extended or earlier terminated. The Company expects to pay for the 2010 Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn in the tender offer promptly following the expiration of the tender offer with proceeds from a concurrent offering of senior unsecured notes of Acuity Brands Lighting, Inc., the Company's wholly-owned operating subsidiary.
The purchase price for each $1,000 principal amount of 2010 Notes validly tendered, not withdrawn, and accepted for payment pursuant to the tender offer will be determined in the manner described in the Offer to Purchase by taking a fixed spread of 20 basis points over the bid-side yield to maturity of the 2.75% U.S. Treasury Notes due July 31, 2010 (based on the price for such Treasury security at 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on December 7, 2009 (such time and date as the same may be extended)). The purchase price for the 2010 Notes will be announced by news release promptly after its determination.
In addition, holders who validly tender and do not validly withdraw their 2010 Notes will be paid any accrued and unpaid interest on the 2010 Notes from the most recent interest payment date up to, but not including, the settlement date.
The tender offer is subject to the condition that Acuity Brands Lighting, Inc. shall have raised at least $225 million from its concurrent offering of senior unsecured notes, as well as certain other customary conditions.
The Company will accept and settle validly tendered 2010 Notes upon satisfaction of the conditions to the tender offer, which is expected to be the first business day following the date on which the tender offer expires, or as soon thereafter as practicable.
Except as set forth in the Offer to Purchase or as required by applicable law, 2010 Notes tendered may be withdrawn only on or before the expiration of the tender offer, and tendered 2010 Notes may not be withdrawn after the expiration of the tender offer.
The Company has retained J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and Banc of America Securities LLC to serve as the dealer managers for the tender offer and has retained Global Bondholder Services Corporation to serve as the depositary and information agent for the tender offer.

This press release is neither an offer to purchase nor a solicitation of an offer to sell the 2010 Notes or any other securities, nor shall it constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale is unlawful. The tender offer is made only by and pursuant to the terms of the Offer to Purchase and the related Letter of Transmittal.

Overview
On December 8, 2009 (the "Closing Date"), Acuity Brands Lighting, Inc. ("ABL"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Acuity Brands, Inc.

The Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction. The Notes were offered in the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A of the Securities Act and outside the United Stated pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act.
Indenture and Notes
The following is a brief description of the material provisions of the Indenture and the Notes. The description of the Indenture and the Notes contained herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Indenture and form of 6.00% Senior Note due 2019, filed as Exhibits 4.1 and 4.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K, which are incorporated by reference.
Interest Payments
Interest on the Notes is payable semiannually on June 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing on June 15, 2010.
Guarantees
The Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Company and ABL IP Holding (the "Guarantees").
Ranking
The Notes are senior unsecured obligations of ABL and rank equally in right of payment with all of ABL's existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness. The guarantees of the Company and ABL IP Holding are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and ABL IP Holding and rank equally in right of payment with their other senior unsecured indebtedness.
Optional Redemption
The Notes will be redeemable, in whole or in part, at ABL's option at any time, or from time to time prior to maturity, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice, at a price of equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed; and (2) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal of and interest on the note that would be due after the related redemption date but for the redemption, discounted to the redemption date, on a semiannual basis at a rate equal to the sum of a treasury rate calculated in accordance with the terms of the Indenture plus 40 basis points, plus, in each case, accrued interest thereon to the redemption date.
Change of Control
If a Change of Control Triggering Event (as defined in the Indenture) occurs, unless the Company has exercised its right to redeem all of the Notes as described above, ABL will be required to make an offer to repurchase all or, at the holder's option, any part, of each holder's Notes on the terms set forth in the Notes for cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Notes, to, but not including the date of purchase.
Other Covenants
The Indenture contains certain covenants limiting ABL's and the Company's ability to (subject to certain exceptions) create liens, enter into sale and leaseback transactions and merge, consolidate, sell or otherwise dispose of their properties and assets substantially as an entirety.
Events of Default
The Indenture contains customary events of default which, if any of them occurs, would permit or require the principal of and accrued interest on the Notes to become or to be declared due and payable.
Registration Rights Agreement
In connection with the issuance of the Notes, ABL, the Company and ABL IP Holding entered into a registration rights agreement, dated as of December 8, 2009, with the initial purchasers of the Notes (the "Registration Rights Agreement"), obligating the Company to use its commercially reasonable efforts to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") and cause to become effective a registration statement (the "Exchange Offer Registration Statement") relating to an offer to exchange the Notes for new notes with terms substantially identical in all material respects with the Notes by December 8, 2010 (the "Exchange Offer"). Once the Exchange Offer Registration Statement has been declared effective, the Company will offer the exchange notes in exchange for surrender of the Notes. In the event the Exchange Offer Registration Statement is not available and in certain other circumstances, a registration statement providing for resales of the Notes will be filed.
This description of the Registration Rights Agreement is qualified in its entirety by the Registration Rights Agreement filed as Exhibit 4.3 to this Current Report on Form 8-K, which is incorporated herein by reference.
 
The information set forth above under Item 1.01 is hereby incorporated by reference into this Item 2.03.

Such notice shall be accompanied by an Officer's Certificate from the Company to the effect that such redemption shall comply with the conditions herein. The record date relating to such redemption shall be selected by the Company and set forth in the related notice given to the Trustee, which record date shall be not less than 15 days prior to the date selected for redemption by the Company.
 
SECTION 3.2. . If fewer than all the Notes then outstanding are to be redeemed, the Trustee shall select the Notes to be redeemed pro rata or by lot or by any other method that complies with applicable legal and securities exchange requirements, if any, and that the Trustee considers, in its discretion, to be fair and appropriate in accordance with methods generally used at the time of selection by fiduciaries in similar circumstances. The Trustee shall make the selection from outstanding Notes not previously called for redemption. Notes and portions thereof that the Trustee selects shall be in amounts of $2,000 or integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. Provisions of this Indenture that apply to Notes called for redemption also apply to portions of Notes called for redemption. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of the Notes or portions of Notes to be redeemed.
Selection of Notes to be Redeemed
SECTION 3.3. . At least 30 days but not more than 60 days before a date for redemption of the Notes, as the case may be, notice of redemption shall be mailed by first-class mail to each Holder of Notes to be redeemed at its registered address.

The notice shall identify the Notes to be redeemed and shall state:
(1) the redemption date;
(2) the redemption price (or the method of calculating such price) and the amount of accrued interest to be paid, if any;
(3) the name and address of the Paying Agent;
(4) that Notes called for redemption must be surrendered to the Paying Agent to collect the redemption price plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any;

The notice, if mailed in the manner herein provided, shall be conclusively presumed to have been given, whether or not the Holder
 
receives such notice. In any case, failure to give such notice by mail or any defect in the notice to the Holder of any Note designated for redemption as a whole or in part shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other Notes.

(b) No provision of this Indenture shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Notes or the rights of any Holder thereof or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding; , that the Trustee may, on behalf of the Holders, vote for the election of a trustee in bankruptcy or similar official and be a member of a creditors' or other similar committee.

determination in such proceeding, the Company, the Guarantors, the Trustee and the Holders shall be restored severally and respectively to their former positions hereunder and thereafter all rights and remedies of the Trustee and the Holders shall continue as though no such proceeding had been instituted.
SECTION 6.10. . No right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee or to the Holders is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right and remedy shall, to the extent permitted by law, be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise.

Rights and Remedies Cumulative
SECTION 6.11. . No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Holder of any Notes to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any Event of Default shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence therein.

(2) in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which under Article IX cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each outstanding Note affected.
 
Upon any such waiver, such default shall cease to exist and be deemed not to have occurred, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured and not to have occurred, for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or impair any right consequent thereon.

A successor Trustee shall deliver a written acceptance of its appointment to the retiring Trustee and to the Company and the Company shall pay all amounts due and owing to the Trustee under Section 7.6 of the Indenture.

The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes with respect to which any default under the Indenture shall have occurred and be continuing may, on behalf of the Holders of all Notes, waive such past default under the Indenture and its consequences, except a default (1) in the
 
payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on any Note, or (2) in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which under the Indenture cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each outstanding Note affected.

Noteholders may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture. The Trustee may refuse to enforce the Indenture or the Notes unless it receives reasonable indemnity. Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The Trustee may withhold from Noteholders notice of any continuing Default or Event of Default (except a Default or Event of Default in payment of principal (or premium, if any) or interest) if it in good faith determines that withholding notice is not opposed to their interest.
 
No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of or premium, if any, or the interest, if any, on this Note, or for any claim based thereon, or upon any obligation, covenant or agreement of the Company or any of the Guarantors in the Indenture, against any incorporator, limited partner, shareholder, trustee, director, officer or employee, as such, past, present of future, of the Company, of any of the Guarantors or of any successor entity to the Company or any of the Guarantors, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law or by the enforcement of any assessment of penalty or otherwise; and all such personal liability is expressly released and waived as a condition of, and as part of the consideration for, the issuance of this Note.

covenant or provision hereof which under the Indenture cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each outstanding Note affected.
 
If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes may declare all the Notes to be due and payable immediately. Certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency involving the Company are Events of Default which will result in the Notes being due and payable immediately upon the occurrence of such Events of Default.
Noteholders may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture. The Trustee may refuse to enforce the Indenture or the Notes unless it receives reasonable indemnity. Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The Trustee may withhold from Noteholders notice of any continuing Default or Event of Default (except a Default or Event of Default in payment of principal (or premium, if any) or interest) if it in good faith determines that withholding notice is not opposed to their interest.
 
No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or the interest, if any, on this Note, or for any claim based thereon, or upon any obligation, covenant or agreement of the Company or any of the Guarantors in the Indenture, against any incorporator, limited partner, shareholder, trustee, director, officer or employee, as such, past, present of future, of the Company, of any of the Guarantors or of any successor entity to the Company or any of the Guarantors, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law or by the enforcement of any assessment of penalty or otherwise; and all such personal liability is expressly released and waived as a condition of, and as part of the consideration for, the issuance of this Note.

As a condition to participating in the Exchange Offer, a Holder will be required to represent to the Company and the Guarantors that (i) any Exchange Securities to be received by it will be acquired in the ordinary course of its business, (ii) at the time of the commencement of the Exchange Offer it has no arrangement or understanding with any Person to participate in the distribution (within the meaning of the Securities Act) of the Exchange Securities in violation of the provisions of the Securities Act, (iii) it is not an "affiliate" (within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act) of the Company or the Guarantors and (iv) if such Holder is a broker-dealer that will receive Exchange Securities for its own account in exchange for Registrable Securities that were acquired as a result of market-making or other trading activities, then such Holder will deliver a Prospectus (or, to the extent permitted by law, make available a Prospectus to purchasers) in connection with any resale of such Exchange Securities.
As soon as practicable after the last Exchange Date, the Company and the Guarantors shall:

The Exchange Offer shall not be subject to any conditions, other than that the Exchange Offer does not violate any applicable law or applicable interpretations of the Staff.
(b) In the event that (i) the Company and the Guarantors determine that the Exchange Offer Registration provided for in Section 2(a) above is not available or may not be completed as soon as practicable after the last Exchange Date because it would violate any applicable law or applicable interpretations of
 
the Staff, (ii) the Exchange Offer is not for any other reason completed by December 8, 2010 or (iii) upon receipt of a written request (a "Shelf Request") from any Initial Purchaser representing that it holds Registrable Securities that are or were ineligible to be exchanged in the Exchange Offer, the Company and the Guarantors shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be filed as soon as practicable after such determination date or Shelf Request, as the case may be, a Shelf Registration Statement providing for the sale of all the Registrable Securities by the Holders thereof and to have such Shelf Registration Statement become effective; , , that no Holder (other than an Initial Purchaser) shall be entitled to have Securities held by it covered by such Shelf Registration Statement unless such Holder agrees in writing to be bound by the provisions of this Agreement that are applicable to such Holder.
provided
however
In the event that the Company and the Guarantors are required to file a Shelf Registration Statement pursuant to Section 2(b)(iii) above, the Company and the Guarantors shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to file and have become effective both an Exchange Offer Registration Statement pursuant to Section 2(a) with respect to all Registrable Securities and a Shelf Registration Statement (which may be a combined Registration Statement with the Exchange Offer Registration Statement) with respect to offers and sales of Registrable Securities held by the Initial Purchasers after completion of the Exchange Offer.
The Company and the Guarantors agree to use their commercially reasonable efforts to keep the Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective until the date which is one year after the effective date of the Shelf Registration Statement or such shorter period that will terminate when all the Registrable Securities covered by the Shelf Registration Statement have been sold pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement (the "Shelf Effectiveness Period"). The Company and the Guarantors further agree to supplement or amend the Shelf Registration Statement, the related Prospectus and any Free Writing Prospectus if required by the rules, regulations or instructions applicable to the registration form used by the Company or the Guarantors for such Shelf Registration Statement or by the Securities Act or by any other rules and regulations thereunder or if reasonably requested by a Holder of Registrable Securities with respect to information relating to such Holder, and to use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause any such amendment to become effective, if required, and such Shelf Registration Statement, Prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus, as the case may be, to become usable as soon as thereafter practicable. The Company and the Guarantors agree to furnish to the Holders of Registrable Securities copies of any such supplement or amendment promptly after its being used or filed with the SEC. Such delivery requirement shall not apply with respect to any filing of a report or document under the Exchange Act, at any time following the effective date of the applicable Shelf Registration Statement, when such filing is made to satisfy the Parent Guarantor's periodic disclosure obligations under Sections 13 and 15 of the Exchange Act.
 
(c) The Company and the Guarantors shall pay all Registration Expenses in connection with any registration pursuant to Section 2(a) or Section 2(b) hereof. Each Holder shall pay any underwriting discounts and commissions, brokerage commissions and transfer taxes, if any, relating to the sale or disposition of such Holder's Registrable Securities pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement.
(d) An Exchange Offer Registration Statement pursuant to Section 2(a) hereof will not be deemed to have become effective unless it has been declared effective by the SEC. A Shelf Registration Statement pursuant to Section 2(b) hereof will not be deemed to have become effective unless it has been declared effective by the SEC or is automatically effective upon filing with the SEC as provided by Rule 462 under the Securities Act.
In the event that either the Exchange Offer is not completed or the Shelf Registration Statement, if required pursuant to Section 2(b)(i) or 2(b)(ii) hereof, does not become effective on or prior to December 8, 2010 (the "Target Registration Date"), the interest rate on the Registrable Securities will be increased by 0.50% per annum until the Exchange Offer is completed or the Shelf Registration Statement, if required hereby, becomes effective. In the event that the Company or the Guarantors receive a Shelf Request pursuant to Section 2(b)(iii), and the Shelf Registration Statement required to be filed thereby does not become effective by the later of (x) December 8, 2010 or (y) 90 days after the delivery of such Shelf Request (such later date, the "Shelf Additional Interest Date"), then the interest rate on the Registrable Securities will be increased by 0.50% per annum until the Shelf Registration Statement becomes effective or the Securities become freely tradable under the Securities Act.
If the Shelf Registration Statement, if required hereby, has become effective and thereafter either ceases to be effective or the Prospectus contained therein ceases to be usable, in each case whether or not permitted by this Agreement, at any time during the Shelf Effectiveness Period, and such failure to remain effective or usable exists for more than 30 days (whether or not consecutive) during the period in which the Shelf Registration Statement is required to be kept effective in accordance with this Agreement, then the interest rate on the Registrable Securities will be increased by 0.50% per annum commencing on the 31
st
day in such period and ending on such date that the Shelf Registration Statement has again become effective or the Prospectus again becomes usable.
(e) The Company and the Guarantors acknowledge and agree that in the event of any failure by the Company or the Guarantors to comply with their obligations under Section 2(a) and Section 2(b) hereof, the Initial Purchasers or any Holder shall be entitled to specific performance of the obligations of the Company and the Guarantor under Section 2(a) and Section 2(b) hereof as set forth in Section 6(a) hereof.

(vii) use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the withdrawal of any order suspending the effectiveness of a Registration Statement or, in the
 
case of a Shelf Registration, the resolution of any objection of the SEC pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2), including by promptly filing an amendment to such Shelf Registration Statement on the proper form, and promptly notify each Holder of the withdrawal of any such order or such resolution;
(viii) in the case of a Shelf Registration, if not otherwise available on EDGAR, upon the written request of a Holder of Securities included within the coverage of the Shelf Registration, furnish to each Holder of Registrable Securities, without charge, at least one conformed copy of each Registration Statement and any post-effective amendment thereto (without any documents incorporated therein by reference or exhibits thereto, unless requested);

provided
(xv) if reasonably requested by any Holder of Registrable Securities covered by a Shelf Registration Statement, promptly include in a Prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment such information with respect to such Holder as such Holder reasonably requests in writing to be included therein and make all required filings of such Prospectus supplement or such post-effective amendment as soon as the Company has received notification of the matters to be so included in such filing; and

(b) In the case of a Shelf Registration Statement, the Company may require each Holder of Registrable Securities to furnish to the Company such information regarding such Holder and the proposed disposition by such Holder of such Registrable Securities as the Company and the Guarantors may from time to time reasonably request in writing.

(c) In the case of a Shelf Registration Statement, each Holder of Registrable Securities covered in such Shelf Registration Statement agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from the Company and the Guarantors of the happening of any event of the kind described in Section 3(a)(vi)(3) or 3(a)(vi)(5) hereof, such Holder will forthwith discontinue disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement until such Holder's receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus and any Free Writing Prospectus contemplated by Section 3(a)(x) hereof and, if so directed by the Company and the Guarantors, such Holder will deliver to the Company and the Guarantors all copies in its possession, other than permanent file copies then in such Holder's possession, of the Prospectus and any Free Writing Prospectus covering such Registrable Securities that is current at the time of receipt of such notice.
(d) If the Company and the Guarantors shall give any notice to suspend the disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to a Registration Statement, the Company and the Guarantors shall extend the period during which such Registration Statement shall be maintained effective pursuant to this Agreement by the number of days during the period from and including the date of the giving of such notice to and including the date when the Holders of such Registrable Securities shall have received copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus or any Free Writing Prospectus necessary to resume such dispositions. The Company and the Guarantors may give any such notice only twice during any 365-day period and any such suspensions shall not exceed 45 days for each suspension and there shall not be more than two suspensions in effect during any 365-day period. The Initial Purchasers, the Holders and any Participating Broker-Dealers shall keep confidential the cause of such notice for so long as such cause is not otherwise publicly known.

No person may participate in any such Underwritten Offering unless such person completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, underwriting agreements and other documents reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements.

provided
however
4. . (a) The Staff has taken the position that any broker-dealer that receives Exchange Securities for its own account in the Exchange Offer in exchange for Securities that were acquired by such broker-dealer as a result of market-making or other trading activities (a "Participating Broker-Dealer") may be deemed to be an "underwriter" within the meaning of the Securities Act and must deliver a prospectus meeting the requirements of the Securities Act in connection with any resale of such Exchange Securities.
Participation of Broker-Dealers in Exchange Offer
The Company and the Guarantors understand that it is the Staff's position that if the Prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement includes a plan of distribution containing a statement to the above effect and the means by which Participating Broker-Dealers may resell the Exchange Securities, without naming the Participating Broker-Dealers or specifying the amount of Exchange Securities owned by them, such Prospectus may be delivered by Participating Broker-Dealers (or, to the extent permitted by law, made available to purchasers) to satisfy their prospectus delivery obligation under the Securities Act in connection with resales of Exchange Securities for
 
their own accounts, so long as the Prospectus otherwise meets the requirements of the Securities Act.
(b) In light of the above, and notwithstanding the other provisions of this Agreement, the Company and the Guarantors agree to amend or supplement the Prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement for a period of up to 135 days after the last Exchange Date (as such period may be extended pursuant to Section 3(d) of this Agreement, if requested by the Initial Purchasers or by one or more Participating Broker-Dealers), in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of any Exchange Securities by Participating Broker-Dealers consistent with the positions of the Staff recited in Section 4(a) above. The Company and the Guarantors further agree that Participating Broker-Dealers shall be authorized to deliver such Prospectus (or, to the extent permitted by law, make available) during such period in connection with the resales contemplated by this Section 4.
(c) The Initial Purchasers shall have no liability to the Company, the Guarantors or any Holder with respect to any request that they may make pursuant to Section 4(b) above.
5. . (a) The Company and the Guarantors, jointly and severally, agree to indemnify and hold harmless each Initial Purchaser and each Holder, their respective affiliates, directors and officers and each Person, if any, who controls any Initial Purchaser or any Holder within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees and other expenses incurred in connection with any suit, action or proceeding or any claim asserted, as such fees and expenses are incurred), joint or several, that arise out of, or are based upon, (1) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading, or (2) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Prospectus, any Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" ("Issuer Information") filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act, or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in each case except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to any Initial Purchaser or information relating to any Holder furnished to the Company in writing through Banc of America and J.P. Morgan or any selling Holder, respectively, expressly for use therein. In connection with any Underwritten Offering permitted by Section 3, the Company and the Guarantors, jointly and severally, will also indemnify the
Indemnification and Contribution
 
Underwriters, if any, selling brokers, dealers and similar securities industry professionals participating in the distribution, their respective affiliates and each Person who controls such Persons (within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act) to the same extent as provided above with respect to the indemnification of the Holders, if requested in connection with any Registration Statement, any Prospectus, any Free Writing Prospectus or any Issuer Information.
(b) Each Holder agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Guarantors, the Initial Purchasers and the other selling Holders, their respective affiliates, the directors of the Company and the Guarantors, each officer of the Company and the Guarantors who signed the Registration Statement and each Person, if any, who controls the Company, the Guarantors, any Initial Purchaser and any other selling Holder within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the indemnity set forth in Section 5(a) above, but only with respect to any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (including, without limitation, legal fees and other expenses incurred in connection with any suit, action or proceeding or any claim asserted, as such fees and expenses are incurred) that arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to such Holder furnished to the Company in writing by such Holder expressly for use in any Registration Statement, any Prospectus and any Free Writing Prospectus.
(c) If any suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be brought or asserted against any Person in respect of which indemnification may be sought pursuant to either Section 5(a) or 5(b) above, such Person (the "Indemnified Person") shall promptly notify the Person against whom such indemnification may be sought (the "Indemnifying Person") in writing; that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under this Section 5 except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and , , that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an Indemnified Person otherwise than under this Section 5. If any such proceeding shall be brought or asserted against an Indemnified Person and it shall have notified the Indemnifying Person thereof, the Indemnifying Person shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person (who shall not, without the consent of the Indemnified Person, be counsel to the Indemnifying Person) to represent the Indemnified Person and any others entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section 5 that the Indemnifying Person may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of such counsel related to such proceeding, as incurred. In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such
provided
provided
further
 
counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless (i) the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the contrary; (ii) the Indemnifying Person has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person; (iii) the Indemnified Person shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to the Indemnifying Person; or (iv) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood and agreed that the Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Any such separate firm (x) for any Initial Purchaser, its affiliates, directors and officers and any control Persons of such Initial Purchaser shall be designated in writing jointly by Banc of America and J.P. Morgan, (y) for any Holder, its directors and officers and any control Persons of such Holder shall be designated in writing by the Majority Holders and (z) in all other cases shall be designated in writing by the Company. The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify each Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an Indemnified Person shall have requested that an Indemnifying Person reimburse the Indemnified Person for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by this paragraph, the Indemnifying Person shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by the Indemnifying Person of such request and (ii) the Indemnifying Person shall not have reimbursed the Indemnified Person in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No Indemnifying Person shall, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement (A) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (B) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in Section 5(a) and 5(b) above is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person
 
under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors from the offering of the Securities and the Exchange Securities, on the one hand, and by the Holders from receiving Securities or Exchange Securities registered under the Securities Act, on the other hand, or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Holders on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Holders on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company and the Guarantors or by the Holders and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
(e) The Company, the Guarantors and the Holders agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 5 were determined by allocation (even if the Holders were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 5(d) above. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in Section (d) above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 5, in no event shall a Holder be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities or Exchange Securities sold by such Holder exceeds the amount of any damages that such Holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Holders' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 5 are several and not joint.
pro
rata
(f) The remedies provided for in this Section 5 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies that may otherwise be available to any Indemnified Person at law or in equity.
(g) The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 5 shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any
 
termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of the Initial Purchasers or any Holder, their respective affiliates or any Person controlling any Initial Purchaser or any Holder, or by or on behalf of the Company or the Guarantors or the officers or directors of or any Person controlling the Company or the Guarantors, (iii) acceptance of any of the Exchange Securities and (iv) any sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to a Shelf Registration Statement.

Acuity Brands, Inc.
(404) 853-1423
ATLANTA, January 6, 2010  Acuity Brands, Inc. (NYSE: AYI) today announced fiscal 2010 first quarter net sales of $391.7 million, a 13 percent decline compared with the $452.0 million reported in the year-ago period. Comparable shipment volumes declined approximately 13 percent versus the year-ago period. Recent acquisitions contributed more than $15 million to fiscal 2010 first quarter net sales, which essentially offset the negative impact from year-over-year unfavorable price/mix changes. Fiscal 2010 first quarter net income was $23.3 million compared with $19.4 million for the same period a year ago. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) for the first quarter of fiscal 2010 were $0.53 compared with $0.47 for the prior year period. Prior year's first quarter results included a $13.8 million after-tax special charge for streamlining activities, or $0.34 per diluted share.
Mr. Nagel, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Acuity Brands, commented, "Our results for the first quarter of fiscal 2010 reflect solid performance by our associates in an extremely challenging market. Although net sales continue to be impacted by the decline in construction spending due to lower economic activity and tight lending standards for real estate, we were able to partially mitigate the negative impact by realizing benefits from streamlining actions, productivity improvements, and market gains in certain channels. These benefits combined with lower material and component costs helped to partially offset the full impact of the decline in shipment volume and unfavorable price/mix changes. The recently acquired controls businesses, Sensor Switch and Lighting Control & Design ("LC&D"), also contributed nicely to first quarter results. Additionally, we are particularly pleased with our strong operating profit margin and cash generation in the first quarter."
Operating profit for the first quarter of fiscal 2010 was $42.7 million, or 10.9 percent of net sales, compared with $33.7 million, or 7.5 percent of net sales, for the year-ago period. Excluding the prior year special charge, adjusted operating profit for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 was $55.8 million, or 12.3 percent of net sales. During the first quarter of fiscal 2010, the Company realized total savings of over $11 million from streamlining actions initiated in fiscal 2009; approximately $2 million of savings were realized in the year-ago period.
 
 
Other expense was $0.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 compared with $4.2 million of other income in the year-ago period. Other expense/income, net consists primarily of gains or losses resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency rates on certain items. The unusually large gain in the prior year was due to the significant appreciation in the value of the U.S. Dollar during the first quarter of fiscal 2009.
Interest expense, net was $6.7 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2010 compared with $8.0 million in the year-ago period. The decrease in interest expense, net was due primarily to lower average outstanding debt balances partially offset by a decline in interest income, resulting from lower invested cash balances and lower interest rates.
Outlook
Mr. Nagel commented, "For the remainder of our fiscal year 2010, we continue to foresee a difficult and challenging economic environment, particularly for non-residential construction activity, a primary market for us. Key indicators continue to signal declines for North American non-residential construction spending. We still expect that the overall markets we serve will experience a percentage decline in the mid-teens during our fiscal year 2010. Also, we anticipate that our second quarter will be particularly challenging due primarily to normal seasonal factors, including inconsistent customer demand and the potential for year-end inventory rebalancing by certain customers. Our backlog at the end of the first quarter was down 14 percent on a year-over-year comparable basis. Despite these challenges, we continue to see opportunities.
"In addition to our fiscal 2009 acquisitions of Sensor Switch and LC&D, which significantly increased our presence in the growing lighting controls market, we believe the execution of our strategies to accelerate investments in innovative and energy-efficient products, enhance services to our customers, and expand market presence in key geographies and sectors such as home centers and the renovation and relight market will provide growth opportunities which should enable us to outperform the overall markets we serve.
 
 
"We expect our profitability in fiscal 2010 to reflect additional benefits from recent acquisitions and the realization of approximately $22 million of annualized savings from streamlining actions initiated in fiscal 2009 in addition to the $28 million realized in the prior year. We see the potential for material and component costs increasing in the second half of fiscal 2010 which we would attempt to recover through higher selling prices. Notwithstanding efforts to recoup potentially higher costs, pricing will continue to be competitive. We expect to largely offset this potential negative impact through productivity improvements and benefits from new product introductions. We intend to invest approximately $30 million in capital expenditures during fiscal 2010, and we estimate our annual tax rate to be approximately 35 percent for the year.
"Although fiscal 2010 results will continue to be negatively impacted by current economic conditions, we remain very positive about the long-term potential of our company and our ability to outperform the market. We continue to position the Company to optimize short-term performance while investing in and deploying resources to further our long-term profitable growth opportunities."
Mr. Nagel concluded, "Looking beyond the current environment, we believe the lighting and lighting-related industry will experience solid growth over the next decade, particularly as energy and environmental concerns come to the forefront, and we believe we are well positioned to fully participate in this exciting industry."
Accounting Standards Adopted in Fiscal 2010
Included in the accounting standards that the Company adopted in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 was the two-class method as required under ASC 260. The two-class method is an earnings allocation method for computing EPS when a company's capital structure includes two or more classes of common stock or common stock and participating securities; EPS is determined based on dividends declared on common stock and participating securities and participation rights of participating securities in any undistributed earnings. EPS is reduced as a result of including the participating securities in the calculation of EPS. The adoption of the two-class method reduced diluted EPS for the first quarter of both fiscal years by $0.01; prior year's diluted EPS was restated to reflect the two-class method.
 
 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Acuity Brands' management included in the above news release the term "adjusted operating profit" which is a non-GAAP financial measure provided to enhance the user's overall understanding of the Company's current financial performance and prospects for the future. Specifically, management believes that adjusted operating profit provides useful information to investors by excluding or adjusting items related to streamlining and manufacturing consolidation activities which affected the Company's reported operating results for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 and 2010. Management believes these special items impacted the comparability of the Company's core operating results and that these items are not reflective of fixed costs that the Company will incur over the long term. The non-GAAP financial measure should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, results prepared in accordance with GAAP. The most directly comparable GAAP measure for adjusted operating profit is "operating profit" which includes the impact of special items. The non-GAAP financial measure included in this news release has been reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure.
Conference Call
As previously announced, the Company will host a conference call to discuss first quarter results today, January 6, 2010, at 10:00 a.m. ET. Interested parties may listen to this call live today or hear a replay at the Company's Web site: .

Effective February 5, 2010, each of the current directors and named executive officers of Acuity Brands, Inc. ("Company") entered into a new form of Indemnification Agreement (the "New Indemnification Agreement") which will replace any prior indemnification agreement (each a "Previous Indemnification Agreement") with the Company to which such director or executive officer was a party. The New Indemnification Agreement replaces the indemnification rights provided under the Company's certificate of incorporation, bylaws and applicable law. The New Indemnification Agreement provides that the Company will indemnify the director or executive officer (the "Indemnitee") against all expenses (as defined in the agreement), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee and arising out of the Indemnitee's service as a director or executive officer to the fullest extent permitted by the Company's certificate of incorporation, bylaws and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or other applicable law and to any greater extent that applicable law may in the future permit. The New Indemnification Agreement further provides procedures for the determination of an Indemnitee's right to receive indemnification and the advancement of expenses. In addition to the terms provided for in the Previous Indemnification Agreement, the New Indemnification Agreement provides that in the event of a change in control transaction, the Company will obtain substantially equivalent directors and officers liability insurance covering a six-year period following the transaction, subject to reasonable premium limitations.
The foregoing description of the New Indemnification Agreement is a general description only and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the New Indemnification Agreement, the form of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
Date: February 9, 2010
 
 

Exhibit 10.1
This hereinafter, this "Agreement"), is made and executed this 5th day of February, 2010, by and between Acuity Brands, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and , an individual resident of the State of (the "Indemnitee"), and amends, restates and supersedes the Indemnification Agreement between the Company and the Indemnitee dated , (the "Original Agreement").
AMENDED AND RESTATED INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT (
                    
                
                
            
WHEREAS, the Company and the Indemnitee desire collectively to amend and restate the Original Agreement in the form of this Agreement;
WHEREAS, the Company is aware that, in order to induce highly competent persons to serve the Company as directors, officers, employees or in other capacities, the Company must provide such persons with adequate protection through insurance and indemnification against inordinate risks of claims and actions against them arising out of their service to and activities on behalf of the Company;
WHEREAS, the Company recognizes that the increasing difficulty in obtaining directors' and officers' liability insurance, the increases in the cost of such insurance and the general reductions in the coverage of such insurance have increased the difficulty of attracting and retaining such persons;
WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company's stockholders that the Company act to assure such persons that there will be increased certainty of such protection in the future;
WHEREAS, it is reasonable, prudent and necessary for the Company contractually to obligate itself to indemnify such persons to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law so that they will continue to serve the Company free from undue concern that they will not be so indemnified; and
WHEREAS, the Indemnitee is willing to serve, continue to serve, and take on additional service for or on behalf of the Company or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries on the condition that he/she be so indemnified.
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants contained herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Company and Indemnitee do hereby agree as follows:
1. . The Indemnitee agrees to serve and/or continue to serve as a director, officer, employee or other agent of the Company faithfully and will discharge his/her duties and responsibilities to the best of his/her ability so long as the Indemnitee is duly elected or qualified in accordance with the provisions of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (the "Certificate"), and Amended and Restated By-laws, as amended (the "By-laws") of the Company, the General
Service by the Indemnitee
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as amended (the "DGCL"), and any other applicable law in effect on the date of this Agreement and from time to time, or until his/her earlier death, resignation or removal. The Indemnitee may at any time and for any reason resign from such position (subject to any other contractual obligation or other obligation imposed by operation by law), in which event the Company shall have no obligation under this Agreement to continue the employment or directorship of the Indemnitee. Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon the Indemnitee the right to continue in the employ of the Company or as a director of the Company or affect the right of the Company to terminate the Indemnitee's employment at any time in the sole discretion of the Company, with or without cause, subject to any contract rights of the Indemnitee created or existing otherwise than under this Agreement.
2. . The Company shall indemnify the Indemnitee against all Expenses (as defined below), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee as provided in this Agreement to the fullest extent permitted by the Certificate, By-laws and DGCL or other applicable law in effect on the date of this Agreement and to any greater extent that applicable law may in the future from time to time permit. Without diminishing the scope of the indemnification provided by this Section 2, the rights of indemnification of the Indemnitee provided hereunder shall include, but shall not be limited to, those rights hereinafter set forth, except that no indemnification shall be paid to the Indemnitee:
Indemnification
(a) on account of any action, suit or proceeding in which judgment is rendered against the Indemnitee for disgorgement of profits made from the purchase or sale by the Indemnitee of securities of the Company pursuant to the provisions of Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Act"), or similar provisions of any federal, state or local statutory law;
(b) on account of conduct of the Indemnitee which is finally adjudged by a court of competent jurisdiction to have been knowingly fraudulent or to constitute willful misconduct;
(c) in any circumstance where such indemnification is expressly prohibited by applicable law;
(d) with respect to liability for which payment is actually made to the Indemnitee under a valid and collectible insurance policy of the Company or under a valid and enforceable indemnity clause, By-law or agreement (other than this Agreement) of the Company, except in respect of any liability in excess of payment under such insurance policy, indemnity clause, By-law or agreement;
(e) if a final decision by a court having jurisdiction in the matter shall determine that such indemnification is not lawful (and, in this respect, both the Company and the Indemnitee have been advised that it is the position of the Securities and Exchange Commission that indemnification for liabilities arising under the federal securities laws is against public policy and is, therefore, unenforceable, and that claims for indemnification should be submitted to the appropriate court for adjudication); or
 
(f) in connection with any action, suit or proceeding by the Indemnitee against the Company or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries or the directors, officers, employees or other Indemnitees of the Company or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries, (i) unless such indemnification is expressly required to be made by law, (ii) unless the proceeding was authorized by the Board of Directors of the Company, (iii) unless such indemnification is provided by the Company, in its sole discretion, pursuant to the powers vested in the Company under applicable law, or (iv) except as provided in Sections 11 and 13 hereof.
3. . The Indemnitee shall be entitled to the indemnification rights provided in this Section 3 if the Indemnitee was or is a party or witness or is threatened to be a party or witness to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative in nature, other than an action by or in the right of the Company, by reason of the fact that the Indemnitee is or was a director, officer, employee, agent or fiduciary of the Company, or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries, or is or was serving at the request of the Company, or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries, as a director, officer, employee, agent or fiduciary of any other entity, including, but not limited to, another corporation, partnership, limited liability company, employee benefit plan, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or by reason of any act or omission by him/her in such capacity. Pursuant to this Section 3, the Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all Expenses, judgments, penalties (including excise and similar taxes), fines and amounts paid in settlement which were actually and reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with such action, suit or proceeding (including, but not limited to, the investigation, defense or appeal thereof), if the Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner the Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his/her conduct was unlawful.
Actions or Proceedings Other Than an Action by or in the Right of the Company
4. . The Indemnitee shall be entitled to the indemnification rights provided in this Section 4 if the Indemnitee was or is a party or witness or is threatened to be made a party or witness to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding brought by or in the right of the Company to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that the Indemnitee is or was a director, officer, employee, agent or fiduciary of the Company, or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries, or is or was serving at the request of the Company, or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries, as a director, officer, employee, agent or fiduciary of another entity, including, but not limited to, another corporation, partnership, limited liability company, employee benefit plan, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or by reason of any act or omission by him/her in any such capacity. Pursuant to this Section 4, the Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him/her in connection with the defense or settlement of such action, suit or proceeding (including, but not limited to the investigation, defense or appeal thereof), if the Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner the Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company; provided, however, that no such indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim,
Actions by or in the Right of the Company
 
issue or matter as to which the Indemnitee shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Company, unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or the court in which such action, suit or proceeding was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, the Indemnitee is fairly and reasonably entitled to be indemnified against such Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him/her which such court shall deem proper.
5. . For purposes of this Agreement, the Indemnitee shall be deemed to have acted in good faith and in a manner the Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company, or, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding to have had no reasonable cause to believe the Indemnitee's conduct was unlawful, if such action was based on a reasonable reliance upon (i) the records of the Company and (ii) information, opinions, reports or statements presented to the Company by any of the Company's officer's or employees, or committees.
Good Faith Definition
6. . Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Agreement, to the extent that the Indemnitee has served on behalf of the Company, or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries, as a witness or other participant in any class action or proceeding, or has been successful, on the merits or otherwise, in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in Sections 3 and 4 hereof, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, including, but not limited to, the dismissal of any action without prejudice, the Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee in connection therewith, regardless of whether or not the Indemnitee has met the applicable standards of Section 3 or 4 and without any determination pursuant to Section 8.
Indemnification for Expenses of Successful Party
7. . If the Indemnitee is entitled under any provision of this Agreement to indemnification by the Company for some or a portion of the Expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with the investigation, defense, appeal or settlement of such suit, action, investigation or proceeding described in Section 3 or 4 hereof, but is not entitled to indemnification for the total amount thereof, the Company shall nevertheless indemnify the Indemnitee for the portion of such Expenses, judgments, penalties, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee to which the Indemnitee is entitled.
Partial Indemnification
8. . (a) To obtain indemnification under this Agreement, Indemnitee shall submit to the Company a written request, including documentation and information which is reasonably available to Indemnitee and is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification. The Secretary of the Company shall, promptly upon receipt of a request for indemnification, advise the Board of Directors in writing that Indemnitee has requested indemnification. Any Expenses incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with the Indemnitee's request for indemnification hereunder shall be borne by the Company. The Company hereby indemnifies and agrees to hold the Indemnitee harmless for any Expenses incurred by Indemnitee under the immediately preceding sentence irrespective of the outcome of the determination of the Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification.
Procedure for Determination of Entitlement to Indemnification
 
(b) Upon written request by the Indemnitee for indemnification pursuant to Section 3 or 4 hereof, the entitlement of the Indemnitee to indemnification pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be determined by the following person or persons, who shall be empowered to make such determination: (i) if a Change in Control (as hereinafter defined) shall have occurred, by Independent Counsel (as hereinafter defined) (unless the Indemnitee shall request in writing that such determination be made by the Board of Directors (or a committee thereof) in the manner provided for in clause (ii) of this Section 8(b)) in a written opinion to the Board of Directors, a copy of which shall be delivered to the Indemnitee; or (ii) if a Change in Control shall not have occurred, (A)(1) by the Board of Directors of the Company, by a majority vote of Disinterested Directors (as hereinafter defined) even though less than a quorum, or (2) by a committee of Disinterested Directors designated by majority vote of Disinterested Directors, even though less than a quorum, or (B) if there are no such Disinterested Directors or, even if there are such Disinterested Directors, if the Board of Directors, by the majority vote of Disinterested Directors, so directs, by Independent Counsel in a written opinion to the Board of Directors, a copy of which shall be delivered to the Indemnitee. Such Independent Counsel shall be selected by the Board of Directors and approved by the Indemnitee. Upon failure of the Board of Directors to so select, or upon failure of the Indemnitee to so approve, such Independent Counsel shall be selected by the Chancellor of the State of Delaware or such other person as the Chancellor shall designate to make such selection. Such determination of entitlement to indemnification shall be made not later than 45 days after receipt by the Company of a written request for indemnification. If the person making such determination shall determine that the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification as to part (but not all) of the application for indemnification, such person shall reasonably prorate such part of indemnification among such claims, issues or matters. If it is so determined that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, payment to Indemnitee shall be made within ten days after such determination.
9. .(a) In making a determination with respect to entitlement to indemnification, the Indemnitee shall be presumed to be entitled to indemnification hereunder and the Company shall have the burden of proof in the making of any determination contrary to such presumption.
Presumptions and Effect of Certain Proceedings
(b) If the Board of Directors, or such other person or persons empowered pursuant to Section 8 to make the determination of whether Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, shall have failed to make a determination as to entitlement to indemnification within 45 days after receipt by the Company of such request, the requisite determination of entitlement to indemnification shall be deemed to have been made and the Indemnitee shall be absolutely entitled to such indemnification, absent actual fraud in the request for indemnification or a prohibition of indemnification under applicable law. The termination of any action, suit, investigation or proceeding described in Section 3 or 4 hereof by judgment, order, settlement or conviction, or upon a plea of or its equivalent, shall not, of itself: (a) create a presumption that the Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner which he/she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, that the Indemnitee has reasonable cause to believe that the Indemnitee's conduct was unlawful; or (b) otherwise adversely affect the rights of the Indemnitee to indemnification, except as may be provided herein.
nolo contendere
 
10. . All reasonable Expenses actually incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with any threatened or pending action, suit or proceeding shall be paid by the Company in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding, if so requested by the Indemnitee, within 20 days after the receipt by the Company of a statement or statements from the Indemnitee requesting such advance or advances. The Indemnitee may submit such statements from time to time. The Indemnitee's entitlement to such Expenses shall include those incurred in connection with any proceeding by the Indemnitee seeking an adjudication or award in arbitration pursuant to this Agreement. Such statement or statements shall reasonably evidence the Expenses incurred by the Indemnitee in connection therewith and shall include or be accompanied by a written affirmation by Indemnitee of Indemnitee's good faith belief that Indemnitee has met the standard of conduct necessary for indemnification under this Agreement and an undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnitee to repay such amount if it is ultimately determined that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified against such Expenses by the Company pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise. Each written undertaking to pay amounts advanced must be an unlimited general obligation but need not be secured, and shall be accepted without reference to financial ability to make repayment.
Advancement of Expenses
11. . In the event that a determination is made that the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification hereunder or if the payment has not been timely made following a determination of entitlement to indemnification pursuant to Sections 8 and 9, or if Expenses are not advanced pursuant to Section 10, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to a final adjudication in an appropriate court of the State of Delaware or any other court of competent jurisdiction of the Indemnitee's entitlement to such indemnification or advance. Alternatively, the Indemnitee may, at the Indemnitee's option, seek an award in arbitration to be conducted by a single arbitrator in Atlanta, Georgia pursuant to the rules of the American Arbitration Association, such award to be made within 60 days following the filing of the demand for arbitration. The Company shall not unreasonably oppose the Indemnitee's right to seek any such adjudication or award in arbitration or any other claim. Such judicial proceeding or arbitration shall be made , and the Indemnitee shall not be prejudiced by reason of a determination (if so made) that the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification. If a determination is made or deemed to have been made pursuant to the terms of Section 8 or Section 9 hereof that the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, the Company shall be bound by such determination and shall be precluded from asserting that such determination has not been made or that the procedure by which such determination was made is not valid, binding and enforceable. The Company further agrees to stipulate in any such court or before any such arbitrator that the Company is bound by all the provisions of this Agreement and is precluded from making any assertions to the contrary. If the court or arbitrator shall determine that the Indemnitee is entitled to any indemnification hereunder, the Company shall pay all reasonable Expenses actually incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with such adjudication or award in arbitration (including, but not limited to, any appellate proceedings).
Remedies of the Indemnitee in Cases of Determination not to Indemnify or to Advance Expenses
de novo
12. . Promptly after receipt by the Indemnitee of notice of the commencement of any action, suit or proceeding, the Indemnitee will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the Company under this Agreement, notify the Company in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission to so notify the Company will not relieve the Company from any liability that it may have to the Indemnitee otherwise than under this Agreement or otherwise, except to the extent that the
Notification and Defense of Claim
 
Company may suffer material prejudice by reason of such failure. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, with respect to any such action, suit or proceeding as to which the Indemnitee gives notice to the Company of the commencement thereof:
(a) The Company will be entitled to participate therein at its own expense.
(b) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 12(b), to the extent that it may wish, the Company, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, shall be entitled to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee. After notice from the Company to the Indemnitee of its election to so assume the defense thereof, the Company shall not be liable to the Indemnitee under this Agreement for any legal or other Expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation or as otherwise provided below. The Indemnitee shall have the right to employ the Indemnitee's own counsel in such action or lawsuit, but the fees and Expenses of such counsel incurred after notice from the Company of its assumption of the defense thereof shall be at the expense of the Indemnitee unless (i) the employment of counsel by the Indemnitee has been authorized in writing by the Company, (ii) the Indemnitee shall have reasonably concluded that there may be a conflict of interest between the Company and the Indemnitee in the conduct of the defense of such action and such determination by the Indemnitee shall be supported by an opinion of counsel, which opinion shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company, or (iii) the Company shall not in fact have employed counsel to assume the defense of the action, in each of which cases the fees and Expenses of counsel shall be at the expense of the Company. The Company shall not be entitled to assume the defense of any action, suit or proceeding brought by or on behalf of the Company or as to which the Indemnitee shall have reached the conclusion provided for in clause (ii) above.
(c) The Company shall not be liable to indemnify the Indemnitee under this Agreement for any amounts paid in settlement of any action, suit or proceeding effected without its written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Company shall not be required to obtain the consent of Indemnitee to settle any action, suit or proceeding which the Company has undertaken to defend if the Company assumes full and sole responsibility for such settlement and such settlement grants Indemnitee a complete and unqualified release in respect of any potential liability.
(d) If, at the time of the receipt of a notice of a claim pursuant to this Section 12, the Company has director and officer liability insurance in effect, the Company shall give prompt notice of the commencement of such proceeding to the insurers in accordance with the procedures set forth in the respective policies. The Company shall thereafter take all necessary or desirable action to cause such insurers to pay, on behalf of the Indemnitee, all amounts payable as a result of such proceeding in accordance with the terms of the policies.
 
13. . The indemnification and advancement of Expenses provided by this Agreement are cumulative, and not exclusive, and are in addition to any other rights to which the Indemnitee may now or in the future be entitled under any provision of the By-laws or Certificate of the Company, any vote of stockholders or Disinterested Directors, any provision of law or otherwise. Except as required by applicable law, the Company shall not adopt any amendment to its By-laws or Certificate the effect of which would be to deny, diminish or encumber the Indemnitee's right to indemnification under this Agreement.
Other Right to Indemnification
14. . (a) The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain a policy or policies of liability insurance, including broad form individual non-indemnifiable loss coverage (with difference-in-condition feature), with reputable insurance companies providing the Indemnitee with coverage for losses from wrongful acts, including Expenses, and to ensure the Company's performance of its indemnification and advancement of Expenses obligations under this Agreement. In the event the Company maintains such liability insurance, the Indemnitee shall be named as an insured in such manner as to provide the Indemnitee the same rights and benefits as are accorded to the most favorably insured of the Company's officers or directors. Such coverage shall be on terms of coverage and in amounts which are in all cases no less favorable to the Indemnitee than those of the policies in effect as of January 8, 2010, except to the extent coverage on such terms or in such amounts cannot be obtained through the use of commercially reasonable efforts.
Director and Officer Liability Insurance
(b) In the event of a Change in Control, the Company shall obtain and maintain in effect for a period of six (6) years from the effective date of the Change in Control (either through the Company's then-existing insurance programs and/or through the purchase of additional insurance policies), the insurance coverage provided by the Company's then current directors and officers liability insurance and broad form individual non-indemnifiable loss (with difference-in-condition feature) policies, in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the effective date of the Change in Control, covering the Indemnitee on terms of coverage and in amounts no less favorable to the Indemnitee than those of the policies in effect as of January 8, 2010 or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage, provided however that the Company shall not be required to pay an annual premium for such insurance in excess of 300% of the annual amounts paid by the Company to maintain the policies in effect during the 12-month period immediately preceding the effective date of the Change in Control, provided further that if the annual premium for such insurance coverage exceeds such amount, the Company shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount.
(c) The Company further agrees that all of the provisions of this Agreement shall remain in effect regardless of whether liability or other insurance coverage is at any time obtained or retained by the Company; except that any payments made to, or on behalf of, the Indemnitee under an insurance policy shall reduce the obligations of the Company hereunder.
 
15. .The Company will indemnify the Indemnitee's spouse to whom the Indemnitee is legally married at any time the Indemnitee is covered under the indemnification provided in this Agreement (even if Indemnitee did not remain married to him or her during the entire period of coverage) against any pending or threatened action, suit, proceeding or investigation for the same period, to the same extent and subject to the same standards, limitations, obligations and conditions under which the Indemnitee is provided indemnification herein, if the Indemnitee's spouse (or former spouse) becomes involved in a pending or threatened action, suit, proceeding or investigation solely by reason of his or her status as Indemnitee's spouse, including, without limitation, any pending or threatened action, suit, proceeding or investigation that seeks damages recoverable from marital community property, jointly-owned property or property purported to have been transferred from the Indemnitee to his/her spouse (or former spouse). The Indemnitee's spouse or former spouse also may be entitled to advancement of Expenses to the same extent that Indemnitee is entitled to advancement of Expenses herein. The Company may maintain insurance to cover its obligation hereunder with respect to Indemnitee's spouse (or former spouse) or set aside assets in a trust or escrow fund for that purpose.
Spousal Indemnification
16. . This Agreement is intended to be broader than any statutory indemnification rights applicable in the State of Delaware and shall be in addition to any other rights Indemnitee may have under the Company's Certificate, By-laws, applicable law or otherwise. To the extent that a change in applicable law (whether by statute or judicial decision) permits greater indemnification by agreement than would be afforded currently under the Company's Certificate, By-laws, applicable law or this Agreement, it is the intent of the parties that Indemnitee enjoy by this Agreement the greater benefits so afforded by such change. In the event of any change in applicable law, statute or rule which narrows the right of a Delaware corporation to indemnify a member of its Board of Directors or an officer, employee, agent or fiduciary, such change, to the extent not otherwise required by such law, statute or rule to be applied to this Agreement, shall have no effect on this Agreement or the parties' rights and obligations hereunder.
Intent
17. . In the event that the Indemnitee is subject to or intervenes in any action, suit or proceeding in which the validity or enforceability of this Agreement is at issue or seeks an adjudication or award in arbitration to enforce the Indemnitee's rights under, or to recover damages for breach of, this Agreement the Indemnitee, if he/she prevails in whole or in part in such action, shall be entitled to recover from the Company and shall be indemnified by the Company against any actual expenses for attorneys' fees and disbursements reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee.
Attorney's Fees and Other Expenses to Enforce Agreement
18. . The provisions of this Agreement shall cover claims, actions, suits or proceedings whether now pending or hereafter commenced and shall be retroactive to cover acts or omissions or alleged acts or omissions which heretofore have taken place. The Company shall be liable under this Agreement, pursuant to Sections 3 and 4 hereof, for all acts of the Indemnitee while serving as a director and/or officer, notwithstanding the termination of the Indemnitee's service, if such act was performed or omitted to be performed during the term of the Indemnitee's service to the Company.
Effective Date
 
19. . This Agreement shall survive and continue even though the Indemnitee may have terminated his/her service as a director, officer, employee, agent or fiduciary of the Company or as a director, officer, employee, agent or fiduciary of any other entity, including, but not limited to another corporation, partnership, limited liability company, employee benefit plan, joint venture, trust or other enterprise or by reason of any act or omission by the Indemnitee in any such capacity. This Agreement shall be binding upon the Company and its successors and assigns, including, without limitation, any corporation or other entity which may have acquired all or substantially all of the Company's assets or business or into which the Company may be consolidated or merged, and shall inure to the benefit of the Indemnitee and his/her spouse, successors, assigns, heirs, devisees, executors, administrators or other legal representations. The Company shall require any successor or assignee (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company, by written agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company and the Indemnitee, expressly to assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform if no such succession or assignment had taken place.
Duration of Agreement
20. . Except as expressly required by any Federal or state securities laws or other Federal or state law, neither party shall disclose any payments under this Agreement unless prior approval of the other party is obtained.
Disclosure of Payments
21. .

Severability
22. . This Agreement may be executed by one or more counterparts, each of which shall for all purposes be deemed to be an original but all of which together shall constitute one and the same Agreement. Only one such counterpart signed by the party against whom enforceability is sought shall be required to be produced to evidence the existence of this Agreement.

ATLANTA, March 31, 2010  Acuity Brands, Inc. (NYSE: AYI) ("Company") today announced fiscal 2010 second quarter net sales of $383.5 million, a less than 1 percent decline compared with the year-ago period. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal 2010 were $0.16 compared with $0.34 for the prior year. Excluding the special charges for streamlining activities recorded in both periods and the loss associated with the early retirement of debt as described below, fiscal 2010 second quarter adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations were $0.40 compared with $0.41 for the prior period.
Acquisitions contributed incremental sales of approximately 3.5 percentage points to fiscal 2010 second quarter net sales. Additionally, the translation of the stronger dollar on international sales contributed approximately one percentage point to current-year net sales. Excluding the impact from acquisitions and foreign currency, net sales were down approximately five percent compared with the prior-year period. The decline in net sales was due primarily to changes in product prices and the mix of product sold while unit volume was down approximately one percent. Although it is not possible to precisely quantify the separate impact of price and product mix changes, the Company estimates that more than half of the decline in price/mix was due to decreases in product prices.
Operating profit for the second quarter of fiscal 2010 was $27.8 million compared with $28.6 million for the year-ago period. Excluding the special charges for streamlining activities, adjusted operating profit for the second quarter of fiscal 2010 was $33.2 million, or 8.7 percent of net sales, compared with $33.2 million, or 8.6 percent of net sales, for the prior-year period. Fiscal 2010 second quarter income from continuing operations was $7.2 million compared with $14.4 million for the prior-year period. Excluding the impact of special charges for streamlining activities and the loss associated with the early retirement of debt, fiscal 2010 second quarter
 
 
adjusted income from continuing operations was $17.5 million compared with $17.3 million for the prior-year period.
Mr. Nagel, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Acuity Brands, commented, "Our results for the second quarter of fiscal 2010 reflect solid performance by our associates in a continuing challenging market. Although our key markets continue to be negatively impacted by the decline in new construction spending due to lower economic activity and tight lending standards for real estate, we were able to hold sales essentially flat through market gains in certain channels, including home improvement and acquisitions. While we experienced an increase in price competition, which was largely anticipated, we maintained our pricing posture in areas where our service and product features are differentiated, while responding to competition in certain channels and geographies as appropriate. Changes in product mix were due primarily to a shift in sales channels reflecting the decline in new construction, largely from commercial and institutional builders. These unfavorable changes in price/mix were offset by lower material and component costs."
Mr. Nagel continued, "During the second quarter, we continued to invest heavily in areas such as technology and innovation, sales and marketing, and our lighting controls business. While the majority of these investments were recorded as expense in our second quarter results, we believe they will provide significant future growth opportunities and generate returns starting in the second half of 2010. We also enhanced our capital structure and strengthened our liquidity position through various refinancing activities as we previously announced."
The Company completed refinancing activities during the second quarter of fiscal 2010 that consisted of the issuance of $350.0 million of 10-year notes, retirement of its $200.0 million 8.375% notes due August 2010, and repayment of a promissory note in the amount of $25.3 million.
Special Charges and Loss on Early Retirement of Debt
In the second quarter of fiscal 2010, the Company recorded a $5.4 million pre-tax special charge, or $0.08 per diluted share, related to streamlining activities. The special charge was comprised of a non-cash asset impairment of $3.7 million associated with a facility that the Company plans to close and $1.7 million for employee severance and benefits. The Company expects to realize annualized savings of approximately $10 million from these streamlining
 
 
actions as a result of efficiencies in its manufacturing and distribution operations. The Company expects most of the savings to be realized in fiscal 2011. In the second quarter of the prior year, the Company reported a pre-tax special charge of $4.6 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, for streamlining and manufacturing consolidation activities.
In the second quarter of fiscal 2010, the Company reported a pre-tax loss of $10.5 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, for the early retirement of its $200.0 million 8.375% notes due August 2010. The Company retired the 8.375% notes following the issuance of $350.0 million 6.0% notes due December 2019.
Year-to-Date Results
Net sales for the first six months of fiscal 2010 were $775.2 million compared with $838.2 million for the prior-year period. Operating profit for the first half of fiscal 2010 was $70.5 million compared with $62.4 million for the year-ago period. Excluding the special charges for streamlining activities, adjusted operating profit for the first half of fiscal 2010 was $75.9 million, or 9.8 percent of net sales, compared with $89.0 million, or 10.6 percent of net sales, for the prior-year period. Income from continuing operations for the first half of fiscal 2010 was $30.5 million compared with $33.8 million for the prior-year period. Excluding the impact of special charges for streamlining activities and the loss associated with the early retirement of debt, adjusted income from continuing operations for the first half of fiscal 2010 was $40.8 million, a decrease of 19 percent compared with $50.6 million for the prior-year period. Diluted EPS from continuing operations for the first half of fiscal 2010 were $0.69 compared with $0.81 per share for the prior-year period. Excluding the impact of special charges for streamlining activities and the loss associated with the early retirement of debt, adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations for the first half of fiscal 2010 were $0.93, a decrease of 23 percent compared with $1.21 for the year-ago period.
Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the second fiscal quarter totaled $155.8 million, an increase of $137.1 million from the $18.7 million at the beginning of the fiscal year. The increase in cash was due primarily to refinancing activities and cash flow provided by operations. Cash flow provided by operations totaled $47.4 million for the first half of fiscal 2010 compared with a use of cash of $3.9 million in the prior-year period.
 
 
Outlook
Mr. Nagel commented, "We continue to see a very challenging economic environment for the remainder of our fiscal year 2010. Key indicators for our primary market, non-residential construction, continue to signal a decline. Independent third-party forecasts continue to signal that for our fiscal 2010 the year-over-year percentage decline for net sales in the overall markets we serve will be in the mid-teens. Despite these challenges, we continue to see opportunities.
"In addition to our fiscal 2009 acquisitions of Sensor Switch and LC&D, which significantly increased our presence in the growing lighting controls market, we are accelerating investments to create more innovative and energy-efficient products, enhance services to our customers, and expand market presence in key geographies and sectors such as home centers and the renovation and relight market. We believe these strategic initiatives provide growth opportunities which should enable us to outperform the overall markets we serve.
"We see the potential for material and component costs increasing in the second half of fiscal 2010 and we expect to be as vigilant as possible in our pricing strategies to protect our margins. Notwithstanding efforts to recoup potentially higher costs, pricing will continue to be competitive. We expect to partially offset this potential negative impact through productivity improvements, benefits from new product introductions, and expanded market presence.
"Although fiscal 2010 results will continue to be negatively impacted by current economic conditions, we remain very positive about the long-term potential of our company and our ability to outperform the market. We continue to position the Company to optimize short-term performance while investing in and deploying resources to further our long-term profitable growth opportunities. We intend to invest approximately $25 million in capital expenditures during fiscal 2010, and we estimate our annual tax rate to be approximately 33 percent for the year."
Mr. Nagel concluded, "Looking beyond the current environment, we believe the lighting and lighting-related industry will experience solid growth over the next decade, particularly as energy and environmental concerns come to the forefront, and we believe we are well positioned to fully participate in this exciting industry."
 
 
Accounting Standards Adopted in Fiscal 2010
Included in the accounting standards that the Company adopted in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 was the two-class method as required under ASC 260. The two-class method is an earnings allocation method for computing EPS when a company's capital structure includes two or more classes of common stock or common stock and participating securities; EPS is determined based on dividends declared on common stock and participating securities and participation rights of participating securities in any undistributed earnings. EPS is reduced as a result of including the participating securities in the calculation of EPS. The adoption of the two-class method reduced diluted EPS for the second quarter and first half of fiscal 2009 by $0.01 and $0.02, respectively.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Acuity Brands' management included in the above news release the terms "adjusted operating profit", "adjusted operating profit margin", "adjusted income from continuing operations", and "adjusted diluted EPS" which are non-GAAP financial measures provided to enhance the user's overall understanding of the Company's current financial performance and prospects for the future. Specifically, management believes that adjusted operating profit, adjusted operating profit margin, adjusted income from continuing operations, and adjusted diluted EPS provide useful information to investors by excluding or adjusting items related to (a) streamlining and manufacturing consolidation activities which affected the Company's reported operating results in fiscal 2009 and 2010 and (b) the loss on the early retirement of debt which affected income and diluted EPS in the second quarter of fiscal 2010. Management believes these special items impacted the comparability of the Company's results and that these items are not reflective of fixed costs that the Company will incur over the long term. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, results prepared in accordance with GAAP. The most directly comparable GAAP measure for adjusted operating profit and adjusted operating profit margin are "operating profit" and "operating profit margin", respectively, which include the impact of streamlining and manufacturing consolidation activities. The most directly comparable GAAP measures for adjusted income from continuing operations and adjusted diluted EPS are "income from continuing operations" and "diluted EPS," respectively; both GAAP measures include the impact of special charges and the loss on early retirement of debt. The non-GAAP financial measures included in this news release have been reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure.

Item 8.01 Other Events
As previously reported, on December 1, 2009, Acuity Brands, Inc. ("Acuity Brands" or the "Company") simultaneously announced the private offering by Acuity Brands Lighting, Inc. ("ABL"), its wholly-owned operating subsidiary, of $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due in fiscal 2020 (the "Notes") and the cash tender offer for the $200.0 million of publicly traded notes outstanding that were scheduled to mature in August 2010 (the "2010 Notes"). The proceeds from the offering of the Notes were used to pay for the tender offer and the redemption of any 2010 Notes not tendered. In addition to the retirement of the 2010 Notes, the Company used the proceeds to repay the $25.3 million outstanding balance in January 2010 on a three-year unsecured promissory note issued to the former sole shareholder of Sensor Switch, Inc. ("Sensor Switch"), as part of the Company's acquisition of Sensor Switch during fiscal 2009, with the remainder of the proceeds used for general corporate purposes. The Notes were offered and sold in private placement offerings subsequent to the filing of the consolidated financial statements for the years ended August 31, 2009, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on October 30, 2009 (the "2009 Form 10-K"), and in accordance with Rule 144A and Regulations of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
The Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Company and ABL IP Holding LLC ("ABL IP Holding", and, together with Acuity Brands, the "Guarantors"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Acuity Brands. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations of ABL and rank equally in right of payment with all of ABL's existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness. The guarantees of Acuity Brands and ABL IP Holding are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and ABL IP Holding and rank equally in right of payment with their other senior unsecured indebtedness. The Notes bear interest at a rate of 6% per annum and were issued at a price equal to 99.797% of their face value and for a term of 10 years. Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually on June 15 and December 15, commencing on June 15, 2010.
In accordance with the registration rights agreement by and between ABL and the Guarantors and the initial purchases of the Notes, ABL and the Guarantors to the Notes expect to file a registration statement with the SEC for an offer to exchange the Notes for an issue of SEC-registered notes with substantially identical terms (the "Exchange Offer"). The registration rights agreement provides that, if the Exchange Offer is not completed on or before December 8, 2010, the annual interest rate borne by the Notes will increase by 0.50% per annum until the exchange offer is completed or a shelf registration statement is declared effective.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Overview
     
Company
Acuity Brands Inc. ("Acuity Brands") is the parent company of Acuity Brands Lighting and other subsidiaries (collectively referred to herein as "the Company"). The Company, with its principal office in Atlanta, Georgia, employs approximately 6,000 people worldwide.
The Company designs, produces, and distributes a broad array of indoor and outdoor lighting fixtures and related products, including lighting controls, and services for commercial and institutional, industrial, infrastructure, and residential applications for various markets throughout North America and select international markets. The Company is one of the world's leading producers and distributors of lighting fixtures, with a broad, highly configurable product offering, consisting of roughly 500,000 active products as part of over 2,000 product groups, as well as lighting controls and other products, that are sold to approximately 5,000 customers. As of August 31, 2009, the Company operates 16 manufacturing facilities and six distribution facilities along with two warehouses to serve its extensive customer base.
Acuity Brands completed the Spin-off of its specialty products business, Zep, on October 31, 2007, by distributing all of the shares of Zep common stock, par value $.01 per share, to the Company's stockholders of record as of October 17, 2007. The Company's stockholders received one Zep share, together with an associated preferred stock purchase right, for every two shares of the Company's common stock they owned. Stockholders received cash in lieu of fractional shares for amounts less than one full Zep share.
As a result of the Spin-off, the Company's financial statements have been prepared with the net assets, results of operations, and cash flows of the specialty products business presented as discontinued operations. All historical statements have been restated to conform to this presentation.
     
Strategy
Throughout 2009, the Company made significant progress towards key initiatives designed to enhance and streamline its operations, including its product development and service capabilities, and create a stronger, more effective organization that is capable of more consistently achieving its long-term financial goals, which are as follows:
 
To increase the probability of the Company achieving these financial goals, management will continue to implement programs to enhance its capabilities at providing unparalleled customer service; creating a globally competitive cost structure; improving productivity; and introducing new and innovative products and services more rapidly and cost effectively. In addition, the Company has invested considerable resources to teach and train associates to utilize tools and techniques that accelerate success in these key areas as well as to create a culture that demands excellence through continuous improvement. Additionally, the Company promotes a "pay-for-performance" culture that rewards achievement, while closely monitoring appropriate risk-taking. The expected outcome of these activities will be to better position the Company to deliver on its full potential, to provide a platform for future growth opportunities, and to allow the Company to achieve its long-term financial goals. See the section below for additional information.
Outlook
     
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Company's principle sources of liquidity are operating cash flows generated primarily from its business operations, cash on hand, and various sources of borrowings. The ability of Acuity Brands to generate sufficient cash flow from operations and access certain capital markets, including borrowing from banks, is necessary for the Company to fund its operations, to pay dividends, to meet its obligations as they become due, and to maintain compliance with covenants contained in its financing agreements.
Based on its cash on hand, availability under existing financing arrangements and current projections of cash flow from operations, the Company believes that it will be able to meet its liquidity needs over the next 12 months. These needs are expected to include funding its operations as currently planned, making anticipated capital investments, funding certain potential acquisitions, funding foreseen improvement initiatives, paying quarterly stockholder dividends as currently anticipated, paying principal and interest on borrowings as currently scheduled, and making required contributions into the Company's employee benefit plans, as well as potentially repurchasing shares of Acuity Brands' outstanding common stock as authorized by the Company's Board of Directors. The Company currently expects to invest approximately $35.0 million primarily for equipment, tooling, and new and enhanced information technology capabilities during fiscal 2010.
The Company has $200 million of public notes scheduled to mature on August 2, 2010, and intends to refinance the notes prior to their maturity. While the Company believes it will be able to refinance the notes, the Company believes it will also have the ability to retire the notes as they come due based on available borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility, future cash provided by operations, and current cash balances. See Note 5: Debt and Lines of Credit of the .
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
     
Cash Flow
The Company uses available cash and cash flow from operations, as well as proceeds from the exercise of stock options, if any, to fund operations and capital expenditures, to pay principal and interest on debt, to repurchase stock, to fund acquisitions, and to pay dividends. The Company's available cash position at August 31, 2009 was $18.7 million, a decrease of $278.4 million from August 31, 2008. The decrease in the Company's available cash position was due primarily to the repayment of $162.4 million of debt, $162.1 million used for acquisitions, $21.6 million used for dividends paid, partially offset by cash provided by operating activities and proceeds from the exercise of stock options.
During fiscal 2009, the Company generated $92.7 million of net cash from operating activities compared with $221.8 million generated in the prior-year period, a decrease of $129.1 million. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased due primarily to lower net income and the payment of employee incentive compensation totaling approximately $37.8 million, which was attributable to fiscal 2008 performance.
 
Operating working capital (calculated by adding accounts receivable, net, plus inventories, and subtracting accounts payable) as a percentage of net sales increased to 12.4% at the end of fiscal 2009 from 10.3% at the end of fiscal 2008, due primarily to higher inventory levels as a percentage of net sales. At August 31, 2009, the current ratio (calculated as total current assets divided by total current liabilities) of the Company was 0.9 compared with 1.4 at August 31, 2008. This reduction in the current ratio was due primarily due to the reduction in cash described above and the short-term classification at August 2009 of the $200 million notes that are due in August 2010.
Management believes that investing in assets and programs that will over time increase the overall return on its invested capital is a key factor in driving stockholder value. The Company invested $21.2 million and $27.2 million in fiscal 2009 and 2008, respectively, primarily for new tooling, machinery, equipment, and information technology. As noted above, the Company expects to invest approximately $35.0 million for new plant, equipment, tooling, and new and enhanced information technology capabilities during fiscal 2010.
     
Contractual Obligations
The following table summarizes the Company's contractual obligations at August 31, 2009:
 
 
     
Capitalization
The current capital structure of the Company is comprised principally of senior notes and equity of its stockholders. As of August 31, 2009, the Company had total debt outstanding of $231.6 million which consisted primarily of fixed-rate obligations. During fiscal 2009, total debt outstanding decreased $132.3 million from $363.9 million at August 31, 2008, due primarily to the repayment of the $160 million 6% notes, which matured on February 2, 2009, partially offset by the issuance of a $30 million unsecured promissory note issued as partial consideration for the acquisition of Sensor Switch.
On October 19, 2007, the Company executed a $250 million revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Credit Facility"). The Revolving Credit Facility matures in October 2012 and contains financial covenants including a minimum interest coverage ratio and a leverage ratio ("Maximum Leverage Ratio") of total indebtedness to EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization expense), as such terms are defined in the Revolving Credit Facility agreement. These ratios are computed at the end of each fiscal quarter for the most recent 12-month period. The Revolving Credit Facility allows for a Maximum Leverage Ratio of 3.50, subject to certain conditions defined in the financing agreement. The Company was in compliance with all financial covenants and had no outstanding borrowings at August 31, 2009 under the Revolving Credit Facility. At August 31, 2009, the Company had borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility of $242.7 million under the most restrictive covenant in effect at the time, which represents the full amount of the Revolving Credit Facility less outstanding letters of credit of $7.3 million.
In December 2008, the Company commenced a cash tender offer to purchase any and all of its outstanding $160 million 6% notes due February 2, 2009 (the "Notes"). On December 9, 2008, a total aggregate principal amount of $12.6 million, representing approximately 7.9% of the outstanding Notes, was validly tendered in the offer at a discounted price of $990.00 per $1,000.00. The total consideration plus the applicable accrued and unpaid interest was paid to the tendering holders on the settlement date, December 10, 2008. The gain, net of expenses, was immaterial. The remaining $147.4 million of the Notes matured on February 2, 2009, and the Company repaid the outstanding balance with cash on hand.
The Company has $200 million of outstanding public notes scheduled to mature on August 2, 2010. The Company intends to refinance the notes prior to their maturity. While the Company believes it will be able to refinance the notes, the Company believes it will also have the ability to retire the notes as they come due based on available borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility, future cash provided by operations, and current cash balances. See Note 5: Debt and Lines of Credit of the . In addition, the Company's Board of Directors may authorize the Company's management to explore opportunistic repurchases of indebtedness.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
On April 20, 2009, the Company issued a three-year $30 million 6% unsecured promissory note to the sole shareholder of Sensor Switch, who continued as an employee of the Company upon completion of the acquisition, as partial consideration for the acquisition of Sensor Switch. Scheduled quarterly payments on the note began on July 1, 2009 with the last payment due April 1, 2012. The lender has certain rights to accelerate the note should the Company refinance the $200 million public notes.
During fiscal 2009, the Company's consolidated stockholders' equity increased $96.6 million to $672.1 million at August 31, 2009 from $575.5 million at August 31, 2008. The increase was due primarily to net income earned in the period, stock issued as partial consideration for acquired businesses, and stock issuances associated with employee incentive compensation programs, partially offset by the payment of dividends, unfavorable currency translation adjustments, and an increase in pension obligationsThe Company's debt to total capitalization ratio (calculated by dividing total debt by the sum of total debt and total stockholders' equity) was 25.6% and 38.7% at August 31, 2009 and August 31, 2008, respectively. The ratio of debt, net of cash, to total capitalization, net of cash, was 24.1% at August 31, 2009 and 10.4% at August 31, 2008.
.
 
     
Dividends
Acuity Brands paid dividends on its common stock of $21.6 million ($0.52 per share) during 2009 compared with $22.5 million ($0.54 per share) in 2008. Acuity Brands currently plans to pay quarterly dividends at a rate of $0.13 per share. All decisions regarding the declaration and payment of dividends by Acuity Brands are at the discretion of the Board of Directors of Acuity Brands and will be evaluated from time to time in light of the Company's financial condition, earnings, growth prospects, funding requirements, applicable law, and any other factors the Acuity Brands' board deems relevant.
Results of Operations
     
Fiscal 2009 Compared with Fiscal 2008
The following table sets forth information comparing the components of net income for the year ended August 31, 2009 with the year ended August 31, 2008:
     
Results from Continuing Operations
Net sales were $1,657.4 million for fiscal 2009 compared with $2,026.6 million reported in the prior-year period, a decrease of $369.2 million, or 18.2%. For fiscal 2009, the Company reported income from continuing operations of $85.3 million compared with $148.6 million earned in fiscal 2008. Diluted
 
earnings per share from continuing operations were $2.01 for fiscal 2009 as compared with $3.51 reported for fiscal 2008, a decrease of 42.7%. Results for fiscal 2009 and 2008 include pre-tax special charges of $26.7 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, and $14.6 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, respectively.
On December 31, 2008, Acuity Brands acquired for cash and stock substantially all the assets and assumed certain liabilities of Lighting Control & Design, Inc. ("LC&D"). Located in Glendale, California, LC&D is a manufacturer of comprehensive digital lighting controls and software. LC&D offers a wide range of products, including dimming and building interfaces as well as digital thermostats, all within a single, scalable system. LC&D had calendar year 2008 sales of approximately $18 million.
On April 20, 2009, the Company acquired Sensor Switch, Inc. ("Sensor Switch"), an industry-leading developer and manufacturer of lighting controls and energy management systems for an aggregate consideration of the $205 million comprised of (i) 2 million shares of common stock of the Company, (ii) a $30 million note of Acuity Brands Lighting, and (iii) approximately $130 million of cash. A cash payment of approximately $130 million was funded from available cash on hand and from borrowings under the Company's Revolving Credit Facility. The $30 million unsecured promissory note is payable over three years. Sensor Switch, based in Wallingford, Connecticut, offers a wide-breadth of products and solutions that substantially reduce energy consumption including occupancy sensors, photocontrols, and distributed lighting control devices. Sensor Switch generated sales in excess of $37 million during its fiscal year ending October 31, 2008.
The operating results of Sensor Switch and LC&D have been included in the Company's consolidated financial statements since their respective dates of acquisition.
Net Sales
Net sales decreased approximately 18% in 2009 compared with 2008 due primarily to lower shipments and unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuation, partially offset by revenues from recent acquisitions. The lower volume of product shipments was due primarily to continued decline in demand on the residential and non-residential construction markets, particularly for commercial and office buildings. The Company estimates shipment volumes declined by approximately 19% in fiscal 2009 compared with 2008, partially offset by an estimated 1% improvement in price and product mix. Additionally, unfavorable foreign currency rate fluctuations negatively impacted net sales in fiscal 2009 by slightly less than 2% compared with the prior year, which was largely offset by $26 million of net sales from acquisitions.
Gross Profit
Gross profit margin decreased by 200 basis points to 38.3% of net sales for fiscal 2009 from 40.3% reported for the prior-year period. Gross profit for fiscal 2009 decreased $180.7 million, or 22.2%, to $635.1 million compared with $815.8 million for the prior-year period. The decline in gross profit and gross profit margin was largely attributable to the decline in net sales noted above, increased cost for raw material and components, and unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations. The Company estimates raw material and component costs increased cost of goods sold by approximately $40 million compared with the year-ago period, with only a small portion of the increase recovered in higher prices. Savings from ongoing streamlining efforts, benefits from productivity improvements, and contributions from acquisitions helped to partially offset the negative impact of the aforementioned items on gross profit and gross profit margin.
 
Operating Profit
Selling, Distribution, and Administrative ("SD&A") for fiscal 2009 were $454.6 million compared with $540.1 million in the prior-year period, which represented a decrease of $85.5 million, or 15.8%. Approximately half of the decrease in SD&A expenses was due to lower commissions paid to the Company's sales forces and agents and lower freight costs, which both typically vary directly with sales. Additionally, reduced incentive compensation and benefits from streamlining efforts contributed to lower fiscal 2009 SD&A expense. Partially offsetting these reductions was the additional SD&A expense related to the businesses acquired in fiscal 2009.
expenses
In fiscal 2009, gross profit less SD&A expenses was $180.5 million compared with $275.7 million in the prior-year period, which represents a decrease of $95.2 million, or 17.6%. The decrease was due to lower volume, increased raw material and component costs, and unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations, partially offset by savings from streamlining efforts, benefits from productivity improvements, and contributions from acquisitions. The Company believes this measure provides greater comparability and enhanced visibility into the improvements realized.
As part of the Company's initiative to streamline and simplify operations, the Company recorded in fiscal 2009 and 2008 pre-tax charges of $26.7 million and $14.6 million, respectively, to reflect severance and related employee benefit costs associated with the elimination of certain positions worldwide and the costs associated with the early termination of certain leases. The fiscal 2009 charge included a non-cash expense of $1.6 million for the impairment of assets associated with the closing of a facility. The Company estimates that it realized $39 million ($28 million and $11 million from actions initiated in fiscal 2009 and 2008, respectively) in savings during fiscal 2009 compared with the prior year related to these actions.
Operating profit for fiscal 2009 was $153.8 million compared with $261.1 million reported for the prior-year period, a decrease of $107.3 million, or 41.1%. Operating profit margin decreased 360 basis points to 9.3% compared with 12.9% in the year-ago period. The decrease in operating profit in fiscal 2009 compared with the prior-year period was due primarily to the decrease in gross profit noted above and the $12.1 million incremental special charge related to streamlining efforts, partially offset by decreased SD&A expense as noted above.
Income from Continuing Operations before Provision for Taxes
Other expense consists primarily of interest expense, net, and miscellaneous income (or expense) resulting from changes in exchange rates on foreign currency items as well as other non-operating items. Interest expense, net, was $28.5 million and $28.4 million for fiscal 2009 and 2008, respectively. Fiscal 2009 interest expense, net reflects lower interest expense resulting from the maturity of the $160 million public notes that was more than offset by reduced interest income resulting from both lower cash balances and lower short-term interest rates. For fiscal 2009, the Company reported $2.1 million of other miscellaneous income compared with $2.1 million of other miscellaneous expense in the year-ago period. The $4.2 million favorable year-over-over change was due primarily to the impact of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency items.
Provision for Income Taxes and Income from Continuing Operations
The effective income tax rate reported by the Company was 33.1% and 35.5% for fiscal 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease in the annual tax rate was due primarily to the greater impact of tax credits and deductions on the lower earnings amount and the adverse effect on prior year's effective tax rate related to the repatriation of foreign cash. Income from continuing operations for fiscal 2009 decreased $63.3 million to $85.3 million (including $16.8 million after-tax for the special charge) from $148.6 million (including $9.1 million after-tax for the special charge) reported for the prior-year period. The decrease in income from continuing operations was due primarily to the above noted decrease in operating profit, partially offset by lower tax expense.
 
Results from Discontinued Operations and Net Income
The loss from discontinued operations for fiscal 2009 was $0.3 million, a decrease of $0.1 million from the prior-year loss of $0.4 million. The loss in both periods relate to tax adjustments associated with pre-spin activities.
Net income for fiscal 2009 decreased $63.3 million to $85.0 million from $148.3 million reported for the prior-year period. The decrease in net income resulted primarily from the above noted decline in net sales.
     
Fiscal 2008 Compared with Fiscal 2007
The following table sets forth information comparing the components of net income for the year ended August 31, 2008 with the year ended August 31, 2007:
     
Results from Continuing Operations
Net sales were $2,026.6 million for fiscal 2008 compared with $1,964.8 million reported in the prior-year period, an increase of $61.8 million, or 3.1%. For fiscal 2008, the Company reported income from continuing operations of $148.6 million (including a $9.1 million after-tax special charge for estimated costs the Company incurred to simplify and streamline its operations as a result of the Spin-off) compared
 
with $128.7 million earned in fiscal 2007. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $3.51 (including $0.21 loss related to the special charge) for fiscal 2008 as compared with $2.89 reported for fiscal 2007, an increase of 21.5%.
On July 17, 2007, Acuity Brands acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of Mark Architectural Lighting. Located in Edison, New Jersey, Mark Architectural Lighting is a specification-oriented manufacturer of high-quality lighting products which generated fiscal 2006 sales of over $22 million. The acquisition provides the Company a stronger presence in the Northeast, particularly the New York City metropolitan area, and is a complement to the Center for Light+Space, the Company's sales and marketing office in New York City. The operating results of Mark Architectural Lighting have been included in the Company's consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition.
     
Net Sales
The 3.1% increase in net sales was due primarily to an enhanced mix of products sold and improved pricing. The Company's sales and profitability continued to benefit from a disciplined approach to pricing and a richer mix of new and innovative products sold at higher per unit sales prices that offer customers greater benefits and features, such as more energy efficiency and an improved lighting experience. The Company estimated that greater shipments of products both for new construction and relighting of existing non-residential buildings, excluding large retailers, increased by approximately 2% in fiscal 2008 compared with 2007, partially offset by an approximately 3% decline in volume resulting from weakness in the residential market and reduced new store openings by certain large retailers. The Mark Architectural Lighting acquisition contributed approximately $18.0 million to fiscal 2008 net sales. Additionally, favorable foreign currency rate fluctuations added approximately $19.1 million to the increase in net sales in fiscal 2008.
     
Gross Profit
Gross profit margins increased 240 basis points to 40.3% of net sales for fiscal 2008 from 37.9% reported for the prior-year period. Gross profit increased $71.5 million, or 9.6%, to $815.8 million for fiscal 2008 compared with $744.3 million for the prior-year period. The improvement in gross profit and gross profit margin was largely attributable to improved pricing and a greater mix of higher-margin products sold. In addition, benefits from the contribution of Mark Architectural Lighting and programs to improve productivity and quality contributed to the increased profitability. These gains offset increases in costs for raw materials, components, and freight, as well as increases associated with employee wages and related benefits and freight costs.
     
Operating Profit
Selling, Distribution, and Administrative ("SD&A") were $540.1 million for fiscal 2008 compared with $521.9 million in the prior-year period, which represented an increase of $18.2 million, or 3.5%. Approximately half of the increase in SD&A expenses was due to higher commissions paid to the Company's sales forces and agents, which typically vary directly with sales. Additionally, fiscal 2007 was favorably impacted by a $6.6 million pre-tax gain (net of related legal costs) resulting from a settlement for a commercial dispute involving reimbursement of warranty and product liability costs associated with a product line purchased from a third party in fiscal 2002. The balance of the increase in SD&A expenses was due primarily to an increase in the Company's investment in product marketing and development activities and the impact from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates partially offset by lower expenses for the Company's other general and administrative costs due to cost containment programs. Merit based and inflationary wage increases were fully offset by benefits from the actions taken during fiscal 2008 to streamline and simplify operations.
expenses
 
Gross profit less SD&A expenses was $275.7 million in fiscal 2008 compared with $222.4 million in the prior-year period, which represented an increase of $53.3 million, or 24.0%. The increase was due to gross profit improvements partially offset by increased SD&A expenses as noted above. The Company believes this measure provides greater comparability and enhanced visibility into the improvements realized.
As part of the Company's initiative to streamline and simplify operations, largely in connection with actions related to the Spin-off, the Company recorded in fiscal 2008 a pre-tax charge of $14.6 million to reflect severance and related employee benefit costs associated with the elimination of certain positions worldwide and the costs associated with the early termination of certain leases. The Company estimates that it realized $11 million in savings during fiscal 2008 related to these actions.
Operating profit for fiscal 2008 was $261.1 million compared with $222.4 million reported for the prior-year period, an increase of $38.7 million, or 17.4%. Operating profit margin increased 160 basis points to 12.9% compared with 11.3% in the year-ago period. The improvement in operating profit in fiscal 2008 compared with the prior-year period was due primarily to the increased gross profit noted above, partially offset by the $14.6 million special charge and the $6.6 million favorable commercial dispute settlement in the prior-year period.
     
Income from Continuing Operations before Provision for Taxes
Other expense consists primarily of interest expense, net, and miscellaneous expense (or income) resulting from changes in exchange rates on foreign currency items as well as other non-operating items. Interest expense, net, was $28.4 million and $29.9 million for fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively. Interest expense, net, decreased 5.0% in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 due primarily to greater interest income earned on higher invested cash balances, partially offset by lower short-term interest rates. The fluctuation in miscellaneous expense (income) was due primarily to the impact of exchange rates on foreign currency items.
     
Provision for Income Taxes and Income from Continuing Operations
The effective income tax rate reported by the Company was 35.5% and 33.7% for fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively. The current period tax rate was adversely affected by taxes related to the repatriation of foreign cash and increased income in jurisdictions with higher tax rates.
Income from continuing operations for fiscal 2008 increased $19.9 million to $148.6 million (including $9.1 million after-tax for the special charge) from $128.7 million reported for the prior-year period. The increase in income from continuing operations resulted primarily from the above noted increase in operating profit, partially offset by higher tax expense.
Results from Discontinued Operations and Net Income
The loss from discontinued operations for fiscal 2008 was $0.4 million, a decrease of $19.8 million from the prior-year period income of $19.4 million. The decrease was due primarily to the contribution of only two months of operating results in fiscal 2008 rather than a full year in fiscal 2007. In addition, discontinued operations were negatively impacted by approximately $5.5 million in costs related to the Spin-off during the first quarter of fiscal 2008. These non-tax deductible costs consist primarily of legal, accounting, financial, and other professional fees incurred in connection with the Spin-off.
Net income for fiscal 2008 increased $0.2 million to $148.3 million from $148.1 million reported for the prior-year period. The increase in net income resulted primarily from the above noted increase in income from continuing operations, partially offset by the results from discontinued operations.
 
Outlook
The performance of Acuity Brands, like most companies, is influenced by a multitude of factors such as the health of the economy, including employment, credit availability, and consumer confidence. During the Company's fiscal 2009, major economies and financial markets throughout the world experienced unprecedented volatility, creating uncertainty both for consumers and businesses. As a result, construction activity in the U.S., both non-residential and residential, declined significantly during fiscal 2009. The vitality of the Company's business is determined by underlying economic factors such as employment levels, credit availability, consumer demand, commodity costs, and government policy, particularly as it impacts capital formation and risk taking by businesses and commercial developers. As such, it is difficult at this time to precisely forecast the direction or intensity of future economic activity in general and more specifically with respect to overall construction demand. Key indicators continue to signal declines for North American non-residential construction activity. Accordingly, management's expectation is that in 2010 the percentage decline in the overall markets it serves will be in the mid-teens. The Company's backlog at the end of the fiscal 2009 was down 23 percent compared to the prior year.
While prices for components and commodities, particularly for steel and petroleum, declined from their record highs in the summer and fall of 2008, volatility in pricing for these products could once again occur and possibly place pressure on the Company's margins. Management believes that competitive forces in the current market environment will not allow the Company to pass along more than commodity cost increases or to significantly retain current pricing on commodity-sensitive products should those specific commodity costs sharply decline. Although management believes pricing is likely to become more competitive in certain channels and geographies, the negative impact is expected to be offset through productivity improvements and lower material, component, and freight costs.
During fiscal 2010, the Company expects to realize approximately $50 million of annualized benefits from the streamlining actions taken in fiscal 2009 of which approximately $28 million of benefits were realized during fiscal 2009. These actions related to the consolidation of certain manufacturing operations and a reduction in workforce. The Company initiated such actions in an effort to continue to redeploy and invest resources in other areas where the Company believes it can create greater value for all stakeholders and accelerate profitable growth opportunities, including a continued focus on industry-leading product innovation incorporating sustainable design, relighting, and customer connectivity.
In addition to the recent acquisitions which significantly increased the Company's presence in the fast-growing lighting controls market, management believes the execution of the Company's strategies to accelerate investments in innovative and energy-efficient products, enhance services to its customers, and expand market presence in key sectors such as home centers and the renovation and relight market will provide growth opportunities, which should enable the Company to outperform the overall markets it serves. Additionally, management believes these actions and investments will position the Company to meet or exceed its long-term financial goals.
The Company expects cash flow from operations to remain strong in 2010 and intends to invest approximately $35 million in capital expenditures during the year. Also, the Company estimates the annual tax rate to approximate 35% for 2010.
Although fiscal 2010 results are expected to be negatively impacted by current economic conditions, management remains very positive about the long-term potential of the Company and its ability to outperform the market. Management continues to position the Company to optimize short-term performance while investing in and deploying resources to further the Company's long-term profitable growth opportunities. Looking beyond the current environment, management believes the lighting and lighting-related industry will experience solid growth over the next decade, particularly as energy and environmental concerns come to the forefront, and that the Company is well-positioned to fully participate in this growing industry.
 
Accounting Standards Yet to Be Adopted
In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting ("SFAS") No. 141 (revised 2007), ("SFAS No. 141R"). SFAS No. 141R changes accounting for business combinations through a requirement to recognize 100% of the fair values of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and noncontrolling interests in acquisitions of less than a 100% controlling interest when the acquisition constitutes a change in control of the acquired entity. Other requirements include capitalization of acquired in-process research and development assets, expensing, as incurred, acquisition-related transaction costs and capitalizing restructuring charges as part of the acquisition only if requirements of SFAS No. 146, are met. SFAS No. 141R is effective for business combination transactions for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008 and is therefore effective for the Company beginning in fiscal 2010. The implementation of this guidance will affect the Company's results of operations and financial position after its effective date only to the extent it completes applicable business combinations subsequent to the effective date, and therefore, the impact cannot be determined at this time.
Business Combinations
Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities,
In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, ("SFAS No. 160"). SFAS No. 160 establishes the economic entity concept of consolidated financial statements, stating that holders of a residual economic interest in an entity have an equity interest in the entity, even if the residual interest is related to only a portion of the entity. Therefore, SFAS No. 160 requires a noncontrolling interest to be presented as a separate component of equity. SFAS No. 160 also states that once control is obtained, a change in control that does not result in a loss of control should be accounted for as an equity transaction. The statement requires that a change resulting in a loss of control and deconsolidation is a significant event triggering gain or loss recognition and the establishment of a new fair value basis in any remaining ownership interests. SFAS No. 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008 and is therefore effective for the Company beginning in fiscal 2010. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 160 to have a material impact on its results of operations and financial position.
Noncontrolling Interest in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51
In June 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 168, ("SFAS No. 168"), which confirms that as of July 1, 2009, the ("Codification") is the single official source of authoritative, nongovernmental U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP"). All existing accounting standard documents are superseded, and all other accounting literature not included in the Codification is considered nonauthoritative. SFAS No. 168 is effective for interim and annual periods ending after September 15, 2009 and is therefore effective for the Company at the conclusion of the first quarter of 2010. While the Codification is not intended to change U.S. GAAP and, thus, not expected to have an effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows upon adoption, the Company is reviewing disclosures due to changes in references to U.S. GAAP literature.

Accounting Standards Adopted in Fiscal 2009
In May 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 165, ("SFAS No. 165"), which establishes: the period after the balance sheet date during which an entity should evaluate events or transactions for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements; the circumstances under which an entity should recognize such events or transactions in its financial statements; and disclosures regarding such events or transactions and the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events.
Subsequent Events
The provisions of SFAS No. 165 were effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after June 15, 2009 and were adopted by the Company on August 31, 2009. The Company determined, however, that SFAS No. 165 did not have an effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows upon adoption, as its guidance is substantially consistent with that previously applied by the Company.
In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP FAS No. 107-1 and Accounting Principles Board Opinion ("APB") No. 28-1, Instruments ("FSP FAS No. 107-1 and APB 28-1"), which requires that the fair value of financial instruments be disclosed in an entity's interim financial statements, as well as in annual financial statements. The provisions of FSP FAS No. 107-1 and APB 28-1 also require that fair value information be presented with the related carrying value and that the method and significant assumptions used to estimate fair value, as well as changes in method and significant assumptions, be disclosed.
Interim Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial
The provisions of FSP FAS No. 107-1 and APB 28-1 were effective for interim periods ending after June 15, 2009 and were adopted by the Company on August 31, 2009. As the pronouncement only pertains to additional disclosures, the adoption had no effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, ("SFAS No. 159"). SFAS No. 159 permits companies, at their election, to measure specified financial instruments and warranty and insurance contracts at fair value on a contract-by-contract basis, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each reporting period. The election, called the "fair value option," will enable some companies to reduce the volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently, and it is easier than using the complex hedge-accounting requirements in SFAS No. 133, , to achieve similar results. Subsequent changes in fair value for designated items will be required to be reported in earnings in the current period. SFAS No. 159 was effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and was therefore effective for the Company beginning in fiscal 2009. The Company adopted SFAS No. 159 on September 1, 2008 and elected not to apply the fair value option, and therefore, the adoption did not have an impact on the Company's results of operations or financial position.
The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, , an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R) ("SFAS No. 158"). SFAS No. 158 requires an employer to: (a) recognize in its statement of financial position the funded status of a benefit plan; (b) measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the end of the employer's fiscal year (with limited exceptions); and (c) recognize as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit costs pursuant to prior existing guidance. The provisions governing recognition of the funded status of a defined benefit plan and related disclosures became effective and were adopted by the Company at the end of fiscal 2007. The requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the employer's fiscal year-end statement of financial position is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008, and was therefore effective for the Company in fiscal 2009. The change in measurement date to August 31 resulted in a reduction to retained earnings of approximately $0.5 million, net of tax.
Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans
 
In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, ("SFAS No. 157"). SFAS No. 157 establishes a single authoritative definition of fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosure requirements pertaining to fair value measurements. The provisions of SFAS No. 157 related to financial assets and liabilities as well as other assets and liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring basis were effective for the Company on September 1, 2008. Other than the additional disclosures required, the adoption of these provisions of SFAS No. 157 did not have an impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. The provisions of SFAS No. 157 related to other nonfinancial assets and liabilities will be effective for the Company on September 1, 2009. The Company does not expect the adoption of these provisions to have a material impact on its results of operations and financial position.
Fair Value Measurements
Pronouncements Retrospectively Adopted
In June 2008, FASB issued FASB Staff Position ("FSP") No. EITF 03-6-1, ("FSP EITF 03-6-1"). FSP EITF 03-6-1 was issued to clarify that unvested share-based payment awards with a right to receive nonforfeitable dividends are participating securities. FSP EITF 03-6-1 provided guidance on how to allocate earnings to participating securities and compute basic earnings per share ("EPS") using the two-class method. The provisions of this standard were effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years, and were therefore adopted by the Company on September 1, 2009. The implementation of this guidance impacted the Company's EPS calculation; thus, the EPS amounts for previously reported periods have been adjusted due to the retrospective adoption of this standard. The Company's diluted EPS from continuing operations for the years ended August 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, under this guidance are $2.01, $3.51, and $2.89, respectively, as compared to $2.04, $3.57, and $2.93 previously reported for these periods.
Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities
Critical Accounting Estimates
addresses the financial condition and results of operations as reflected in the Company's C, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. As discussed in Note 1 of the , the preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to inventory valuation; depreciation, amortization and the recoverability of long-lived assets, including goodwill and intangible assets; share-based compensation expense; medical, product warranty, and other reserves; litigation; and environmental matters. Management bases its estimates and judgments on its substantial historical experience and other relevant factors, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Management discusses the development of accounting estimates with the Company's Audit Committee. See Note 3: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the for a summary of the accounting policies of Acuity Brands.
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
onsolidated Financial Statements
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
The management of Acuity Brands believes the following represent the Company's critical accounting estimates:
     
Inventories
Inventories include materials, direct labor, and related manufacturing overhead, and are stated at the lower of cost (on a first-in, first-out or average-cost basis) or market. Management reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess or obsolete inventory primarily based on estimated future demand and current market conditions. A significant change in customer demand or market conditions could render certain inventory obsolete and thus could have a material adverse impact on the Company's operating results in the period the change occurs.
     
Goodwill and Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets
The Company reviews goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis in the fiscal fourth quarter or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not indicate that the fair value of the long-lived asset is below its carrying value. All other long-lived and intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss for goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles would be recognized based on the difference between the carrying value of the asset and its estimated fair value, which would be determined based on either discounted future cash
 
flows or other appropriate fair value methods. The evaluation of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles for impairment requires management to use significant judgments and estimates in accordance with U.S. GAAP including, but not limited to, projected future net sales, operating results, and cash flow.
Although management currently believes that the estimates used in the evaluation of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles are reasonable, differences between actual and expected net sales, operating results, and cash flow and/or changes in the discount rate or theoretical royalty rate could cause these assets to be deemed impaired. If this were to occur, the Company would be required to charge to earnings the write-down in value of such assets, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial position, but not its cash flows from operations.
     
Goodwill
The Company is comprised of one reporting unit with a goodwill balance of $510.6 million. In determining the fair value of the Company's reporting unit, the Company uses a discounted cash flow analysis, which requires significant assumptions about discount rates as well as short and long-term growth (or decline) rates, in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company utilized an estimated discount rate of 10% as of June 1, 2009, based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model, which considers the updated risk-free interest rate, beta, market risk premium, and entity specific size premium. Short-term growth (or decline) rates are based on management's forecasted financial results which consider key business drivers such as specific revenue growth initiatives, market share changes, growth (or decline) in non-residential and residential construction markets, and general economic factors such as credit availability and interest rates. The Company calculates the discounted cash flows using a 10-year period with a terminal value and compares this calculation to the discounted cash flows generated over a 40-year period to ensure reasonableness. The long-term growth rate used in determining terminal value is estimated at 3% for the Company and is primarily based on the Company's understanding of projections for expected long-term growth in non-residential construction, the Company's key market.
During fiscal 2009, the Company performed an evaluation of the fair value of goodwill. The analysis included downward adjustments to the Company's revenue forecasts and related short-term growth rates compared to the prior year evaluation. The goodwill analysis did not result in an impairment charge as the estimated fair value of the reporting unit continues to exceed the carrying value by such a significant amount that any reasonably likely change in the assumptions used in the analysis, including revenue growth rates and the discount rate, would not cause the carrying value to exceed the estimated fair value for the reporting unit as determined under the step one goodwill impairment analysis.
     
Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets
The Company's indefinite lived intangible assets consist of five unamortized trade names with an aggregate carrying value of approximately $96.0 million. Management utilizes significant assumptions to estimate the fair value of these unamortized trade names using a fair value model based on discounted future cash flows in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Future cash flows associated with each of the Company's unamortized trade names are calculated by applying a theoretical royalty rate a willing third party would pay for use of the particular trade name to estimated future net sales. The present value of the resulting after-tax cash flow is management's current estimate of the fair value of the trade names. This fair value model requires management to make several significant assumptions, including estimated future net sales, the royalty rate, and the discount rate.
Future net sales and short-term growth (or decline) rates are estimated for each particular trade name based on management's forecasted financial results which consider key business drivers such as specific revenue growth initiatives, market share changes, expected growth (or decline) in non-residential and residential construction markets, and general economic factors such as credit availability and interest rates. The long-term growth rate used in determining terminal value is estimated at 3% for the Company and is primarily based on the Company's understanding of projections for expected long-term growth in
 
non-residential construction, the Company's key market. The theoretical royalty rate is estimated using a factor of operating profit margins and management's assumptions regarding the amount a willing third party would pay to use the particular trade name. Differences between expected and actual results can result in significantly different valuations. If future operating results are unfavorable compared with forecasted amounts, the Company may be required to reduce the theoretical royalty rate used in the fair value model. A reduction in the theoretical royalty rate would result in lower expected future after-tax cash flow in the valuation model. As with goodwill noted above, the Company utilized an estimated discount rate of 10% as of June 1, 2009, based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model, which considers the updated risk-free interest rate, beta, market risk premium, and entity specific size premium. All of these assumptions are subject to change based on unforeseen factors by management due to the inherent uncertainty of the global economic and political environment at large.
During fiscal 2009, the Company performed an evaluation of the fair value of its five unamortized trade names. The Company's adjusted expected revenues are based on recent lighting market growth or decline estimates for fiscal 2010 through 2014. The Company also included revenue growth estimates based on current initiatives expected to help the Company improve performance. During fiscal 2009, estimated theoretical royalty rates ranged between 1% and 4%. The indefinite lived intangible asset analysis did not result in an impairment charge as the fair values exceeded the carrying values by a significant amount except for the Mark Lighting trade name which has a fair value that exceeds its $8.6 million carrying value by approximately 28%. The estimated fair values of the indefinite lived intangible assets, other than the Mark Lighting trade name, exceed the carrying values by such a significant amount that any reasonably likely change in the assumptions used in the analyses, including revenue growth rates and the discount rate, would not cause the carrying values to exceed the estimated fair values as determined by the fair value analyses. The Company determined that any estimated potential impairment related to the Mark Lighting trade name based on reasonably likely changes in the assumptions would not be material to the Company's financial results, trend of earnings, or financial position.
     
Self-Insurance
The Company self-insures, up to certain limits, traditional risks including workers' compensation, comprehensive general liability, and auto liability. The Company's self-insured retention for each claim involving workers' compensation, comprehensive general liability (including product liability claims), and auto liability is limited to $0.5 million per occurrence of such claims. A provision for claims under this self-insured program, based on the Company's estimate of the aggregate liability for claims incurred, is revised and recorded annually. The estimate is derived from both internal and external sources including but not limited to the Company's independent actuary. Acuity Brands is also self-insured up to certain limits for certain other insurable risks, primarily physical loss to property ($0.5 million per occurrence) and business interruptions resulting from such loss lasting three days or more in duration. Insurance coverage is maintained for catastrophic property and casualty exposures as well as those risks required to be insured by law or contract. Acuity Brands is fully self-insured for certain other types of liabilities, including environmental, product recall, and patent infringement. The actuarial estimates calculated are subject to uncertainty from various sources, including, among others, changes in claim reporting patterns, claim settlement patterns, judicial decisions, legislation, and economic conditions. Although Acuity Brands believes that the actuarial estimates are reasonable, significant differences related to the items noted above could materially affect the Company's self-insurance obligations, future expense and cash flow.
The Company is also self-insured for the majority of its medical benefit plans with individual claims limited to $300,000. The Company estimates its aggregate liability for claims incurred by applying a lag factor to the Company's historical claims and administrative cost experience. The appropriateness of the Company's lag factor is evaluated and revised, if necessary, annually. Although management believes that the current estimates are reasonable, significant differences related to claim reporting patterns, plan designs, legislation, and general economic conditions could materially affect the Company's medical benefit plan liabilities, future expense and cash flow.
 
     
Share-Based Compensation Expense
On September 1, 2005, Acuity Brands adopted SFAS No. 123(R), ("SFAS No. 123(R)"), which requires compensation cost relating to share-based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements based on the estimated fair value of the equity or liability instrument issued. Acuity Brands adopted SFAS No. 123(R) using the modified prospective method and applied it to the accounting for Acuity Brands' stock options and restricted shares, and share units representing certain deferrals into the Director Deferred Compensation Plan or the Supplemental Deferred Savings Plan (both of which are discussed further in Note 7: Share Based Payments of ). Under the modified prospective method, share-based expense recognized after adoption includes: (a) share-based expense for all awards granted prior to, but not yet vested as of September 1, 2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS No. 123, , and (b) share-based expense for all awards granted subsequent to September 1, 2005, based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R). Acuity Brands recorded $13.0 million, $12.0 million, and $11.1 million of share-based expense in continuing operations for the years ended August 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. Amounts recorded for share-based expense in discontinued operations were $2.2 million for the year ended August 31, 2007.
Share Based Payment
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
SFAS No. 123(R) does not specify a preference for a type of valuation model to be used when measuring fair value of share-based payments, and Acuity Brands continues to employ the Black-Scholes model in deriving the fair value estimates of such awards. SFAS No. 123(R) requires forfeitures of share-based awards to be estimated at time of grant and revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from initial estimates. Therefore, expense related to share-based payments recognized in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. Acuity Brands' assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model remain otherwise unaffected by the implementation of this pronouncement. As of August 31, 2009, there was $26.1 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.6 years. As of August 31, 2009, there was $2.9 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested options. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.7 years. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience. If factors change causing different assumptions to be made in future periods, compensation expense recorded pursuant to SFAS No. 123(R) may differ significantly from that recorded in the current period. See Notes 3 and 7 of for more information regarding the assumptions used in estimating the fair value of stock options.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
     
Product Warranty and Recall Costs
The Company records an allowance for the estimated amount of future warranty costs when the related revenue is recognized, primarily based on historical experience of identified warranty claims. Excluding costs related to recalls due to faulty components provided by third parties, historical warranty costs have been within expectations. However, there can be no assurance that future warranty costs will not exceed historical amounts. If actual future warranty costs exceed historical amounts, additional allowances may be required, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company's operating results and cash flow in future periods.
     
Litigation
Acuity Brands recognizes expense for legal claims when payments associated with the claims become probable and can be reasonably estimated. Due to the difficulty in estimating costs of resolving legal claims, actual costs may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts reserved.
 
     
Environmental Matters
The Company recognizes expense for known environmental claims when payments associated with the claims become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. The actual cost of resolving environmental issues may be higher or lower than that reserved primarily due to difficulty in estimating such costs and potential changes in the status of government regulations. The Company is self-insured for most environmental matters.

Exhibit 99.3
Item 8.
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
 
The management of Acuity Brands, Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
The Company's management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2009. In making this assessment, the Company's management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO") in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based on this assessment, management believes that, as of August 31, 2009, the Company's internal control over financial reporting is effective.
The Company's independent registered public accounting firm has issued an audit report on their audit of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. This report dated October 29, 2009 appears on page 4 of this report.
 
The Board of Directors and Stockholders Acuity Brands, Inc.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Acuity Brands, Inc. as of August 31, 2009 and 2008, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended August 31, 2009.

The Board of Directors and Stockholders Acuity Brands, Inc.
We have audited Acuity Brands, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2009, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Acuity Brands, Inc.'s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, Acuity Brands, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2009, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Acuity Brands, Inc. as of August 31, 2009 and 2008, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended August 31, 2009 of Acuity Brands, Inc. and our report dated October 29, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Note 1: Description of Business and Basis of Presentation
Acuity Brands, Inc. ("Acuity Brands") is the parent company of Acuity Brands Lighting, Inc. formerly known as Acuity Lighting Group, Inc. and other subsidiaries (collectively referred to herein as "the Company"). The Company designs, produces, and distributes a broad array of indoor and outdoor lighting fixtures and related products, including lighting controls, and services for commercial and institutional, industrial, infrastructure, and residential applications for various markets throughout North America and select international markets. The Company has one operating segment.
Acuity Brands completed the spin-off of its specialty products business (the "Spin-off"), Zep Inc. ("Zep") on October 31, 2007, by distributing all of the shares of Zep common stock, par value $.01 per share, to the Company's stockholders of record as of October 17, 2007. The Company's stockholders received one Zep share, together with an associated preferred stock purchase right, for every two shares of the Company's common stock they owned. Stockholders received cash in lieu of fractional shares for amounts less than one full Zep share.
As a result of the Spin-off, the Company's financial statements have been prepared with the net assets, results of operations, and cash flows of the specialty products business presented as discontinued operations. All historical statements have been restated to conform to this presentation. Refer to Note 2  .
Discontinued Operations

Consolidated Financial Statements
Note 2: Discontinued Operations
As described in Note 1  , the Company completed the Spin-off of the specialty products business on October 31, 2007.
Description of Business and Basis of Presentation
A summary of the operating results for the discontinued operations is as follows:
The loss from discontinued operations for fiscal 2009 was $0.3 million, a decrease of $0.1 million from the prior-year loss and relates to tax adjustments associated with pre-spin activities.
In conjunction with the Spin-off, Acuity Brands and Zep entered into various agreements that address the allocation of assets and liabilities between them and that define their relationship after the separation, including a distribution agreement, a tax disaffiliation agreement, an employee benefits agreement, and a transition services agreement. Pursuant to the distribution agreement, Zep drew on its financing arrangements and paid a $62.5 million dividend to the Company, which was subject to adjustment based on the actual cash flow performance of Zep prior to the Spin-off. A dividend adjustment of approximately
 
$4 million plus interest was disbursed to Zep by the Company during the third quarter of fiscal 2008 resulting in a reduction of the dividend received from Zep. Information regarding guarantees and indemnities related to the Spin-off are included in Note 8  .

Revenue Recognition
The Company records revenue when the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the Company's price to the customer is fixed and determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. Delivery is not considered to have occurred until the customer assumes the risks and rewards of ownership. Customers take delivery at the time of shipment for terms designated free on board shipping point. For sales designated free on board destination, customers take delivery when the product is delivered to the customer's delivery site. Provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives, product returns, and discounts to customers are recorded in the same period the related revenue is recorded. The Company also maintains one-time or on-going marketing and trade-promotion programs with certain customers that require the Company to estimate and accrue the expected costs of such programs. These arrangements include cooperative marketing programs, merchandising of the Company's products, and introductory marketing funds for new products and other trade-promotion activities conducted by the customer. Costs associated with these programs are reflected within the Company's in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 01-09: , which in most instances requires such costs be recorded as a reduction of revenue.
Consolidated Statements of Income
Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer (Including a Reseller of the Vendor's Products)
The Company provides for limited product return rights to certain distributors and customers primarily for slow moving or damaged items subject to certain defined criteria. The Company monitors product returns and records, at the time revenue is recognized, a provision for the estimated amount of future returns based primarily on historical experience and specific notification of pending returns. Although historical product returns generally have been within expectations, there can be no assurance that future product returns will not exceed historical amounts. A significant increase in product returns could have a material impact on the Company's operating results in future periods.
For the Company's turn key labor renovation and relight services, revenue is earned on installation services and lighting fixtures. Revenue is recognized for the service and fixtures in the period that the installation of the fixtures is completed.
     
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
     
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash in excess of daily requirements is invested in time deposits and marketable securities and is included in the accompanying balance sheets at fair value. Acuity Brands considers time deposits and marketable securities with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
 
     
Accounts Receivable
The Company records accounts receivable at net realizable value. This value includes an allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts to reflect losses anticipated on accounts receivable balances. The allowance is based on historical write-offs, an analysis of past due accounts based on the contractual terms of the receivables, and economic status of customers, if known. Management believes that the allowance is sufficient to cover uncollectible amounts; however, there can be no assurance that unanticipated future business conditions of customers will not have a negative impact on the Company's results of operations.
     
Concentrations of Credit Risk
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables, which are typically unsecured, are generally limited due to the wide variety of customers and markets using Acuity Brands' products, as well as their dispersion across many different geographic areas. Receivables from The Home Depot were approximately $30.2 million and $35.2 million at August 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. No other single customer accounted for more than 10% of consolidated receivables at August 31, 2009. Additionally, net sales to The Home Depot accounted for approximately 11% of net sales of the Company in both fiscal 2009 and 2008 and 13% in fiscal 2007.
     
Reclassifications
Certain prior-period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.
     
Inventories
Inventories include materials, direct labor, and related manufacturing overhead, are stated at the lower of cost (on a first-in, first-out or average cost basis) or market, and consist of the following:
     
Goodwill and Other Intangibles
Summarized information for the Company's acquired intangible assets is as follows:
 
Through multiple acquisitions, the Company acquired intangible assets consisting primarily of trademarks associated with specific products with finite lives and distribution networks which are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Other acquired definite lived intangible assets consist primarily of patented technology, non-compete agreements, and customer relationships. Indefinite lived intangible assets consist of trade names that are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely. Significant estimates and assumptions were used to determine the fair value of these acquired intangible assets in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The current year increases in the gross carrying amounts for the acquired intangible assets were due to the Lighting Control and Design, Inc. ("LC&D") and Sensor Switch, Inc. and related subsidiaries ("Sensor Switch") (refer to Note 10  ). With regards to the LC&D acquisition, the weighted average useful life of the intangible assets with finite lives acquired by the Company was 12.8 years, which consisted of intangible assets related to distribution networks and customer relationships. In the acquisition of Sensor Switch, the Company acquired intangible assets with finite lives related to patented technology and distribution networks and customer relationships with weighted average useful lives of 12.0 and 19.9 years, respectively. The total weighted average useful life for these intangible assets acquired during the Sensor Switch acquisition was 18.9 years.
Acquisitions
The Company recorded amortization expense of $5.4 million, $3.7 million and $3.2 million related to intangible assets with finite lives during fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. Amortization expense is expected to be approximately $6.4 million in both fiscal 2010 and 2011, $5.4 million in fiscal 2012, and $4.6 million in both fiscal 2013 and 2014. The decrease in expected amortization expense in fiscal 2012 is due to the completion of the amortization during fiscal 2011 of certain acquired patented technology assets. The decrease in fiscal 2013 is due to the completion of the amortization during fiscal 2012 of certain acquired customer relationships. Included in these amounts are the impact of incremental amortization expense for the December 31, 2008 acquisition of substantially all the assets and the assumption of certain liabilities of LC&D and the April 20, 2009 acquisition of Sensor Switch.
The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill during the year are summarized as follows:
The Company tests indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently as facts and circumstances change, as required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142, . The goodwill impairment test has two steps. The first step identifies potential impairments by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill. The fair values are determined based on a combination of valuation techniques including the expected present value of future cash flows, a market multiple approach, and a comparable transaction approach. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying value, goodwill is not impaired and the second step is not necessary. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value, the second step calculates the possible impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying value. If the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value, an impairment charge is recorded. The impairment test for unamortized trade names consists of comparing the fair value of the asset with its carrying value. The Company estimates the fair value of these unamortized trade names using a fair value model based on discounted future cash flows. If the carrying amount exceeds the measured fair value, an impairment loss would be recorded in the amount of the excess. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, significant assumptions were used in the determination of estimated fair value for both goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets. Neither of the analyses resulted in an impairment charge during fiscal 2009, 2008, or 2007.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
 
     
Other Long-Term Assets
Other long-term assets consist of the following:
 
As of August 31, 2009, the Company reported assets held for sale of $9.6 million, which were comprised of $5.6 million in short-term assets and $4.0 million in long-term assets. The assets represent three properties that the Company intends to sell to third parties within one year, or, in certain circumstances, beyond one year as allowed by SFAS 144, , as the facilities have been deemed unnecessary to current operations.

Share-Based Compensation
The Company accounts for share-based compensation under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 123(R), . SFAS No. 123(R) requires compensation cost relating to share-based payment transactions to be recognized in financial statements and that this cost be measured based on the estimated fair value of the equity or liability instrument issued. SFAS No. 123(R) also requires that forfeitures be estimated over the vesting period of the instrument. Effective September 1, 2005, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123(R) using the modified prospective method and applied it to the accounting for the Company's stock options and restricted shares, and share units representing certain deferrals into the Director Deferred Compensation Plan or the Supplemental Deferred Savings Plan (see Note 7  of for further discussion of these plans). Under the modified prospective method, share-based expense recognized after adoption includes: (a) share-based expense for all awards granted prior to, but not yet vested as of September 1, 2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS No. 123, , and (b) share-based expense for all awards granted subsequent to September 1, 2005, based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R).

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
Share-based expense includes expense related to restricted stock and options issued, as well as share units deferred into either the Director Deferred Compensation Plan or the Supplemental Deferred Savings Plan. The Company recorded $13.0 million, $12.0 million, and $11.1 million of share-based expense in continuing operations for the years ending August 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. Amounts recorded for share-based expense in discontinued operations were $2.2 million for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2007. The total income tax benefit recognized in continuing operations for share-based compensation arrangements was $4.3 million, $4.7 million, and $3.9 million for the years ended August 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. The total income tax benefit recognized for share-based compensation arrangements in discontinued operations was less than $1 million in fiscal 2007. The Company did not capitalize any expense related to share-based payments and has recorded share-based expense in . The Company accounts for any awards with graded vesting on a straight-line basis.
Selling, Distribution, and Administrative Expenses
Excess tax benefits of $0.4 million, $5.0 million, and $15.4 million related to share-based compensation were included in financing activities in the Company's for the years ended August 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively.

Depreciation
For financial reporting purposes, depreciation is determined principally on a straight-line basis using estimated useful lives of plant and equipment (10 to 40 years for buildings and related improvements and 5 to 15 years for machinery and equipment) while accelerated depreciation methods are used for income tax purposes. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the life of the lease or the useful life of the improvement, whichever is shorter. Depreciation expense amounted to $29.6 million, $29.7 million, and $28.1 million during the fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively.
 
     
Research and Development
Research and development ("R&D") costs, which are included in in the Company's , are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses amounted to $20.8 million, $30.3 million, and $31.3 million during the fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. The decrease in the fiscal 2009 expense was due primarily to lower incentive compensation associated with R&D associates.

Accounting Standards Yet to Be Adopted
In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), ("SFAS No. 141R"). SFAS No. 141R changes accounting for business combinations through a requirement to recognize 100% of the fair values of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and noncontrolling interests in acquisitions of less than a 100% controlling interest when the acquisition constitutes a change in control of the acquired entity. Other requirements include capitalization of acquired in-process research and development assets, expensing, as incurred, acquisition-related transaction costs and capitalizing restructuring charges as part of the acquisition only if requirements of SFAS No. 146, are met. SFAS No. 141R is effective for business combination transactions for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008 and is therefore effective for the Company beginning in fiscal 2010. The implementation of this guidance will affect the Company's results of operations and financial position after its effective date only to the extent it completes applicable business combinations subsequent to the effective date, and therefore, the impact can not be determined at this time.
Business Combinations
Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities,
In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, ("SFAS No. 160"). SFAS No. 160 establishes the economic entity concept of consolidated financial statements, stating that holders of a residual economic interest in an entity have an equity interest in the entity, even if the residual interest is related to only a portion of the entity. Therefore, SFAS No. 160 requires a noncontrolling interest to be presented as a separate component of equity. SFAS No. 160 also states that once control is obtained, a change in control that does not result in a loss of control should be accounted for as an equity transaction. The statement requires that a change resulting in a loss of control and deconsolidation is a significant event triggering gain or loss recognition and the establishment of a new fair value basis in any remaining ownership interests. SFAS No. 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008 and is therefore effective for the Company beginning in fiscal 2010. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 160 to have a material impact on its results of operations and financial position.
Noncontrolling Interest in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51
In June 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 168, ("SFAS No. 168"), which confirms that as of July 1, 2009, the ("Codification") is the single official source of authoritative, nongovernmental U.S. GAAP. All existing accounting standard documents are superseded, and all other accounting literature not included in the Codification is considered nonauthoritative. SFAS No. 168 is effective for interim and annual periods ending after September 15, 2009 and is therefore effective for the Company at the conclusion of the first quarter of 2010. While the Codification is not intended to change U.S. GAAP and, thus, not expected to have an effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows upon adoption, the Company is reviewing disclosures due to changes in references to U.S. GAAP literature.

Accounting Standards Adopted in Fiscal 2009
In May 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 165, ("SFAS No. 165"), which establishes: the period after the balance sheet date during which an entity should evaluate events or transactions for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements; the circumstances under which an entity should recognize such events or transactions in its financial statements; and disclosures regarding such events or transactions and the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events.
Subsequent Events
The provisions of SFAS No. 165 were effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after June 15, 2009 and were adopted by the Company on August 31, 2009. The Company determined, however, that SFAS No. 165 did not have an effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows upon adoption, as its guidance is substantially consistent with that previously applied by the Company.
In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP FAS No. 107-1 and Accounting Principles Board Opinion ("APB") No. 28-1, Instruments ("FSP FAS No. 107-1 and APB 28-1"), which requires that the fair value of financial instruments be disclosed in an entity's interim financial statements, as well as in annual financial statements. The provisions of FSP FAS No. 107-1 and APB 28-1 also require that fair value information be presented with the related carrying value and that the method and significant assumptions used to estimate fair value, as well as changes in method and significant assumptions, be disclosed.
Interim Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial
The provisions of FSP FAS No. 107-1 and APB 28-1 were effective for interim periods ending after June 15, 2009 and were adopted by the Company on August 31, 2009. As the pronouncement only pertains to additional disclosures, the adoption had no effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
 
In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, ("SFAS No. 159"). SFAS No. 159 permits companies, at their election, to measure specified financial instruments and warranty and insurance contracts at fair value on a contract-by-contract basis, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each reporting period. The election, called the "fair value option," will enable some companies to reduce the volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently, and it is easier than using the complex hedge-accounting requirements in SFAS No. 133, , to achieve similar results. Subsequent changes in fair value for designated items will be required to be reported in earnings in the current period. SFAS No. 159 was effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and was therefore effective for the Company beginning in fiscal 2009. The Company adopted SFAS No. 159 on September 1, 2008 and elected not to apply the fair value option, and therefore, the adoption did not have an impact on the Company's results of operations or financial position.
The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, , an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R) ("SFAS No. 158"). SFAS No. 158 requires an employer to: (a) recognize in its statement of financial position the funded status of a benefit plan; (b) measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the end of the employer's fiscal year (with limited exceptions); and (c) recognize as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit costs pursuant to prior existing guidance. The provisions governing recognition of the funded status of a defined benefit plan and related disclosures became effective and were adopted by the Company at the end of fiscal 2007. The requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the employer's fiscal year-end statement of financial position is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008, and was therefore effective for the Company in fiscal 2009. The change in measurement date to August 31 resulted in a reduction to retained earnings of approximately $0.5 million, net of tax.
Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans
In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, ("SFAS No. 157"). SFAS No. 157 establishes a single authoritative definition of fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosure requirements pertaining to fair value measurements. The provisions of SFAS No. 157 related to financial assets and liabilities as well as other assets and liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring basis were effective for the Company on September 1, 2008. The adoption of these provisions of SFAS No. 157 did not have an impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. The provisions of SFAS No. 157 related to other nonfinancial assets and liabilities will be effective for the Company on September 1, 2009. The Company does not expect the adoption of these provisions to have a material impact on its results of operations and financial position.
Fair Value Measurements
Pronouncements Retrospectively Adopted
In June 2008, FASB issued FASB Staff Position ("FSP") No. EITF 03-6-1, ("FSP EITF 03-6-1"). FSP EITF 03-6-1 was issued to clarify that unvested share-based payment awards with a right to receive nonforfeitable dividends are participating securities. FSP EITF 03-6-1 provided guidance on how to allocate earnings to participating securities and compute basic earnings per share ("EPS") using the two-class method. The provisions of this standard were effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years, and were therefore adopted by the Company on September 1, 2009. The implementation of this guidance impacted the Company's EPS calculation; thus, the EPS amounts for previously reported periods have been adjusted due to the retrospective adoption of this standard. The Company's diluted EPS from continuing operations for the years ended August 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, under this guidance are $2.01, $3.51, and $2.89, respectively, as compared to $2.04, $3.57, and $2.93 previously reported for these periods.
Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities
Note 4: Pension and Profit Sharing Plans
Acuity Brands has several pension plans, both qualified and non-qualified, covering certain hourly and salaried employees. Benefits paid under these plans are based generally on employees' years of service and/or compensation during the final years of employment. Acuity Brands makes annual contributions to the plans to the extent indicated by actuarial valuations and required by ERISA or foreign regulatory requirements. Plan assets are invested primarily in equity and fixed income securities.
Effective August 31, 2007, the Company adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 158, ("SFAS No. 158").
Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)
Effective for fiscal 2009, the Company adopted the measurement date provisions of SFAS No. 158, Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R) ("SFAS No. 158"). Prior to 2009, the Company measured the funded status of its plans as of May 31 of each year. The requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the employer's fiscal year-end statement of financial position is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008, and is therefore effective for the Company in fiscal 2009. The change in measurement date to August 31 resulted in a reduction to retained earnings of approximately $0.5 million, net of tax.
 
The following tables reflect the status of Acuity Brands' domestic (U.S. based) and international pension plans at August 31, 2009 and 2008. Activity related to the three-month gap period created by the change in valuation date from May 31 to August 31 is separately identified. The values of the below listed amounts were measured as of August 31, 2009 and August 31, 2008, respectively:
 
The fair value of plan assets associated with certain of the Company's domestic defined benefit plans did not exceed those plans' projected and accumulated benefit obligations in fiscal 2009 and 2008. The projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation, and fair value of plan assets for domestic defined benefit pension plans with both projected and accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were, as of August 31, 2009, $116.8 million, $115.6 million, and $75.3 million, respectively. As of August 31, 2008, the projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation, and fair value of plan assets for domestic defined benefit pension plans with both projected and accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were $90.1 million, $88.2 million, and $71.4 million, respectively. The projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation, and fair value of plan assets for international defined benefit pension plans with both projected and accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were $32.2 million, $29.8 million, and $21.3 million, respectively, as of August 31, 2009, and $35.9 million, $32.9 million, and $26.0 million, respectively, as of August 31, 2008.
Components of net periodic pension cost for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007 included the following:
Weighted average assumptions used in computing the benefit obligation are as follows:
Weighted average assumptions used in computing net periodic benefit cost are as follows:
It is the Company's policy to adjust, on an annual basis, the discount rate used to determine the projected benefit obligation to approximate rates on high-quality, long-term obligations. The Company estimates that each 100 basis point increase in the discount rate would result in reduced net periodic pension cost of approximately $0.8 million for domestic plans. The Company's discount rate used in computing the net periodic benefit cost for its domestic plans increased by 25 basis points in 2009, which contributed to the change in net periodic pension cost associated with those plans. The decrease in service costs associated with the higher discount rate was more than offset by a decrease in expected return on assets due primarily to lower asset balances. The discount rate used in computing the net periodic pension cost for the Company's international plans increased 30 basis points in 2009 over the prior year, resulting in
 
lower service and interest costs. This decrease was more than offset by a lower expected return on plan assets due primarily to lower asset balances, resulting in higher overall periodic benefit costs. The expected return on plan assets is derived from a periodic study of long-term historical rates of return on the various asset classes included in the Company's targeted pension plan asset allocation. The Company estimates that each 100 basis point reduction in the expected return on plan assets would result in additional net periodic pension cost of $0.8 million and $0.2 million for domestic plans and international plans, respectively. The rate of compensation increase is also evaluated and is adjusted by the Company, if necessary, annually.
The Company's investment objective for U.S. plan assets is to earn a rate of return sufficient to match or exceed the long-term growth of the Plans' liabilities without subjecting plan assets to undue risk. The plan assets are invested primarily in high quality equity and debt securities. The Company conducts a periodic strategic asset allocation study to form a basis for the allocation of pension assets between various asset categories. Specific allocation percentages are assigned to each asset category with minimum and maximum ranges established for each. The assets are then managed within these ranges. During 2009, the U.S. targeted asset allocation was 55% equity securities, 40% fixed income securities, and 5% real estate securities. The Company's investment objective for the international plan assets is also to add value by matching or exceeding the long-term growth of the Plans' liabilities. During 2009, the international asset target allocation was 86% equity securities, 12% fixed income securities, and 2% real estate securities.
Acuity Brands' pension plan asset allocation at August 31, 2009 and 2008 by asset category is as follows:
The Company expects to contribute approximately $3.1 million and $1.1 million to its domestic and international defined benefit plans, respectively, during 2010. These amounts are based on the total contributions required during 2010 to satisfy current legal minimum funding requirements for qualified plans and estimated benefit payments for non-qualified plans.
Benefit payments are made primarily from funded benefit plan trusts. Benefit payments are expected to be paid as follows for the years ending August 31:
Acuity Brands also has defined contribution plans to which both employees and the Company make contributions. The cost to Acuity Brands for these plans was $4.3 million in 2009, $5.5 million in 2008, and $5.5 million in 2007. Employer matching amounts are allocated in accordance with the participants' investment elections for elective deferrals. At August 31, 2009, assets of the domestic defined
 
contribution plans included shares of the Company's common stock with a market value of approximately $5.1 million, which represented approximately 2.8% of the total fair market value of the assets in the Company's domestic defined contribution plans.
Note 5: Debt and Lines of Credit
     
Debt
The Company's debt at August 31, 2009 and 2008 consisted of the following:
Future annual principal payments of long-term debt are as follows for fiscal years ending August 31:
Acuity Brands and its principal operating subsidiary, Acuity Brands Lighting, Inc. ("ABL") are the obligors of the $200 million public notes. Because the public notes trade infrequently, it is difficult to obtain an accurate fair market value of the notes. The fair value of the $200 million public notes is estimated to approximate $207.8 million at August 31, 2009, based on the discounted future cash flows using rates currently available for debt of similar terms and maturity. As of August 31, 2009, the public notes were guaranteed by the subsidiary, Acuity Brands Lighting, Inc. The guarantee of the subsidiary was full and unconditional and joint and several. Acuity Brands has no independent assets or operations (as defined by Regulation S-X 3-10(h)(5)), and each subsidiary of Acuity Brands, other than Acuity Brands Lighting, Inc., is "minor" (as defined by Regulation S-X 3-10(h)(6)). Furthermore, there are no significant restrictions on the ability of Acuity Brands or any guarantor to obtain funds from its subsidiaries by dividend or loan.
On April 20, 2009, ABL issued a three-year $30 million 6% unsecured promissory note to the sole shareholder of Sensor Switch, who continued as an employee of the Company upon completion of the acquisition, as partial consideration for the acquisition of Sensor Switch. Scheduled quarterly payments on the note began on July 1, 2009 with the last payment due April 1, 2012. The lender has certain rights to
 
accelerate the promissory note should the Company refinance the $200 million public notes. The fair value of the $27.6 million outstanding balance, which represents the carrying value of the promissory note, is estimated to approximate $28.0 million at August 31, 2009, and is based on the discounted future cash flows using rates currently available for debt of similar terms and maturity.
The $4.0 million industrial revenue bond matures in 2021. The industrial revenue bond is a tax-exempt variable-rate instrument that resets on a weekly basis, and, therefore, the face amount of the bond approximates the fair value amount. The interest rates on the $4.0 million bond were approximately 0.5% and 1.9% at August 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
     
Lines of Credit
On October 19, 2007, the Company executed a $250 million revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Credit Facility"). The Revolving Credit Facility matures in October 2012 and contains financial covenants including a minimum interest coverage ratio and a leverage ratio ("Maximum Leverage Ratio") of total indebtedness to EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization expense), as such terms are defined in the Revolving Credit Facility agreement. These ratios are computed at the end of each fiscal quarter for the most recent 12-month period. The Revolving Credit Facility allows for a Maximum Leverage Ratio of 3.50, subject to certain conditions defined in the financing agreement. The Company was in compliance with all financial covenants and had no outstanding borrowings at August 31, 2009 under the Revolving Credit Facility. At August 31, 2009, the Company had additional borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility of $242.7 million under the most restrictive covenant in effect at the time, which represents the full amount of the Revolving Credit Facility less outstanding letters of credit of $7.3 million discussed below.
The Revolving Credit Facility bears interest at the option of the borrower based upon either (1) the higher of the JPMorganChase Bank prime rate and the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%, or (2) the London Inter Bank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus the Applicable Margin (a margin as determined by Acuity Brands' leverage ratio). Based upon Acuity Brands' leverage ratio, as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility agreement, the Applicable Margin was 0.41% as of both August 31, 2009 and 2008. During both fiscal 2009 and 2008, commitment fees were computed at a rate of approximately 0.1%, and commitment fees paid during each of those years were approximately $0.2 million.
At August 31, 2009, the Company had outstanding letters of credit totaling $11.5 million, primarily for the purpose of securing collateral requirements under the casualty insurance programs for Acuity Brands and for providing credit support for the Company's industrial revenue bond. At August 31, 2009, a total of $7.3 million of the letters of credit were issued under the Revolving Credit Facility, thereby reducing the total availability under the facility by such amount.
None of the Company's existing debt instruments, neither short-term nor long-term, include provisions that would require an acceleration of repayments based solely on changes in the Company's credit ratings.
Note 6: Common Stock and Related Matters
     
Stockholder Protection Rights Agreement
The Company's Board of Directors has adopted a Stockholder Protection Rights Agreement (the "Rights Agreement"). The Rights Agreement contains provisions that are intended to protect the Company's stockholders in the event of an unsolicited offer to acquire the Company, including offers that do not treat all stockholders equally and other coercive, unfair, or inadequate takeover bids and practices that could impair the ability of the Company's Board of Directors to fully represent stockholders' interests. Pursuant to the Rights Agreement, the Company's Board of Directors declared a dividend of one "Right" for each outstanding share of the Company's common stock as of November 16, 2001. The Rights will be
 
represented by, and trade together with, the Company's common stock until and unless certain events occur, including the acquisition of 15% or more of the Company's common stock by a person or group of affiliated or associated persons (with certain exceptions, "Acquiring Persons"). Unless previously redeemed by the Company's Board of Directors, upon the occurrence of one of the specified triggering events, each Right that is not held by an Acquiring Person will entitle its holder to purchase one share of common stock or, under certain circumstances, additional shares of common stock at a discounted price. The Rights will cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire the Company on terms not approved by the Company's Board of Directors. Thus, the Rights are intended to encourage persons who may seek to acquire control of the Company to initiate such an acquisition through negotiation with the Board of Directors.
     
Common Stock
Changes in common stock for the years ended August 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007 were as follows:
Since October 2005, the Company's Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of ten million shares of the Company's outstanding common stock. At August 31, 2009, the Company had repurchased 9.5 million shares at a cost of $395.5 million. During fiscal 2009, the Company re-issued 2.1 million shares as partial consideration for the acquisitions of Sensor Switch, Inc. and Lighting Controls & Design. The re-issued shares were removed from treasury stock using the FIFO cost method. At fiscal year-end, the remaining 7.4 million repurchased shares were recorded as treasury stock at original repurchase cost of $322.3 million.
     
Preferred Stock
The Company has 50 million shares of preferred stock authorized, 5 million of which have been reserved for issuance under the Stockholder Protection Rights Agreement. No shares of preferred stock had been issued at August 31, 2009 and 2008.
     
Earnings per Share
The Company computes earnings per share in accordance with SFAS No. 128, . Under this Statement, basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, which has been modified to include the effects of all participating securities (unvested share-based payment awards with a right to receive nonforfeitable dividends) as prescribed by the retrospective adoption of the two-class method under FSP EITF 03-6-1. Diluted earnings per share is computed similarly but reflects the potential dilution that would occur if dilutive options were exercised and restricted stock awards were vested. Stock options and restricted stock awards of 333,852 and 509,531, respectively, were excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation for the year ended August 31, 2009, as the effect of inclusion would have been antidilutive.
Earnings per Share
 
The following table calculates basic earnings per common share and diluted earnings per common share for the years ended August 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007:
Note 7: Share-Based Payments
Long-term Incentive and Directors' Equity Plans
Effective November 30, 2001, Acuity Brands adopted the Acuity Brands, Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "Plan") for the benefit of officers and other key management personnel. An aggregate of 8.1 million shares was originally authorized for issuance under that plan. In October 2003, the Board of Directors approved the Acuity Brands, Inc. Amended and Restated Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "Amended Plan"), including an increase of 5.0 million in the number of shares available for grant. However, the Board of Directors subsequently committed that not more than 3.0 million would be available without further shareholder approval. In December 2003, the shareholders approved the Amended Plan. The Amended Plan provides for issuance of share-based awards, including stock options and performance-based and time-based restricted stock awards. The Amended Plan was further amended in October 2007, including the release of the remaining 2.0 million shares and an increase of an additional 500,000 shares. In January 2008, the shareholders approved the Amended Plan. In addition to the Amended Plan, in November 2001, the Company adopted the Acuity Brands, Inc. 2001 Nonemployee Directors' Stock Option Plan (the "Directors' Plan"), under which 300,000 shares were authorized for issuance. In January 2007, the Directors' Plan was amended to provide that no further annual grants of stock options would be made to nonemployee directors.
     
Restricted Stock Awards
As of August 31, 2009, the Company had approximately 683,000 shares outstanding of restricted stock to officers and other key employees under the Amended Plan. The shares vest over a four-year period
 
and are valued at the closing stock price on the date of the grant. Compensation expense recognized in continuing operations related to the awards under the Amended Plan was $9.0 million, $8.2 million, and $7.0 million in fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. The Company incurred expenses related to the restricted stock held by current and former employees of the Company and Zep at the time of the Spin-off. Compensation expense related to these awards was recognized in discontinued operations and amounted to $1.8 million in fiscal 2007.
Additionally, the Company awarded restricted stock to certain employees on an individual basis based on a number of factors, including individual achievements, additional job responsibilities, relocation, and employee recruitment and retention, in fiscal 2009 and prior years. As of August 31, 2009, approximately 231,000 shares related to these awards were outstanding. Compensation expense recognized in continuing operations related to these awards was $1.6 million, $1.4 million, and $1.1 million in fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. Compensation expense recognized in discontinued operations related to these awards was $0.4 million in fiscal 2007.
Activity related to restricted stock awards during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2009 was as follows:
As of August 31, 2009, there was $29.0 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.4 years. The total fair value of shares vested during the years ended August 31, 2009 and 2008, was approximately $9.3 million and $17.8 million, respectively.
     
Stock Options
Options issued under the Plan are generally granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the Company's stock on the date of grant and expire 10 years from the date of grant. These options generally vest and become exercisable over a three-year period. The stock options granted under the Directors' Plan vest and become exercisable one year from the date of grant. These options have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the Company's stock on the date of the grant and expire 10 years from that date. As of August 31, 2009, approximately 120,000 shares had been granted under the Director's Plan. Shares available for grant under all plans were approximately 3.2 million at August 31, 2009. Shares available for grant under all plans were approximately 3.8 million and 1.7 million at August 31, 2008 and 2007. Forfeited shares and shares that are exchanged to offset taxes are returned to the pool of shares available for grant. The Director Stock Option Plan was frozen with respect to future awards effective January 1, 2007.
The fair value of each option was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes model. The dividend yield was calculated based on annual dividends paid and the trailing 12-month average closing stock price at the time of grant. Expected volatility was based on historical volatility of the Company's stock, calculated using the most recent time period equal to the expected life of the options. The risk-free interest rate was based on the U.S. Treasury yield for a term equal to the expected life of the options at the time of grant. The Company used historical exercise behavior data of similar employee groups to
 
determine the expected life of options. All inputs into the Black-Scholes model are estimates made at the time of grant. Actual realized value of each option grant could materially differ from these estimates, without impact to future reported net income.
The following weighted average assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of stock options granted in the fiscal years ended August 31:
In addition to the options granted as a part of the annual incentive award, the Board of Directors approved a supplemental option grant related to the assumption of additional duties by certain executives and key employees which was granted in April 2009. As a result, the assumptions used in 2009 are reflected as a range of values.
Stock option transactions for the stock option plans and stock option agreements during the years ended August 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007 were as follows:
The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended August 31, 2009 and 2008 was $5.6 million and $9.7 million, respectively. As of August 31, 2009, the total intrinsic value of options outstanding and expected to vest were each $14.8 million, and the total intrinsic value of options exercisable was $14.0 million. As of August 31, 2009, there was $2.9 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested options. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.7 years.
 
     
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
Employees are able to purchase, through payroll deduction, common stock at a 5% discount on a monthly basis. There were 1.5 million shares of the Company's common stock reserved for purchase under the plan, of which approximately 1.1 million shares remain available as of August 31, 2009. Employees may participate at their discretion.
     
Share Units
The Company requires its Directors to defer at least 50% of their annual retainer into the Directors' Deferred Compensation Plan. Under this plan, until June 29, 2006, the deferred cash was converted into share units using the average of the high and low prices for the five days prior to the deferral date. The share units were adjusted to current market value each month and earned dividend equivalents. Upon retirement, the Company distributed cash to the retiree in a lump sum or five annual installments. The distribution amount was calculated as share units times the average of the high and low prices for the five days prior to distribution (defined as "fair market value" in the Directors' Deferred Compensation Plan). On June 29, 2006, the Board of Directors amended this plan to convert existing share units and future deferrals to cash-based, interest bearing deferrals at fair market value or stock-based deferrals, with distribution only in the elected form upon retirement. Existing share deferrals were valued at the fair market value at the date of election and future share deferrals will be calculated at fair market value at the date of the deferral and will no longer vary with fluctuations in the Company's stock price. As of August 31, 2009, approximately 175,000 share units were accounted for in this plan.
Additionally, the Company allowed employees to defer a portion of restricted stock awards granted in fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2004 into the Supplemental Deferred Savings Plan as share units. Those share units were adjusted to the current market value at the end of each month. On June 29, 2006, the Board of Directors amended this plan to distribute those share unit deferrals in stock rather than cash. The shares were valued at the closing stock price on the date of conversion and expense related to these shares will no longer vary with fluctuations in the Company's stock price. As of August 31, 2009 approximately 60,000 fully vested share units were accounted for in this plan.
     
Treatment of Stock Options, Restricted Stock Awards, and Restricted Stock Units pursuant to the Spin-off of Zep
The employee benefits agreement entered into between Acuity Brands, Inc. and Zep Inc. provided that at the time of the Spin-off, Acuity Brands stock options held by Zep's current employees (but not former employees) were generally converted to, and replaced by, Zep stock options in accordance with a conversion ratio such that the intrinsic value of the underlying awards remains unaffected by the Spin-off. The employee benefits agreement also provided that, at the time of the Spin-off, Acuity Brands stock options held by current and former Acuity Brands employees and former Zep employees were adjusted with regard to the exercise price of and number of Acuity Brands shares underlying the Acuity Brands stock options to maintain the intrinsic value of the options, pursuant to the applicable Acuity Brands long-term incentive plan.
Each of the current and former employees of Acuity Brands and Zep holding unvested shares of restricted stock of Acuity Brands received a dividend of one share of Zep restricted stock for each two shares of Acuity Brands unvested restricted stock held. The shares of Zep stock received as a dividend are subject to the same restrictions and terms as the Acuity Brands restricted stock. The shares of Zep common stock were fully paid and non-assessable and the holders thereof are not entitled to preemptive rights.
Effective immediately after the Spin-off of the specialty products business, the number of shares represented by restricted stock units were converted in the same manner as the above mentioned stock option awards.
 
Note 8: Commitments and Contingencies
     
Self-Insurance
It is the policy of Acuity Brands to self-insure, up to certain limits, traditional risks including workers' compensation, comprehensive general liability, and auto liability. The Company's self-insured retention for each claim involving workers' compensation, comprehensive general liability (including product liability claims), and auto liability is limited to $0.5 million per occurrence of such claims. A provision for claims under this self-insured program, based on the Company's estimate of the aggregate liability for claims incurred, is revised and recorded annually. The estimate is derived from both internal and external sources including but not limited to the Company's independent actuary. Acuity Brands is also self-insured up to certain limits for certain other insurable risks, primarily physical loss to property ($0.5 million per occurrence) and business interruptions resulting from such loss lasting three days or more in duration. Insurance coverage is maintained for catastrophic property and casualty exposures as well as those risks required to be insured by law or contract. Acuity Brands is fully self-insured for certain other types of liabilities, including employment practices, environmental, product recall, and patent infringement. The actuarial estimates are subject to uncertainty from various sources, including, among others, changes in claim reporting patterns, claim settlement patterns, judicial decisions, legislation, and economic conditions. Although Acuity Brands believes that the actuarial estimates are reasonable, significant differences related to the items noted above could materially affect the Company's self-insurance obligations, future expense and cash flow. The Company is also self-insured for the majority of its medical benefit plans. The Company estimates its aggregate liability for claims incurred by applying a lag factor to the Company's historical claims and administrative cost experience. The appropriateness of the Company's lag factor is evaluated and revised annually, as necessary.
     
Leases
Acuity Brands leases certain of its buildings and equipment under noncancelable lease agreements. Minimum lease payments under noncancelable leases for years subsequent to August 31, 2009, are $14.4 million, $12.7 million, $9.3 million, $6.0 million, $3.0 million, and $3.1 million for fiscal 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and after 2015, respectively.
Total rent expense was $18.2 million, $18.8 million, and $18.7 million in fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively.
     
Purchase Obligations
The Company has incurred purchase obligations in the ordinary course of business that are enforceable and legally binding. Obligations for years subsequent to August 31, 2009 include $81.7 million and $0.6 million in fiscal 2010 and 2011, respectively. As of August 31, 2009, the Company had no purchase obligations extending beyond August 31, 2011.
     
Collective Bargaining Agreements
Approximately 57% of the Company's total work force is covered by collective bargaining agreements. Collective bargaining agreements representing approximately 34% of the Company's work force will expire within one year.
     
Litigation
Acuity Brands is subject to various legal claims arising in the normal course of business, including patent infringement and product liability claims. Acuity Brands is self-insured up to specified limits for certain types of claims, including product liability, and is fully self-insured for certain other types of claims,
 
including environmental, product recall, and patent infringement. Based on information currently available, it is the opinion of management that the ultimate resolution of pending and threatened legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows of Acuity Brands. However, in the event of unexpected future developments, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of any such matters, if unfavorable, could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows of Acuity Brands in future periods. Acuity Brands establishes reserves for legal claims when the costs associated with the claims become probable and can be reasonably estimated. The actual costs of resolving legal claims may be substantially higher than the amounts reserved for such claims. However, the Company cannot make a meaningful estimate of actual costs to be incurred that could possibly be higher or lower than the amounts reserved.
     
Environmental Matters
The operations of the Company are subject to numerous comprehensive laws and regulations relating to the generation, storage, handling, transportation, and disposal of hazardous substances, as well as solid and hazardous wastes, and to the remediation of contaminated sites. In addition, permits and environmental controls are required for certain of the Company's operations to limit air and water pollution, and these permits are subject to modification, renewal, and revocation by issuing authorities. On an ongoing basis, Acuity Brands invests capital and incurs operating costs relating to environmental compliance. Environmental laws and regulations have generally become stricter in recent years. The cost of responding to future changes may be substantial. Acuity Brands establishes reserves for known environmental claims when the costs associated with the claims become probable and can be reasonably estimated. The actual cost of environmental issues may be substantially higher or lower than that reserved due to difficulty in estimating such costs.
     
Guarantees and Indemnities
The Company is a party to contracts entered into in the normal course of business in which it is common for the Company to agree to indemnify third parties for certain liabilities that may arise out of or relate to the subject matter of the contract. In most cases, the Company cannot estimate the potential amount of future payments under these indemnities until events arise that would result in a liability under the indemnities. In connection with the sale of assets and the divestiture of businesses, the Company has from time to time agreed to indemnify the purchaser from liabilities relating to events occurring prior to the sale and conditions existing at the time of the sale. The indemnities generally include potential environmental liabilities, general representations and warranties concerning the asset or business, and certain other liabilities not assumed by the purchaser. Indemnities associated with the divestiture of businesses are generally limited in amount to the sales price of the specific business or are based on a lower negotiated amount and expire at various times, depending on the nature of the indemnified matter, but in some cases do not expire until the applicable statute of limitations expires. The Company does not believe that any amounts that it may be required to pay under these indemnities will be material to the Company's results of operations, financial position, or cash flow.
In conjunction with the separation of their businesses (the "Distribution"), Acuity Brands and Zep entered into various agreements that addressed the allocation of assets and liabilities and defined the Company's relationship with Zep after the Distribution, including a distribution agreement and a tax disaffiliation agreement. The distribution agreement provides that Acuity Brands will indemnify Zep for liabilities related to the businesses that comprise Acuity Brands. The tax disaffiliation agreement provides that Acuity Brands will indemnify Zep for certain taxes and liabilities that may arise related to the Distribution and, generally, for deficiencies, if any, with respect to federal, state, local, or foreign taxes of Zep for periods before the Distribution. Liabilities determined under the tax disaffiliation agreement terminate upon the expiration of the applicable statutes of limitation for such liabilities. There is no stated maximum potential liability included in the tax disaffiliation agreement or the distribution agreement. The Company does not
 
believe that any amounts it is likely to be required to pay under these indemnities will be material to the Company's results of operations, financial position, or liquidity. The Company cannot estimate the potential amount of future payments under these indemnities because claims that would result in a liability under the indemnities are not fully known.
     
Product Warranty and Recall Costs
Acuity Brands records an allowance for the estimated amount of future warranty claims when the related revenue is recognized, primarily based on historical experience of identified warranty claims. However, there can be no assurance that future warranty costs will not exceed historical experience. If actual future warranty costs exceed historical amounts, additional allowances may be required, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company's results of operations and cash flows in future periods.
The changes in product warranty and recall reserves (included in on the during the fiscal years ended August 31, 2009 and 2008 are summarized as follows:
Other accrued liabilities
Consolidated Balance Sheets)
The decrease in the product warranty and recall reserve in fiscal 2009 was due primarily to reserves for certain specifically identified issues and warranty costs related to faulty components provided by third parties during fiscal 2008 which was not repeated in fiscal 2009.
Note 9: Special Charge
     
Fiscal 2009 Special Charge
On October 6, 2008, the Company announced plans to accelerate its ongoing programs to streamline operations including the consolidation of certain manufacturing facilities and the reduction of certain overhead costs. These actions are expected to allow the Company to better leverage efficiencies in its supply chain and support areas, while funding continued investments in other areas that support future growth opportunities. During fiscal 2009, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $26.7 million, or $0.40 per diluted share. The $26.7 million pre-tax charge consists of $25.6 million for estimated severances and employee benefits as well as estimated retention payments related to the previously announced consolidation of certain manufacturing operations and reductions in workforce and a $1.6 million impairment of assets related to the closing of a manufacturing facility, partially offset by a $0.5 million adjustment to the fiscal 2008 special charge.
The changes in the reserves related to the 2009 program during the twelve months ended August 31, 2009 are summarized as follows:
 
     
Fiscal 2008 Special Charge
During fiscal 2008, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $14.6 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, for actions to streamline and simplify the Company's organizational structure and operations as a result of the Spin-off of Zep Inc. The charge consisted of severance and related employee benefit costs associated with the elimination of certain positions worldwide, the estimated costs associated with the early termination of certain leases, and $0.8 million of share-based expense due to the modification of the terms of agreements to accelerate vesting for certain terminated employees.
The changes in the reserves related to these programs during the twelve months ended August 31, 2009 are summarized as follows:
Note 10: Acquisitions
On April 20, 2009, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding capital stock of Sensor Switch, an industry-leading developer and manufacturer of lighting controls and energy management systems. Sensor Switch, based in Wallingford, Connecticut, offers a wide-breadth of products and solutions that substantially reduce energy consumption including occupancy sensors, photocontrols, and distributed lighting control devices. Total consideration for the purchase was approximately $205 million consisting of 2 million shares of Acuity Brands' common stock, a $30 million unsecured promissory note payable over three years, and approximately $130 million of cash. The cash payment was funded from available cash on hand and from borrowings under the Company's existing Revolving Credit Facility. The operating results of Sensor Switch have been included in the Company's consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition. Management finalized the purchase price allocation during fiscal 2009 and the amounts are reflected in the as of August 31, 2009. Pro forma results and other expanded disclosures required by SFAS No. 141, ("SFAS No. 141"), have not been presented as the purchase of Sensor Switch does not represent a material acquisition.

Note 11: Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability approach as prescribed by SFAS No. 109, ("SFAS No. 109"). This approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse, deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of an asset or liability.
Accounting for Income Taxes
The provision for income taxes consists of the following components:
A reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the total provision for income taxes is as follows:
 
Components of the net deferred income tax asset at August 31, 2009 and net deferred tax liability at August 31, 2008 include:
Acuity Brands currently intends to indefinitely reinvest all undistributed earnings of and original investments in foreign subsidiaries, which amounted to approximately $30.2 million at August 31, 2009; however, this amount could fluctuate due to changes in business, economic, or other conditions. If these earnings were distributed to the U.S. in the form of dividends or otherwise, or if the shares of the relevant foreign subsidiaries were sold or otherwise transferred, the Company would be subject to additional U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits) and foreign withholding taxes. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liability related to these earnings or investments is not practicable.
At August 31, 2009 and August 31, 2008, no valuation allowances on deferred tax assets were deemed necessary. Typically, these allowances are required to reflect the net realizable value of state tax credit carryforwards.
At August 31, 2009 the Company has state tax credit carryforwards of approximately $0.5 million, which will expire between 2013 and 2018.
As described in Note 3  , Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 48, ("FIN 48"), is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006 and was adopted by the Company on September 1, 2007. The cumulative effect of adopting FIN 48 was not material. The amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits as of the date of the adoption was approximately $6.9 million of which approximately $5.7 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. The gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of August 31, 2009 totaled $7.2 million, which includes $5.9 million of net unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the annual effective tax rate. The Company recognizes potential interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense; such accrued interest and penalties are not material. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to United States federal, state and local income tax examinations for years ended before 2006 or for foreign income tax examinations before 2004. The Company does not anticipate unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes  an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109
 
A reconciliation of the change in the unrecognized income tax benefit reported in Other long-term liabilities for the year ended August 31, 2009 is as follows:
During fiscal 2009, the Company decreased its interest accrual associated with uncertain tax positions by approximately $0.1 million. Total accrued interest as of August 31, 2009 was $0.9 million. There were no penalty accruals during fiscal 2009. Interest, net of tax benefit, and penalties are included in tax expense. The classification of interest and penalties did not change as a result of our adoption of FIN 48.
Note 12: Subsequent Events
The Company has evaluated subsequent events for recognition and disclosure through October 29, 2009, which is the date the financial statements as of August 31, 2009 and for the twelve months ended August 31, 2009 were issued.
Note 13: Fair Value Measurements
In accordance with SFAS No. 157, Acuity Brands determines a fair value measurement based on the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing an asset or liability. SFAS No. 157 established a three level hierarchy making a distinction between market participant assumptions based on (i) unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market (Level 1), (ii) quoted prices in markets that are not active or inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the asset or liability (Level 2), and (iii) prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement (Level 3). The following table presents information about assets and liabilities required to be carried at fair value on a recurring basis as of August 31, 2009:
 
Note: Fair value information on assets and liabilities not carried at fair value are included in Note 2 for Investments in nonconsolidating affiliates and Note 5 for Debt.
 
The Company utilizes valuation methodologies to determine the fair values of its financial assets and liabilities in conformity with the concepts of "exit price" and the fair value hierarchy as prescribed in SFAS No. 157. All valuation methods and assumptions are validated at least quarterly to ensure the accuracy and relevance of the fair values. There were no material changes to the valuation methods or assumptions used to determine fair values during the current period.
The following valuation methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating the fair value of the following assets and liabilities:
Cash and cash equivalents are classified as Level 1 assets. The carrying amounts for cash reflect the assets' fair values, and the fair values for cash equivalents are determined based on quoted market prices.
Long-term investments are classified as Level 1 assets. These investments consist primarily of publicly traded marketable equity securities and fixed income securities, and the fair values are obtained through market observable pricing.
Deferred compensation plan liabilities are classified as Level 1 within the hierarchy. The fair values of the liabilities are directly related to the valuation of the long-term investments held in trust for the plan. Hence, the carrying value of the deferred compensation liability represents the fair value of the investment assets.
The Company does not possess any assets or liabilities that are carried at fair value on a recurring basis classified as Level 3 assets or liabilities.
Note 14: Geographic Information
The Company has one operating segment. The geographic distribution of the Company's net sales, operating profit, income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes, and long-lived assets is summarized in the following table for the years ended August 31:
 
 
Note 15: Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited)
 
Note 16: Supplemental Guarantor Condensed Consolidating Financial Statements
In December 2009, Acuity Brands Lighting, Inc. ("ABL"), the wholly-owned and principal operating subsidiary of the Company, engaged in the refinancing of the current debt outstanding through a private placement bond offering of $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due in fiscal 2020 (the "Notes"). The net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes were used primarily to repurchase the $200.0 million of publicly traded notes outstanding, of which Acuity Brands and ABL were co-obligors. The Company also used the proceeds to repay the three-year unsecured promissory note at 6% interest with an outstanding balance of $25.3 million in January 2010 that was issued to the former sole shareholder of Sensor Switch as part of the Company's acquisition of Sensor Switch during fiscal 2009, with the remainder used for general corporate purposes. The Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by Acuity Brands and ABL IP Holding LLC ("ABL IP Holding"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Acuity Brands (collectively, the "Guarantors"). The Notes are senior unsecured obligations of ABL and rank equally in right of payment with all of ABL's existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness. The guarantees are senior unsecured obligations of the Guarantors and rank equally in right of payment with their other senior unsecured indebtedness. The Notes bear interest at a rate of 6% per annum and were issued at a price equal to 99.797% of their face value and for a term of 10 years. Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually on June 15 and December 15, commencing on June 15, 2010.
In accordance with the registration rights agreement by and between ABL and the Guarantors and the initial purchases of the Notes, ABL and the Guarantors to the Notes expect to file a registration statement with the SEC for an offer to exchange the Notes for an issue of SEC-registered notes with identical terms. If the exchange offer is not completed on or before December 8, 2010, the annual interest rate borne by the Notes will increase by 0.50% per annum until the exchange offer is completed or a shelf registration statement is declared effective. In anticipation of the filing of the registration statement and offer to exchange, the Company determined the need for compliance with Rule 3-10 of SEC Regulation S-X ("Rule 3-10"). In lieu of providing separate audited
 
financial statements for ABL and ABL IP Holding, the Company has included the accompanying Condensed Consolidating Financial Statements in accordance with Rule 3-10(d) of SEC Regulation S-X. The column marked "Parent" represents the financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows of Acuity Brands. The column marked "Subsidiary Issuer" represents the financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows of ABL and Sensor Switch, which was legally merged into ABL on September 1, 2009. The column entitled "Subsidiary Guarantor" represents the financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows of ABL IP Holding. Lastly, the column listed as "Non-Guarantors" includes the financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows of the non-guarantor direct and indirect subsidiaries of Acuity Brands, which consist primarily of foreign subsidiaries. Eliminations were necessary in order to arrive at consolidated amounts. In addition, the equity method of accounting was used to calculate investments in subsidiaries. Accordingly, this basis of presentation is not intended to present our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows for any purpose other than to comply with the specific requirements for parent-subsidiary guarantor reporting.
Note: Intercompany payable (receivable) within the non-guarantors column primarily represents intercompany transactions between ABL and its direct subsidiary, Acuity Unlimited, Inc ("Acuity Unlimited"). The equity interest in Acuity Unlimited offsets this receivable. As no operating activity currently exists, Acuity Unlimited will issue a dividend and a return of capital in the amount of the capital investment made by ABL and settle the intercompany balance outstanding during fiscal 2010. The dividend and the return of capital will reduce intercompany receivable and total equity for the non-guarantors column by approximately $230.0 million and fully eliminate all Acuity Unlimited balance sheet amounts. ABL expects to experience equal reductions in investments in subsidiaries and net intercompany payables.

ATLANTA, July 8, 2010 (BUSINESS WIRE)  Acuity Brands, Inc. (NYSE: AYI) ("Company") today announced that the Board of Directors of Acuity Brands authorized the repurchase of an additional 2,000,000 shares, or almost 5%, of the Company's outstanding common stock. Also, the Company has authorization to buy back the remaining 512,300 shares of outstanding common stock under its previously announced repurchase program.
Under the share repurchase programs, the Company expects to acquire shares primarily through open market transactions, subject to market conditions and other factors. The Company may enter into Rule 10b5-1 plans to facilitate open market repurchases under the programs.

Shares repurchased under the programs may be retired or used for general corporate purposes, which may include the Company's share-based compensation and employee benefit plans.
Mr. Nagel commented, "The Board's approval of this additional share repurchase program is a reflection of our confidence in the Company's future and its ability to continue to generate strong cash flow from operations. We believe that the repurchase program supports Acuity Brands' objective to maximize long-term stockholder value, while continuing to fund investments to better serve our customers, to grow our businesses, and to improve our operating and financial performance."

Exhibit 99.1
(404) 853-1423
Company Contact: Dan Smith Acuity Brands, Inc.
ATLANTA, October 6, 2010  Acuity Brands, Inc. (NYSE: AYI) ("Company") today announced fiscal 2010 fourth quarter net sales of $444.1 million, a 5 percent increase compared with the year-ago period. Fiscal 2010 fourth quarter income from continuing operations was $27.2 million compared with $29.1 million for the prior-year period. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 were $0.62 compared with $0.66 for the prior year. The results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 include a $3.3 million pre-tax special charge, or $0.05 per diluted share. The special charge related to streamlining activities and non-cash asset impairments as explained below. Excluding special charges in both periods, adjusted diluted EPS for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 was $0.67 compared with $0.66 for the prior-year period.
Operating profit was $48.0 million and $49.9 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively. Excluding the special charges for both periods, adjusted operating profit for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 was $51.3 million, or 11.5 percent of net sales, compared with the prior year's adjusted operating profit of $50.0 million, or 11.8 percent of net sales.
Mr. Nagel, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Acuity Brands, commented, "We are very pleased with our fiscal 2010 fourth quarter results as we continue to execute extremely well in a challenging environment. We achieved unit volume growth while non-residential construction continued to decline. I believe this is strong evidence that the execution of our strategies to extend our leadership position in North America is succeeding. These strategies include continued introduction of new, more energy-efficient lighting products and solutions, expansion in key geographies and important channels, and further gains in productivity. Our profitability and cash flow were similarly strong while we continued to invest heavily in a number of areas with significant growth potential."
 
The year-over-year growth in fiscal fourth quarter net sales was due primarily to a 6 percent increase in unit volume, partially offset by unfavorable changes in both selling prices in certain channels and geographies and the mix of products sold. The increase in unit volume occurred in key product areas, such as lighting control devices and energy-efficient luminaires, and in key channels, such as renovation and home improvement, all of which helped to offset declines in other sectors of the non-residential construction market, particularly commercial and office buildings.
Fiscal 2010 fourth quarter gross profit margin increased 240 basis points to 41.5 percent compared with 39.1 percent for the prior-year period. The increase was due primarily to higher sales volume, favorable year-over-year material and component costs, and productivity improvements. Partially offsetting these positive contributions were unfavorable pricing and mix of products sold as well as higher pension and transportation costs. Selling, distribution and administrative ("SD&A") expenses for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 increased to $133.1 million compared with $115.4 million in the prior-year period. Fiscal 2010 fourth quarter SD&A expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 270 basis points year-over-year to 30.0 percent. More than 75 percent of the increase was attributable to higher incentive compensation expense and higher commission and freight costs to support the additional sales volume. The remainder of the increase was due to structurally higher operating costs associated with acquired businesses, acquisition costs, and increased investments in key areas of the business for new product introductions and renovation, partially offset by savings realized from previous streamlining actions.
Fiscal 2010 fourth quarter results include a $3.3 million special charge which consists of a $1.7 million non-cash expense for asset impairments primarily associated with the write-down of the value of a closed facility, as well as $1.6 million of employee severance and benefits costs related to streamlining actions, including actions associated with the recent acquisition of Renaissance Lighting.
Fiscal 2010 Results
Fiscal 2010 net sales were $1,626.9 million compared with $1,657.4 million for the prior-year period, a decrease of 2 percent. Operating profit for fiscal 2010 was $157.7 million compared with $153.8 million for the prior year. Excluding the special charges for streamlining activities, adjusted operating profit for fiscal 2010 was $166.1 million, or 10.2 percent of net sales, compared with $180.5 million, or 10.9 percent of net sales, for the prior year. Income from
 
continuing operations for fiscal 2010 was $79.0 million compared with $85.2 million for fiscal 2009. Excluding the impact of special charges for streamlining activities in both periods and the loss associated with the early retirement of debt, which was incurred in the second quarter of fiscal 2010, adjusted income from continuing operations for fiscal 2010 was $91.3 million, a decrease of 10 percent compared with $102.0 million for fiscal 2009. Diluted EPS from continuing operations for fiscal 2010 and 2009 were $1.79 and $2.01, respectively. Excluding the impact of special charges for streamlining activities and the loss associated with the early retirement of debt, adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations for fiscal 2010 were $2.08, compared with $2.41 for fiscal 2009.
Cash and cash equivalents at August 31, 2010 totaled $191 million, an increase of $172 million since the beginning of the fiscal year. For fiscal 2010, the Company generated $139 million in free cash flow (defined as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant, and equipment.) Additionally, during fiscal 2010 net proceeds from debt refinancing activities provided $109 million, partially offset by payments of $23 million for acquisitions and strategic investments, $23 million for dividends to stockholders, and $36 million for stock repurchases. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, the Company repurchased over 1 million shares, or 2 percent, of its outstanding common stock. The Company's debt to total capitalization ratio (calculated by dividing total debt by the sum of total debt and total stockholders' equity) was 34% at August 31, 2010. The ratio of debt, net of cash, to total capitalization, net of cash, was 19% at August 31, 2010.
Outlook
Mr. Nagel commented, "Key economic indicators and independent third-party forecasts, while a bit mixed, suggest activity to be slightly down to flat for our primary market, U.S. non-residential construction, for our fiscal 2011. This more neutral outlook is in contrast to the stiff headwinds our industry faced over the last few years. We believe demand outlook for lighting fixtures and controls should benefit from the growing interest for renovation of commercial and institutional buildings and outdoor lighting for energy savings and sustainability.
"We believe the Company is well positioned to fully participate in the renovation opportunity, as well as the resurgence of new construction. We continue to make investments to create more innovative and energy-efficient lighting fixtures, controls and software that can be sold separately or configured into systems which provide improved energy efficiency and a better lighting environment. Complete lighting systems will likely become an integral part of the "smart
 
building" energy management development. Also, we continue to invest in extending our market presence in the growing renovation sector. While these investments will likely continue to negatively affect our short-term profitability, we believe they will position the Company so that it can continue to outperform the market over the longer-term.
"We remain cautious about the potential for increases in material and component costs, and we will be as vigilant as possible in our pricing strategies to protect our margins and market position. Notwithstanding efforts to recoup higher costs, we anticipate pricing will continue to be competitive. We expect savings from previous streamlining actions to provide almost $10 million of incremental savings in fiscal 2011. We intend to invest up to $40 million in capital expenditures during fiscal 2011, and we estimate our annual tax rate to be approximately 34 percent for the year."
Mr. Nagel concluded, "Looking beyond the current environment, we believe the lighting and lighting-related industry will experience solid growth over the next decade, particularly as energy and environmental concerns come to the forefront, and we believe we are well positioned to fully participate in this exciting industry."
The Company's independent registered public accountants' audit opinion with respect to the fiscal year-end financial statements will not be issued until the Company completes its annual report on Form 10-K, including its evaluation of internal controls over financial reporting. Accordingly, the financial results reported in this earnings release are preliminary pending completion of the audit. In addition, the classification of the purchase price allocation for the recent acquisition of Renaissance Lighting remains subject to finalization.
Accounting Standards Adopted in Fiscal 2010
Included in the accounting standards that the Company adopted in fiscal 2010 was the two-class method as required under ASC 260  "Earnings Per Share" (EPS). The two-class method is an earnings allocation method for computing EPS when a company's capital structure includes two or more classes of common stock or common stock and participating securities; EPS is determined based on dividends declared on common stock and participating securities and participation rights of participating securities in any undistributed earnings. EPS is reduced as a result of including the participating securities in the calculation of EPS. The adoption of the two-class method reduced diluted EPS from continuing operations for the fiscal 2009 fourth quarter and full-year by $0.02 and $0.04, respectively.
 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Acuity Brands' management included in the above news release the terms "adjusted operating profit", "adjusted operating profit margin", "adjusted income from continuing operations", and "adjusted diluted EPS" which are non-GAAP financial measures provided to enhance the user's overall understanding of the Company's current financial performance and prospects for the future. Specifically, management believes that adjusted operating profit, adjusted operating profit margin, adjusted income from continuing operations, and adjusted diluted EPS provide useful information to investors by excluding or adjusting items related to (a) streamlining and manufacturing consolidation activities which affected the Company's reported operating results in fiscal 2009 and 2010 and (b) the loss on the early retirement of debt which affected fiscal 2010 income and diluted EPS. Management believes these special items impacted the comparability of the Company's results and that these items are not reflective of fixed costs that the Company will incur over the long term. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, results prepared in accordance with GAAP. The most directly comparable GAAP measure for adjusted operating profit and adjusted operating profit margin are "operating profit" and "operating profit margin", respectively, which include the impact of streamlining and manufacturing consolidation activities. The most directly comparable GAAP measures for adjusted income from continuing operations and adjusted diluted EPS are "income from continuing operations" and "diluted EPS," respectively; both GAAP measures include the impact of special charges and the loss on early retirement of debt. The non-GAAP financial measures included in this news release have been reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure.

(404) 853-1423
Company Contact: Dan Smith Acuity Brands, Inc.
ATLANTA, January 10, 2011  Acuity Brands, Inc. (NYSE: AYI) ("Company") today announced fiscal 2011 first quarter net sales of $425.0 million, an 8.5 percent increase compared with the year-ago period. Fiscal 2011 first quarter operating profit was $45.5 million, or 10.7 percent of net sales, compared with $42.7 million, or 10.9 percent of net sales, for the prior-year period. Net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2011 was $24.4 million compared with $23.3 million for the year-ago period, an increase of 4.7 percent. Diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of fiscal 2011 increased 5.7 percent to $0.56 compared with $0.53 reported for the prior-year period.
Mr. Nagel, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Acuity Brands, commented, "We are very pleased with our fiscal 2011 first quarter results as we continue to execute extremely well in this demanding and competitive environment. This was the third quarter in a row where we achieved unit volume growth in an environment where non-residential construction continued to decline. I believe this is strong evidence that the execution of our strategies to extend our leadership position in North America is succeeding. These strategies include continued introduction of new, more energy-efficient lighting products and solutions, expansion in key geographies and sales channels, and further gains in productivity. Our profitability was similarly strong while we continued to invest in a number of areas representing significant growth potential, including the acquisition of Winona Lighting, a premier provider of architectural and high-performance indoor and outdoor lighting products."
 
Excluding the impact from acquisitions, fiscal 2011 first quarter net sales rose approximately 7 percent year-over-year. The growth in net sales was due primarily to higher unit volumes in certain sales channels such as renovation, distributor stock and flow, and home improvement. The overall impact from changes in selling prices and the mix of products sold contributed minimally to net sales growth.
Management estimates that higher material and component costs as well as expediting costs due to the ongoing ballast shortage added approximately $2 million of incremental expense in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 as compared with the prior-year period. Additionally, although acquisitions contributed over $6 million to fiscal 2011 first quarter sales, they had an immaterial impact on profitability due to purchase accounting adjustments and transaction costs.
Outlook
Mr. Nagel commented, "Independent third-party forecasts suggest U.S. non-residential construction, our primary market, will be flat or possibly slightly down in 2011, with growth in the second half of the year offsetting declines in the first half. Additionally, we continue to see growth opportunities in the current environment, including renovation and tenant improvement projects, further expansion in underpenetrated geographies and channels, benefits from the government stimulus program, and growth from new product introductions, both in luminaires and controls. We expect that the controls portion of the market will continue to significantly outpace the growth of luminaires. At the end of the first quarter, comparable orders increased approximately 10 percent over the prior-year period while comparable backlog rose approximately 2 percent versus the prior-year.
"We anticipate that the second quarter will once again be challenging due primarily to continued weakness in non-residential construction and normal seasonal factors, including inconsistent customer demand, as well as higher input costs. The recent rise in commodity costs has led to higher material, component, and freight costs. We estimate that commodity cost increases will negatively impact second quarter's profitability by at least $4 million as compared with the prior-year period. In an effort to recoup these higher costs, we recently announced a price increase of 5 to 7 percent on most products which will be effective at the end of February, though we expect there to be a lag in realizing the full benefit of the price increase. We estimate the lag in recovering these cost increases will also negatively impact third quarter profitability though we expect to offset this shortfall from actions to reduce costs and improve productivity. In addition to our efforts to mitigate the negative impact of these cost increases, we will continue to be as vigilant as possible in our pricing strategies to protect our margins and market position. Assuming no further significant rise in commodity costs, the shortfall is expected to be temporary as we begin to realize the full benefits of the announced product price increases by the end of third quarter."
Mr. Nagel concluded, "We believe the continued execution of our long-term strategies to expand and leverage our industry-leading product portfolio and market presence, as well as our considerable financial strength to allow us to capitalize on market-growth opportunities, will enable us to outperform the markets we serve in 2011 and beyond. We believe the lighting and
 
lighting-related industry will experience solid growth over the next decade, particularly as energy and environmental concerns come to the forefront, and we believe we are well positioned to fully participate in this exciting industry."

Prior year's second quarter results included a pre-tax special charge for streamlining activities of $5.4 million, or an $0.08 impact on diluted EPS, and a $10.5 million pre-tax loss associated with the early retirement of debt, or a $0.16 impact on diluted EPS. Excluding such items, prior year's adjusted operating profit was $33.2 million, or 8.7 percent of net sales, and adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations were $0.40.
Excluding the impact from acquisitions, fiscal 2011 second quarter net sales rose 6.6 percent year-over-year. Higher unit volumes contributed approximately 5 percentage points to the
 
increase in net sales reflecting growth of both luminaires and controls across multiple sales channels, primarily for smaller-size commercial projects and renovation. Favorable price/mix contributed approximately 1 percentage point to the year-over-year increase in net sales with the remainder due to favorable foreign currency translation on international sales.
Mr. Nagel, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Acuity Brands, commented, "We are pleased with our fiscal 2011 second quarter results as we continue to execute extremely well in this demanding and competitive environment. This was the fourth quarter in a row where we achieved unit volume growth in an environment where U.S. non-residential construction, a key market for us, continued to decline. We estimate that higher material, component, and fuel costs negatively impacted second quarter operating profit by approximately $5 million as compared with the year-ago period. This reduced operating profit margin by 120 basis points and diluted EPS by $0.08. Even with the higher material costs, we increased our operating profit margin by 20 basis points over the prior-year period's adjusted operating profit margin (excludes special charges) as higher sales volumes, favorable price/mix, and productivity improvements all contributed to the margin improvement."
Mr. Nagel continued, "During the second quarter, we also expanded our suite of sustainable and energy-efficient lighting solutions with the acquisition of Sunoptics, a premier provider of high-performance, prismatic daylighting products. Sunoptics extends our capabilities in managing the visual environment by using natural daylight, while also providing opportunities to leverage our technology expertise and broad market access, including integration with other energy-efficient technologies such as our LED-based luminaires and intelligent lighting control solutions."
Year-to-Date Results
Net sales for the first six months of fiscal 2011 increased $66.0 million, or 8.5 percent, to $841.2 million compared with $775.2 million for the prior-year period. Operating profit for the first half of fiscal 2011 was $82.7 million, or 9.8 percent of net sales, compared with $70.5 million, or 9.1 percent of net sales, for the year-ago period. Income from continuing operations for the first half of fiscal 2011 was $44.3 million compared with $30.5 million for the year-ago period. Diluted EPS from continuing operations for the first half of fiscal 2011 were $1.01 compared with $0.69 per share for the prior-year period. Excluding prior year's special charge for streamlining activities and loss associated with the early retirement of debt, prior year's first half adjusted operating profit was $75.9 million, or 9.8 percent of net sales, and adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations were $0.93.
 
Net income for the first six months of fiscal 2011 was $44.3 million compared with $31.1 million for the year-ago period. Net income for the year-ago period included $0.6 million of income from discontinued operations. Diluted EPS for the first half of fiscal 2011 were $1.01 compared with $0.70 for the prior-year period.
Outlook
Mr. Nagel commented, "We continue to experience inflationary cost pressures resulting from increases in commodity prices. As an example, steel spot prices have risen nearly 45 percent during the past quarter. Although we recently implemented a price increase of 5 to 7 percent at the end of February on those products most affected by higher input costs, fiscal third quarter operating profit margin will continue to come under pressure due to the typical lag in realizing the full benefit of price increases. We will continue to be vigilant in our pricing strategies to protect our margins and market position, which may include future price increases should commodity costs continue to rise. Additionally, we expect to partially offset the negative impact of cost increases from actions to reduce costs and improve productivity.
"Third-party forecasts for the North American non-residential lighting market, which includes renovation, suggest that the market will grow in the low to mid-single digit range for the remainder of our fiscal 2011. While comparable backlog, which excludes the impact from acquisitions, rose 45 percent to $166 million at the end of the second quarter compared with the year-ago period, much of this increase was likely attributable to a pull-forward of orders in advance of the announced price increase that became effective at the end of the quarter. However, March order levels continue to provide encouraging signals of future shipment volume increases.
"Our strategies to drive profitable growth remain intact as we continue to see opportunities in the current environment. These include growth in renovation and tenant improvement projects, further expansion in underpenetrated geographies and channels, and growth from new product introductions and lighting solutions. We continue to enjoy success in building our lighting controls platform and we are now realizing the benefits and synergies of our investment in this exciting and fast growing market."
Mr. Nagel concluded, "We believe the continued execution of our long-term strategy to expand and leverage our product and solutions portfolio, coupled with our industry-leading market presence and our considerable financial strength to allow us to capitalize on market-growth opportunities, will enable us to outperform the markets we serve in fiscal 2011 and beyond. We believe the lighting and lighting-related industry will experience solid growth over the next
 
decade, particularly as energy and environmental concerns come to the forefront, and we believe we are well positioned to fully participate in this exciting industry."
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Acuity Brands' management included in the above news release the terms "adjusted operating profit" and "adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations" which are non-GAAP financial measures provided to enhance the user's overall understanding of the Company's current financial performance and prospects for the future. Specifically, management believes that adjusted operating profit and adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations provide useful information to investors by excluding or adjusting items related to (a) streamlining and manufacturing consolidation activities which affected the Company's reported operating results in 2010 and (b) the loss on the early retirement of debt which affected income and diluted EPS in the second quarter of fiscal 2010. Management believes these special items impacted the comparability of the Company's results and that these items are not reflective of fixed costs that the Company will incur over the long term. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, results prepared in accordance with GAAP. The most directly comparable GAAP measure for adjusted operating profit is "operating profit", which includes the impact of streamlining and manufacturing consolidation activities. The most directly comparable GAAP measure for adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations is "diluted EPS from continuing operations", which includes the impact of special charges and the loss on early retirement of debt. The non-GAAP financial measures included in this news release have been reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure.

Exhibit 99.1
(404) 853-1423
Company Contact: Dan Smith Acuity Brands, Inc.
ATLANTA, June 29, 2011  Acuity Brands, Inc. (NYSE: AYI) ("Company") today announced fiscal 2011 third quarter net sales of $458.3 million, an increase of over 12 percent compared with the year-ago period. Operating profit for the third quarter of fiscal 2011 was $50.2 million, or 11.0 percent of net sales, compared with the prior year period's $39.2 million, or 9.6 percent of net sales. Fiscal 2011 third quarter net income was $27.1 million compared with $21.3 million for the prior-year period, an increase of 27 percent. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations for the third quarter of fiscal 2011 were $0.62 compared with $0.48 for the prior year, an increase of 29 percent.
Excluding the impact from acquisitions, fiscal 2011 third quarter net sales rose 9 percent year-over-year. Higher unit volumes contributed approximately 5 percent to the increase in net sales reflecting growth of both luminaires and controls across multiple sales channels, primarily for smaller-size commercial projects and renovation. In addition, favorable price/mix contributed approximately 3 percent to the year-over-year increase in net sales with the remainder due to favorable foreign currency translation on international sales.
In the prior year third quarter, the Company recorded a $0.3 million pre-tax adjustment to reduce its previously recorded special charge for streamlining activities reflecting lower than originally planned employee severance and benefit costs. Adjusted operating profit for the third quarter of fiscal 2010 was $38.9 million, or 9.5 percent of net sales.
Mr. Nagel, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Acuity Brands, commented, "We are pleased with our fiscal 2011 third quarter results as we continue to execute extremely well in a demanding and competitive environment. We believe our strategies to drive profitable growth are progressing well as we continue to gain market share. Higher sales volumes, favorable price/mix, and productivity improvements all contributed to the year-over-year 130 basis points
 
improvement in gross profit margin and 150 basis points improvement in adjusted operating profit margin."
Mr. Nagel continued, "During the third quarter, we also enhanced our expertise and offering of high-quality, energy-efficient lighting solutions with the acquisition of Healthcare Lighting and its specialized product portfolio for the large and growing healthcare industry. Healthcare Lighting's product portfolio includes specialized ambient and task lighting products for today's modern healthcare facilities, including patient and examination rooms, surgical suites and medical procedure rooms, as well as lighting products for specialized medical functions."
Year-to-Date Results
Net sales for the first nine months of fiscal 2011 were $1,299.5 million compared with $1,182.7 million for the prior-year period, an increase of approximately 10 percent. Operating profit for the first nine months of fiscal 2011 was $132.9 million, or 10.2 percent of net sales, compared with $109.7 million, or 9.3 percent of net sales, for the year-ago period. Income from continuing operations for the first nine months of fiscal 2011 was $71.3 million compared with $51.8 million for the prior-year period. Diluted EPS from continuing operations for the first nine months of fiscal 2011 were $1.63 compared with $1.17 per share for the prior-year period.
In the prior fiscal year, the Company incurred special charges for streamlining activities and recorded a loss associated with the early retirement of debt. Excluding the special charges and loss associated with the early retirement of debt, adjusted operating profit for the first nine months of fiscal 2010 was $114.9 million, or 9.7 percent of net sales, while adjusted income from continuing operations was $62.0 million and adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations were $1.41.
Outlook
Mr. Nagel commented, "We remain very positive about the future prospects for our company and our ability to outperform the markets we serve. We continue to position the Company to optimize short-term performance while investing in and deploying resources to further our long-term profitable growth opportunities.
"We expect the economic environment for the remainder of our fiscal 2011 to remain challenging. Independent third-party forecasts continue to indicate declines for non-residential construction activity for the balance of 2011, although the North American non-residential
 
lighting market, which includes renovation and relight, is expected to continue to rise modestly for the balance of our fiscal 2011. While we are optimistic about our future prospects and ability to outperform the markets we serve, we do see the potential for continuing volatility in demand as well as increases in material and component costs. We will continue to be as vigilant as possible in our pricing strategies to protect our margins."
Mr. Nagel concluded, "We believe the lighting and lighting-related industry will experience strong growth over the next decade, particularly as energy and environmental concerns come to the forefront, and we believe we are well-positioned to fully participate in this exciting industry."
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Acuity Brands' management included in the above news release the terms "adjusted operating profit", "adjusted operating profit margin", "adjusted income from continuing operations", and "adjusted diluted EPS" which are non-GAAP financial measures provided to enhance the user's overall understanding of the Company's current financial performance and prospects for the future. Specifically, management believes that adjusted operating profit, adjusted operating profit margin, adjusted income from continuing operations, and adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations provide useful information to investors by excluding or adjusting items related to (a) streamlining and manufacturing consolidation activities which affected the Company's reported operating results in fiscal 2010 and (b) the loss on the early retirement of debt which affected income and diluted EPS in fiscal 2010. Management believes these special items impacted the comparability of the Company's results and that these items are not reflective of fixed costs that the Company will incur over the long term. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, results prepared in accordance with GAAP. The most directly comparable GAAP measure for adjusted operating profit and adjusted operating profit margin are "operating profit" and "operating profit margin", respectively, which include the impact of streamlining and manufacturing consolidation activities. The most directly comparable GAAP measures for adjusted income from continuing operations and adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations are "income from continuing operations" and "diluted EPS from continuing operations," respectively; both GAAP measures include the impact of special charges and the loss on early retirement of debt. The non-GAAP financial measures included in this news release have been reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure.

Section 1.
Right to Indemnification
.
Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved in any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a proceeding), by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or an officer of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer or trustee of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan (hereinafter an indemnitee), whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer or trustee or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer or trustee, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the Delaware General Corporation Law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than such law permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment), against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such indemnitee in connection therewith; provided, however, that, except as provided in Section 3 of this Article VII with respect to proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification, the Corporation shall indemnify any such indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.
Section 2.
Right to Advancement of Expenses
.
In addition to the right to indemnification conferred in Section 1 of this Article VII, an indemnitee shall also have the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses (including attorney's fees) incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition (hereinafter an advancement of expenses); provided, however, that, if the Delaware General Corporation Law requires, an advancement of expenses incurred by an indemnitee in his or her capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such indemnitee, including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking (hereinafter an undertaking), by or on behalf of such indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal (hereinafter a final adjudication) that such indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under this Section 2 or otherwise.
Section 3.
Right of Indemnitee to Bring Suit
.
If a claim under Section 1 or 2 of this Article VII is not paid in full by the Corporation within sixty (60) days after a written claim has been received by the Corporation, except in the case of a claim for an advancement of expenses, in which case the applicable period shall be twenty (20) days, the indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim. If successful in whole or in part in any such suit, or in a suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit. In (i) any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (but not in a suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to an advancement of expenses) it shall be a defense that, and (ii) in any suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the Corporation shall be entitled to recover such expenses upon a final adjudication that, the indemnitee has not met any applicable standard for indemnification set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its directors who are not parties to such action, a committee of such directors, independent legal counsel, or its
Exhibit 3.1
stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such suit that indemnification of the indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its directors who are not parties to such action, a committee of such directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that the indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought by the indemnitee, be a defense to such suit. In any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, or brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden of proving that the indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses, under this Article VII or otherwise shall be on the Corporation.
Section 4.
Non-Exclusivity of Rights
.
The rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses conferred in this Article VII shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, the Corporation's certificate of incorporation, By-laws, agreement, vote of stockholders or directors or otherwise.
Section 5.
Insurance

News Release
Exhibit 99.1
Acuity Brands Reports Fiscal 2011 Fourth Quarter and Full Year Results
Fourth Quarter Net Sales Rise 12 Percent and Diluted EPS Increases 27 Percent
ATLANTA, October 5, 2011 - Acuity Brands, Inc. (NYSE: AYI) (Company) today announced fiscal 2011 fourth quarter net sales of $496.2 million, an increase of $52.1 million, or 12 percent, compared with the year-ago period. Fiscal 2011 fourth quarter net income was $34.2 million compared with $27.2 million for the prior-year period, an increase of 26 percent. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 were $0.79 compared with $0.62 for the prior year, an increase of 27 percent.
The year-over-year growth in fiscal fourth quarter net sales was due to an approximate 5 percent increase in unit volume, 4 percent from acquisitions, 2 percent from pricing that was partially offset by a less favorable mix of products sold, and 1 percent from favorable foreign currency translation on international sales. The increase in unit volume was fairly broad-based across most product categories and key sales channels in North America, partially offset by a decline in Europe which reduced overall growth in the fourth quarter by almost one full percentage point.
For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, operating profit was $55.8 million, or 11.2 percent of net sales, compared with $48.0 million, or 10.8 percent of net sales, for the prior year period. Prior year's fourth quarter results included a $3.3 million pre-tax special charge, or $0.05 per diluted share. The special charge related to streamlining activities and non-cash asset impairments. Excluding the special charge in the prior-year period, adjusted operating profit for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 was $51.3 million, or 11.5 percent of net sales.
Cash and cash equivalents at August 31, 2011 totaled $170 million. For the full year of fiscal 2011, the Company generated $161 million in net cash from operating activities. In fiscal 2011, the Company invested $90 million in acquisitions and $23 million in capital expenditures, while paying $23 million of dividends to stockholders and repurchasing $61 million of company stock. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, the Company repurchased over 1.2 million shares, or 3 percent, of its outstanding common stock. The Company's debt to total capitalization ratio (calculated by dividing total debt by the sum of total debt and total stockholders' equity) was 32 percent at August 31, 2011. The ratio of debt, net of cash, to total capitalization, net of cash, was 19 percent at August 31, 2011.
Vernon J. Nagel, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Acuity Brands, commented, We are pleased with our fiscal 2011 fourth quarter results. We continue to execute well in a challenging environment. In addition to our top-line growth, our profitability and cash flow were similarly strong even while we continued to invest heavily in a number of areas, including new products and lighting solutions, as well as key strategic acquisitions. We continue to focus on extending our leadership position in North America while diversifying our product portfolio and expanding our channels to market, making us much less reliant on new construction.
News Release
Furthermore, as we continue to diversify and expand our addressable market, we see significant growth potential over the next five years and beyond.
Fiscal 2011 fourth quarter gross profit margin declined 110 basis points to 40.4 percent compared with 41.5 percent for the prior-year period. The year-over-year decrease was due primarily to the impact of higher input costs and unfavorable changes in the mix of products sold. The Company was able to recover all but approximately $2 million of these higher input costs through price increases, however, the gross profit margin percentage was negatively impacted. The Company implemented an additional price increase in September 2011 on those products most affected by higher input costs. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, sales of the Company's LED products quadrupled compared with the prior-year period, and the Company launched a new line of retrofit lighting fixtures through the home center channel that entailed upfront stocking and display costs. While the LED products contributed profit dollars similar to or above the traditional portfolio mix, the gross profit percentage from the products was lower due to both their higher sales price and component costs. The profit margin on most LED products is currently dilutive to the Company's overall profit margin and is expected to remain so in the near future. The Company anticipates that LED fixtures will become accretive to its overall profit margins as the expected decline of LED component costs outpaces the expected decrease in the selling prices of LED fixtures. This is due largely to higher value-added benefits and functionality of these fixtures, including improved energy efficiency and quality lighting from embedded controls.
Selling, distribution and administrative (SD&A) expenses for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 increased to $144.6 million compared with $133.1 million in the prior-year period due primarily to commission and freight costs associated with the higher sales volume, additional SD&A expenses attributable to acquired businesses, as well as an increased level of spending on future growth initiatives such as new products, expanded market presence, and technology and innovation. However, fiscal 2011 fourth quarter SD&A expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 90 basis points year-over-year to 29.1 percent.
Fiscal 2011 Results
Fiscal 2011 net sales were $1,795.7 million compared with $1,626.9 million for the prior-year period, an increase of over 10 percent. Operating profit for fiscal 2011 was $188.7 million, or 10.5 percent of net sales, compared with the prior-year period operating profit of $157.7 million, or 9.7 percent of net sales. Income from continuing operations for fiscal 2011 was $105.5 million compared with $79.0 million for fiscal 2010. Diluted EPS from continuing operations for fiscal 2011 and 2010 were $2.42 and $1.79, respectively. Excluding prior year's special charges, adjusted operating profit for fiscal 2010 was $166.1 million, or 10.2 percent of net sales. Excluding prior year's impact of special charges and loss associated with the early retirement of debt, fiscal 2010 adjusted income from continuing operations was $91.3 million and adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations were $2.08.
Outlook
Mr. Nagel commented, We remain very positive about the future prospects for our company and our ability
News Release
to outperform the markets we serve, particularly as we become more diversified and less reliant on new building construction for growth. We have experienced growth for six consecutive quarters in spite of weak new construction, supporting our diversification strategy. We continue to position the Company to deliver short-term performance while investing in and deploying resources to further our longer-term profitable growth opportunities.
We expect the North American lighting market, which includes renovation and relight, to grow modestly in our fiscal 2012, although we do see the potential for continuing volatility in customer demand. We believe our strategies to drive profitable growth are progressing well, particularly as we expand our LED and lighting solutions portfolio. While we expect to experience continued volatility in material and component costs, we also continue to be as vigilant as possible in our pricing strategies to protect our margins. We intend to invest approximately $40 million in capital expenditures during fiscal 2012, and we estimate our annual tax rate to be approximately 34 percent for the year.
Mr. Nagel concluded, Looking beyond the current environment, we believe the lighting and lighting-related industry will experience solid growth over the next decade, particularly as energy and environmental concerns come to the forefront, and we believe we are well positioned to fully participate in this exciting industry.
The Company's independent registered public accountants' audit opinion with respect to the fiscal year-end financial statements will not be issued until the Company completes its annual report on Form 10-K, including its evaluation of internal controls over financial reporting. Accordingly, the financial results reported in this earnings release are preliminary pending completion of the audit.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Acuity Brands' management included in the above news release the terms adjusted operating profit, adjusted operating profit margin, adjusted income from continuing operations, and adjusted diluted EPS which are non-GAAP financial measures provided to enhance the user's overall understanding of the Company's current financial performance and prospects for the future. Specifically, management believes that adjusted operating profit, adjusted operating profit margin, adjusted income from continuing operations, and adjusted diluted EPS provide useful information to investors by excluding or adjusting items related to (a) streamlining and manufacturing consolidation activities which affected the Company's reported operating results in fiscal 2010 and (b) the loss on the early retirement of debt which affected fiscal 2010 income and diluted EPS. Management believes these special items impacted the comparability of the Company's results and that these items are not reflective of fixed costs that the Company will incur over the long term. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, results prepared in accordance with GAAP. The most directly comparable GAAP measure for adjusted operating profit and adjusted operating profit margin are operating profit and operating profit margin, respectively, which include the impact of streamlining and manufacturing consolidation activities. The most directly comparable GAAP measures for adjusted income from continuing operations and adjusted diluted
News Release
EPS are income from continuing operations and diluted EPS, respectively; both GAAP measures include the impact of special charges and the loss on early retirement of debt. The non-GAAP financial measures included in this news release have been reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure.
Conference Call
As previously announced, the Company will host a conference call to discuss fourth quarter results today, October 5, 2011, at 10:00 a.m. ET. Interested parties may listen to this call live today or hear a replay at the Company's Web site:

Acuity Brands Reports Fiscal 2012 First Quarter Results
Net Sales Rise 12 Percent; Adjusted Diluted EPS Increases 32 Percent
ATLANTA, January 9, 2012 - Acuity Brands, Inc. (NYSE: AYI) (Company) today announced fiscal 2012 first quarter net sales of $474.3 million, an increase of $49.3 million, or approximately 12 percent, compared with the year-ago period. Net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2012 was $29.9 million compared with $24.4 million for the year-ago period, an increase of 23 percent. Diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of fiscal 2012 increased to $0.70 compared with $0.56 reported for the prior-year period. Included in the results for the first quarter of fiscal 2012 was a $2.7 million pre-tax special charge associated with actions to streamline the organization through the realignment of responsibilities within various selling, distribution, and administrative departments. Excluding the special charge, fiscal 2012 first quarter adjusted diluted EPS were $0.74, an increase of 32 percent compared with the year-ago period.
The year-over-year growth in fiscal 2012 first quarter net sales was due to an approximate 7 percent increase in unit volume, 3 percent from acquisitions, and 2 percent from the net impact of improved pricing that was partially offset by an unfavorable mix of products sold. The increase in unit volume was broad-based across most product categories and key sales channels in North America. Fiscal 2012 first quarter operating profit was $50.6 million compared with $45.5 million for the prior-year period. Operating profit margin for both periods was 10.7 percent. Excluding the special charge, adjusted operating profit for the first quarter of fiscal 2012 was $53.3 million, or 11.2 percent of net sales, which represents a 50 basis point improvement in operating profit margin compared with the prior-year period.
Vernon J. Nagel, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Acuity Brands, commented, We are very pleased with our fiscal 2012 first quarter results as we continue to perform extremely well in this demanding and competitive environment. We continue to execute our strategies, including the introduction of new and more energy-efficient lighting solutions, to extend our leadership position in North America. Contributing to our year-over-year top-line growth was a 150 percent increase in sales of LED products, which now represent more than 5 percent of total net sales. The improvement in adjusted operating profit was due primarily to the benefits from higher sales volumes, price increases implemented during the prior twelve months, and productivity improvements. These benefits were partially offset by higher material costs and additional operating and amortization expense related to acquired businesses. Our strong first quarter results also reflect the continuing higher level of spending on future growth initiatives such as new products, expanded market presence, and technology and innovation.
News Release
The pre-tax special charge of $2.7 million recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 relates primarily to actions to streamline the organization by realigning responsibilities within various selling, distribution, and administrative departments. The special charge consisted primarily of severance and related employee benefit costs associated with a modest reduction in workforce. The Company expects to achieve annualized pre-tax savings of approximately $5 million related to these streamlining efforts with approximately $3.5 million to be realized in fiscal 2012. Management continues to evaluate possible further streamlining measures that may result in additional charges this fiscal year.
Fiscal 2012 first quarter results included $2.9 million of net miscellaneous income compared with $1.2 million of net miscellaneous expense in the prior-year period. Net miscellaneous income/expense consists primarily of gains and losses resulting from the impact of exchange rates changes on foreign currency exposures, particularly those associated with the Mexican Peso.
Outlook
Mr. Nagel commented, We remain very positive about the future prospects for our company, particularly as we become more diversified and less reliant on new building construction for growth. We believe our diversification strategy, which includes providing high quality, energy-efficient lighting solutions for all types of renovation, has allowed us to achieve volume growth for seven consecutive quarters in spite of weak new construction. We continue to position the Company to deliver short-term performance while investing in and deploying resources to further our longer-term profitable growth opportunities.
Our performance expectations for fiscal 2012 have not changed materially during the past quarter. Updated third-party forecasts suggest that the North American lighting market, which includes renovation and relight activity, will increase in the low-to-mid single digits during the remainder of our fiscal 2012. We believe opportunities continue to exist that will allow us to outperform the markets we serve. These opportunities include benefits from growing renovation and tenant improvement projects, further expansion in underpenetrated geographies and channels, and growth from the introduction of new products and lighting solutions. This notwithstanding, we anticipate on-going volatility in both customer demand and commodity costs. Similar to prior years, the second fiscal quarter, typically our weakest quarter, is expected to once again be influenced by normal seasonality and the potential for year-end inventory rebalancing by certain customers.
Mr. Nagel concluded, We believe the lighting and lighting-related industry will experience solid growth over the next decade, particularly as energy and environmental concerns come to the forefront, and we believe we are well positioned to fully participate in this exciting industry.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Acuity Brands' management included in the above news release the terms adjusted operating profit, adjusted operating profit margin, adjusted net income, and adjusted diluted EPS which are non-GAAP
News Release
financial measures provided to enhance the user's overall understanding of the Company's current financial performance and prospects for the future. Specifically, management believes that adjusted operating profit, adjusted operating profit margin, adjusted net income, and adjusted diluted EPS provide useful information to investors by excluding or adjusting items related to special charges associated with efforts to streamline the organization by realigning responsibilities within various selling, distribution, and administrative departments, which affected fiscal 2012 first quarter operating profit, net income and diluted EPS. Management believes the special charges impacted the comparability of the Company's results and that these items are not reflective of fixed costs that the Company will incur over the long term. However, we have incurred similar charges in prior fiscal years and continually evaluate streamlining measures which could result in additional charges in future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, results prepared in accordance with GAAP. The most directly comparable GAAP measure for adjusted operating profit and adjusted operating profit margin are operating profit and operating profit margin, respectively, which include the impact of the special charges. The most directly comparable GAAP measures for adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS are net income and diluted EPS, respectively; both GAAP measures include the impact of the special charges. The non-GAAP financial measures included in this news release have been reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure.
Conference Call
As previously announced, the Company will host a conference call to discuss first quarter results today, January 9, 2012, at 10:00 a.m. ET. Interested parties may listen to this call live today or hear a replay at the Company's Web site:

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
The information included pursuant to Item 2.03 is incorporated under this Item 1.01.
Item 1.02. Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement.
As of January 31, 2012, in connection with our entry into the new unsecured revolving credit facility described in Item 2.03 hereof, we terminated the $250 million five-year revolving credit facility, dated as of October 19, 2007, with the syndicate of banks including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent. The prior credit facility would have expired on October 19, 2012.
Item 2.03. Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation Under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
On January 31, 2012, we entered into a new $250 million five-year unsecured revolving credit facility (Revolving Credit Facility) with a syndicate of commercial banks consisting of Bank of America, N.A., Branch Banking & Trust Company, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., KeyBank National Association, RBC Bank (USA), U.S. Bank National Association, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association. The material terms of the Revolving Credit Facility are as set forth below.
Generally, amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a Eurocurrency Rate. Eurocurrency rate advances can be denominated in a variety of currencies, including U.S. Dollars, and amounts outstanding bear interest at a periodic fixed rate equal to LIBOR for the applicable currency plus an applicable margin. The applicable margins are based on our leverage ratio, as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility, with such margins ranging from 1.075% to 1.65%. Interest on Eurocurrency rate advances is payable upon the earlier of maturity of the outstanding loan or quarterly if the loan is for a period greater than three months. The Revolving Credit Facility will mature and all amounts outstanding thereunder will be due and payable on January 31, 2017.
We are required to pay certain fees in connection with the Revolving Credit Facility. For example, we must pay an annual facility fee. Such fee is payable quarterly in arrears and is determined by our leverage ratio as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility. This facility fee ranges from 0.175% to 0.35% of the aggregate $250 million commitment of the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility. Additionally, we are also required to pay certain fees to the Agent for administrative services.
The Revolving Credit Facility contains customary covenants regarding, among other matters, the preservation and maintenance of our corporate existence, material compliance with laws, payment of taxes, and maintenance of insurance and of our properties. Further, the Revolving Credit Facility contains financial covenants including a leverage ratio (Maximum Leverage Ratio) of total indebtedness to EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization expense), as such terms are defined in the Revolving Credit Facility agreement, and a minimum interest coverage ratio. These ratios are computed at the end of each fiscal quarter for the most recent 12-month period. The Revolving Credit Facility allows for a Maximum Leverage Ratio of 3.50x and a Minimum Interest Coverage Ratio of 2.50x. The Revolving Credit Facility includes customary events of default, including, but not limited to, the failure to pay any interest, principal or fees when due, the failure to perform any covenant or agreement, inaccurate or false representations or warranties, insolvency or bankruptcy, change of control, the occurrence of certain ERISA events and judgment defaults.

Item 2.05. Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.
On March 9, 2012, Acuity Brands, Inc. (the Company), announced to its employees the planned closing of its Cochran, Georgia production facility, which is expected to be principally completed by the end of the current fiscal year. The facility closing is a part of the Company's previously disclosed ongoing streamlining efforts to improve efficiencies and reduce costs, as well as to enhance customer service capabilities. The Company will transition production from the Cochran facility, which produces less than 10 percent of the Company's total sales, to various existing facilities in North America. Annualized pre-tax savings, due primarily to lower labor and manufacturing costs, are expected to be approximately $8 million. The savings are expected to be realized beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 following the completion of the transfer of production and closure of the facility.
The Company expects to incur a pre-tax special charge of approximately $15 million associated with the planned facility closing of which approximately $5 million is expected to be recognized in the second quarter of fiscal 2012. The remaining portion of the pre-tax charge is forecasted to be recognized primarily during the second half of fiscal 2012. The pre-tax charge consists primarily of severance and employee-related costs, production transfer expenses, and non-cash asset impairments. Approximately $11 million of the pre-tax charge is anticipated to result in cash expenditures, most of which is expected to be paid in the second half of fiscal 2012.
The Company is currently in the process of finalizing certain aspects of the activities related to the closure of the facility, including union bargaining, which could require future adjustments to the aforementioned estimated costs, savings, and timing, however, the estimated costs are consistent with prior streamlining efforts.
Additionally, the Company recorded a special pre-tax charge of approximately $1 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2012 associated with a reduction in workforce primarily at its Spanish operations. The reduction in workforce is due to the decline in market conditions in Spain, which are not expected to rebound materially in the near future. The pre-tax charge consisted primarily of severance and other employee related costs. Annualized pre-tax savings related to the reduction in workforce are estimated to be $1 million and are expected to begin to be realized by the end of the third quarter of the current fiscal year.
This current report on Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Statements that may be considered forward-looking include statements incorporating terms such as "expects," "believes," "intends," estimates, forecasts, "anticipates," may, should, and similar terms that relate to future events, performance, or results of the Company and specifically include statements made in this press release regarding the expected costs, savings, and timing of the closing of the Cochran facility as well as the reduction in workforce at its Spanish operations.

Exhibit 99.1
Acuity Brands Reports Fiscal 2012 Second Quarter Results
Net Sales Rise 10%
;
Adjusted Diluted EPS Increases 27%
ATLANTA, April 4, 2012 - Acuity Brands, Inc. (NYSE: AYI) (Company) today announced that fiscal 2012 second quarter net sales increased $41.6 million, or 10 percent, to $457.7 million compared with the prior-year period. Net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2012 was $19.5 million compared with $19.9 million for the year-ago period. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) for the second quarter of fiscal 2012 were $0.46 compared with $0.45 reported for the prior-year period. Included in the results for the second quarter of fiscal 2012 was a $6.6 million pre-tax special charge, or $0.11 per diluted share, associated with streamlining actions as explained below. Excluding the special charge, fiscal 2012 second quarter adjusted diluted EPS were $0.57, an increase of 27 percent compared with the year-ago period.
The year-over-year growth in fiscal 2012 second quarter net sales was due to an approximate 5 percent increase in unit volume, 3 percent from the net favorable impact of changes in product pricing and the mix of products sold (i.e., price/mix), and 2 percent from acquisitions. The increase in unit volume was broad-based across most product categories and key sales channels in North America, partially offset by a decline in Spain. Although it is not possible to precisely quantify the separate impact of price/mix changes, the Company believes that essentially all of the benefit from price/mix was due to price increases implemented in calendar year 2011 which offset a less favorable mix of products sold.
Fiscal 2012 second quarter operating profit was $39.0 million compared with $37.2 million for the prior-year period. Excluding the special charge, adjusted operating profit for the second quarter of fiscal 2012 was $45.6 million, or 10.0 percent of net sales, which represents a 110 basis point improvement in adjusted operating profit margin compared with the prior-year period.
Vernon J. Nagel, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Acuity Brands, commented, We are pleased with our fiscal 2012 second quarter results as we continue to execute our strategies, including the introduction of new and more energy-efficient lighting solutions, to extend our leadership position in North America. The improvement in adjusted operating profit was due primarily to the benefits from higher sales volumes, price increases implemented during the prior twelve months, and productivity improvements. These benefits were partially offset by higher material costs, additional operating expense related to acquired businesses, increased compensation expense, and an adjusted operating loss in Spain. Our second quarter results also reflect the continuing higher level of spending on future growth initiatives, including new products, expanded market presence, and technology and innovation.
Mr. Nagel continued, Our gross profit margin increased 30 basis points year-over-year to 39.7 percent. Through previously implemented pricing initiatives we were able to recapture approximately $11 million of
News Release
higher material costs, although the impact of these items negatively impacted our gross profit margin by 90 basis points. Our operations in Spain reported for the quarter an adjusted operating loss, excluding any special charges, of $1.3 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, on a 50 percent, or $2.6 million, year-over-year decline in net sales, reflecting the difficult economic conditions in Spain. While we are taking significant steps to properly size our Spanish operations given the challenging prospects of the local economy, we expect to report a modest operating loss for Spain in our third quarter.
The effective tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal 2012 was 35.4 percent compared with 31.4 percent for the prior-year period. The increase in the effective tax rate was due primarily to the research and development tax credit which was extended during the second quarter of fiscal 2011 but was not extended in the current year. The change in the tax rate negatively impacted adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS by $1.3 million and $0.03, respectively, compared with the year-ago period. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 is forecasted to approximate 34 percent.
Special Charge
In the second quarter of fiscal 2012, the Company recorded a pre-tax special charge related to streamlining activities of $6.6 million, or $0.11 per diluted share. The special charge was comprised of approximately $1.2 million associated with a reduction in workforce, primarily at its operations in Spain, and $5.4 million related to the planned closing of the Company's Cochran, Georgia production facility. The closure of the facility is expected to be principally completed by the end of the current fiscal year. The Company expects to incur additional costs of approximately $10 million associated with the closure of the facility, which are forecasted to be recognized primarily during the second half of fiscal 2012. The total estimated pre-tax special charge of $15 million associated with the facility closing consists primarily of severance and employee-related costs of $9 million, production transfer expenses of $3 million, and non-cash asset impairments of $3 million. Annualized pre-tax savings related to the reduction in workforce in Spain are estimated to be $1.2 million and are expected to begin to be realized by the end of the third quarter of the current fiscal year. Annualized pre-tax savings associated with the closure of the Cochran production facility are forecasted to be approximately $8 million and are expected to be realized beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 following the completion of the transfer of production and closure of the facility.
Year-to-Date Results
Net sales for the first six months of fiscal 2012 were $932.0 million compared with $841.2 million for the prior-year period, an increase of approximately 11 percent. Fiscal 2012 first half reported results include operating profit of $89.5 million, net income of $49.5 million, and diluted EPS of $1.16. Adjusted results, which exclude the special charge for streamlining activities, include adjusted operating profit of $98.8 million, or 10.6 percent of net sales, compared with $82.7 million, or 9.8 percent of net sales, for the prior-year
News Release
period. Adjusted net income for the first half of fiscal 2012 was $55.8 million, an increase of 26 percent compared with $44.3 million for the prior-year period. For the first half of fiscal 2012, adjusted diluted EPS were $1.31, an increase of 30 percent compared with the year-ago period.
Outlook
Mr. Nagel commented, Our performance expectations for fiscal 2012 have not changed materially during the past quarter. Third-party forecasts suggest that the North American lighting market, which includes renovation and relight activity, will increase in the low-to-mid single digits during the remainder of our fiscal 2012. We believe opportunities continue to exist that will allow us to continue to outperform the markets we serve. These opportunities include benefits from growing renovation and tenant improvement projects, further expansion in underpenetrated geographies and channels, and growth from the introduction of new products and lighting solutions. This notwithstanding, we continue to anticipate on-going volatility in both customer demand and commodity costs.
Mr. Nagel concluded, We continue to position the Company to deliver short-term performance while investing in and deploying resources to further our longer-term profitable growth opportunities. We believe the lighting and lighting-related industry will experience solid growth over the next decade, particularly as energy and environmental concerns come to the forefront, and we believe we are well positioned to fully participate in this exciting industry.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Acuity Brands' management included in the above news release the terms adjusted operating profit, adjusted operating profit margin, adjusted net income, and adjusted diluted EPS which are non-GAAP financial measures provided to enhance the user's overall understanding of the Company's current financial performance and prospects for the future. Specifically, management believes that adjusted operating profit, adjusted operating profit margin, adjusted net income, and adjusted diluted EPS provide useful information to investors by excluding or adjusting items related to special charges associated with efforts to streamline the organization, which affected fiscal 2012 second quarter operating profit, net income and diluted EPS. Management believes the special charges impacted the comparability of the Company's results and that these items are not reflective of fixed costs that the Company will incur over the long term. However, we have incurred similar charges in prior fiscal years and continually evaluate streamlining measures which could result in additional charges in future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, results prepared in accordance with GAAP. The most directly comparable GAAP measure for adjusted operating profit and adjusted operating profit margin are operating profit and operating profit margin, respectively, which include the impact of the special charges. The most directly comparable GAAP measures for adjusted net income and adjusted
News Release
diluted EPS are net income and diluted EPS, respectively; both GAAP measures include the impact of the special charges. The non-GAAP financial measures included in this news release have been reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure.

News Release
Exhibit 99.1
Acuity Brands Reports Fiscal 2012 Third Quarter Results
Adjusted Diluted EPS Increases 32 Percent
ATLANTA, July 2, 2012 - Acuity Brands, Inc. (NYSE: AYI) (Company) today announced that fiscal 2012 third quarter net sales increased $29.2 million, or 6.4 percent, to $487.5 million compared with the prior-year period. Net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2012 was $33.6 million compared with $27.1 million for the year-ago period. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) for the third quarter of fiscal 2012 were $0.79 compared with $0.62 reported for the prior-year period. Included in the results for the third quarter of fiscal 2012 was a pre-tax special charge of $1.9 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, associated with streamlining actions as explained below. Excluding the special charge, fiscal 2012 third quarter adjusted diluted EPS were $0.82, an increase of 32 percent compared with the year-ago period.
Unit volume increased more than 5 percent compared with the prior-year period reflecting the modest recovery in the North American lighting market, partially offset by weakness in Spain. The balance of the year-over-year increase in net sales was due primarily to the net favorable change in product prices and the mix of products sold (price/mix). While it is not possible to precisely quantify the separate impact between price and mix, the Company estimates that the net favorable change in price/mix was due primarily to price. The impact on net sales from acquisitions and foreign currency was not significant.
Fiscal 2012 third quarter operating profit was $57.3 million, or 11.8 percent of net sales, compared with $50.2 million, or 11.0 percent of net sales, for the prior-year period. Excluding the special charge, adjusted operating profit for the third quarter of fiscal 2012 was $59.2 million, or 12.1 percent of net sales, which represents a 110 basis point improvement in adjusted operating profit margin compared with the prior-year period.
Vernon J. Nagel, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Acuity Brands, commented, We are pleased with our fiscal 2012 third quarter results as we continue to execute our strategies to extend our leadership position in North America, including our record pace for the introduction of more energy-efficient lighting solutions. The improvement in adjusted operating profit was due primarily to the benefits from higher sales volumes, price increases implemented during calendar year 2011, and productivity improvements. These benefits were partially offset by higher material and component costs and additional operating expense to support the greater sales volume, including increased sales and marketing expenses. Our third quarter results also reflected a continuation of an elevated level of spending on future growth initiatives, including new products, expanded market presence, and technology and innovation.
Fiscal 2012 third quarter results included $2.7 million of net miscellaneous income compared with $0.9 million of net miscellaneous expense in the prior-year period. Net miscellaneous income/expense consists
News Release
primarily of gains and losses resulting from the impact of exchange rates changes on foreign currency exposures, particularly those associated with the Mexican Peso.
The effective tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2012 was 35.8 percent compared with 35.2 percent for the prior-year period. The increase in the effective tax rate was due primarily to higher taxable income, nondeductible losses in Spain, and the expiration of the research and development tax credit which occurred at the end of calendar year 2011. The Company
s effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 is forecasted to be approximately 35 percent.
Special Charge
In the third quarter of fiscal 2012, the Company recorded a pre-tax special charge related to streamlining activities of $1.9 million, or $0.03 per diluted share. The special charge was associated with the previously announced planned closing of the Company
s Cochran, Georgia production facility. The closure of the facility, which began in the third quarter of fiscal 2012, is expected to be principally completed by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2013. The Company expects to incur additional costs of approximately $7 million associated with the closure of the facility, which are forecasted to be recognized primarily during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. The total estimated pre-tax costs of $14 million associated with the facility closing consist primarily of severance and employee-related costs of $9 million, production transfer expenses of $2 million, and non-cash asset impairments of $3 million. Annualized pre-tax savings associated with the closure of the Cochran production facility are forecasted to be approximately $8 million and are expected to be realized beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 following the completion of the transfer of production and closure of the facility.
Year-to-Date Results
Net sales for the first nine months of fiscal 2012 were $1,419.5 million compared with $1,299.5 million for the prior-year period, an increase of approximately 9 percent. Results for the first nine months of fiscal 2012 include operating profit of $146.9 million, net income of $83.1 million, and diluted EPS of $1.95. Adjusted results, which exclude $11.2 million of pre-tax special charges for streamlining activities, include adjusted operating profit of $158.1 million, or 11.1 percent of net sales, compared with $132.9 million, or 10.2 percent of net sales, for the prior-year period. Adjusted net income for the first nine months of fiscal 2012 was $90.6 million, an increase of 27 percent compared with $71.3 million for the prior-year period. For the first nine months of fiscal 2012, adjusted diluted EPS were $2.13, an increase of 31 percent compared with the year-ago period.
Outlook
Mr. Nagel commented, We remain very positive about the future prospects for our company and our ability to outperform the markets we serve. We continue to position the Company to optimize short-term
News Release
performance while investing in and deploying resources to further our long-term profitable growth opportunities. While we are optimistic about our future prospects and ability to outperform the markets we serve, we do see the potential for continuing volatility in demand due to the weak pace of economic recovery in the United States and globally.
Our performance expectations have not changed materially during the past quarter. Key indicators continue to suggest that the U.S. non-residential construction market, a key market for the Company, is expected to grow modestly through fiscal 2013. Also, third-party forecasts suggest that the North American lighting market, which includes renovation and relight activity, will continue to outpace the growth rate of new construction. We believe opportunities exist that will allow us to continue to outperform the markets we serve, including benefits from growing renovation and tenant improvement projects, further expansion in underpenetrated geographies and channels, and growth from the introduction of innovative products and lighting solutions.
Mr. Nagel concluded, We believe the lighting and lighting-related industry will experience solid growth over the next decade, particularly as energy and environmental concerns come to the forefront, and we believe we are well positioned to fully participate in this exciting industry.

Acuity Brands Reports Fiscal 2012 Fourth Quarter and Full Year Results
Fiscal 2012 Net Sales Rise 8% and Adjusted Diluted EPS Increases 24%
ATLANTA, October 2, 2012
- Acuity Brands, Inc. (NYSE: AYI) (Company) today announced fiscal 2012 fourth quarter net sales of $514.3 million, an increase of $18.1 million, or approximately 4 percent, compared with the year-ago period. Fiscal 2012 fourth quarter net income was $33.3 million compared with $34.2 million for the prior-year period. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 were $0.78 compared with $0.79 reported for the prior-year period. Included in the results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 were a pre-tax special charge and expenses associated with streamlining actions totaling $6.5 million, or $0.10 per diluted share as explained below. Excluding the special charge and related expenses, fiscal 2012 fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS were $0.88, an increase of 11 percent compared with the year-ago period.
Fiscal 2012 fourth quarter results included $2.8 million of net miscellaneous expense, or $0.04 per diluted share, compared with $1.7 million of net miscellaneous income, or $0.03 per diluted share, in the prior-year period. Net miscellaneous income/expense consists primarily of gains and losses resulting from the impact of exchange rates changes on foreign currency exposures, particularly those associated with the Mexican Peso.
For the full year of fiscal 2012, the Company reported net sales of $1,933.7 million, an annual increase of approximately 8 percent. Adjusted diluted EPS for the full year of fiscal 2012 were $3.00, an increase of 24 percent over the prior year.
Vernon J. Nagel, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Acuity Brands, commented, We were very pleased with our fiscal 2012 fourth quarter and full year results as we continued to execute our strategies to extend our leadership position in North America. Our profitability and cash flow for the quarter and full year were once again strong while we continued to fund areas with significant future growth potential, including the expansion of our industry-leading portfolio of lighting solutions.
Fiscal 2012 Fourth Quarter Results
Over two-thirds of the approximate 4 percent year-over-year increase in fourth quarter net sales was due to higher volume with the balance due primarily to the net favorable change in product prices and the mix of products sold. The increase in volume was fairly broad-based across most product categories. The impact on net sales from acquisitions and foreign currency was not significant. Sales of LED-based products grew by more than two-and-a-half times over the prior-year period and represented approximately 12 percent of fiscal 2012 fourth quarter net sales.
News Release
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, the Company recorded a pre-tax special charge related to streamlining activities of $2.1 million, or $0.03 per diluted share. The special charge was associated with the previously announced planned closing of the Cochran, Georgia production facility and consisted primarily of production transfer costs. In addition to the special charge, the Company incurred $3.2 million of higher costs, or $0.05 per diluted share, directly related to manufacturing inefficiencies associated with the closing of the facility as well as $1.2 million of non-cash expenses, or $0.02 per diluted share, related to the abandonment of certain otherwise usable inventory at the facility.
Fiscal 2012 fourth quarter gross profit margin increased 50 basis points to 40.9 percent compared with 40.4 percent for the prior-year period. Excluding the impact of the expenses directly associated with the closing of the Cochran facility, adjusted gross profit margin increased 140 basis points to 41.8 percent compared with the prior-year period.
Operating profit for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 was $61.2 million, or 11.9 percent of net sales, compared with $55.8 million, or 11.2 percent of net sales, for the prior-year period. Excluding expenses associated with the closing of the Cochran facility, adjusted operating profit for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 was $67.7 million, a 21 percent increase over the prior-year period. Adjusted operating profit margin for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 was 13.2 percent, which represents a 200 basis point improvement over the year-ago period.
The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 was 34.4 percent compared with 31.7 percent for the prior-year period. The effective tax rate for the prior-year period was favorably impacted by various discrete items, including federal and state tax credits, which did not occur in the fourth quarter of the fiscal 2012.
Fiscal 2012 Full Year Results
Fiscal 2012 net sales were $1,933.7 million compared with $1,795.7 million for the prior-year period, an increase of approximately 8 percent. Operating profit for fiscal 2012 was $208.0 million compared with $188.7 million for the year-ago period. Net income for fiscal 2012 was $116.3 million compared with $105.5 million for fiscal 2011. Diluted EPS for fiscal 2012 and 2011 were $2.72 and $2.42, respectively. Excluding the impact of special charges and expenses associated with the closing of the Cochran facility, adjusted operating profit was $225.7 million, or 11.7 percent of net sales, which is a 120 basis point improvement over the prior year. Excluding the impact of special charges and expenses associated with the closing of the Cochran facility, fiscal 2012 adjusted diluted EPS were $3.00, a 24 percent increase over the prior year.
Fiscal 2012 full-year results included $1.7 million of net miscellaneous income, or $0.03 per diluted share, compared with $1.2 million of net miscellaneous expense, or $0.02 per diluted share, in the prior-year period.
News Release
Cash and cash equivalents totaled approximately $285 million at August 31, 2012. For the 2012 fiscal year, the Company generated over $172 million in net cash from operating activities. The Company's debt to total capitalization ratio (calculated by dividing total debt by the sum of total debt and total stockholders' equity) was 30 percent at August 31, 2012. The ratio of debt, net of cash, to total capitalization, net of cash, was 8 percent at August 31, 2012.
2012 Special Charges and Expenses Associated with Streamlining Activities
During fiscal 2012, the Company incurred a total of $17.7 million of pre-tax special charges for streamlining activities and for expenses associated with the closing of the Cochran production facility. The $17.7 million consisted of special charges related to streamlining activities totaling $13.3 million, $3.2 million of higher costs directly related to manufacturing inefficiencies associated with the closing of the Cochran facility, and $1.2 million of non-cash expenses related to the abandonment of certain otherwise usable inventory at the facility. The Company expects to record an additional pre-tax special charge of approximately $2 million associated with the closing of the Cochran facility along with related production inefficiencies of approximately $3 million, however, the amounts could vary depending on the timing of the transfer of production. The Company estimates that the total annualized pre-tax savings associated with all streamlining activities initiated in 2012, including the closure of the Cochran facility, to be approximately $14 million of which approximately $4 million was realized in fiscal 2012, including $2 million of benefits realized in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. The Company expects to be at the total annualized savings run rate from the streamlining activities by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2013 following the completion of the transfer of production and closure of the facility.
Outlook
Mr. Nagel commented, We remain very positive about the future prospects for our Company and our ability to outperform the markets we serve. We continue to position the Company to optimize short-term performance while investing in and deploying resources to capitalize on our long-term profitable growth opportunities. While we are optimistic about our future prospects and ability to outperform the markets we serve, we do see the possibility for continuing volatility in demand due to the weak pace of economic recovery in the United States and globally.
The North American lighting market appears to have experienced a slowdown in the rate of growth over the past few months, reflecting both a tepid economic recovery in the U.S. and macro-level uncertainties in the U.S. and globally. Third-party forecasts for the U.S. non-residential construction market, a key market for the company, remain favorable though estimates for growth vary significantly. The current consensus estimate is that non-residential construction will grow modestly through our fiscal 2013 while the growth rate
News Release
for the North American lighting market will be higher, suggesting growth in the mid-single digit range for fiscal 2013. We believe opportunities exist that will allow us to continue to outperform the markets we serve, including benefits from growing renovation and tenant improvement projects, further expansion in underpenetrated geographies and channels, and growth from the introduction of innovative products and lighting solutions.
Mr. Nagel concluded, We believe the lighting and lighting-related industry will experience solid growth over the next decade, particularly as energy and environmental concerns come to the forefront, and we believe we are well positioned to fully participate in this exciting industry.
The independent registered public accountants' audit opinion with respect to the Company's fiscal year-end financial statements will not be issued until the Company completes its annual report on Form 10-K, including its evaluation of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting. Accordingly, the financial results reported in this earnings release are preliminary pending completion of the audit.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Acuity Brands' management included in the above news release the terms adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross profit margin, adjusted operating profit, adjusted operating profit margin, adjusted net income, and adjusted diluted EPS which are non-U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), or non-GAAP, financial measures provided to enhance the user's overall understanding of the Company's current financial performance and prospects for the future. Specifically, management believes that adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross profit margin, adjusted operating profit, adjusted operating profit margin, adjusted net income, and adjusted diluted EPS provide useful information to investors by excluding or adjusting items related to special charges and additional costs associated with the closing of the Cochran production facility, which affected fiscal 2012 gross profit, operating profit, net income and diluted EPS. Management believes the special charges and additional costs impacted the comparability of the Company's results and that these items are not reflective of costs that the Company will incur over the long term. However, we have incurred similar charges in prior fiscal years and continually evaluate streamlining measures which could result in additional charges in future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, results prepared in accordance with GAAP. The most directly comparable GAAP measure for adjusted gross profit and adjusted gross profit margin are gross profit and gross profit margin, respectively, which include the impact of costs associated with the closing of the Cochran facility. The most directly comparable GAAP measure for adjusted operating profit and adjusted operating profit margin are operating profit and operating profit margin, respectively, which include the impact of the special charges and the costs associated with the closing of the Cochran facility. The most directly comparable GAAP measures for adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS are net income
News Release
and diluted EPS, respectively; both GAAP measures include the impact of the special charges and the costs associated with the closing of the Cochran facility. The non-GAAP financial measures included in this news release have been reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure.

Acuity Brands Reports Fiscal 2013 First Quarter Results
Adjusted Diluted EPS of $0.69 on 1.4 Percent Rise in Net Sales
ATLANTA, January 8, 2013 - Acuity Brands, Inc. (NYSE: AYI) (Company) today announced fiscal 2013 first quarter net sales were $481.1 million, an increase of $6.8 million, or 1.4 percent, compared with the year-ago period. Excluding special charges and related temporary expenses in both periods, fiscal 2013 first quarter adjusted net income was $29.6 million compared with adjusted net income of $31.6 million for the prior-year period. Adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS) for the first quarter of fiscal 2013 were $0.69 compared with adjusted diluted EPS of $0.74 for the year-ago period. Additionally, adjusted diluted EPS were basically flat year over year after excluding the impact of prior year's first quarter net miscellaneous income of $2.9 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, which was primarily attributable to currency-related gains that did not repeat this year. Net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2013 was $26.1 million, or $0.61 diluted EPS, compared with $29.9 million, or $0.70 diluted EPS, for the year-ago period. A detailed discussion of adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS, together with a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is provided below.
Vernon J. Nagel, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Acuity Brands, commented, Our first quarter results reflect what we believe was a lull in demand in the nonresidential construction market as well as temporary inefficiencies and costs associated with the closure of our Cochran, Georgia production facility. As indicated in our fourth quarter SEC filings, earnings release and conference call, we cautioned that end-customer demand could be inconsistent and tepid, particularly during the first half of the year, due to the weak pace of economic recovery in the U.S. and abroad. Although shipment volume increased modestly in the first quarter as compared with the year-ago period, it appeared certain customers took a "wait and see" approach surrounding the uncertainties of the outcomes of the U.S. elections and the resolution of the pending fiscal cliff resulting in weak demand. In spite of these market conditions, I am pleased to report that excluding the costs and inefficiencies associated with the ongoing closure process of our Cochran facility, adjusted operating profit margins remained solid at 11.2 percent. While we currently see favorable trends in our daily order rate, we still expect demand to be volatile in our
second quarter, as businesses and consumers adjust their spending plans to take into account the uncertainties associated with U.S. fiscal policy and global economic concerns. We currently believe this will be followed by more stable demand in the second half of our fiscal 2013.
First Quarter Results
The year-over-year growth in fiscal 2013 first quarter net sales was due primarily to an increase in volume, partially offset by a slightly net unfavorable change in product prices and the mix of products sold. While the increase in volume was fairly broad-based across most product categories and key sales channels in North America, the Company did observe some postponement or cancellation of certain projects. The impact on net sales from acquisitions and foreign currency was not significant. Sales of LED-based products grew by more than two-and-a-half times over the prior-year period and represented approximately 13 percent of fiscal 2013 first quarter net sales.
Fiscal 2013 first quarter gross profit margin decreased 140 basis points to 39.4 percent compared with 40.8 percent for the prior-year period. Excluding the impact of the expenses directly associated with the closing of the Cochran facility as discussed below, adjusted gross profit margin decreased 40 basis points to 40.4 percent compared with the prior-year period. The decline in adjusted gross profit margin was due primarily to an increase in expenses associated with new product introductions and higher manufacturing costs related to slight changes in the mix of products sold, partially offset by the favorable impact of increased net sales, lower material and component costs, and realized productivity improvements associated with ongoing streamlining activities.
Operating profit for the first quarter of fiscal 2013 was $48.2 million, or 10.0 percent of net sales, compared with $50.6 million, or 10.7 percent of net sales, for the prior-year period. Excluding expenses associated with the closing of the Cochran facility as discussed below, adjusted operating profit for the first quarter of fiscal 2013 was $53.7 million, a 1 percent increase over the prior-year period's adjusted operating profit of $53.3 million. Adjusted operating profit margin for the first quarter of both fiscal 2013 and 2012 was 11.2 percent.
Fiscal 2013 first quarter results included $0.1 million of net miscellaneous expense compared with $2.9 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, of net miscellaneous income in the prior-year period. Net miscellaneous expense/income consists primarily of gains and losses resulting from the impact of exchange rates changes on foreign currency exposures, particularly those associated with the Mexican Peso.
Special Charges and Temporary Expenses Associated with Streamlining Activities
Included in the results for the first quarter of fiscal 2013 were a pre-tax special charge and temporary expenses associated with previously announced streamlining actions, primarily to close a production facility, totaling $5.5 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, as explained below. Included in the results for the first quarter of the prior year was a $2.7 million pre-tax special charge, or $0.04 per diluted share, associated with other streamlining actions.
The current year pre-tax special charge and temporary expenses totaling $5.5 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, was comprised of a pre-tax special charge of $0.7 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, and $4.8 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, of costs related to temporary manufacturing inefficiencies associated with the closing of the Cochran production facility. The special charge consisted principally of production transfer costs from the Cochran facility to other locations. The $4.8 million of manufacturing inefficiencies consisted primarily of: non-productive operating costs at the Cochran facility; expenses associated with the initial set-up of production at various facilities that have assumed the production of products previously manufactured at the Cochran facility; and incremental costs associated with production-related activities performed by third-parties that are now largely produced internally as the Company's manufacturing capacity has since been increased to accommodate the transfer of production.
The Company expects that the closure of the Cochran facility will be principally completed by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2013. Management forecasts that additional costs of approximately $4 million associated with the closing of the Cochran facility will be incurred in the second fiscal quarter. The costs are expected to once again be comprised of a pre-tax special charge along with temporary production inefficiencies. Assuming no further delays in obtaining government permits and approvals or in ramping-up production at the receiving facilities, management anticipates that the Cochran facility will totally cease production by the end of the second fiscal quarter and no further costs related to this streamlining effort will be incurred thereafter.
The Company estimates that the total annualized pre-tax savings associated with all streamlining activities initiated in 2012, including the closure of the Cochran facility, to be approximately $14 million of which approximately $4 million was realized in fiscal 2012. The Company realized approximately $2 million of benefits (excluding the inefficiencies noted above) in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 and expects to be at the total annualized savings run rate from the streamlining activities beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2013 following the completion of the transfer of production and closure of the facility.
Outlook
Mr. Nagel commented, As we look to the second quarter, typically our softest due to seasonality, we expect demand to continue to be inconsistent. Due to the recent slowdown in the rate of growth over the past several months, we believe the growth rate for the North American lighting market may be tempered somewhat to the low to mid-single digit range. We remain cautiously optimistic that we will continue to outperform the markets we serve while delivering financial results for the full fiscal year more consistent with our long-term financial objectives as identified in our recent Form 10-K.
Mr. Nagel concluded, We believe the lighting and lighting-related industry will experience solid growth over the next decade, particularly as energy and environmental concerns come to the forefront, and we believe we are well positioned to fully participate in this exciting industry.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Acuity Brands' management included in the above news release the terms adjusted gross profit,adjusted gross profit margin, adjusted operating profit, adjusted operating profit margin, adjusted net income, and adjusted diluted EPS which are non-U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), or non-GAAP, financial measures provided to enhance the user's overall understanding of the Company's current financial performance and prospects for the future. Specifically, management believes that adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross profit margin, adjusted operating profit, adjusted operating profit margin, adjusted net income, and adjusted diluted EPS provide useful information to investors by excluding or adjusting items related to special charges and additional costs associated with the closing of the Cochran production facility, which affected fiscal 2013 gross profit as well as fiscal 2013 and 2012 operating profit, net income and diluted EPS. Management believes the special charges and additional costs impacted the comparability of the Company's results and that these items are not reflective of costs that the Company will incur over the long term. However, we have incurred similar charges in prior fiscal years and continually evaluate streamlining measures which could result in additional charges in future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, results prepared in accordance with GAAP. The most directly comparable GAAP measure for adjusted gross profit and adjusted gross profit margin are gross profit and gross profit margin, respectively,which include the impact of costs associated with the closing of the Cochran facility. The most directly comparable GAAP measure for adjusted operating profit and adjusted operating profit margin are operating profit and operating profit margin, respectively, which include the impact of the special charges and the costs associated

Acuity Brands Reports Fiscal 2013 Second Quarter Results
Net Sales Rise 6 Percent to $487 Million; Adjusted Diluted EPS Increase 9 Percent to $0.62
ATLANTA, April 3, 2013 - Acuity Brands, Inc. (NYSE: AYI) (Company) today announced fiscal 2013 second quarter net sales were $486.7 million, an increase of $29.0 million, or 6 percent, compared with the year-ago period. Excluding special charges and related temporary expenses in both periods, fiscal 2013 second quarter adjusted net income was $26.7 million compared with adjusted net income of $24.0 million for the prior-year period, an increase of 11 percent. Adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS) for the second quarter of fiscal 2013 were $0.62 compared with adjusted diluted EPS of $0.57 for the year-ago period, an increase of 9 percent. Net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2013 was $24.7 million, or $0.57 diluted EPS, compared with $19.5 million, or $0.46 diluted EPS, for the year-ago period. A detailed discussion of adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS, together with a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is provided below.
Vernon J. Nagel, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Acuity Brands, commented, We are pleased with our fiscal 2013 second quarter results as we continue to execute our strategies to extend our leadership in the North American lighting market through the introduction of new and more energy-efficient lighting solutions, including the acquisitions of Adura Technologies and eldoLED to expand our wireless lighting controls and high-performance, intelligent drivers for LED-based lighting systems.
Mr. Nagel continued, The year-over-year and sequential increase in net sales reflects favorable trends in order rates that we experienced during the second quarter as well as the continuing adoption of LED lighting solutions, which more than doubled from a year-ago and now represents approximately 15 percent of our total sales. We believe that second quarter sales growth was positively influenced by customer projects that were delayed from the first quarter and released during the second quarter as the resolution to various political and budgetary uncertainties became clearer. This influx of orders from certain channels had a distortive impact on the mix of products sold and unfavorably impacted gross profit margins in the second quarter. Our second quarter results also included temporary inefficiencies and costs associated with the closure of our Cochran, Georgia production facility which was principally completed by the end of the quarter. Excluding these costs and inefficiencies, adjusted operating profit margin was 9.9 percent, which was virtually flat with the prior year.
Second Quarter Results
The year-over-year growth in fiscal 2013 second quarter net sales was due primarily to a more than 9 percent increase in sales volume, partially offset by a net unfavorable change in prices and the mix of products sold. The impact on net sales from acquisitions and foreign currency was not significant. The increase in sales volume was fairly broad-based across most product categories and key sales channels in North America. While it is not possible to precisely quantify the separate impact of changes in product prices and the mix of products sold (price/mix), management estimates that the net unfavorable price/mix was due primarily to a disproportionately higher mix of lower-margin products sold this quarter as a result of an increase in the number of large renovation projects, particularly for national retailers, as well as a greater amount of value-oriented products sold through certain sales channels. Additionally, price/mix was influenced by a reduction in the sales price of certain LED luminaires reflecting the continued decline in the cost of certain purchased LED components.
Fiscal 2013 second quarter gross profit margin was 39.0 percent compared with 39.7 percent for the prior-year period. Excluding the impact of the expenses directly associated with the closing of the Cochran facility as discussed below, fiscal 2013 second quarter adjusted gross profit margin was 39.6 percent. Adjusted gross profit margin was virtually flat compared with the year-ago period as changes in both the mix of products sold and sales channels was offset by the favorable impact of increased net sales, lower material and component costs, and realized productivity improvements primarily associated with ongoing streamlining activities.
Operating profit for the second quarter of fiscal 2013 was $45.1 million compared with $39.0 million for the prior-year period. Excluding expenses associated with the closing of the Cochran facility as discussed below, adjusted operating profit for the second quarter of fiscal 2013 was $48.2 million compared with the prior-year period's adjusted operating profit of $45.6 million. The adjusted operating profit margin for the second quarter of fiscal 2013 was 9.9 percent, virtually flat with the prior-year period.
Fiscal 2013 second quarter results included $0.1 million of net miscellaneous expense compared with $1.1 million for the prior-year period. Net miscellaneous expense consisted primarily of losses resulting from the impact of exchange rate changes on foreign currency exposures, particularly those associated with the Mexican Peso. The effective income tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal 2013 was 33.6 percent compared with 35.4 percent for the year-ago period. The decrease in the effective tax rate was due primarily to the retroactive application of the research and development tax credit included in the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 that became law during the second fiscal quarter.
Special Charges and Temporary Expenses Associated with Streamlining Activities
Included in the results for the second quarter of fiscal 2013 were a pre-tax special charge and temporary expenses associated with previously announced streamlining actions, primarily to close a production facility, totaling $3.1 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, as explained below. Included in the results for the second quarter of the prior year was a $6.6 million pre-tax special charge, or $0.11 per diluted share, associated with streamlining actions.
The current year pre-tax special charge and temporary expenses totaling $3.1 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, was comprised of a pre-tax special charge of $0.3 million and $2.8 million of costs related to temporary manufacturing inefficiencies associated with the closing of the Cochran production facility. The special charge consisted principally of production transfer costs from the Cochran facility to other locations. The $2.8 million of manufacturing inefficiencies consisted primarily of non-productive operating costs at the Cochran facility and expenses associated with the initial set-up of production at various facilities that have assumed the production of products previously manufactured at the Cochran facility. Management forecasts that additional temporary production inefficiencies of approximately $1 million may be incurred in the fiscal third quarter.
As previously noted, management estimates that the total annualized pre-tax savings associated with all streamlining activities initiated in 2012, including the closure of the Cochran facility, to be approximately $14 million of which approximately $4 million was realized in fiscal 2012. The Company realized approximately $6 million of benefits (excluding the inefficiencies noted above) in the first half of fiscal 2013, and is now at the total annualized savings run rate.
Year-to-Date Results
Net sales for the first six months of fiscal 2013 were $967.8 million compared with $932.0 million for the prior-year period, an increase of approximately 4 percent. Fiscal 2013 first half reported results include operating profit of $93.3 million, net income of $50.8 million, and diluted EPS of $1.18. Adjusted results, which exclude the special charge and temporary expenses associated with streamlining activities, include adjusted operating profit of $101.9 million, or 10.5 percent of net sales, compared with adjusted operating profit of $98.8 million, or 10.6 percent of net sales, for the prior-year period. Adjusted net income for the first half of fiscal 2013 was $56.3 million compared with $55.8 million for the prior-year period. Adjusted diluted EPS for both the first half of fiscal 2013 and 2012 were $1.31.
Outlook
Mr. Nagel commented, Our performance expectations for fiscal 2013 have not changed materially during the past quarter. Third-party forecasts and leading indicators suggest that the North American lighting
market, which includes renovation and relight activity, will increase in the mid-single digits during the remainder of our fiscal 2013. While we still expect to see some volatility in demand among certain sales channels and geographies, our expectation for the second half of fiscal 2013 is that overall demand in our end markets will continue to improve and be more consistent and broad-based. The favorable trend in our March order rates reflects this improvement. We believe opportunities continue to exist that will allow us to continue to outperform the markets we serve. These opportunities include benefits from growing renovation and tenant improvement projects, further expansion in underpenetrated geographies and channels, and growth from the introduction of new products and lighting solutions.
Mr. Nagel concluded, We believe the lighting and lighting-related industry will experience solid growth over the next decade, particularly as energy and environmental concerns come to the forefront, and we believe we are well positioned to fully participate in this exciting industry.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Acuity Brands' management included in the above news release the terms adjusted operating profit, adjusted operating profit margin, adjusted net income, and adjusted diluted EPS which are non-GAAP financial measures provided to enhance the user's overall understanding of the Company's current financial performance and prospects for the future. Specifically, management believes that adjusted operating profit, adjusted operating profit margin, adjusted net income, and adjusted diluted EPS provide useful information to investors by excluding or adjusting items related to special charges associated with efforts to streamline the organization, which affected fiscal 2013 second quarter operating profit, net income and diluted EPS. Management believes the special charges impacted the comparability of the Company's results and that these items are not reflective of fixed costs that the Company will incur over the long term. However, we have incurred similar charges in prior fiscal years and continually evaluate streamlining measures which could result in additional charges in future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, results prepared in accordance with GAAP. The most directly comparable GAAP measure for adjusted operating profit and adjusted operating profit margin are operating profit and operating profit margin, respectively, which include the impact of the special charges. The most directly comparable GAAP measures for adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS are net income and diluted EPS, respectively; both GAAP measures include the impact of the special charges. The non-GAAP financial measures included in this news release have been reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure.
Conference Call
As previously announced, the Company will host a conference call to discuss second quarter results today, April 3, 2013, at 10:00 a.m. ET. Interested parties may listen to this call live today or hear a replay at the Company's Web site:
