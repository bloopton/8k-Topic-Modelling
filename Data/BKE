Exhibit 99.2 We appreciate the opportunity to present today and share with you information about The Buckle. In addition to reviewing financial information, we'll also share with you the vision and the culture of our company. As you probably know, we specialize in casual fashions and our target customers include young men and women between the ages of 12 and 24. By department/class, last year our business was about 47 percent guys and 53 percent gals. By offering both guys and gals merchandise we have unique opportunities for merchandising and we gain flexibility in adapting to changing trends in fashion. We began as a single store in Kearney and Kearney still remains our corporate headquarters and only distribution center today. During fiscal 2003 we'll open 15 new stores as well as remodel 15 stores. We'll grow to approximately 319 stores in 38 states by holiday 2003, with 2-3 potential store closures prior to fiscal year end. For fiscal 2004, at this point in time, we anticipate opening 12-15 new stores and 8-12 full remodels. Our stores are in markets with an average population of over 200,000, with communities ranging in size from 25,000 to more than a million. Our average store size is approximately 4850 sq. ft., with flexibility to adapt to larger or smaller space as opportunities exist. Our distribution system is capable of handling up to 450 stores, with the ability for further expansion to service 650 stores. Our distribution center has the ability to hold part of the goods as they arrive at the DC and then we fill in stores as merchandisers watch weekly and daily selling trends. Our headquarters is tied into every store through a centralized MIS and point of purchase reporting system that allows us to track sales, trends and inventory on a daily basis. The exchange of information with the stores and the ability to utilize centralized decision making has helped produce positive results. Many of you, I'm sure follow our financial results, so I'll talk just briefly about our recent results. Fiscal 2002 net sales were over $401 million compared to $338 million just 5 years ago. Our compound growth rate for net sales for the five-year period ending February 1, 2003, was approximately 9%. The past few years we've experienced a tough retail environment. Our fiscal 2002 comparable store sales decreased just 0.5% and our average sales per square foot were $274 compared with $279 in the previous 7
year. Our average sales per store also decreased in fiscal 2002-going from $1.352 million to $1.334 million per store. With slightly negative comparable store sales and with the past 4 year's new stores being in some more expensive markets, we saw reverse leverage in our occupancy costs which decreased gross margin from 33% in 2001 to 32.8% in fiscal 2002. Merchandise margins improved during fiscal 2002, helping to partially offset the higher occupancy costs in during the year. Our earnings per share on a diluted basis were $1.47 for fiscal 2002 compared to $1.52 for fiscal 2001. Current analysts estimates for fiscal 2003 diluted earnings per share are $1.46 and for fiscal 2004 $1.54 - a 5.5% increase from fiscal 2003's estimate. Now I'd like to touch on our current year results. Net sales for the first six months were $167.4 million, up 2.5% from last year. And comparable store sales were down 1.1%. YTD net earnings for the two quarters were down 21% to $6.6 million or $.31 per share compared to $.38 for the 1st two quarters of fiscal 2002. The Buckle went public in May 1992 at a price of $4.50 per share-adjusted for our 1997 two-for-one stock split and our 1998 3:2 stock split. That price per share is over $20 today. Last week we announced our first ever quarterly dividend of $.10 per share to be paid on October 27, 2003 to shareholders of record at the close of business on October 15, 2003. We feel this added return will be welcome by shareholders. Also, important to our shareholders is our consistent return on net equity which has averaged 20% over the past 5 years. We intend to continue growing sensibly. We take a methodical approach to identifying new markets for The Buckle. In 2002 we rolled out a new store design and it has been very well received. Our new design brings together a cohesive corporate vision including a signature red color and a B icon. This new design build out costs include $540,000 in capital expenditures, prior to construction allowance, and approximately $170,000 in inventory, net of payables. Our new design includes inviting merchandise displays and fixtures to help create an even more enjoyable shopping experience. Some of the fixture innovations were rolled out to all existing stores during fiscal 8
2002. I will now turn the presentation over to Kyle as she covers information regarding our corporate web site and online store. When we launched our internet website in the Fall of 1995, it was created to promote the image of our mall stores and provide information about the Company. Then, on April 26, 1999, we launched an online store with 125 items. Our online store offers shoppers the opportunity to purchase items from a limited selection of the merchandise found in our stores. The online store carries select merchandise from vendors such as Lucky Brand, Silver, Fossil, Quiksilver, Billabong, Ecko, Dr. Martens, and The Buckle's private label brands. In December of 2002, we redesigned our site and added some new features. We enhanced our search capabilities within the site, enabling guests to find what they want quickly. We have continued to expand our product offerings and offer style centers that feature current looks and brands. Our denim guide also assists guests as they determine the looks and fits that will meet their needs. Since one of the main focuses of our website is to market our brick and mortar stores, our web marketing efforts track what we are featuring in our stores. For example, our latest image piece that we give to in-store guests is featured online as well. We feature an upgraded store search tool that helps guests locate their nearest Buckle store and look at the schedule for new store openings. The Buckle remains focused on customer service and quality as we continue to enhance our website and online store's functionality. We continue to build our e-mail database through online and in-store promotions. Soon, we will begin implementing a new data analytics solution that will better enable us to analyze our customer shopping experiences and sales results. Search engine optimization continues to enable us to market specific products and increase traffic to the site. The Buckle's web team continues to keep their focus on enhancing our brand image across all channels. As our website grows, we will continually look for more ways to enhance our guests' shopping experiences. Now Karen will spend a little time on how we approach our business, our people and our future as a company. 9
We have an outstanding team of executives with many years of service. Our 2 vice presidents of sales have each been with the company for 25 years and our top 4 merchandisers have a total of 100 years with the company. We also have longevity from our other officers, regional managers, district managers, and others within our corporate headquarters. Another strength has been our real estate. As we look at new markets, we focus on regional shopping centers with location, economics, and availability of store management being very important factors that enter into our decisions. We analyze the total package before simply making a decision on available space. Our controlled growth allows us to do a better job of selecting the best sites, and allows us to maximize our growth opportunities. Our history of retail success has made The Buckle very attractive to mall developers for a number of reasons: our great look and strong sales; our merchandise is unique, and of high quality; our outstanding service encourages strong customer relationships; and our strong balance sheet gives landlords confidence that we will be a long-term tenant. Our goal is to maximize the return on investment for each store, and to capitalize on the potential of each store manager. Our managers receive incentive pay based upon their store's performance, and they work hard to help their stores succeed. As a result, we are committed to a strategy of controlled growth and consistent return on investment. Our balance sheet reflects the wisdom of this approach. We have been able to grow using internal resources exclusively. We have no long-term or short-term debt. At the end of the 2nd quarter we had over $148 million in cash and investments. The strength of our cash position provides us with a multitude of opportunities. It allows us to quickly capitalize on the best situations as they arise, and it gives us leverage with landlords. In our retail sector we feel that the two areas where we compete very well are customer service and merchandise selection. The key to our merchandising success is a combination of experience, teamwork, and commitment, allowing us to stay in tune with our Guests' tastes and stay on target with the merchandise. 10
Also, our experience helps us avoid costly mistakes, and that helps maintain a strong merchandise margin. The fact that most of our buyers have actual sales floor experience, and stay in touch with the stores on a regular basis, helps even further. Our merchandise strategy is simple - to offer the best selection of styles from the hottest brands in the marketplace. The Buckle is one of a select group of specialty store chains that carries Lucky Brand, Dr. Martens and Silver. The list of top vendors may change from year to year-since our success is based in part on our ability to manage the cycle of change in the fashion industry and to continue to shop for the best vendors. We work hard to maintain the perfect balance of brand names, private labels, and exclusive merchandise. The Buckle continues to be a denim trendsetter-and denim is definitely a mainstay of our business. Denim at The Buckle is strong, accounting for 32% of our sales for the 1st half of this year. In addition to the merchandise selection, we work to continually raise the bar in terms of customer service. At The Buckle, our mission is to create the most enjoyable shopping experience possible for our guests. Our goal is to create the opportunity for our teammates to succeed, and to demonstrate that The Buckle offers the best possible experience for our teammates, and our guests. For that reason, when we open a store we look internally for a Buckle teammate with a proven track record; a talented leader who understands the Buckle culture, and whom we believe is ready for the challenge of managing a new store. The sales management team includes two vice presidents of sales and 15 district managers whose experience with the company ranges from ten to twenty-five years each. These leaders began their careers working on the sales floor at The Buckle. Our network of area and district managers work closely with store managers, providing guidance, encouragement and support. We have built an organization that is responsive to the market; one that encourages customer loyalty, and trust, as well as employee commitment, and growth. We're building the future of The Buckle on the strength of experience, our people, and our balance sheet. We have established a strong base, but we're always looking to improve. We're confident in the future for The Buckle and feel that our marketing, merchandising, and management strategy will help both the company and its shareholders enjoy in it's success. 11

ITEM 2.02. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION On March 3, 2005, The Buckle, Inc. announced financial results for its fourth quarter ended January 29, 2005. The full text of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report. The information shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"), as amended, and shall not be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act, except as set forth by specific reference in such filing. ITEM 4.02(a). NON-RELIANCE ON PREVIOUSLY ISSUED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OR A RELATED AUDIT REPORT OR COMPLETE INTERIM REVIEW On March 3, 2005, The Buckle, Inc. announced that it will make corrections to its accounting for leases following review of the guidance set forth in the SEC's February 7, 2005, letter from the Office of the Chief Accountant to the Center for Public Company Audit Firms which clarified certain issues related to the accounting for operating leases and leasehold improvements. The Company has determined that its method of accounting for construction allowances and rent holidays is not consistent with the accounting as described in the SEC's letter and is also correcting its financial statements for other adjustments to straight-line rent expense. In prior periods, the Company reported the unamortized portion of construction allowances from landlords as a reduction of property and equipment on its balance sheet rather than as a deferred rent credit. In addition, the Company's past statements of cash flows reported construction allowances as a reduction of capital expenditures within cash flows from investing activities, rather than cash flows from operating activities. Also in prior periods, the Company recognized rent expense for leases beginning on the opening date of store operations, which had the effect of excluding the store build-out period (during which the Company typically makes no rent payments) from the period used for calculating rent. The Company's statements of income and selected financial data included in its March 3, 2005, press release reflect the above referenced corrections in its lease accounting policies. Additionally, The Buckle is in the process of finalizing its analysis of the impact of these lease accounting changes and will restate the Company's financial statements as of January 31, 2004, and February 1, 2003, and for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2004, February 1, 2003, and February 2, 2002, previously issued in its Annual Report on Form 10-K once the Company's analysis has been finalized. The Buckle will also restate the Company's financial statements as of and for the interim fiscal periods ended October 30, 2004, July 31, 2004, May 1, 2004, November 1, 2003, August 2, 2003, and May 3, 2003, previously issued on Forms 10-Q. Accordingly, these financial statements and related auditors' reports should no longer be relied upon. The Company plans to quantify these restatements in a Form 10-K/A and Forms 10-Q/A to be filed with the SEC as soon as administratively possible. Investors or other interested parties should refer to the Company's filings on Form 10-K/A and Forms 10-Q/A, upon filing with the SEC, for amended information. We have reviewed the accounting treatment and disclosures referred to in this Item 4.02(a) and discussed such treatment and disclosures with Deloitte & Touche LLP, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. For additional information concerning the Company's lease accounting corrections, please refer to the Company's March 3, 2005, press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report. ITEM 9.01(c).

Accountant to the Center for Public Company Audit Firms which clarified certain issues related to the accounting for operating leases and leasehold improvements. The Company has determined that its method of accounting for construction allowances and rent holidays is not consistent with the accounting as described in the SEC's letter and is also correcting its financial statements for other adjustments to straight-line rent expense. Accordingly, the Company plans to restate its financial statements to correct its accounting for these items. In prior periods, the Company reported the unamortized portion of construction allowances from landlords as a reduction of property and equipment on its balance sheet rather than as a deferred rent credit. In addition, the Company's past statements of cash flows reported construction allowances as a reduction of capital expenditures within cash flows from investing activities, rather than cash flows from operating activities. To correct the accounting for construction allowances, the Company's rent expense was decreased by $2.5 million and depreciation expense increased by $2.6 million, for a net impact of $0.1 million for fiscal year ended January 29, 2005. Further, the Company's net property and equipment increased by $16.2 million, and there was an increase in accrued store operating expenses and other long-term liabilities of $16.5 million at January 29, 2005. Shareholders' equity was reduced $0.3 million, net of tax, to reflect the cumulative prior period effect of these adjustments as of January 29, 2005. In prior periods, the Company recognized rent expense for leases beginning on the opening date of store operations, which had the effect of excluding the store build-out period (during which the Company typically makes no rent payments) from the period used for calculating rent. To correct the "rent holidays" and other adjustments to straight-line rent expense, management has recorded the impact of adjusting these items to reflect rent on a straight-line basis as a decrease to currently reported net earnings of $71,000, net of tax, an increase in the straight-line rent liability of $5.6 million, an increase in the deferred asset of $2.1 million and a reduction in Stockholders' equity of $3.4 million, net of tax, to reflect the cumulative prior period effect of this change. The corrections in accounting for lease-related issues reduced reported diluted earnings per share $0.01 for the year ended January 29, 2005. The Buckle will restate the Company's financial statements previously issued in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 31, 2004 and its interim reports on Form 10-Q for each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2004. The Company plans to quantify these restatements in a Form 10-K/A and amended Forms 10-Q to be filed with the SEC as soon as administratively possible. The Company also plans to file with the SEC a report on Form 8-K indicating that the financial statements reported in the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2004 and Forms 10-Q for fiscal 2004 should no longer be relied upon. Investors or other interested parties should refer to the Company's filings on Form 10-K/A and Forms 10-Q/A, upon filing with the SEC, for amended information. The Company has restated the accompanying statements of income and selected financial data to reflect the corrections for the lease accounting policies as discussed above. Headquartered in Kearney, Nebraska, The Buckle, Inc. is a retailer of casual apparel, footwear and accessories for young men and women. It currently operates 327 retail stores in 38 states compared with 316 stores in 38 states at this same time a year ago.

(NYSE: BKE) announced today that it has entered into an agreement with Daniel J. Hirschfeld, founder and Chairman, to purchase a total of 3,000,000 shares of the Company's outstanding stock from Mr. Hirschfeld. The shares represent approximately 13.8% of the Company's total outstanding Common Stock. The shares will be purchased for $28.00 per share, or a total purchase price of $84 million. This price represents a 9.1% discount to the March 24, 2005 closing price, and a 9.7% discount to the five day average closing price ending March 24, 2005. The Company intends to fund the stock repurchase transaction out of currently available cash and investments. This transaction is expected to be completed as soon as possible, subject to certain customary closing conditions. The Buckle expects this stock repurchase transaction to be accretive to earnings per share, without reducing the publicly traded float. For fiscal 2004, the Company reported diluted earnings per share of $1.94 based upon 22,257,290 weighted average shares outstanding. Assuming that the company had repurchased Mr. Hirschfeld's shares at the beginning of fiscal 2004, the weighted average shares for calculating earnings per share would have been 19,257,290. Following the transaction, the Buckle, Inc. will have approximately $150 million in cash and short and long term investments that will allow the Company to maintain the financial flexibility to continue its growth plans. The Company plans to retire the purchased shares, reducing the total shares outstanding and reducing Mr. Hirschfeld's ownership percentage to approximately 53%. The stock repurchase transaction was negotiated by a Special Committee of The Buckle, Inc.'s Board of Directors. The Special Committee was comprised of all of the Company's independent Directors, and therefore the transaction was approved by the independent Directors on the Company's Board. In connection with this transaction, the Special Committee received a written fairness opinion from Houlihan Lokey Howard & Zukin Financial Advisors, Inc., an international investment bank. Headquartered in Kearney, Nebraska, The Buckle, Inc. is a retailer of casual apparel, footwear and accessories for young men and women. It currently operates 328 retail stores in 38 states compared with 316 stores in 38 stated at this same time a year ago.

Accordingly, the Company's future performance and financial results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in any such forward-looking statements.

SETS PROCEDURE FOR SELECTING PRESIDING NON-MANAGEMENT DIRECTOR KEARNEY, NE, October 12, 2005 -- The Buckle, Inc. reported in its Proxy Statement for the annual meeting of stockholders held on June 2, 2005, that its independent Directors meet separately in executive session without employee Directors or representatives of management at each regularly scheduled quarterly meeting of the Board. However, the Company failed to indicate which Director presides at such meetings. Until the annual meeting of the Board of Directors of the Company held on June 2, 2005, both the Compensation Committee and the Audit Committee of the Company were comprised of all of the independent Directors, and only the independent Directors of the Company. William Orr, Chair of the Compensation Committee, and Bill Fairfield, Chair of the Audit Committee, presided at meetings of these Committees, which meetings also constituted executive sessions of the independent Directors. As of June 2, 2005, all of the independent Directors do not serve on any one committee. It is expected that no one Director will preside at all executive sessions of the independent Directors. Rather each Director will preside on a rotating basis in alphabetical order starting with the meeting to be held on December 12, 2005 at which Director Robert E. Campbell will preside. Shareholders may contact the independent non-employee Director, at the following address: Outside Directors The Buckle, Inc. P.O.

ITEM: Non-Reliance on Previously Issued Financial Statements or a Related Audit Report or Completed Interim Review
Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
ITEM 4.02(a) Non-Reliance on Previously Issued Financial Statements or a Related Audit Report or Completed Interim Review
SIGNATURES
ITEM 4.02(a). Non-Reliance on Previously Issued Financial Statements or a Related Audit Report or Completed Interim Review
On March 29, 2006, the management of The Buckle, Inc. (the Company) and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, after discussions with Deloitte & Touche LLP (Deloitte & Touche), the Companys independent registered public accounting firm, concluded that the balance sheets and statements of cash flows included in the Companys Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2005 and Forms 10-Q for each of the three quarters of the fiscal year ended January 28, 2006 should be restated in order to correct certain classification errors, as discussed below. As such, the previously filed financial statements and the report of the independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2005 should no longer be relied upon.
The restatements relate to the classification of auction rate securities both on the balance sheets and in the statements of cash flows. Auction rate securities are highly liquid investments that are reset through a dutch auction process that occurs every 7 to 49 days, depending on the terms of the individual security. Given the liquid nature of such securities, they had previously been classified as cash equivalents on both the balance sheets and in the statements of cash flows. However, given that such auction rate securities have long-term stated maturities and that the issuers of such auction rate securities are under no obligation to redeem them prior to their stated maturities; the Company has determined that its investments in such securities should be classified as short-term available-for-sale investments, rather than as cash equivalents.
This restatement has no impact on previously reported results of operations, total current assets, total assets or stockholders equity. It will, however, result in the restatement of previously reported cash and cash equivalents and short term investments in the balance sheet as of January 29, 2005 in the amount of $133.7 million. It will also result in a $33.3 million and $33.8 million restatement of previously reported net cash flows from investing activities in the statements of cash flows for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2004 and January 29, 2005, respectively.
The
Company plans to restate its financial statements as of January 29, 2005 and for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2004 and January 29, 2005, previously issued in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2005. The Company plans to restate its financial statements for these annual periods in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2006. The Company will also restate its financial statements for the interim periods ended April 30, 2005, July 30, 2005 and October 29, 2005, previously issued on Forms 10-Q, prospectively as it files its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q during fiscal 2006.

ITEM 4.02(a). Non-Reliance on Previously Issued Financial Statements or a Related Audit Report or Completed Interim Review
On June 13, 2006, the management of The Buckle, Inc. (the Company) and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, concluded that the balance sheets as of January 28, 2006 and January 29, 2005 and the statements of cash flows for the fiscal years ended January 28, 2006, January 29, 2005 and January 31, 2004 and the related report of the independent registered public accounting firm included in the Companys previously filed Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2006 should no longer be relied upon due to managements identification of errors in the classification of certain investments.
As disclosed in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2006, subsequent to the issuance of its fiscal 2004 financial statements and during the completion of its fiscal 2005 year-end control procedures relating to the accounting for and disclosure of cash and cash equivalents, management discovered an error related to the prior presentation of investments held in auction-rate securities, which are highly liquid investments that are reset through a dutch auction process that occurs every 7 to 49 days, depending on the terms of the individual security, on the balance sheet and in the statement of cash flows. As a result, the balance sheet as of January 29, 2005 and the statements of cash flows for the fiscal years ended January 29, 2005 and January 31, 2004 were restated in the Companys fiscal 2005 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Subsequent to filing the fiscal 2005 Annual Report on Form 10-K and as a result of control procedures performed during the first quarter of fiscal 2006 relating to the accounting for and disclosure of cash and cash equivalents, management discovered additional errors in the prior presentation of investments held in auction-rate securities and the classification of certain other securities. The additional errors resulted in managements decision to restate the previously issued financial statements included in its 2005 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The restatement will not have any impact on the previously reported statements of income or statements of stockholders equity. It will, however, result in a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $12.7 million and $24.0 million, an increase in short-term investments of $5.2 million and $13.6 million and an increase in long-term investments of $7.5 million and $10.4 million as of January 28, 2006 and January 29, 2005, respectively. On the statement of cash flows, the correction of these errors will result in an increase in the purchases of investments of $9.1 million, $13.6 million and $6.9 million and an increase in proceeds from sales/maturities of investments of $20.4 million, $3.3 million and $10.5 million for the fiscal years ended January 28, 2006, January 29, 2005 and January 31, 2004, respectively.
The Company intends to file as soon as practicable, a Form 10-K/A to amend its Annual Report for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2006 to restate its balance sheet as of January 28, 2006 and January 29, 2005 and its statement of cash flows for the fiscal years ended January 28, 2006, January 29, 2005 and January 31, 2004 as they relate to the presentation of these securities.
The Company will also restate its financial statements for the interim periods ended July 30, 2005 and October 29, 2005, previously issued on Forms 10-Q, prospectively as it files its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q during fiscal 2006. Investors or other interested parties should refer to the Company's Form 10-Q for the Quarterly Period Ended April 29, 2006, filed on June 13, 2006, and the Companys amended Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2006 and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal 2006 interim periods, upon filing with the SEC, for additional information.
The Company has discussed the disclosures contained in this filing with Deloitte & Touche LLP, its independent registered public accounting firm.

The Buckle, Inc.
308/236-8491
KEARNEY, NE
-- The Buckle, Inc. (NYSE: BKE) announced today financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended February 3, 2007.
Net sales for the 14-week fourth quarter ended February 3, 2007 increased 14.1 percent to $175.0 million compared to net sales of $153.4 million for the 13-week fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. Comparable store net sales for the fourth quarter rose 4.8 percent from comparable store net sales for the same 14-week period last year.
Net sales for the 53-week period ended February 3, 2007 increased 5.8 percent to $530.1 million from net sales of $501.1 million for the 52-week period ended January 28, 2006. Comparable store net sales for fiscal 2006 were flat compared to the same 53-week period last year.
Net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 was $22.1 million, or $0.77 per share ($0.73 per share on a diluted basis), compared with $19.1 million, or $0.66 per share ($0.64 per share on a diluted basis) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005.
Net income for the fiscal year ended February 3, 2007 was $55.7 million or $1.93 per share ($1.86 per share on a diluted basis), compared with $51.9 million or $1.76 per share ($1.69 per share on a diluted basis) for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2006.
Earnings per share and the weighted average shares outstanding for the prior year fourth quarter and year-to-date periods have been adjusted to reflect the impact of the Companys 3-for-2 stock split paid in the form of a stock dividend on January 12, 2007.
 
The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123(R),
Share-Based Payments,
(SFAS No. 123(R)) at the beginning of fiscal 2006. The additional compensation expense recognized under SFAS No. 123(R) impacted the Companys basic and diluted earnings per share
 
by 3 cents and 5 cents per share for the fourth quarter ended February 3, 2007 and for the full fiscal year 2006, respectively. The fourth quarter and year-to-date impact of SFAS No. 123(R) includes 2 cents of stock option compensation expense related to the accelerated vesting of certain stock options during the fourth quarter. The accelerated vesting triggered the early recognition of compensation expense related to the stock option grants, which the Company had been recording on a straight line basis over the previously expected remaining vesting period through December 30, 2008. No compensation expense related to stock option grants was recognized by the Company for the prior fiscal year 2005.
During the fourth quarter, the Company achieved its performance goals on the 2006 non-vested stock grant. This changed the Companys estimate of the number of non-vested shares granted by the Company that would ultimately vest. This increase in the number of shares resulted in incremental compensation expense for the fourth quarter that had a 2 cents per share impact on the Companys reported basic and diluted earnings per share for the quarter.  
During fiscal 2006, the Company purchased and retired 654,300 shares of its outstanding common stock at an average price of $24.52 per share. These shares were purchased pursuant to the 1,500,000 share corporate stock repurchase program authorized by the Board of Directors. The Company had 380,100 shares remaining as of February 3, 2007 to be purchased to complete this authorization. The average price and number of shares authorized and purchased above have been adjusted to reflect the impact of the Companys 3-for-2 stock split paid in the form of a stock dividend on January 12, 2007.
As of February 3, 2007, the Company operated 350 retail stores in 38 states compared with 338 stores in 38 states as of January 28, 2006.
Management will hold a conference call at 10:00 a.m. EDT today, to discuss fourth quarter results. To participate in the call, please dial (800) 398-9386 and reference the conference code 865593. A replay of the call will be available for a two-week period beginning March 13, 2007, at 1:30 p.m. EDT by dialing (800) 475-6701 and entering the conference code 865593.
Headquartered in Kearney, Nebraska, The Buckle, Inc. is a retailer of casual apparel, footwear and accessories for young men and women. During February, the Company opened one store and closed one store. It currently operates 350 retail stores in 38 states compared with 340 stores in 38 states at this same time a year ago.

Online sales (which are not included in comparable store sales) increased 56.4 percent to $21.8 million for the 26-week period ended August 1, 2009, compared to the 26-week period ended August 2, 2008.
Net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2009 was $25.0 million, or $0.55 per share ($0.54 per share on a diluted basis), compared with $22.3 million, or $0.49 per share ($0.48 per share on a diluted basis) for the second quarter of fiscal 2008.
Net income for the 26-week fiscal period ended August 1, 2009 was $51.9 million, or $1.14 per share ($1.11 per share on a diluted basis), compared with $41.0 million, or $0.91 per share ($0.88 per share on a diluted basis) for the 26-week fiscal period ended August 2, 2008.
General and administrative expenses for the prior year quarter and year-to-date periods ended August 2, 2008 are reported net of a $3.0 million gain from the involuntary conversion of one of the Companys corporate aircrafts to a monetary asset upon receipt of the insurance proceeds.  The aircraft was destroyed by a tornado that hit the airport in Kearney, Nebraska.  This gain had a $0.04 per share after-tax impact on reported basic and diluted earnings per share for both the prior year quarter and year-to-date periods.
 
 
 
 
Earnings per share and the weighted average shares outstanding for the prior year quarter and year-to-date periods have been adjusted to reflect the impact of the Companys 3-for-2 stock split paid in the form of a stock dividend on October 30, 2008.
Management will hold a conference call at 10:00 a.m. EDT today to discuss results for the quarter.  To participate in the call, please call (877) 531-2989 and reference the conference code 111545.
