ITEM 4. Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant. Effective as of May 31, 2002, AutoNation, Inc. ("AutoNation") appointed Deloitte & Touche LLP ("D&T") as its new independent public accountant. Effective as of May 30, 2002, AutoNation dismissed Arthur Andersen LLP ("Andersen") as its independent public accountant. This change in independent public accountant was approved by the Board of Directors of AutoNation upon the recommendation of the Audit Committee. The change resulted from an evaluation process undertaken by AutoNation to identify a new independent public accountant in light of the recent well-publicized challenges confronting Andersen. During AutoNation's two most recent fiscal years and through the date of this Form 8-K, there were no disagreements between AutoNation and Andersen on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to Andersen's satisfaction, would have caused Andersen to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in connection with its reports. None of the reportable events described under Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K occurred within AutoNation's two most recent fiscal years and through the date of this Form 8-K. The audit reports of Andersen on the consolidated financial statements of AutoNation and its subsidiaries as of and for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 did not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles. AutoNation provided Andersen with a copy of the foregoing disclosures. Attached hereto as Exhibit 16.1 is a copy of Andersen's letter, dated May 30, 2002, stating its agreement with such statements. During AutoNation's two most recent fiscal years and through the date of this Form 8-K, AutoNation did not consult with D&T with respect to the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on AutoNation's consolidated financial statements, or any other matters or reportable events listed in Item 304(a)(2)(i) and (ii) of Regulation S-K.

INDEX TO EXHIBITS Exhibit Exhibit Number Description - ------- ----------- 99.1 Settlement Agreement and Mutual Release, dated April 15, 2003. 99.2 Press Release of AutoNation, Inc., dated April 15, 2003.

Exhibit 99.1 SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AND MUTUAL RELEASE THIS SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AND MUTUAL RELEASE ("Agreement") is entered into by and among AutoNation, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("AutoNation"), ANC Rental Corporation, together with its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, "ANC"), including but not limited to the debtors and debtors-in-possession (collectively, the "Debtors"), in those certain jointly administered Chapter 11 Bankruptcy cases presently pending in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the "Court") as Case No. 01-11200 (MFW) (the "Case"), and the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors in the Case (the "Committee," and with AutoNation and ANC, the "Parties") pursuant to SS.SS. 1102 and 1103 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. ss. 101 et seq. (the "Code"). WHEREAS, certain of the Debtors were formerly wholly-owned direct and indirect subsidiaries of AutoNation; and WHEREAS, on June 30, 2000, AutoNation distributed to its shareholders all of the outstanding stock of ANC in a tax-free spin-off (the "Spin-off"); and WHEREAS, certain of the Debtors and AutoNation entered into certain agreements in connection with the Spin-off; and WHEREAS, the Debtors filed the instant Case on November 13, 2001 (the "Petition Date"); and WHEREAS, the Committee has been duly appointed in the Case; and WHEREAS, the Debtors and the Committee have asserted that certain claims, including claims for fraudulent conveyance and breach of fiduciary duty, may exist against AutoNation and its officers and directors with respect to actions taken prior to the Spin-off, in connection with the Spin-off or otherwise, and AutoNation has asserted certain claims as a creditor in the Case; and WHEREAS, the Parties have agreed to resolve their differences, in the manner set forth herein, with respect to all matters which were or could have been raised in the context of the Spinoff or the Case and/or otherwise with respect to the matters at issue; AND NOW, therefore, the Parties hereby stipulate and agree as follows: 1. AUTONATION CREDIT SUPPORT. A. AIG RETRO BOND. AutoNation agrees that it shall remain the guarantor (the "Guaranty") under that certain AIG Retro Bond issued November 9, 2001 by Liberty Bond Services, an unincorporated division of Liberty Mutual Insurance Company, in the total principal amount of $29,500,000, including any replacement as contemplated below (the "AIG Retro Bond") until the earlier of: (a) December 31, 2006 or (b) cancellation of such bond (the "Guaranty Termination Date"), provided, however, that in the event that the underlying AIG obligation currently supported by the AIG Retro Bond becomes collateralized by a new bond or other instrument under the same terms and conditions or terms and conditions that are at least as favorable to AutoNation as the current AIG Retro Bond, and without expanding or changing such underlying AIG obligation or AutoNation's indemnification obligations under the Guaranty, AutoNation's Guaranty shall continue in full force and effect with respect to such new bond or instrument until the Guaranty Termination Date. In the event that the AIG Retro Bond is not cancelled prior to the Guaranty Termination Date, ANC hereby agrees to take such actions as are necessary to cancel and/or replace the AIG Retro Bond or the Guaranty supporting such Bond on the Guaranty Termination Date, which may include providing substitute credit support for the AIG Retro Bond effective as of the Guaranty Termination Date. ANC also agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain a full release of AutoNation's obligations under the AIG Retro Bond as of the Guaranty Termination Date, without payment by, or other obligation of, AutoNation. 2
B. ADDITIONAL CREDIT SUPPORT. AutoNation further agrees that, solely upon a final order in the Case approving confirmation of a plan of reorganization under Section 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code (a "Plan") or a sale of all or substantially all of Debtors assets (as a going concern) under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code (a "Sale"), AutoNation shall agree to guaranty up to $10,500,000 of (i) domestic airport concession surety bonds selected by ANC from the list of airport locations listed on Exhibit A, or (ii) other bonds as requested by Debtors and approved by AutoNation in its reasonable discretion (the "Additional Credit Support", and together with the Guaranty, the "Credit Support"), until the earlier of the December 31, 2006 or the earlier cancellation of such Additional Credit Support (together with the Guaranty Termination Date, a "Termination Date"). To the extent that an underlying bond obligation for which AutoNation provides Additional Credit Support is cancelled or terminated for any reason prior to the Termination Date, AutoNation shall continue to provide Additional Credit Support on another bond, as requested by Debtor and approved by AutoNation in its reasonable discretion, up to an aggregate amount not to exceed $10,500,000. Any obligation to provide Additional Credit Support shall terminate upon the dismissal or conversion of the Case. The Additional Credit Support shall only support surety bonds that, by their terms, terminate on or before December 31, 2006. If for any reason the Additional Credit Support is not cancelled prior to the Termination Date, ANC hereby agrees to take such actions as are necessary to cancel and/or replace the Additional Credit Support on the Termination Date, which may include providing substitute credit support for the Additional Credit Support effective as of the Termination Date. ANC also agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain a full and unconditional release of AutoNation's obligations under the Additional Credit Support as of the Termination Date, without payment by, or other obligation of, AutoNation. 3
C. NO FURTHER OBLIGATIONS. Except to the extent provided herein, AutoNation shall be under no further obligation to provide any further guaranties or credit support in favor of the Debtors (other than that which exists as of the date hereof). Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to impose any obligation upon AutoNation to increase, reinstate, replenish, renew or replace its Credit Support in the event that claims are made with respect to or upon the Credit Support or the Credit Support is otherwise reduced, released, or cancelled (except as otherwise expressly provided herein). 2. PAYMENTS TO UNSECURED TRUST. Without limiting any other provision of this Agreement, in resolution of fraudulent conveyance claims asserted by the Committee, AutoNation agrees, upon confirmation of any Plan of Reorganization, to thereafter make payments to the ANC Unsecured Creditors' Liquidating LLC or other similar entity established upon the effective date of a Plan (the "Trust"), as follows: within thirty (30) days after the Termination Date of any Credit Support (the "Released Support") with respect to such Released Support (a "Payment Date"), and provided that the Released Support has been fully and unconditionally released by the beneficiaries of such Credit Support or the bonds have expired or have been cancelled, thereby eliminating any further obligation of AutoNation under the Released Support, AutoNation shall pay to the "Trust" an amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of the following amount: the Released Support, less any payments made or losses incurred by or claimed against AutoNation (and not reimbursed to AutoNation by ANC as of the Payment Date) with respect to any Credit Support, including in connection with the 4
release thereof ("Credit Support Claim Amounts"). By way of example, if the total amount of the Released Support is $10 million and there are $2 million in Credit Support Claim Amounts, the calculation shall be as follows: .5 x ($10 million - $2 million) = $4 million. In the event any Credit Support Claim Amounts are recovered by AutoNation after the Payment Date from the Debtors, AutoNation and the Debtor shall provide the Committee with prompt notice of such recovery, and AutoNation shall also pay the Trust, within thirty (30) days of such recovery, fifty percent (50%) of such recovered amounts. In no event shall AutoNation's aggregate payments to the Trust exceed $20,000,000. The payments to the Trust shall be deemed to be distributions to unsecured creditors pursuant to a plan of reorganization so long as the Trust is responsible solely for making payments on account of general unsecured creditors' claims and the Trust is not responsible for making payments on account of secured claims, administrative claims, unsecured priority claims or any claims other than general unsecured creditors' claims. 3. TAX INDEMNITY. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in that certain tax sharing agreement, entered into between ANC and AutoNation, dated June 30, 2000 (the "Tax Sharing Agreement"), AutoNation agrees to indemnify ANC for any and all (i) federal income taxes (including penalties and interest) asserted by the IRS against any ANC entity with respect to any period during which such ANC entity was a member of the AutoNation consolidated group for such tax purposes, and (ii) state and local income taxes (including penalties and interest) asserted by any state or local taxing authority against any ANC entity with respect to any period during which such ANC entity was a member of a consolidated or combined group with AutoNation for such tax purposes, but only to the extent that such amounts arise as a result of correlative adjustments to a state or local income tax return in connection with any adjustments asserted by the IRS to any federal income tax return with respect to which AutoNation provides an indemnity pursuant to clause (i) of this sentence. ANC shall have no payment or other indemnification obligation to AutoNation for any such taxes. ANC, or any successor, shall provide AutoNation 5
with prompt access to all records, personnel and information reasonably requested by AutoNation in connection with the foregoing tax matters. ANC shall provide such cooperation as is reasonably requested by AutoNation in connection with preparing any such tax returns or contesting any audit or other proceeding with respect to periods ending on or before or including the date of Spin-off, and shall retain all tax records relating to such periods until 90 days after the expiration of all applicable statutes of limitation (including any applicable extension thereof). AutoNation shall be relieved of its indemnification obligations under this paragraph to the extent that AutoNation is materially prejudiced by any failure of ANC, or any successors, to comply with its obligations under the preceding two sentences. ANC further acknowledges that AutoNation shall have the sole right to prepare and file any tax return and to respond to, control, settle and resolve any contests with applicable taxing authorities in connection with the tax matters described in this paragraph. With respect to any AutoNation federal income tax period ending on or before or including the date of the Spin-off, if, as a result of AutoNation (a) filing (or causing to be filed) any amended income tax return with respect to any such tax period, or (b) agreeing to or having imposed on it any resolution of an issue raised in any tax audit or other proceeding with respect to any such tax period, the tax position of ANC in income tax periods following the Spin-off is adversely affected (an "AutoNation Adverse Tax Position"), then AutoNation shall indemnify ANC for any federal, state or local income taxes actually paid by ANC resulting from AutoNation's Adverse Tax Position. For purposes of the preceding sentence, if the resolution of the AutoNation Adverse Tax Position results in a decrease in any ANC tax attribute (e.g., a net operating loss carryforward), 6
then AutoNation shall indemnify ANC for taxes paid by ANC which ANC would not otherwise actually have had to pay if an AutoNation Adverse Tax Position had not occurred; provided, however, a decrease in any ANC tax attribute as a result of ANC's actions required in the first sentence of Section 4 below shall be excluded. With respect to any AutoNation federal income tax period ending on or before or including the date of the Spin-off, if, as a result of AutoNation (a) filing (or causing to be filed) any amended income tax return with respect to any such tax period, or (b) agreeing to or having imposed on it any resolution of an issue raised in any tax audit or other proceeding with respect to any such tax period, the tax position of ANC in income tax periods following the Spin-off is benefited (an "AutoNation Beneficial Tax Position"), then ANC shall indemnify AutoNation for any actual reduction in ANC's federal, state or local income taxes resulting from AutoNation's Beneficial Tax Position. For purposes of the preceding sentence, if the resolution of the AutoNation Beneficial Tax Position results in an increase in any ANC tax attribute (e.g., a net operating loss carryforward), then ANC shall indemnify AutoNation for any actual reduction in ANC's taxes which ANC would otherwise actually have had to pay if an AutoNation Beneficial Tax Position had not occurred; provided, however, a decrease in any ANC tax attribute as a result of ANC's actions required in the first sentence of Section 4 below shall be excluded. 4. TAX RETURNS. Within 30 days of the Approval Date (as defined below) of this Agreement for federal income tax returns and within 60 days of the Approval Date for state income tax returns, ANC will amend all previously filed income tax returns to the extent necessary to provide that AutoNation's recorded basis of the assets owned by ANC at the time of the Spinoff was carried over by ANC and depreciation methods used with respect to such assets were consistent. All such filings, and, with respect to the carry over basis and depreciation 7
methods, any future income tax filings, shall be in a manner consistent with the basis and methods used by AutoNation on its tax returns. AutoNation will pay up to $200,000 of the out-of-pocket third-party professional fees incurred by ANC in connection with the preparation of such amended tax returns by ANC, based upon submission of invoices to AutoNation. AutoNation shall be granted a reasonable opportunity to review such returns prior to their filing, and ANC shall make any changes reasonably requested by AutoNation to ensure compliance with this paragraph. In connection with any inquiry by any taxing authority, ANC further agrees that (i) it shall provide these amended returns to such taxing authority and (ii) prior to submission by ANC of any tax returns or other materials to any taxing authority, it shall provide a copy of any such returns or other materials to AutoNation for its review. ANC will be provided with sufficient information from AutoNation's December 31, 2000 federal, state and local income tax returns to allow ANC to comply with its obligations under this paragraph. 5. DATA CENTER LEASE. The Parties hereby agree that that certain Data Center Lease dated May 31, 2000 (and commencing January 1, 2000) by and between Corporate Properties Holding, Inc. (which AutoNation shall cause to amend) and ANC Rental Corporation for a portion of the premises located at 5301 N.W. 33rd Ave., Ft. Lauderdale, Florida 33309, shall be amended as follows: (i) the current terms and conditions shall be extended to expire on December 31, 2005 (the "Extended Term"), and (ii) ANC Rental Corporation shall have the option to extend the Extended Term for an additional three-year period on the same terms and conditions as the current Data Center Lease except that the Base Rent shall be increased by five percent (5%) (the "Extension Option") by providing written notice to Corporate Properties Holding, Inc. stating its exercise of the Extension Option no later than six months prior to the expiration date of the Extended Term. AutoNation agrees to continue the same level of facility upkeep 8
and maintenance that AutoNation performed over the prior three years. ANC agrees to assume the lease upon confirmation of a Plan or Sale, and AutoNation waives any right to object to an assignment of the lease in connection with a Sale, other than on the basis of inadequate assurance of future performance. 6. ASSUMPTION/REJECTION OF CERTAIN AGREEMENTS. Upon the execution of this Agreement, the Debtors shall file a motion seeking authorization to: (i) assume the obligations under that certain Lease dated July 8, 1997 by and between Value Rent-A-Car, Inc., as tenant, and Mitsubishi Motor Sales of America, Inc., as landlord, for the premises located at 18080 Collins Ave., Miami Beach, Florida (the "Property Lease"); (ii) reject the Tax Sharing Agreement; (iii) reject that certain Reimbursement Agreement dated June 30, 2000 by and between AutoNation and ANC, as amended (the "Reimbursement Agreement"); (iv) reject the Separation and Distribution Agreement between ANC and AutoNation; (v) reject the Auto Parts Contract between AutoNation and ANC dated June 30, 2000, (vi) reject the AutoNation/ CarTemps Agreement between AutoNation and ANC dated June 30, 2000 and (vii) reject the Benefits Agreement between AutoNation and ANC dated June 30, 2000. The Debtors further acknowledge that in the event of a Sale pursuant to which the Property Lease is assigned, they shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain a reimbursement agreement in favor of AutoNation from the purchaser in such Sale with respect to the Property Lease. AutoNation and ANC each acknowledge that the other has fully performed its obligations under the Transitional Services Agreement and Rental Fleet Purchase Contract, each dated as of June 30, 2000. 7. RELEASE BY AUTONATION. Each of AutoNation and its subsidiaries, successors and assigns ("AutoNation Releasors"), does hereby unconditionally and irrevocably release and forever discharge ANC and the Committee and any of its or their predecessors, successors and assigns, individually or collectively ("ANC Releasees"), of and from any and all claims, charges, complaints, actions, 9
causes of action, defenses, demands, suits, dues, bond, sums of monies, covenants, guarantees, agreements, representations, obligations, damages, costs, liabilities, expenses, losses and debts of any nature whatsoever (collectively, "Losses") and howsoever arising, both at law and in equity, relating to any matter, claim or right, whether presently known or unknown, past or present, asserted or unasserted, contingent or liquidated, which any such person now has, ever had or may have against any ANC Releasees arising from or relating to any facts or events occurring in whole or in part at or prior to the date hereof, including rejection damages resulting from the Debtors' rejection of any agreement with AutoNation, other than Losses (i) arising under this Agreement, (ii) arising from claims for parts provided and services performed by AutoNation's dealers to ANC prior to the Petition Date in an amount not to exceed $1,500,000, (iii) arising in the ordinary course of business between ANC and AutoNation or any of its subsidiaries after the Petition Date, or (iv) arising under any other agreement between the Parties that is assumed by the Debtors in the Case or entered into after the Petition Date. 8. RELEASE BY ANC AND COMMITTEE. Each of ANC, its shareholders, creditors, trustees and subsequently appointed trustees, successors and assigns and the Committee and its successors and assigns (the "ANC Releasors"), does hereby unconditionally and irrevocably release and forever discharge AutoNation and its past or present, direct or indirect, subsidiaries and any of its or their respective past and present shareholders, directors, officers, employees, agents, legal representatives, predecessors, successors and assigns, individually or collectively (the "AutoNation Releasees"), of and from any and all Losses however arising, both at law or in equity, relating to any matter, claim or right, whether presently known or unknown, past or present, asserted or 10
unasserted, contingent or liquidated which any such person has, ever had or may have against any AutoNation Releasees arising from or relating to any facts or events occurring in whole or in part at or prior to the date hereof, including without limitation any action or inaction in connection with the Spin-off or AutoNation's ownership of ANC prior to the Spin-off, other than Losses (i) arising under this Agreement, (ii) arising in the ordinary course of business between ANC and AutoNation after the Petition Date, (iii) arising under any other agreement between the Parties that is assumed by the Debtors in the Case or entered into after the Petition Date or (iv) arising from claims against ANC, or its directors or officers (in such capacities), for any event, action or inaction occurring after the Spin-off. For the avoidance of doubt, the releases granted herein shall extend to any ANC officer or director or any proposed ANC director (at or preceding the time of the Spin-off) with respect to (but limited to) any claims or causes of action arising out of the Spin-Off or otherwise on or prior to June 30, 2000. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed to release AutoNation or ANC from their obligations under the Tax Indemnification Agreement entered into between ANC and AutoNation as of October 2, 2002 or any agreements related thereto. 9. ANC'S REIMBURSEMENT OBLIGATION. In the event that AutoNation shall be required to pay on any of its Credit Support obligations to third parties as set forth herein, ANC shall reimburse AutoNation in an amount equal to any such payments made by AutoNation. 10.

Exhibit 99.2 For Immediate Release Contact: Marc Cannon (954) 769-3146 cannonm@autonation.com AUTONATION REACHES AGREEMENT REGARDING ANC RENTAL MATTERS FORT LAUDERDALE, FLA. (APRIL 15, 2003) --- AUTONATION, INC. (NYSE: AN), announced today that it has signed an agreement with ANC Rental Corporation ("ANC") and the Unsecured Creditors' Committee appointed in ANC's bankruptcy that resolves potential claims relating to ANC's bankruptcy, including potential claims arising out of the spin-off of ANC by AutoNation in 2000. The agreement is subject to bankruptcy court approval, which the parties will seek to obtain in early May. Mike Jackson, AutoNation's Chairman and CEO stated, "This agreement eliminates uncertainty related to AutoNation's potential exposure arising due to the bankruptcy of ANC, including as a result of AutoNation's spin-off of ANC." The key terms of the settlement include the following. AutoNation will continue to guarantee certain surety bonds issued by ANC until December 2006. AutoNation's obligations under this guarantee are capped at $29.5 million. In addition, upon ANC's successful exit from bankruptcy, AutoNation will guarantee an additional $10.5 million of ANC bonds until December 2006 and, upon a permanent reduction of the guarantees, AutoNation will pay one-half of the permanent reduction, or up to $20 million, to a trust established for the benefit of the unsecured creditors of ANC. ANC and the unsecured creditors will provide a full release of any potential claims against AutoNation arising out of the spin-off of ANC, and AutoNation will release most of the pre-petition claims that it has asserted in the bankruptcy. As a result of the settlement, AutoNation's remaining exposure to ANC is in the estimated range of $20 million to $40 million. Additional details will be provided with AutoNation's first quarter earnings release scheduled for April 28, 2003. ABOUT AUTONATION, INC.

EXHIBIT 99.1 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE CONTACT: MARC CANNON (954) 769-3146 cannonm@autonation.com AUTONATION REPORTS FIRST-QUARTER NET INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $0.72 PER SHARE o Excluding Benefit from Recent IRS Settlement, Record First-Quarter EPS from Continuing Operations of $0.29 Compared to $0.28 for the Period a Year Ago o $0.29 Exceeds The Analysts' Consensus Estimate of $0.27 o Fifth Consecutive Quarter of Record EPS FORT LAUDERDALE, FLA. (APRIL 28, 2003) -- AUTONATION, INC. (NYSE: AN), America's largest retailer of both new and used vehicles, today reported first-quarter net income from continuing operations of $211.9 million, or $0.72 per share, on revenue of $4.5 billion for the period ending March 31, 2003. The Company offset lower revenue and gross profit with a benefit resulting from the previously announced settlement with the Internal Revenue Service, continued share repurchases and lower operating expenses. The results compare with 2002 first-quarter net income from continuing operations of $91.7 million, or $0.28 per share, on revenue of $4.8 billion. The 2003 first quarter results include a benefit of $127.5 million, or $0.43 per share, resulting from the settlement with the IRS of the tax treatment of certain Company transactions in 1997 and 1999. As a result of the tax settlement, the Company expects to incur pre-tax interest expense of $20 million or $0.04 per share for the full year, of which $1.9 million was incurred in the first quarter. The impact of the tax settlement is included in net income from continuing operations for the period. Excluding only the $127.5 million benefit, net income from continuing operations would have been $84.4 million, or a record first-quarter earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.29 per share, which exceeds first-quarter earnings per share of $0.28 for the period a year ago. Mike Jackson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of AutoNation, stated, "AutoNation's scale, coupled with the resiliency of our business model, allowed our Company to perform despite a challenging economy." The Company's first-quarter net income was impacted by two non-operating events. First, a loss from discontinued operations of $12.3 million after-tax, or $0.04 per share, due to a previously announced agreement with ANC Rental Corporation and its unsecured creditors' committee. As a result of the agreement, AutoNation's remaining after-tax exposure to ANC could be up to $12.0 million. Second, a charge of $14.6 million after-tax, or $0.05 per share, for the cumulative effect from an accounting change adopted in accordance with rules recently issued by the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF). The accounting change relates primarily to floorplan assistance and took effect January 1, 2003. Including these items, the Company's 2003 first-quarter net income was $185.0 million, or $0.63 per share. Other highlights in the first quarter included: o The repurchase of over five percent of the Company's outstanding shares, or 16.6 million shares, at a cost of $204.6 million. o A five percent reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses that contributed to a 10-basis point improvement in operating margin to 3.8 percent. o The acquisition of twelve new vehicle franchises representing collective annual revenue of approximately $270 million. The closed acquisitions include the previously announced Vista Automotive Group, with six franchises in Corpus Christi, Texas, and Jim McNatt Honda of Dallas, Texas. Also included is a Pontiac GMC dealership in Houston, Texas and a Pontiac Buick GMC dealership in Hawthorne, California. --MORE--
Looking ahead, Jackson said, "We believe that the automotive retail environment will continue to be challenging. We will continue to focus on cost reductions, operational improvements and efficient allocation of our capital. After considering all of these factors, we are maintaining our outlook for full-year earnings per share from continuing operations excluding the impact of the tax settlement." The Company's earnings outlook, excluding the impact of the tax settlement, remains unchanged. However, in order to reflect the expected ongoing interest expense associated with the tax settlement of $0.04 per share for 2003, the Company is updating its full-year earnings guidance. As a result, the Company's previously announced estimate for full-year 2003 earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.25 to $1.30 (which did not reflect the impact of the tax settlement) is being adjusted to $1.21 to $1.26 per share. For the 2003 second quarter, the Company anticipates earnings per share of $0.29 to $0.31. On a GAAP basis for the full-year, the Company anticipates earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.64 to $1.69, which includes the impact of the Company's tax settlement. The reconciliation of the Company's earnings estimate is set forth in the table below: Original full-year guidance $1.25 - $1.30 Full-year impact of interest related to IRS settlement ($0.04) ------------- Adjusted full-year guidance $1.21 - $1.26 Income tax benefit from IRS settlement $0.43 ------------- Expected 2003 full-year GAAP EPS from continuing operations $1.64 - $1.69 ============= AutoNation will discuss its 2003 first-quarter results, its outlook and supporting assumptions later this morning during a 10 a.m., Eastern Time, conference call.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Certain statements and information included in this release constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Federal Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the Company to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied in such forward-looking statements. Additional discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from management's projections, estimates and expectations is contained in the Company's SEC filings. The Company undertakes no duty to update its forward-looking statements, including its earnings outlook. This release contains certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined under SEC rules, including net income from continuing operations excluding the first-quarter tax benefit. The Company believes such non-GAAP financial measures improve the transparency of the Company's disclosure, provide a meaningful presentation of the Company's results from its core business operations excluding the impact of items not related to the Company's ongoing core business operations, and improve the period-to-period comparability of the Company's results from its core business operations. As required by SEC rules, the Company has provided reconciliations of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, which are set forth in the attachments to this release. ###

ITEM 4. Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant. Effective as of May 6, 2003, AutoNation, Inc. ("AutoNation") appointed KPMG LLP ("KPMG") as its new independent public accountant. Effective as of May 5, 2003, AutoNation dismissed Deloitte & Touche LLP ("D&T") as its independent public accountant. This change in independent public accountant was approved by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of AutoNation. The change was made following the recent announcement by D&T that it had ended efforts to separate Deloitte Consulting, which provides certain non-audit consulting services to the Company that will become prohibited services for an audit firm to provide to its audit clients under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules promulgated thereunder. During AutoNation's most recent fiscal year and through the date of this Form 8-K, there were no disagreements between AutoNation and D&T on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to D&T's satisfaction, would have caused D&T to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in connection with its report. AutoNation engaged D&T as its independent public accountant effective as of May 31, 2002 and, accordingly, D&T did not render services to AutoNation with respect to accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001. None of the reportable events described under Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K occurred within AutoNation's two most recent fiscal years and through the date of this Form 8-K. As described above, AutoNation engaged D&T as its independent public accountant effective as of May 31, 2002. The audit report of D&T on the consolidated financial statements of AutoNation and its subsidiaries as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002 did not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor was it qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles. As described above, AutoNation engaged D&T as its independent public accountant effective as of May 31, 2002 and, accordingly, D&T did not render audit services with respect to the consolidated financial statements of AutoNation and its subsidiaries as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001. AutoNation provided D&T with a copy of the foregoing disclosures. Attached hereto as Exhibit 16.1 is a copy of D&T's letter, dated May 6, 2003, stating its agreement with such statements. During AutoNation's two most recent fiscal years and through the date of this Form 8-K, AutoNation did not consult with KPMG with respect to the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on AutoNation's consolidated financial statements, or any other matters or reportable events listed in Item 304(a)(2)(i) and (ii) of Regulation S-K. 2

(July 24, 2003) --- AutoNation, Inc. (NYSE: AN), America's largest retailer of both new and used vehicles, today reported record second-quarter earnings per share of $0.37, 16% above a year-earlier $0.32 per share, driven by initiatives aimed at maximizing operating efficiencies that allowed the Company to further leverage its cost structure and the continued repurchase of outstanding shares. The Company reported operating income of $207 million and net income of $106 million, increases of 5% and 2%, respectively. Total revenue for the second-quarter ended June 30, 2003 increased to $5.1 billion compared to $5.0 billion a year ago driven by revenue growth of 4% for new vehicles and 6% for finance and insurance. Selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A) was $549 million or 71.1% as a percentage of total gross profit, a 110 basis point improvement compared to a year ago. Commenting on the second-quarter performance AutoNation Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Mike Jackson said, "AutoNation delivered another record quarter of earnings per share coupled with increases in revenue and net income, demonstrating the strength of our operation and the commitment of our team. We benefited from the continued success of our cost containment initiatives and operational improvements, particularly in the area of new and used vehicles and finance and insurance, allowing us to expand our operating margin." Other highlights in the second quarter include: o The repurchase of 10.4 million of the Company's outstanding shares at a cost of $149 million. o Record finance and insurance gross profit per vehicle retailed of $804. o The successful launch of two market brands, Power in Southern California and Champion in Houston, Austin and Corpus Christi; bringing the Company's number of branded markets to 13. o The appointment of two new board members: Alan S.

For the six-month period ended June 30, 2003, the Company earned net income from continuing operations of $318 million or $1.10 per share. Excluding the benefit of the first quarter 2003 IRS tax settlement, earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.66, a 10% increase versus the prior year. The Company's revenue for the six-month period totaled $9.5 billion, down 2% versus the prior year. AutoNation also announced that it will now report new vehicle days supply utilizing the industry standard of selling days inclusive of fleet. Prior to this change, the Company reported new vehicle days supply using calendar days excluding fleet, which at the end of the second quarter stood at 72 days. Using the industry metric, the Company's new vehicle inventory at the end of the second quarter was 65 days, compared to the industry at 63 days. Looking ahead, Mr. Jackson said, "While we are hopeful that efforts to stimulate the economy will take hold, we believe that the auto retail environment will remain challenging for the remainder of the year. Based on our performance this quarter, we are raising our full-year 2003 outlook for earnings per share from continuing operations by $0.07 to the range of $1.28 to $1.33, excluding the benefit of the first quarter tax settlement, and offer third-quarter earnings per share guidance of $0.34 to $0.36."

     (NYSE: AN), America's largest retailer of both new and used vehicles, today reported record third quarter earnings per share of $0.38, 15% above a year-earlier $0.33 per share, driven by the continued repurchase of outstanding shares and initiatives aimed at maximizing operating efficiencies that allowed the Company to further leverage its cost structure.

FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (October 30, 2003) - AutoNation, Inc.
     Total revenue for the third quarter ended September 30, 2003 increased to $5.3 billion compared to $5.2 billion a year ago, driven by revenue growth of 3% for new vehicles, 2% for parts and service, and 7% for finance and insurance. Third quarter vehicle sales were positively impacted due to the accelerated demand in California in anticipation of a substantial increase in the California vehicle license fee on October 1. Selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A) was $566 million or 71.6% of total gross profit, a 110 basis point improvement compared to a year ago. Operating income was $206 million, an increase of 3.5% over a year ago, and as a percent of gross profit improved 60 basis points to 26.1%.
     Commenting on the third quarter results AutoNation Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Mike Jackson said, "Once again, AutoNation delivered solid performance in the quarter as we continued our operational improvements and cost containment. We were pleased to achieve a record for F&I profit per vehicle retailed, gains in our parts and service business and a positive trend in our used vehicle business. Our strategy remains the same. We will continue to focus on the fundamentals, leveraging our cost structure and allocating our capital appropriately among stock repurchase, acquisitions and capital investments."
 
     For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2003, the Company reported net income from continuing operations of $427 million or $1.48 per share.

The Company's revenue for the nine-month period totaled $14.8 billion, down 1% versus the prior year.
     Looking ahead, Mr. Jackson said, "Auto manufacturers have effectively kept consumers in the marketplace with innovative product and strong incentives. AutoNation's fourth quarter earnings per share guidance is $0.27 to $0.29 from our core business. We are maintaining full year earnings per share guidance at $1.31 to $1.33, the upper end of our previous range. This excludes the benefits of the Company's first quarter tax settlement and fourth quarter items related to favorable state income tax settlements and the gain on the sale of a non-core equity investment."
     The Company's earnings outlook on a GAAP basis for the fourth quarter is $0.32 to $0.34 per share and for the full year 2003 is $1.80 to $1.82 per share from continuing operations. The reconciliation of the Company's earnings estimate is set forth in the table below:
     Commenting on the Company's outlook for 2004, Mr. Jackson said, "We anticipate that the 2004 new vehicle market will remain intensely competitive in a stable volume environment. Our full year 2004 EPS outlook is $1.40 - $1.45."

ITEM 12. INFORMATION FURNISHED UNDER ITEM 12 (RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION)
On February 5, 2004, AutoNation, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing its results of operations for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2003. The text of the press release is reproduced below and the Company's Quarterly Financial Data Supplement for the quarter ended December 31, 2003 is attached as an exhibit hereto and is incorporated herein by reference.
      (NYSE: AN), America's largest automotive retailer, today reported 2003 fourth-quarter net income of $79.0 million, or $0.28 per share, compared to year-ago net income of $79.4 million or $0.26 per share. The 8% increase in fourth-quarter earnings per share was driven by further leverage of its cost structure and the continued repurchase of outstanding shares.
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (February 5, 2004) - AutoNation, Inc.
     Fourth-quarter 2003 revenue totaled $4.6 billion, an increase of $77 million compared to the year-ago period resulting from revenue growth in new vehicles of 4%, parts and service of 1% and finance and insurance of 8%. Selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A) in the quarter was $520.3 million or 75.1% of total gross profit, a 100 basis point improvement compared to a year ago. Operating income in the quarter was $130.7 million, a reduction of 16% compared to a year ago resulting from a real estate impairment charge of $27.5 million ($16.9 million after-tax or $0.06 per share) related to three franchised new vehicle stores that currently operate in converted used vehicle megastores. Excluding the effect of the impairment, operating income in the quarter was $158.2 million, an increase of $3 million or 2% compared to the period a year ago. The real estate impairment was offset by a gain of $10.2 million ($6.2 million after-tax or $0.02 per share) recognized by the Company on the sale of a non-core equity investment as well as a net income tax benefit of $10.3 million or $0.04 per share related primarily to favorable tax adjustments and settlements.
 
     Commenting on fourth-quarter 2003 performance AutoNation Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Mike Jackson said, "AutoNation's performance in the fourth quarter was characterized by continued cost containment and revenue growth resulting from ongoing operational improvements. We were pleased to deliver our eighth consecutive quarter-over-quarter record EPS from continuing operations."
     For the full year, the Company reported net income from continuing operations of $506.1 million or $1.76 per share. Excluding the $0.44 per share benefit from the first-quarter 2003 IRS tax settlement, earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.32, an 11% increase versus the prior year. The Company's revenue for the full year totaled $19.4 billion, down less than 1% versus the prior year.
     The Company's 2003 accomplishments included:
     Commenting on the Company's 2003 performance and the year ahead, Jackson said, "In a highly competitive environment where industry sales were down, we once again delivered double-digit EPS growth. Looking ahead, we maintain our outlook that the 2004 new vehicle market will remain intensely competitive in a stable volume environment. We confirm our full-year 2004 EPS guidance of $1.40 to $1.45 and expect first-quarter earnings per share in the range of $0.29 to $0.31."

ITEM 12. INFORMATION FURNISHED UNDER ITEM 12 (RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION)
     On April 29, 2004, AutoNation, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing its results of operations for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2004. The text of the press release is reproduced below and the Company's Quarterly Financial Data Supplement for the quarter ended March 31, 2004 is attached as an exhibit hereto and is incorporated herein by reference.
(NYSE: AN), America's largest automotive retailer, today reported first-quarter net income of $87.3 million, or $0.32 per share, on revenue of $4.8 billion for the period ending March 31, 2004. The results compare with 2003 first-quarter net income from continuing operations of $84.4 million, or $0.29 per share, excluding the benefit of the year-ago IRS tax settlement, on revenue of $4.5 billion. Including this non-cash settlement benefit of $127.5 million, first-quarter 2003 net income from continuing operations was $211.9 million or $0.72 per share.
Fort Lauderdale, Fla. (April 29, 2004)  AutoNation, Inc.
     The first-quarter $0.32 EPS exceeded the analysts' consensus estimate of $0.30 per share. Across-the-board growth in both revenue and gross profit coupled with continued share repurchase and leverage of the company's cost structure drove performance in the quarter. Commenting on the quarter, Mike Jackson, chairman and chief executive officer of AutoNation, stated, "AutoNation delivered strong same store sales results in the first quarter in every area of the business, including new and used vehicles, finance and insurance and parts and service. We also continued to make strides on the cost side of the equation. It was a great quarter and we're very pleased with our results."
     First quarter highlights include:
 
     Looking ahead, Jackson said, "We are encouraged by our ability to generate top line growth, our continued cost reductions and the disciplined redeployment of our significant cash flow to improve shareholder value. Given this, we are raising our full-year 2004 EPS guidance by $0.03 to the range of $1.43 to $1.48 and anticipate second-quarter earnings per share in the range of $0.38 to $0.40."

(NYSE: AN), America's largest automotive retailer, today announces preliminary earnings results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2004. The company's earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations for the second quarter are expected to be in the range of $0.34 to $0.35, below the anticipated EPS range of $0.38 to $0.40 previously provided by the company in April 2004.
Fort Lauderdale, Fla. (July 8, 2004)  AutoNation, Inc.
     "A number of factors directly impacted our second quarter earnings," said Mike Jackson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of AutoNation. "Our cost structure was targeted for vehicle sales volume levels that did not materialize, particularly in June, with significant declines in sales of Ford and General Motors products. Low volume when combined with high inventories also caused a gross margin decline in our new vehicle business."
     Looking ahead, Jackson said, "Although the second quarter earnings were disappointing, our cash flow is strong and our strategy sound. However, in light of the second quarter results and the difficult new vehicle retail environment that we are operating in, we now anticipate 2004 EPS from continuing operations in the range of $1.35 to $1.40."
     Second quarter results are subject to the completion of customary quarterly financial closing and review procedures. AutoNation will release financial results for the 2nd Quarter ended June 30, 2004, on Tuesday, July 20, 2004 before 7:00 a.m. Eastern Time.

      America's largest automotive retailer, today reported net income from continuing operations of $96 million, or $0.35 per share, on revenue of $5.0 billion for the second quarter ended June 30, 2004. The results compare with 2003 second-quarter net income from continuing operations of $107 million, or $0.37 per share, on revenue of $5.0 billion. Including the impact of $4 million net of tax or $0.01 per share of loss from discontinued operations, primarily due to store divestitures, net income for the second quarter 2004 was $92 million, or $0.34 per share.
Fort Lauderdale, FL (July 20, 2004)  AutoNation, Inc. (NYSE: AN),
     "As previously announced, a number of factors directly impacted the company's second-quarter earnings," said Mike Jackson, chairman and chief executive officer of AutoNation. "Our cost structure was targeted for vehicle sales volume levels that did not materialize, particularly in June, with significant declines in sales of Ford and General Motors products. Low volume when combined with high inventories also caused a gross margin decline in our new vehicle business." The decline in new and used vehicle gross profit was partially offset by improved gross profit performances in parts and service and finance and insurance.
     "The economic environment for American retailers in the month of June was particularly challenging, led by a 1.1% decline in retail sales, the largest drop in 16 months," said Jackson. "The automotive retail component of that decline was significant; the industry reported a 4.3% decrease, a notable falloff when compared to May's 3.2% gain."
     For the six-month period ended June 30, 2004, the Company earned net income from continuing operations of $184 million or $0.67 per share. Net income from continuing operations for the six-month period ended June 30, 2003 was $1.10 per share. Excluding the $0.44 per share benefit of the first-quarter 2003 IRS tax settlement, earnings per share from continuing operations
 
for the six-month period ended June 30, 2003 was $0.66. The Company's revenue for the six-month period ended June 30, 2004 totaled $9.7 billion, up 4 percent versus the prior year.
     Looking ahead, Mr. Jackson said, "Although the second quarter earnings were disappointing, our cash flow is strong and our strategy sound. We expect to report third-quarter EPS from continuing operations in the range of $0.36 to $0.38 per share. As previously announced, in light of the second-quarter results and the difficult new vehicle environment that we are operating in, our full-year 2004 guidance for EPS from continuing operations is in the range of $1.35 to $1.40."

FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS
Certain statements and information included in this release constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Federal Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the Company to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied in such forward-looking statements. Additional discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from management's projections, estimates and expectations is contained in the Company's SEC filings. The Company undertakes no duty to update its forward-looking statements, including its earnings outlook. This release contains certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined under SEC rules, including earnings per share from continuing operations for the six-month period ended June 30, 2003 excluding the benefit of the first-quarter 2003 IRS tax settlement. The Company believes such non-GAAP financial measure improves the transparency of the Company's disclosure, provides a meaningful presentation of the Company's results from its core business operations excluding the impact of items not related to the Company's ongoing core business operations, and improves the period-to-period comparability of the Company's results from its core business operations. As required by SEC rules, the Company has provided a reconciliation of this measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, which is set forth in the attachments to this release.
 
 
 
Note
The Company's parts and service departments provide reconditioning repair work for used vehicles acquired by the used vehicle department and minor preparatory work for new vehicles. The parts and service departments charge the new and used departments as if they were third parties in order to account for total activity performed by that department. The Company has determined that the revenue and related cost of sales of both new and used vehicles had not been reduced by the intracompany charge for such work. Commencing with the second quarter of 2004, the Company is making the adjustment and has revised amounts previously reported by reducing new and used vehicle revenue and cost of sales by the amount of the intracompany charge. The adjustments have no impact on gross profit, operating income, income from continuing operations, net income, earnings per share, cash flows, or financial position for any period or their respective trends.
The effect of the adjustments was to reduce both revenue and cost of sales for new vehicles by $22 million and $44 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2004, respectively, and for used vehicles by $52 million and $102 million for the same periods, respectively. For 2003, the adjustment reduced both revenue and cost of sales for new vehicles by $21 million and $40 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2003, respectively, and used vehicles by $49 million and $94 million for the same periods, respectively. Accordingly, the Company's revenue-based performance metrics, such as revenue per vehicle, gross profit as a percent of revenue, and SG&A as a percent of revenue, also have been revised. These revisions do not have a material impact on the amounts for any period or respective trends.

/PRNewswire-FirstCall/  AutoNation, Inc. (NYSE: AN), America's largest automotive retailer, today announced plans to implement a streamlined regional management structure that is designed to generate improved efficiency and management effectiveness. This realignment is the continuation of a four-year-long process to improve productivity and earnings.
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla., Sept. 9
     AutoNation will consolidate its ten districts into five regions, each led by a regional president. Within each region, a market president will manage each individual market. This combination of regional and market presidents will allow the company to further capitalize on AutoNation's innovative retailing systems, processes and technology.
     "This new alignment is the continuation of our efforts to improve our company's operating efficiency and capitalize on our infrastructure investments," said Mike Jackson, AutoNation's chairman and chief executive officer. "It's the next step in a plan that we've been laying out for the past four years and will continue to improve on."
     Since initiating its emphasis on productivity and cost reduction as a focus for business improvement in 2000, the company has realized a 500-basis-point cumulative reduction in SG&A as a percentage of total gross profit, which has translated into savings of $150 million per year. The company expects that the new regional management structure will generate approximately $30 million (pre-tax) in incremental annual cost reductions, which would constitute a portion of AutoNation's previously announced 200 basis point targeted reductions in SG&A as a percentage of total gross profit over the next few years. The company expects that the new regional management structure will result in a one-time pre-tax charge to continuing operations of approximately $5 million, primarily relating to severance.
     "Our regional management structure is the natural evolution enabling us to manage our stores and our markets with even greater focus and productivity," said Mike Maroone, AutoNation's president and chief operating officer. "We view our regional presidents as the elite leaders at AutoNation who have excelled in their previous leadership roles."
     The company announced the following promotions: Jim Bender will become president of the Florida region; Todd Maul will become president of the West Central region; Jerry Heuer will become president of the California region; Dan Agnew will become president of the Texas region; and Hank Phillips will become president of the East Central region.
 
     In addition, Senior Vice President and General Counsel Jon Ferrando will assume oversight responsibilities for the company's human resources function in addition to his current responsibilities.
     Regarding the company's earnings guidance, Mr. Jackson said: "The company's August and September business has been adversely affected by two major hurricanes that have caused store closings and substantial disruption to our business throughout Florida, which accounts for almost 30% of the company's operating profits. We also are continuing to experience a challenging retail sales environment. Considering these factors, we expect to report third-quarter EPS from continuing operations in the range of $0.33 to $0.35, including a one-time pre-tax charge of $5 million or $0.01 per share (after-tax) associated with the new regional management structure. We now anticipate full-year 2004 EPS from continuing operations in the range of $1.32 to $1.35." On July 20, 2004, the company provided guidance for EPS from continuing operations of $.36 to $.38 for the third quarter and $1.35 to $1.40 for the full-year.

Net income from continuing operations for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2003 was $428.5 million or $1.48 per share. Excluding the $0.44 per share benefit of the first-quarter 2003 IRS tax settlement, earnings per share from continuing operations for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2003 was $1.04. The Company's revenue for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2004 totaled $14.8 billion, up 2 percent versus the prior year.
     Looking ahead, Mr. Jackson said, "We expect fourth-quarter EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $0.30 to $0.33 per share. As previously announced, our full-year 2004 guidance for EPS from continuing operations is in the range of $1.32 to $1.35."
     Following careful consideration, the Company has made a policy change with regard to providing future earnings guidance. In the future, the Company will no longer provide quarterly or annual earnings per share guidance. The Company will continue providing investors with long-term EPS growth targets along with information and insight into strategic initiatives, growth and value drivers, and trend and industry data critical to understanding the Company's businesses and operating environment.
     "We believe that our Company and shareholders are best served with our approach of managing our business for the long-term," Mr. Jackson stated. "Our progress in executing our long-term strategy is best measured as we achieve it, rather than focusing on establishing and
 
attaining short-term public forecasts. With our diversified business model, our goal continues to be EPS growth at a long-term average annual rate of 10%-12%."
     Key assumptions and drivers related to our long-term EPS growth rate objective are set forth in the following financial tables and will be discussed on the earnings conference call.
     Separately, the Company also announced today that its Board of Directors has authorized an additional $250 million for the repurchase of its common stock. The Board's decision extends the Company's previously authorized share repurchase programs.
     AutoNation will discuss these results, the Company's outlook and supporting assumptions during a conference call and audio webcast this morning at 9:00 a.m., Eastern Time.

FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS
Certain statements and information included in this release, including the information set forth under "Business Assumptions Impacting Long-term EPS Growth Target" in the following financial tables, constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Federal Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the Company to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied in such forward-looking statements. Additional discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from management's projections, estimates and expectations is contained in the Company's SEC filings. The Company undertakes no duty to update its forward-looking statements, including its earnings outlook. This release contains certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined under SEC rules, including earnings per share from continuing operations for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2003 excluding the benefit of the first-quarter 2003 IRS tax settlement. The Company believes such non-GAAP financial measure improves the transparency of the Company's disclosure, provides a meaningful presentation of the Company's results from its core business operations excluding the impact of items not related to the Company's ongoing core business operations, and improves the period-to-period comparability of the Company's results from its core business operations. As required by SEC rules, the Company has provided a reconciliation of this measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, which is set forth in the attachments to this release.
 
 
 
Business Assumptions Impacting Long-term EPS Growth Target:
Note
The Company's parts and service departments provide reconditioning repair work for used vehicles acquired by the used vehicle department and minor preparatory work for new vehicles. The parts and service departments charge the new and used departments as if they were third parties in order to account for total activity performed by that department. The Company has determined that the revenue and related cost of sales of both new and used vehicles had not been reduced by the intracompany charge for such work. Commencing with the second quarter of 2004, the Company is making the adjustment and has revised amounts previously reported by reducing new and used vehicle revenue and cost of sales by the amount of the intracompany charge. The adjustments have no impact on total gross profit, operating income, income from continuing operations, net income, earnings per share, cash flows, or financial position for any period or their respective trends.
The effect of the adjustments was to reduce both revenue and cost of sales for new vehicles by $21 million and $65 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2004, respectively, and for used vehicles by $49 million and $151 million for the same periods, respectively. For 2003, the adjustment reduced both revenue and cost of sales for new vehicles by $21 million and $61 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2003, respectively, and used vehicles by $50 million and $143 million for the same periods, respectively. Accordingly, the Company's revenue-based performance metrics, such as revenue per vehicle, gross profit as a percent of revenue, and SG&A as a percent of revenue, also have been revised. These revisions do not have a material impact on the amounts for any period or respective trends.

At all times during the Employment Period, the foregoing provisions of this paragraph shall govern in the event of any conflict between such provisions and the provisions of any stock option agreement to which the Executive is a party or the provisions of any stock option plan pursuant to which the Executive's employee stock options were granted.
"Good Reason" shall mean the occurrence of any of the following: (i) a material change by the Company in the Executive's duties or responsibilities which would cause Executive's position with the Company to become of materially and substantially less responsibility and importance than those associated with his duties or responsibilities as of the date hereof; or (ii) a material breach of this Agreement by the Company, which breach is not cured within ten (10) days after written notice thereof is received by the Company.

(NYSE: AN), America's largest automotive retailer, today reported 2004 fourth-quarter net income from continuing operations of $116 million or $0.43 per share, compared to year-ago net income from continuing operations of $87 million or $0.31 per share. Excluding certain items disclosed in the attached financial tables, the Company's fourth-quarter EPS from continuing operations of $0.34 increased 17% on a comparable basis from $0.29 in 2003, primarily as a result of strong revenue growth, continued leverage of the Company's cost structure, acquisitions and the repurchase of outstanding shares.
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (February 3, 2005)  AutoNation, Inc.
     Fourth-quarter 2004 revenue totaled $4.8 billion, an increase of $0.4 billion compared to the year-ago period resulting from revenue growth in new vehicles of 8%, retail used vehicles of 10%, parts and service of 7% and finance and insurance of 12%. Selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A) in the quarter was $534 million or 70.8% of total gross profit. Operating income for the fourth quarter was $193 million, a fourth quarter record. Excluding certain items for 2003 disclosed in the attached financial tables, operating income for the fourth quarter was up 21%.
     Commenting on fourth-quarter 2004 performance AutoNation Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Mike Jackson said, "AutoNation's performance in the fourth quarter was driven by strong revenue growth resulting from ongoing operational enhancements and an improved industry environment, along with continued improvements in our industry-leading cost structure and the benefit of a streamlined regional management structure. In addition, our Florida and Southeast markets performed extremely well as they recovered from four hurricanes that affected third-quarter results."
     At the end of the fourth-quarter 2004, AutoNation's new vehicle inventory level was 53 days versus 71 days at the end of the fourth-quarter 2003, representing a decline of 17,000 units, or 18%.
     The Company's fourth-quarter results reflect the resolution of various tax matters under audit from prior years, resulting in a $0.09 per share benefit in continuing operations and a $0.19 per share benefit in discontinued operations for the quarter.
 
     For full-year 2004, the Company reported net income from continuing operations of $396 million or $1.45 per share, compared to $515 million or $1.80 per share in 2003, which included a $0.44 per share benefit from the first-quarter 2003 IRS tax settlement. Excluding the effect of this and certain other items disclosed in the attached financial tables, the Company's 2004 EPS from continuing operations of $1.36 increased 2% on a comparable basis from $1.33 in 2003. The Company's revenue for the full year totaled $19.4 billion, an increase of 4% versus the prior year.
     The Company's 2004 accomplishments included:
     Commenting on the Company's 2004 performance and the year ahead, Jackson said, "In a highly competitive and volatile environment, AutoNation was able to grow top-line revenue. Looking ahead, we believe that in 2005 industry sales of new vehicles will be nearly 17 million units for the seventh year in a row."
     AutoNation will discuss these results and information regarding the Company's business and operating environment during a conference call and audio webcast this morning at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time.

FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS
     
Certain statements and information included in this release constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Federal Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the Company to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied in such forward-looking statements. Additional discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from management's projections, estimates and expectations is contained in the Company's SEC filings. The Company undertakes no duty to update its forward-looking statements, including its earnings outlook. This release and the attached financial tables contain certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined under SEC rules, including operating income, net income and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the three- and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, adjusted in each case to exclude certain items disclosed in the attached financial tables. As required by SEC rules, the Company has provided reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, which are set forth in the attachments to this release. The Company believes that each of the foregoing non-GAAP financial measures improves the transparency of the Company's disclosure, provides a meaningful presentation of the Company's results from its core business operations excluding the impact of items not related to the Company's ongoing core business operations, and improves the period-to-period comparability of the Company's results from its core business operations.
 
 
 
 
Business Assumptions Impacting Long-term Average EPS Growth Target of 10% to 12%:
Note
The Company's parts and service departments provide reconditioning repair work for used vehicles acquired by the used vehicle department and minor preparatory work for new vehicles. The parts and service departments charge the new and used departments as if they were third parties in order to account for total activity performed by that department. The Company has determined that the revenue and related cost of sales of both new and used vehicles had not been reduced by the intracompany charge for such work. Commencing with the second quarter of 2004, the Company is making the adjustment and has revised amounts previously reported by reducing new and used vehicle revenue and cost of sales by the amount of the intracompany charge. The adjustments have no impact on total gross profit, operating income, income from continuing operations, net income, earnings per share, cash flows, or financial position for any period or their respective trends.
The effect of the adjustments was to reduce both revenue and cost of sales for new vehicles by $19 million and $84 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2004, respectively, and for used vehicles by $45 million and $195 million for the same periods, respectively. For 2003, the adjustment reduced both revenue and cost of sales for new vehicles by $19 million and $82 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2003, respectively, and used vehicles by $45 million and $190 million for the same periods, respectively. Accordingly, the Company's revenue-based performance metrics, such as revenue per vehicle, gross profit as a percent of revenue, and SG&A as a percent of revenue, also have been revised. These revisions do not have a material impact on the amounts for any period or respective trends.

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
In 2002, the Board of Directors of AutoNation, Inc. (the "Company") adopted, and the Companys stockholders approved, the AutoNation, Inc. Senior Executive Incentive Bonus Plan (the "Plan"), which provides for a performance-based annual bonus program for senior executive officers. A copy of the Plan was filed as Exhibit A to the Companys Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 12, 2002. The Plan is administered by the Executive Compensation Subcommittee (the "Subcommittee") of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company. On January 31, 2005, the Subcommittee selected participants in the Plan for 2005, established specific annual performance goals and set target awards for participants in the Plan for 2005. The Subcommittee selected the following senior executive officers to participate in the Plan for 2005: the Companys Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; President and Chief Operating Officer; Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer; and Senior Vice President, General Counsel & Secretary. The performance goals under the Plan for 2005 that were established by the Subcommittee are based upon the achievement of specified levels of operating income per share (minus a charge for capital deployed for acquisitions or share repurchases) and operating income as a percentage of gross profit for the Company during 2005. The Subcommittee also established an objective standard for calculating the amount of the target award for each Plan participant. The performance goals established under the Plan for 2005 also constitute the performance goals that have been established for the 2005 corporate bonus plan to ensure that bonus-eligible corporate associates are fully aligned as a team to achieve improved operating performance for our existing business and to deploy capital effectively and profitably. In administering the Plan, the Subcommittees objective is to create a direct link betwee n pay and performance for the Companys senior executives. The Subcommittee retains absolute "negative discretion" to eliminate or reduce the amount of any award under the Plan and to make all determinations under the Plan.

, America's largest automotive retailer, today reported 2005 first-quarter net income from continuing operations of $88 million or $0.33 per share, compared to year-ago net income from continuing operations of $89 million or $0.32 per share. During the quarter, the Company repurchased $95 million in face value of its senior notes, incurring repurchase costs of approximately $9 million after tax, or $.03 per share. Excluding this impact, the Company's first-quarter adjusted net income from continuing operations was $97 million or $0.36 per share, an increase of 13% over the prior year, primarily as a result of strong revenue growth in parts and service, gross margin increases in new and used vehicles, continued leverage of the Company's cost structure, and the repurchase of common stock, partially offset by higher floorplan interest expense due to rising rates.
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (April 28, 2005) - AutoNation, Inc. (NYSE: AN)
     First-quarter 2005 revenue totaled $4.6 billion, up slightly from a year ago. Operating income was a record for the first-quarter at $199 million, an increase of 9% compared to the prior year.
     Commenting on first-quarter 2005 performance, AutoNation Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Mike Jackson said, "We are especially pleased with our ability to grow operating income by 9% and adjusted EPS by 13% in a challenging new vehicle environment. AutoNation's performance in the first-quarter was driven by an increase in new vehicle gross margins, greatly improved used vehicle pricing, and strong parts and service growth combined with our continued discipline in cost and inventory management and redeployment of cash. During the first-quarter, we took advantage of our financial flexibility to capitalize on an opportunity to retire a significant portion of our most expensive debt." At the end of first-quarter 2005, AutoNation's new vehicle inventory level was 60 days supply versus 67 days at the end of first-quarter 2004, representing a decline of 12,000 units, or 13%.

AutoNation, Inc. (), America's largest automotive retailer, today announced that Fitch Ratings has initiated coverage on its unsecured debt with a BBB- investment grade rating. This new rating matches Standard & Poors' existing investment-grade rating and reaffirms AutoNation as the only public automotive retailer with an investment-grade unsecured debt rating.
FORT LAUDERDALE, FLA. (June 15, 2005)-
NYSE: AN
"Fitch and S&P recognize the strength of AutoNation's diversified business model," said Mike Jackson, Chairman and CEO of AutoNation. "Together, their investment grade ratings are a validation of our model and financial discipline. Over the last five years, we have strengthened our financial position through a disciplined redeployment of over $4 billion in cash from operations and other financial opportunities."
As a result of the new rating, AutoNation expects to enter the Lehman U.S. Investment Grade Fixed Income Index on July 1, 2005. Lehman's indices are the asset management industry's most widely held benchmarks, used by more than 90% of U.S. institutional investors along with a significant number of foreign investors.
Over the next couple of years, AutoNation's investment-grade status should allow the company to restructure its floorplan and non-vehicle debt facilities, improving its credit spreads by approximately 100 basis points.
AutoNation's diversified business model emphasizes a broad set of related but distinct business lines, including new vehicles, used vehicles, parts and service, and finance and insurance, as well as being diversified by geography and manufacturer brands. This model limits the company's exposure to downturns in specific market segments while enabling it to capitalize on favorable conditions in others.

If no successor agent has accepted appointment as Administrative Agent by the date that is 30 days following a retiring Administrative Agent's notice of resignation, the retiring Administrative Agent's resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become effective, and the Lenders shall assume and perform all of the duties of the Administrative Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor agent as provided for above.

The Borrower agrees not to assert any claim against any Agent-Related Person, any Lender, any of their Affiliates, or any of their respective directors, officers, employees, attorneys, agents, and advisers, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential, or punitive damages arising out of or otherwise relating to the Loan Documents, any of the transactions contemplated herein or the actual or proposed use of the proceeds of the Loans.

Section 11.9
11.10 . If any provision of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents shall be determined to be illegal or invalid as to one or more of the parties hereto, then such provision shall remain in effect with respect to all parties, if any, as to whom such provision is neither illegal nor invalid, and in any event all other provisions hereof shall remain effective and binding on the parties hereto.
Severability
11.11 . This Agreement, together with the other Loan Documents, constitutes the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all previous proposals, negotiations, representations, commitments and other communications between or among the parties, both oral and written, with respect thereto (except that those provisions (if any) which by the express terms of the commitment letter dated as of June 6, 2005, executed by JPMorgan Chase Bank, J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Bank of America, N.A. and Banc of America Securities LLC and accepted by the Borrower, survive the closing of the Revolving Credit Facility and Letter of Credit Facility, shall survive and continue in effect).
Entire Agreement

Agreement Controls
11.13 . Notwithstanding any other provision herein, the aggregate interest rate charged hereunder, including all charges or fees in connection therewith deemed in the nature of interest under applicable law shall not exceed the Highest Lawful Rate (as such term is defined below). If the rate of interest (determined without regard to the preceding sentence) under this Agreement at any time exceeds the Highest Lawful Rate (as defined below), the outstanding amount of the Loans made hereunder shall bear interest at the Highest Lawful Rate until the total amount of interest due hereunder equals the amount of interest which would have been due hereunder if the stated rates of interest set forth in this Agreement had at all times been in effect. In addition, if when the Loans made hereunder are repaid in full the total interest due hereunder (taking into account the increase provided for above) is less than the total amount of interest which would have been due hereunder if the stated rates of interest set forth in this Agreement had at all times been in effect, then to the extent permitted by law, the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to the difference between the amount of interest paid and the amount of interest which would have been paid if the Highest Lawful Rate had at all times been in effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is the intention of the Lenders and the Borrower to conform strictly to any applicable usury laws. Accordingly, if any Lender contracts for, charges, or receives any consideration which constitutes interest in excess of the Highest Lawful Rate, then any such excess shall be cancelled automatically and, if previously paid, shall at such Lender's option be applied to the outstanding amount of the Loans made hereunder or be refunded to the Borrower. As used in this paragraph, the term "Highest Lawful Rate" means the maximum lawful interest rate, if any, that at any time or from time to time may be contracted for, charged, or received under the laws applicable to such Lender which are presently in effect or, to the extent allowed by law, under such applicable laws which may hereafter be in effect and which allow a higher maximum nonusurious interest rate than applicable laws now allow.

For Immediate Release

cannonm@autonation.com
America's largest automotive retailerannounced that it has closed on a new $600 million five-year unsecured credit facility with investment grade terms. The new facility replaces a $300 million, five-year credit facility that was set to expire on August 9, 2006 and a $200 million 364-day credit facility that was set to expire on August 5, 2005. The new credit facility will be used for general corporate purposes.
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (July 14, 2005) - AutoNation, Inc. (NYSE: AN),
,
Commenting on the new credit facility, Craig Monaghan, chief financial officer, said, "The terms of the new facility demonstrate the significant progress AutoNation has made over the past five years and the confidence that our lenders have in our future business plans. We recently became the first public auto retailer to achieve investment grade status and view this new credit facility as further validation of our business model and financial discipline." Monaghan also said, "The new credit spreads are more than 100 basis points less than the credit spreads under the five-year credit facility that we are replacing. We expect to take advantage of additional opportunities to improve our credit spreads and optimize our capital structure as we move forward."
The Administrative Agent for the credit facility is JPMorgan Chase Bank, N. A. and the Syndication Agent is Bank of America, N. A. A total of 13 lenders are committed to the new credit facility.

Commenting on the quarter, Mike Jackson, AutoNation Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "AutoNation delivered solid results in the second quarter in every area of the business, including new and used vehicles, finance and insurance and we're especially pleased with our high-margin parts and service business. We also continued to make strides on the cost side of the equation." At the end of the second quarter 2005, AutoNation's new vehicle inventory level was 51 days supply versus 74 days at the end of second quarter 2004, representing a decline of 27,000 units or 26%.

For the six-month period ended June 30, 2005, the Company earned net income from continuing operations of $195 million or $0.72 per share.

Exhibit 99.1
America's largest automotive retailer, today reported 2005 third-quarter net income from continuing operations of $120 million or $0.45 per share, compared to year-ago net income from continuing operations of $96 million or $0.35 per share, an increase in EPS of 29%. Excluding the $0.04 per share benefit from the resolution of certain tax matters, the Company's third-quarter EPS from continuing operations was $0.41, up 17% compared to a year ago. This increase was primarily a result of solid growth in both revenue and gross profit in every area of the business coupled with continued share repurchases and the leveraging of the Company's cost structure.
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (October 27, 2005)  AutoNation, Inc. (NYSE: AN),
Third-quarter 2005 revenue totaled $5.2 billion, an increase of 5% compared to the year-ago period, and resulted primarily from revenue growth in new vehicles of 2%, retail used vehicles of 10%, parts and service of 9%, and finance and insurance of 6%. Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) in the quarter were $567 million or 70.2% of total gross profit, a 90-basis point improvement versus the prior year. Operating income for the third quarter was $220 million, a third-quarter record, up 13% versus the prior year.
Commenting on the third-quarter performance, AutoNation Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Mike Jackson said, "AutoNation's team of 347 franchises and 27,000 employees can be very proud of their performance over the past quarter. Once again, our Company delivered record third-quarter earnings per share, increased revenue and increased net income  all indicators of just how strong and efficient our organization has become. In addition to operational improvements in nearly every area of the business  new and used vehicles, parts and service, finance and insurance  we benefited during this time from the employee discount programs launched by the Detroit 3. During the third-quarter 2005 our markets were not significantly affected by hurricanes as we were in the third-quarter 2004. However, in the fourth-quarter Hurricane Wilma has impacted our South Florida operations, where we have 33 dealerships representing approximately 20% of our national business. We have a short-term disruption to our South Florida business at this point and we are in the process of assessing the damage. We do not expect a long-term effect on our business."
At the end of the third-quarter 2005, AutoNation's new vehicle inventory level was 43 days supply versus 53 days at the end of the third-quarter 2004, representing a decline of 17,000 units or 22%.
For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2005, the Company reported net income from continuing operations of $315 million or $1.17 per share. The Company's revenue for the nine-month period totaled $14.8 billion, up 3%.

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
     On November 18, 2005, the Company established the AutoNation, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan (the "Plan"), effective December 1, 2005, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference. The Plan is a non-qualified, deferred compensation plan available to a select group of management and highly-compensated employees of the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates, including executive officers of the Company, to enable them to defer receipt of up to 75% of their base salary and up to 90% of their compensation other than base salary each year. The Plan also allows for discretionary contributions by the Company on behalf of participants. On November 18, 2005, the Company's Deferred Compensation Committee, which administers the Plan, approved matching contributions for fiscal year 2006 (and thereafter unless modified by the Deferred Compensation Committee) for persons who participate in the Plan in the amount of 50% of contributions up to $8,000. Such matching contributions will vest one-third upon contribution by the Company to the participant's account and one-third on each anniversary thereafter. The deferred compensation obligations of the Company (the "Obligations") are considered unsecured general obligations of the Company to pay the deferred compensation in the future in accordance with the terms of the Plan.
     The amounts of the Obligations include compensation deferred by participants, Company discretionary contributions (if any), and deemed investment returns, positive or negative, thereon that are credited to the accounts in accordance with the terms of the Plan. The deemed investment returns for each participant are based on investment allocation elections that each participant makes from the deemed investment options (which are based on investment funds representing a broad range of asset classes) made available under the Plan. Each Obligation is payable in cash either in a lump sum distribution or in installments following a participant's retirement, termination of employment, death, disability or other dates selected by the participant at the time of his or her compensation deferral election. In the event of an unforeseeable emergency, a participant may be permitted an earlier cash distribution.
     The Plan may be amended, modified or terminated at any time, provided that such amendment, modification or termination may not adversely affect benefits already accrued without the consent of the affected participants.

The Subcommittee selected the following senior executive officers to participate in the Plan for 2006: the Companys Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; President and Chief Operating Officer; Execut ive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Executive Vice President, General Counsel & Secretary. The performance goals under the Plan for 2006 that were established by the Subcommittee are based upon the achievement of specified levels of operating income per share (minus a charge for capital deployed for acquisitions or share repurchases) and operating income as a percentage of gross profit for the Company during 2006. The Subcommittee also established an objective standard for calculating the amount of the target award for each Plan participant. The performance goals established under the Plan for 2006 also constitute the performance goals that have been established for the 2006 corporate bonus plan to ensure that bonus-eligible corporate associates are fully aligned as a team to achieve improved operating performance for our existing business and to deploy capital effectively and profitably. In administering the Plan, the Subcommittees objective is to create a direct li nk between pay and performance for the Companys senior executives. The Subcommittee retains absolute "negative discretion" to eliminate or reduce the amount of any award under the Plan and to make all determinations under the Plan.

Item 4.02 Non-Reliance on Previously Issued Financial Statements or a Related Audit Report or Completed Interim Review.
In response to a comment letter that AutoNation, Inc. (the "Company") received from the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") in connection with a customary review of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004, we recently have reevaluated the presentation of certain information regarding our vehicle floorplan payable in our consolidated statements of cash flows. As a result of this reevaluation, as well as discussions with the Staff of the SEC and similar restatements made by other public automotive retailers in recent weeks, on February 27, 2006 the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company concluded to restate the Company's consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 to reclassify cash flows relating to non-trade vehicle floorplan payable from operating cash flows to financing cash flows (as described in more detail below) in conformity with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 95 "Statement of Cash Flows" ("SFAS 95"). This change in presentation has no impact on previously reported net income, earnings per share, revenue, cash and cash equivalents, total assets, shareholders' equity, total cash (used in) provided by continuing operations or on the Company's conclusion that its disclosure controls and procedures were effective as reflected in any of the Company's previously issued consolidated financial statements. The change in presentation also will not affect the Company's compliance with any financial covenant or debt instrument with respect to any of the Company's indebtedness. The Company will include the restated consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 in the consolidated financial statements included within its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005. The Company will not restate consolidated financial statements for quarterly periods ended within fiscal year 2005.
The Company's dealership subsidiaries finance substantially all of their new vehicle inventories under revolving floorplan notes payable with lenders affiliated with the vehicle manufacturer with which such subsidiary holds a franchise ("trade lenders"). To a lesser extent, our dealership subsidiaries obtain new vehicle floorplan financing from lenders that are not affiliated with the manufacturer with which a subsidiary holds a franchise, and in very limited circumstances our dealerships obtain floorplan financing with respect to used vehicles (lenders in these contexts are referred to as "non-trade lenders"). We previously have reported all cash flows arising in connection with changes in vehicle floorplan payable (whether with trade lenders or non-trade lenders) as an operating activity in our consolidated statements of cash flows and all amounts due under our vehicle floorplan payable under the caption "Vehicle floorplan payable" in our consolidated balance sheets.
The consolidated statements of cash flows included in the consolidated financial statements that will be filed with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005 reflect vehicle floorplan borrowings and repayments from trade lenders as an item of cash flows from operating activities and vehicle floorplan borrowings and repayments from non-trade lenders as an item of cash flows from financing activities, in each case on a net basis. The consolidated balance sheets included in such consolidated financial statements reflect vehicle floorplan payable to trade lenders as "Vehicle floorplan payable  trade" and vehicle floorplan payable to non-trade lenders as "Vehicle floorplan payable  non-trade". The presentation in the consolidated financial statements filed with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005 will have the effect of increasing reported cash provided from operating activities and reported cash
 
used in financing activities in 2004 and 2003 as compared to our previously filed consolidated financial statements regarding such periods. In light of the foregoing, on February 27, 2006 the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company determined that our previously issued consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 and related reports of independent registered public accounting firm should no longer be relied upon.
The following chart summarizes the effects of the restatement of the Company's consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003:
The Company has no evidence that the restatement is due to any material noncompliance by the Company, as a result of misconduct, with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws. The Audit Committee and the executive officers of the Company have discussed the matters disclosed in this Current Report on Form 8-K with KPMG LLP, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm.

Re: Proposed Equity Tender Offer
Dear Mike:
I am writing to you in reference to the proposed cash tender offer (the "Equity Tender Offer") by AutoNation, Inc. (the "Company") to purchase up to 50,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock (the "Common Stock"), substantially upon the terms of the draft Offer to Purchase received from the Company and the related draft Letter of Transmittal received from the Company. As described by the Company, the Equity Tender Offer is one part of a recapitalization transaction (the "Transactions") that includes (i) a concurrent tender offer and consent solicitation by the Company for any and all of its 9% senior notes due 2008, (ii) an amendment or an amendment and restatement of the Company's $600 million, unsecured, revolving credit facility to, among other things, provide for a new $300 million term loan facility, which can be increased to $400 million at the Company's option and (iii) an offering of senior unsecured notes with an aggregate principal amount of approximately $900 million.
ESL Investments, Inc., together with its affiliated entities and funds ("ESL"), collectively, beneficially own and have the right to tender into the Equity Tender Offer 77,061,800 shares (the "Shares") of Common Stock. In connection with the Company's decision to implement the Transactions, the Company has requested that ESL state its intentions with respect to the Shares and agree to tender the Shares into the Equity Tender Offer. Pursuant to that request by the Company, and for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, ESL agrees to tender all of the Shares (without a minimum purchase condition) into the Equity Tender Offer pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of the Equity Tender Offer no later than the tenth business day following the commencement of the Equity Tender Offer, and not withdraw (once tendered) any of the Shares from the Equity Tender Offer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, ESL's obligation to tender (and not withdraw) the Shares is conditioned upon (i) the price to be paid per share of Common Stock in the Equity Tender Offer being not less than $23.00; (ii) the final expiration of the Equity Tender Offer and the acceptance for payment of the Common Stock tendered therein being no later than April 28, 2006; and (iii) no person commencing a bona fide tender or exchange offer for 5% or more of the Common Stock (other than the Company in connection with the Equity Tender Offer), no merger, acquisition, business combination or other similar transaction with or involving the Company being publicly disclosed and the Company not entering into a definitive agreement or an agreement in principle with any person with respect to a merger, business combination or other similar transaction. In making its decision to tender the Shares, ESL understands that neither the Company nor its Board of Directors will be making any recommendation to ESL regarding whether ESL should tender or refrain from tendering its Shares.
ESL hereby consents to the Company's disclosure of ESL's agreement to tender (and not withdraw) the Shares in any press releases announcing the Transactions (so long as ESL is provided the opportunity to review and approve such reference in any such release in advance), the various tender offer and other disclosure documents relating to the Transactions (so long as ESL is provided the opportunity to review and approve such reference in any such documents in advance), and in other public disclosures from the Company made in reference to the Transactions.
We look forward to the successful completion of the Transactions, including the Equity Tender Offer.
Very truly yours,
ESL Investments, Inc.

Exhibit 99.1
(NYSE: AN),
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (March 7, 2006) - AutoNation, Inc.
America's largest automotive retailer, announced today that it intends to commence a cash tender offer to purchase up to 50 million shares of its common stock at a price per share of $23. The number of shares proposed to be purchased in the offer represents approximately 19% of the Company's currently outstanding shares. The tender price represents a 10% premium over the closing price of the Company's common stock on the New York Stock Exchange of $20.89 per share on March 6, 2006, the last trading day prior to the announcement.
Mike Jackson, the Company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "The tender offer for our common stock demonstrates our confidence in the future of AutoNation. The transaction will allow us to deliver stockholder value while retaining financial flexibility to take advantage of future opportunities. We expect the transaction to be accretive to future earnings in the range of $.08 to $.10 per share on a full year basis."
AutoNation expects to commence the offer by no later than March 10, 2006. It is presently anticipated that the offer will remain open for a period of at least 20 business days. Tenders of shares must be made on or prior to the expiration of the offer and may be withdrawn at any time on or prior to the expiration of the offer.
The Company expects to pay for the shares purchased in the tender offer through a combination of debt financing and existing cash. The Company also intends to seek to repurchase all of its existing 9% senior notes due 2008 in the aggregate principal amount of $323.5 million through a concurrent cash tender offer and consent solicitation.
The stock tender offer will be subject to certain terms and conditions that will be described in the offer to purchase that will be distributed to stockholders and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including that the Company obtains the debt financing on reasonably satisfactory terms prior to the expiration of the tender offer. Additionally, the Company may exercise its right to purchase up to an additional 2% of its outstanding common stock without extending the offer.
On the terms and subject to the conditions of the offer, the Company's stockholders will have the opportunity to tender some or all of their shares at a price of $23 per share, net in cash, without interest. Since it is expected that more than 50 million shares will be tendered, AutoNation will purchase the shares tendered on a pro rata basis pursuant to certain procedures specified in the offer to purchase to be mailed to stockholders.
ESL Investments, Inc., which owns 77,061,800 shares, or 29%, of the Company's common stock, has agreed to tender all of its shares in the offer. Two of the Company's directors, Edward S. Lampert and William C. Crowley, are Chief Executive Officer and President and Chief Operating Officer, respectively, of ESL Investments, Inc. Assuming that most other stockholders participate in the tender offer, ESL's percentage ownership interest in the Company would remain substantially unchanged. Mr. Lampert stated, "ESL expects to maintain a substantial ownership interest in AutoNation. This transaction should create a more efficient capital structure for the Company."
All of the Company's other directors and executive officers have advised the Company that they do not intend to tender any of their shares in the tender offer, except for Michael E. Maroone, the Company's President and Chief Operating Officer, who has advised the Company that he intends to tender approximately three million shares of common stock that he owns in the tender offer. Mr. Maroone beneficially owns a total of approximately six million shares, including approximately three million vested stock options.
None of the Company, its Board of Directors, the information agent, the depositary or the dealer managers will make any recommendations to stockholders as to whether to tender or refrain from tendering their shares into the offer. Stockholders must decide how many shares they will tender, if any.
The information agent for the tender offer will be Innisfree M&A Incorporated. The depositary for the Offer will be Computershare Trust Company of New York. The dealer managers for the tender offer will be J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and Banc of America Securities LLC. The offer to purchase, letter of transmittal and related documents will be mailed to stockholders of record and also will be made available for distribution to beneficial owners of the Company's common stock. Stockholders with questions or who would like additional copies of the offer documents may call the information agent, Innisfree M&A Incorporated, toll-free at (877) 825-8631. (Banks and brokers may call collect at (212) 750-5833.)

(NYSE: AN
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (March 7, 2006) - AutoNation, Inc.
), America's largest automotive retailer, announced today that it intends to commence an offer to purchase for cash any and all of its outstanding 9% senior notes due 2008 in an aggregate principal amount of $323.5 million.

AutoNation expects to commence the offer by no later than March 10, 2006. It is presently anticipated that the consent solicitation will expire approximately 10 business days after commencement of the offer (the "Consent Deadline"), and the offer will remain open for a period of at least 20 business days.
As will be described in more detail in the offer to purchase and consent solicitation, the total consideration for each $1,000 principal amount of notes validly tendered and accepted for purchase by AutoNation will be calculated, in accordance with standard market practice, five business days prior to the expiration of the offer based upon a fixed spread of 50 basis points over the bid side yield on the 4.125% U.S. Treasury Note due August 15, 2008. The foregoing total consideration for the notes includes a consent payment equal to $30 per $1,000 principal amount of notes tendered. Holders must validly tender their notes on or before the Consent Deadline in order to be eligible to receive the total consideration, which includes the consent payment. Holders who validly tender their notes after the Consent Deadline and before the expiration of the offer will only be eligible to receive an amount equal to the total consideration minus the consent payment. Additionally, holders whose notes are purchased pursuant to the offer will receive any accrued but unpaid interest up to but not including the payment date for the notes.
Completion of the offer and consent solicitation will be subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including, but not limited to, receipt of valid tenders and consents from at least a majority in principal amount of outstanding notes and receipt of debt financing in an amount that, with existing cash reserves, will be sufficient to purchase the notes tendered in the offer and the shares tendered in the concurrent cash tender offer to purchase 50 million shares of the Company's common stock at a price of $23 per share.

Item 8.01 Other Events.
On April 3, 2006, AutoNation, Inc. issued a press release announcing that it received lender commitments of $600.0 million for a term loan. A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and its contents are incorporated herein by reference.
The $600.0 million in term loan commitments exceeded AutoNation's original expectations. Accordingly, AutoNation anticipates that its previously announced offering of senior unsecured notes will be reduced to an aggregate principal amount of $600.0 million. AutoNation expects to finance its previously announced equity tender offer and debt tender offer and consent solicitation with the proceeds of the $600.0 million term loan, the net proceeds from the offering of the $600.0 million principal amount of senior unsecured notes, revolving credit facility borrowings of approximately $125.0 million and approximately $200.0 million of existing cash on hand. Set forth below is AutoNation's updated presentation of the estimated sources and uses of funds for the foregoing transactions.
This presentation assumes that 50,000,000 shares are purchased for $23 per share and that all of the 9% senior notes are tendered and that all such notes are purchased in the debt tender offer and paid for on April 12, 2006, for total consideration and accrued interest payable per $1,000 principal amount of old notes of $1,098.41, based on a hypothetical purchase price determined based on a fixed spread over the 4.124% U.S. Treasury Note due August 15, 2008 and based upon the yield on such benchmark security as of March 8, 2006. It is also assumed that, of the $600.0 million of senior notes to be issued, an equal aggregate principal amount of the floating rate notes and the fixed rate notes are issued, although the relative size of each tranche remains to be determined.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

 
Exhibit 99.1
     (NYSE: AN), America's largest automotive retailer, announced today that it has received commitments from lenders for a term loan of $600 million.

FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (April 5, 2006)  AutoNation, Inc.

Exhibit 99.1
, America's largest automotive retailer, is announcing an updated earnings estimate for the first quarter ended March 31, 2006. The Company's earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations for the first quarter are now expected to be in the range of $0.36 to $0.38, increased from the previously disclosed estimate of $0.32 to $0.35. This compares to EPS from continuing operations of $0.33 per share reported in the first quarter of 2005, which included a $0.03 per share charge from senior note repurchases. Commenting on estimated first-quarter EPS from continuing operations, AutoNation Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Mike Jackson said, "We experienced stronger than expected performance primarily in our premium luxury business in March." Details will be provided in the Company's first-quarter earnings release and conference call on April 27, 2006.
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (April 6, 2006) - AutoNation, Inc. (NYSE: AN)
Also, the Company now expects that its previously announced equity tender offer and debt tender offer and consent solicitation will be accretive to future earnings in the range of $0.13 to $0.15 per share on a full-year basis. Previously, the Company's estimated range was $0.08 to $0.10 per share on a full-year basis. This improvement is attributable to an improved mix of financing sources between bank financing and senior notes, as well as lower interest rate spreads than previously anticipated.
AutoNation will release financial results for the first quarter ending March 31, 2006, on Thursday, April 27, 2006 before 7:00 a.m. Eastern Time. Mike Jackson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Maroone, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Craig Monaghan, Chief Financial Officer, will discuss these results and the Company's outlook during a conference call and audio web cast that same morning at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time.

Exhibit 99.1
America's largest automotive retailer, announced today the preliminary results of its cash tender offer to purchase up to 50 million shares of the Company's common stock at a price of $23 per share, which expired at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on April 12, 2006. In addition, the Company announced the results of its concurrent debt tender offer and consent solicitation in respect of its outstanding 9% senior notes due 2008 that also expired at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on April 12, 2006.
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (April 12, 2006)  AutoNation, Inc. (NYSE: AN),
Based on the preliminary count by Computershare Trust Company of New York, the depositary for the stock tender offer, approximately 188.3 million shares of common stock were properly tendered and not withdrawn in the stock tender offer, including approximately 16.9 million shares that were tendered by notice of guaranteed delivery. Accordingly, the Company has accepted for purchase 50 million shares at a purchase price of $23 per share, for a total purchase price of $1.150 billion. In addition, the Company has accepted for purchase all of the approximately $309.4 million, or 95.6%, of the Company's outstanding 9% senior notes that were tendered in the debt tender offer.
Concurrently with the expiration of the stock and debt tender offers, the Company consummated the related debt financing transactions that will be used to provide a portion of the funding required in connection with the tender offers. The financing transactions include the sale of $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured 7% senior notes due 2014, the sale of $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured floating rate senior notes due 2013, the amendment of the Company's existing revolving credit agreement and a new $600.0 million term loan maturing 2010. Cash on hand and revolving credit facility borrowings under the amended credit agreement in the aggregate amount of approximately $310 million will be used to provide the remaining funding required to complete the stock and debt tender offers and pay related expenses.
Since the stock tender offer was oversubscribed, purchase of the tendered shares will be subject to proration as described in the offer to purchase dated March 10, 2006 relating to the stock tender offer. The number of shares tendered and not withdrawn are preliminary and are subject to verification by Computershare Trust Company of New York, the proper delivery of all shares tendered and not properly withdrawn (including shares tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures) and the impact of odd-lot and conditional tenders. The actual number of shares validly tendered and not withdrawn and the proration factor will be announced promptly following completion of the verification process. Promptly after such announcement, the depositary for the stock tender offer will issue payment for the shares validly tendered and accepted under the stock tender offer and will return all other shares tendered. Payment by the Company to the depositary in respect of shares purchased pursuant to the stock tender offer will occur following the completion of the proration process, which is expected to occur within five business days. Payment by the Company to the depositary in respect of notes purchased in the debt tender offer is expected to occur later today.
As of April 10, 2006, the Company had approximately 264.5 million shares of common stock outstanding. As a result of the completion of the stock tender offer, the Company expects to have approximately 214.5 million shares of common stock outstanding.
Any questions with regard to the stock tender offer may be directed to Innisfree M&A Incorporated, the information agent for the offer, at (877) 825-8631. The dealer managers for the stock tender offer were J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and Banc of America Securities LLC, and the dealer managers for the debt tender offer and consent solicitation were J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC.

     Mr. Jackson also stated, "In April, we successfully completed our tender offer for 50 million shares of our stock, which allowed us to deliver $1.15 billion of cash to stockholders while retaining financial flexibility to take advantage of future opportunities.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
The attached financial tables contain certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined under SEC rules, such as net income and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the three-month period ended March 31, 2005, adjusted to exclude the effect of repurchases during the first quarter of 2005 of the Company's 9% senior unsecured notes due 2008. As required by SEC rules, the Company has provided reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, which are set forth in the attachments to this release. The Company believes that each of the foregoing non-GAAP financial measures improves the transparency of the Company's disclosure, provides a meaningful presentation of the Company's results from its core business operations excluding the impact of items not related to the Company's ongoing core business operations, and improves the period-to-period comparability of the Company's results from its core business operations.

          (a) The Company will not cause or permit any Restricted Subsidiary (which is not a Guarantor), directly or indirectly, to guarantee, assume or in any other manner become liable with respect to any Indebtedness of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary unless such Restricted Subsidiary simultaneously executes and delivers a supplemental indenture to this Indenture providing for a Guarantee of the Notes on the same terms as the guarantee of such Indebtedness except that (A) such guarantee need not be secured unless required pursuant to Section 4.12 and (B) if such Indebtedness is by its terms expressly subordinated to the Notes, any such assumption, guarantee or other liability of such Restricted Subsidiary with respect to such Indebtedness shall be subordinated to such Restricted Subsidiary's Guarantee of the Notes at least to the same extent as such Indebtedness is subordinated to the Notes.
          The preceding paragraph shall not be applicable to any guarantees of any Restricted Subsidiary (i) permitted to be incurred pursuant to clauses (1), (4), (5) and (7) of Section 4.9 hereof; or (ii) given to a bank or trust company or any commercial banking institution that is a member of the U.S. Federal Reserve System (or any branch, subsidiary or Affiliate thereof), in connection with the operation of cash management programs established for its benefit or that of any Restricted Subsidiary.
          (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Guarantee by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Notes shall provide by its terms that it (and all Liens securing the same) shall be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon (i) any sale, exchange or transfer, to any Person not an Affiliate of the Company, of all of the Company's Capital Stock in, or all or substantially all the assets of, such Restricted Subsidiary, which transaction is in compliance with the terms of this Indenture and such
 
Restricted Subsidiary is released from all guarantees, if any, by it of other Indebtedness of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, (ii) the Designation of a Restricted Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in compliance with this Indenture and (iii) with respect to any Guarantees created after the Issue Date, the release by the holders of the Indebtedness of the Company described in the preceding clause (a) above of their guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary (including any deemed release upon payment in full of all obligations under such Indebtedness), at such time as (A) no other Indebtedness of the Company has been guaranteed by such Restricted Subsidiary or (B) the holders of all such other Indebtedness which is guaranteed by such Restricted Subsidiary also release their guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary (including any deemed release upon payment in full of all obligations under such Indebtedness).
     Section 4.17. .
Suspension Period
          During the Suspension Period, the provisions of this Indenture under Sections 4.7, 4.8, 4.9, 4.10, 4.11, 4.13, 4.15 and the requirement set forth in paragraph (3) of Section 5.1 will no longer be applicable to the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries.
          "Suspension Period" means the period (a) beginning on the date that:
and (b) ending on the date (the "Reversion Date") that neither Moody's nor Standard & Poor's has an Investment Grade rating on the Notes. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of any Reversion Date.
          On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness incurred during the Suspension Period will be classified to have been incurred pursuant to clause (a) of Section 4.9 of this Indenture or one of the clauses set forth in the definition of Permitted Indebtedness (to the extent such Indebtedness would be permitted to be incurred thereunder as of the Reversion Date and after giving effect to Indebtedness incurred prior to the Suspension Period and outstanding on the Reversion Date). To the extent any Indebtedness would not be so permitted to be incurred pursuant to clause (a) of Section 4.9 of this Indenture or any of the clauses set forth in the definition of Permitted Indebtedness, such Indebtedness will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as Permitted Indebtedness under clause (3) of the definition of Permitted Indebtedness and permitted to be refinanced under clause (16) of the definition of Permitted Indebtedness.
          For purposes of calculating the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under clause (3) of paragraph (a) of Section 4.7, calculations under that clause will be made with reference to the Issue Date as set forth in that clause. Accordingly, Restricted Payments made during the Suspension Period will reduce the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under such clause (3) and the events specified in subclauses (A) through (F) of such clause (3) that occur during the Suspension Period will increase the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under such clause (3).
          For purposes of Section 4.10, on the Reversion Date, the amount of Excess Proceeds will be reset to zero.

     Section 6.1. .
Events of Default
          The occurrence of any of the following will constitute an ":"
Event of Default
 
 
     Section 6.2. .
Acceleration
          If an Event of Default (other than as specified in clauses (8) and (9) of Section 6.1) shall occur and be continuing with respect to this Indenture as it relates to Floating Rate Notes or Fixed Rate Notes, as the case may be, the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of Floating Rate Notes or Fixed Rate Notes, as the case may be, then outstanding may, and the Trustee at the request of such Holders shall, declare all unpaid principal of, premium, if any, and accrued interest on all such Notes to be due and payable immediately, by a notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by the Holders) and upon any such declaration, such principal, premium, if any, and interest shall become due and payable immediately. If an Event of Default specified in clause (8) or (9) of Section 6.1 occurs and is continuing, then all the Notes shall ipso facto become and be due and payable immediately in an amount equal to the principal amount of the Notes, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date the Notes become due and payable, without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holder. Thereupon, the Trustee may, at its discretion, proceed to protect and enforce the rights of the Holders by appropriate judicial proceedings.
          After a declaration of acceleration, but before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of Notes outstanding as to which a notice of acceleration has been given may, by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if
 
          No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.
          The Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of Floating Rate Notes or Fixed Rate Notes outstanding may on behalf of the Holders of all outstanding Notes of the respective series waive any past default under this Indenture and its consequences, except a default (1) in the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any Note of such series (which may only be waived with the consent of each Holder affected) or (2) in respect of a covenant or provision which under this Indenture cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder affected by such modification or amendment.
          No Holder has any right to institute any proceedings with respect to this Indenture or any remedy thereunder, unless the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes of that series have made written request, and offered reasonable indemnity, to the Trustee to institute such proceeding as Trustee under such Notes and this Indenture, the Trustee has failed to institute such proceeding within 15 days after receipt of such notice and the Trustee, within such 15-day period, has not received directions inconsistent with such written request by Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of such Notes outstanding. Such limitations do not, however, apply to a suit instituted by a Holder for the enforcement of the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on such Note on or after the respective due dates expressed in such Note.
     Section 6.3. .
Other Remedies
          If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may pursue any available remedy to collect the payment of principal, premium, if any, Additional Interest, if any, and interest on the Notes or to enforce the performance of any provision of the Notes or this Indenture.
          The Trustee may maintain a proceeding even if it does not possess any of the Notes or does not produce any of them in the proceeding. A delay or omission by the Trustee or any Holder of a Note in exercising any right or remedy accruing upon an Event of Default shall not impair the right or remedy or constitute a waiver of or acquiescence in the Event of Default. All remedies are cumulative to the extent permitted by law.
 
     Section 6.4. .
Waiver of Past Defaults
          The Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes may, on behalf of the Holders of all the Notes of that series, waive any past Defaults, except a Default in the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, Additional Interest, if any, or interest on any Note of that series, or in respect of a covenant or provision which under this Indenture cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each Note of that series outstanding. Upon such waiver, such Default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any right consequent thereon.
     Section 6.5. .
Control by Majority
          Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes of that series may direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on it. Holders may not enforce this Indenture or the Notes, however, except as provided in this Indenture. In addition, the Trustee may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or this Indenture or that the Trustee determines may be unduly prejudicial to the rights of other Holders of Notes of that series or that may involve the Trustee in personal liability.
     Section 6.6. .
Limitation on Suits
          A Holder of a Note may not use this Indenture to prejudice the rights of another Holder of a Note or to obtain a preference or priority over another Holder of a Note.
     Section 6.7. .
Rights of Holders of Notes to Receive Payment
          Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture, the right of any Holder of a Note to receive payment of principal, premium and Additional Interest, if any, and interest on the Note, on or after the respective due dates expressed in the Note (including in connection with an offer to purchase), or to bring suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates, shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of such Holder.
     Section 6.8. .
Collection Suit by Trustee
          If an Event of Default specified in Section 6.1(1) or (2) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee is authorized to recover judgment in its own name and as trustee of an express trust against the Company for the whole amount of principal of, premium and Additional Interest, if any, and interest remaining unpaid on the Notes and interest on overdue principal and, to the extent lawful, interest and such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel.
     Section 6.9. .
Trustee May File Proofs of Claim
          The Trustee is authorized to file such proofs of claim and other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel) and the Holders of the Notes allowed in any judicial proceedings relative to the Company (or any other obligor upon the Notes), its creditors or its property and shall be entitled and empowered to collect, receive and distribute any money or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and any
 
custodian in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make such payments to the Trustee, and in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due to it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 7.7. To the extent that the payment of any such compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 7.7 out of the estate in any such proceeding, shall be denied for any reason, payment of the same shall be secured by a Lien on, and shall be paid out of, any and all distributions, dividends, money, securities and other properties that the Holders may be entitled to receive in such proceeding whether in liquidation or under any plan of reorganization or arrangement or otherwise. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Notes or the rights of any Holder, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding.
     Section 6.10. .
Priorities
          If the Trustee collects any money pursuant to this Article, it shall pay out the money in the following order:
          First: to the Trustee, its agents and counsel for amounts due under Section 7.7, including payment of all compensation, expense and liabilities incurred, and all advances made, by the Trustee and the costs and expenses of collection;
          Second: to Holders of Notes for amounts due and unpaid on the Notes for principal, premium and Additional Interest, if any, and interest, ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on the Notes for principal, premium and Additional Interest, if any, and interest, respectively; and
          Third: to the Company or to such party as a court of competent jurisdiction shall direct.
          The Trustee may fix a record date and payment date for any payment to Holders of Notes pursuant to this Section 6.10.
     Section 6.11. .
Undertaking for Costs
          In any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken or omitted by it as a Trustee, a court in its discretion may require the filing by any party litigant in the suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of the suit, and the court in its discretion may assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, against any party litigant in the suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by the party litigant. This Section does not apply to a suit by the Trustee, a suit by a Holder of a Note pursuant to Section 6.7, or a suit by Holders of more than 10% in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes.

          (c) The Trustee may not be relieved from liabilities for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act, or its own willful misconduct, except that:

          A successor Trustee shall deliver a written acceptance of its appointment to the retiring Trustee and to the Company. Thereupon, the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective, and the successor Trustee shall have all the rights, powers and duties of the Trustee under this Indenture.

The retiring Trustee shall promptly transfer all property held by it as Trustee to the successor Trustee, that all sums owing to the Trustee hereunder have been paid and subject to the Lien provided for in Section 7.7.

consent is not made on any Note.

Guarantee
          Subject to this Article X, each of the Guarantors hereby, jointly and severally, unconditionally guarantees to each Holder of a Note authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and to the Trustee and its successors and assigns, irrespective of the validity and enforceability of this Indenture, the Notes or the obligations of the Company hereunder or thereunder, that: (a) the principal of, premium, if any, Additional Interest, if any, and interest on the Notes will be promptly paid by the Company in full when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, redemption or otherwise, and interest on the overdue principal of, premium, if any, Additional Interest, if any, and interest on the Notes, if any, if lawful, and all other obligations of the Company to the Holders or the Trustee hereunder or thereunder will be promptly paid by the Company in full or performed by the Company, all in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof; and (b) in case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any Notes or any of such other obligations, that same will be promptly paid by the Company in full when due or performed by the Company in accordance with the terms of the extension or renewal, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise. Failing payment when due by the Company of any amount so guaranteed or any performance so guaranteed which failure continues for ten days after demand therefor is made to the Company for whatever reason, the Guarantors shall be jointly and severally obligated to pay the same immediately. Each Guarantor agrees that this is a guarantee of payment and not a guarantee of collection.
          The Guarantors hereby agree that their obligations hereunder shall be unconditional, irrespective of the validity, regularity or enforceability of the Notes or this Indenture, the absence of any
 
action to enforce the same, any waiver or consent by any Holder of the Notes with respect to any provisions hereof or thereof, the recovery of any judgment against the Company, any action to enforce the same or any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a Guarantor. Each Guarantor hereby waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment (except as specifically provided in the preceding paragraph), filing of claims with a court in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company, any right to require a proceeding first against the Company, protest, notice and all demands (except as specifically provided in the preceding paragraph) whatsoever and covenant that this Guarantee shall not be discharged except by complete performance of the obligations contained in the Notes and this Indenture. Each Guarantor also expressly waives, without any requirement of any notice to or further assent by such Guarantor, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the benefit of all principles or provisions of applicable law which are or might be in conflict with the terms hereof, including, without limitation, Section 10-7-23 and Section 10-7-24 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated.
          If any Holder or the Trustee is required by any court or otherwise to return to the Company, the Guarantors or any custodian, trustee, liquidator or other similar official acting in relation to either the Company or the Guarantors, any amount paid by either to the Trustee or such Holder, this Guarantee, to the extent theretofore discharged, shall be reinstated in full force and effect.
          Each Guarantor agrees that it shall not be entitled to any right of subrogation in relation to the Holders in respect of any obligations guaranteed hereby until payment in full of all obligations guaranteed hereby. Each Guarantor further agrees that, as between the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Holders and the Trustee, on the other hand, (x) the maturity of the obligations guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as provided in Article VI hereof for the purposes of this Guarantee, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the obligations guaranteed hereby, and (y) in the event of any declaration of acceleration of such obligations as provided in Article VI hereof, such obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall forthwith become due and payable by the Guarantors for the purpose of this Guarantee, failing payment when due by the Company which failure continues for ten days after demand therefor is made to the Company. The Guarantors shall have the right to seek contribution from any non-paying Guarantor so long as the exercise of such right does not impair the rights of the Holders under the Guarantee.
     Section 10.2. .
Limitation on Guarantor Liability
          Each Guarantor, and by its acceptance of Notes, each Holder, hereby confirms that it is the intention of all such parties that the Guarantee of such Guarantor not constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance for purposes of Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar federal or state law to the extent applicable to any Guarantee. To effectuate the foregoing intention, the Trustee, the Holders and the Guarantors hereby irrevocably agree that the obligations of such Guarantor under its Guarantee and this Article X shall be limited to the maximum amount as will, after giving effect to such maximum amount and all other contingent and fixed liabilities of such Guarantor that are relevant under such laws, and after giving effect to any collections from, rights to receive contribution from or payments made by or on behalf of any other Guarantor in respect of the obligations of such other Guarantor under this Article X, result in the obligations of such Guarantor under its Guarantee not constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance.

Interest
Calculation Agent
Interest Payment Date
provided
          Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual number of days elapsed. The amount of interest for each day that the Floating Rate Notes are outstanding (the "") shall be calculated by dividing the interest rate in effect for such day by 360 and multiplying the result by the principal outstanding amount of the Floating Rate Notes. The amount of interest to be paid on the Floating Rate Notes for each Interest Period shall be calculated by adding the Daily Interest Amounts for each day in the Interest Period.
Daily Interest Amount
          "," with respect to an Interest Period, will be the second London Banking Day preceding the first day of the Interest Period.
Determination Date
          "" means the period commencing on and including an Interest Payment Date and ending on and including the day immediately preceding the next succeeding Interest Payment Date; that the first Interest Period shall commence on and include April 12, 2006, and end on and include July 14, 2006.
Interest Period
provided
 
          "" with respect to an Interest Period will be the rate (expressed as a percentage per annum) for deposits in United States dollars for three-month periods beginning on the first day of such Interest Period that appears on Telerate Page 3750 as of 11:00 a.m., London time, on the Determination Date.

If at least two such offered quotations are so provided, LIBOR for the Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations. If fewer than two such quotations are so provided, the Calculation Agent will request each of three major banks in New York City, as selected by the Calculation Agent, to provide such bank's rate (expressed as a percentage per annum), as of approximately 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on such Determination Date, for loans in a Representative Amount in United States dollars to leading European banks for a three-month period beginning on the first day of such Interest Period. If at least two such rates are so provided, LIBOR for the Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such rates. If fewer than two such rates are so provided, then LIBOR for the Interest Period will be LIBOR in effect with respect to the immediately preceding Interest Period.
LIBOR
          "" is any day in which dealings in United States dollars are transacted or, with respect to any future date, are expected to be transacted in the London interbank market.
London Banking Day

Treasury Yield
provided
          All percentages resulting from any of the above calculations will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point being rounded upwards (e.g., 9.876545% (or .09876545) being rounded to 9.87655% (or .0987655)) and all dollar amounts used in or resulting from such calculations will be rounded to the nearest cent (with one-half cent being rounded upwards).

          The Calculation Agent will, upon the request of the holder of any Floating Rate Note, provide the interest rate then in effect with respect to the Floating Rate Notes.

The Notes will be issued in denominations of $1,000 and integral multiples thereof. Such payment shall be in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts.

third Business Day prior to the proposed date of borrowing, in the case of a Competitive Bid Quote Request for Competitive Bid Loans at the Eurodollar Competitive Rate or (B) the Quotation Date, in the case of a Competitive Bid Quote Request for Competitive Bid Loans at the Absolute Rate (or, in any such case, such other time and date as the Borrower and the Administrative Agent may agree) that if JPMorgan Chase Bank is receiving quotes as provided in , any Competitive Bid Quote may be submitted by JPMorgan Chase Bank (or its applicable Lending Office) only if JPMorgan Chase Bank (or such applicable Lending Office) notifies the Borrower of the terms of the offer contained therein not later than 9:15 A.M. on the Quotation Date. Any Competitive Bid Quote so made shall be irrevocable except with the consent of the Administrative Agent given on the instructions of the Borrower.

Section 2.5(g)
     (ii) Each Competitive Bid Quote shall be substantially in the form of attached hereto and shall specify:
Exhibit H
     (A) the proposed date of borrowing and the Interest Period therefor;
     (B) the principal amount of the Competitive Bid Loan for which each such offer is being made, which principal amount shall be at least $5,000,000 (or in increments of $1,000,000 in excess thereof); that the aggregate principal amount of all Competitive Bid Loans for which a Lender submits Competitive Bid Quotes may not exceed the principal amount of the Competitive Bid Borrowing for a particular Interest Period for which offers were requested;
provided
     (C) in the case of a Competitive Bid Quote for Competitive Bid Loans at an Absolute Rate, the rate of interest per annum (rounded upwards, if necessary, to the nearest 1/10,000th of 1%) offered for each such Competitive Bid Loan (the "Absolute Rate");
     (D) in the case of a Competitive Bid Quote for Competitive Bid Loans at the Eurodollar Competitive Rate, the positive or negative margin to be added to or deducted from the Interbank Offered Rate; and
     (E) the identity of the quoting Lender.
Unless otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, no Competitive Bid Quote shall contain qualifying, conditional or similar language or propose terms other than or in addition to those set forth in the applicable Competitive Bid Quote Request and, in particular, no Competitive Bid Quote may be conditioned upon acceptance by the Borrower of all (or some specified minimum) of the principal amount of the Competitive Bid Loan for which such Competitive Bid Quote is being made. Any subsequent Competitive Bid Quote submitted by a Revolving Credit Lender that amends, modifies or is otherwise inconsistent with a previous Competitive Bid Quote submitted by such Lender with respect to the same Competitive Bid Quote Request shall be disregarded by the Borrower unless such subsequent Competitive Bid Quote is submitted solely to correct a manifest error in such former Competitive Bid Quote.
     (d) The Borrower shall as promptly as practicable after the Competitive Bid Quote is submitted (but in any event not later than 12:00 Noon on (A) in the case of a Competitive Bid Loan at an Absolute Rate, the Quotation Date (or such other time and date as
 
33
the Borrower and the Administrative Agent may agree) or (B) in the case of a Competitive Bid Loan at a Eurodollar Competitive Rate, the third Business Day prior to the proposed date of borrowing) notify the Administrative Agent and Revolving Credit Lenders of (x) the aggregate principal amount of the Competitive Bid Borrowing for which Competitive Bid Quotes have been received as well as the ranges of bids submitted for each Interest Period requested, (y) the respective principal amounts and Absolute Rates or Eurodollar Competitive Rates, as the case may be, so offered by each Revolving Credit Lender (identifying the Lender that made each Competitive Bid Quote), and (z) its acceptance or nonacceptance of the Competitive Bid Quotes. In the case of acceptance, such notice shall specify the aggregate principal amount of offers for each Interest Period that are accepted. The Borrower may accept any Competitive Bid Quote in whole or in part ( that any Competitive Bid Quote accepted in part shall be at least $5,000,000 or in increments of $1,000,000 in excess thereof); that:
provided
provided
     (i) the aggregate principal amount of each Competitive Bid Borrowing may not exceed the applicable amount set forth in the related Competitive Bid Quote Request;
     (ii) the aggregate principal amount of each Competitive Bid Borrowing shall be at least $5,000,000 (or an increment of $1,000,000 in excess thereof) but shall not cause the limits specified in hereof to be violated;
Section 2.5(a)
     (iii) except as provided below, acceptance of Competitive Bid Quotes for any Interest Period may be made only in ascending order of Absolute Rates or Eurodollar Competitive Rates, as the case may be, beginning with the lowest rate so offered; and
     (iv) the Borrower may not accept any Competitive Bid Quote where such Competitive Bid Quote fails to comply with hereof or otherwise fails to comply with the requirements of this Agreement (including, without limitation, hereof).
Section 2.5(c)(ii)
Section 2.5(a)
Any of the conditions above notwithstanding, the Borrower may, in its sole discretion, accept a Competitive Bid Quote that does not contain the lowest Absolute Rate or Eurodollar Competitive Rates, as the case may be, where acceptance of the Competitive Bid Quote containing the lowest Absolute Rate or Eurodollar Competitive Rate, as the case may be, would be less favorable to the Borrower or would cause the principal amount of Outstanding Revolving Credit Obligations to exceed the Total Revolving Credit Commitment.
     If Competitive Bid Quotes are made by two or more Revolving Credit Lenders with the same Absolute Rates or Eurodollar Competitive Rates, as the case may be, for a greater aggregate principal amount than the amount in respect of which Competitive Bid Quotes are accepted for the related Interest Period after the acceptance of all Competitive Bid Quotes, if any, of all lower Absolute Rates or Eurodollar Competitive Rates, as the case may be, offered by any Revolving Credit Lender for such related Interest Period, the principal amount of Competitive Bid Loans in respect of which such Competitive Bid Quotes are accepted shall be allocated by the Borrower among such Lenders as nearly as possible (in amounts of at least $1,000,000 or in increments of $100,000 in excess thereof) in proportion to the aggregate principal amount of such Competitive Bid Quotes. Determinations by the Borrower of the
 
34
amounts of Competitive Bid Loans and the lowest bid after adjustment as provided in shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.
Section 2.5(d)(iii)
     (e) Any Revolving Credit Lender whose offer to make any Competitive Bid Loan has been accepted shall, not later than 1:00 P.M. on the date specified for the making of such Loan, make the amount of such Loan available to the Borrower as shall be directed by the Authorized Representative in Dollars and in immediately available funds.
     (f) From time to time, the Borrower shall furnish such information to the Administrative Agent as the Administrative Agent may request relating to the making of Competitive Bid Loans, including the amounts, interest rates, dates of borrowings and maturities thereof.
     (g) The Borrower may request the Administrative Agent to receive the Competitive Bid Quotes, in which event the Administrative Agent shall (A) in the case of a Competitive Bid Loan at the Absolute Rate, as promptly as practicable after the Competitive Bid Quote is submitted (but in no event later than 10:00 A.M. on the Quotation Date) or (B) in the case of a Competitive Bid Loan at the Eurodollar Competitive Rate, by 10:00 A.M. on the date a Competitive Quote is submitted, notify the Borrower of the terms of any Competitive Bid Quote submitted by a Revolving Credit Lender that is in accordance with hereof. The Administrative Agent's notice to the Borrower shall specify (A) the aggregate principal amount of the Competitive Bid Borrowing for which Competitive Bid Quotes have been received and (B) the respective principal amounts and Absolute Rates or Eurodollar Competitive Rate, as the case may be, offered by each Revolving Credit Lender (identifying the Lender that made each Competitive Bid Quote). Not later than 12:00 Noon on (A) the third Business Day prior to the proposed date of borrowing, in the case of Competitive Bid Loans at the Eurodollar Competitive Rate or (B) the Quotation Date (or, in any such case, such other time and date as the Borrower and the Administrative Agent may agree), the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of their acceptance or nonacceptance of the Competitive Bid Quotes so notified to it (and the failure of the Borrower to give such notice by such time shall constitute nonacceptance) and the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each affected Lender. Together with each notice of a request for Competitive Bid Quotes which the Borrower requires the Administrative Agent to issue pursuant to this paragraph (g), the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Administrative Agent a bid administration fee of $1,500.00.

Termination
     11.9 . (a) Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, the Borrower agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Agent-Related Person and each Lender and each of their Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, and advisors (each, an "Indemnified Party") from and against any and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities, and reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees) that may be incurred by or awarded against any Indemnified Party, in each case arising out of or in connection with or by reason of (including, without limitation, in connection with any investigation, litigation, or proceeding or preparation of defense in connection therewith) the Loan Documents or the First Amendment or the actual or proposed use of the proceeds of the Loans or the Letters of Credit (all of the foregoing, collectively, the "Indemnified Liabilities"), except to the extent such claim, damage, loss, liability, cost, or expense resulted from such Indemnified Party's gross negligence

or willful misconduct. In the case of an investigation, litigation or other proceeding to which the indemnity in this applies, such indemnity shall be effective whether or not such investigation, litigation or proceeding is brought by the Borrower, its directors, shareholders or creditors or an Indemnified Party or any other Person or any Indemnified Party is otherwise a party thereto and whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated. The Borrower agrees that no Indemnified Party shall have any liability (whether direct or indirect, in contract or tort or otherwise) to it, any of its Subsidiaries, any Guarantor, or any security holders or creditors thereof arising out of, related to or in connection with the transactions contemplated herein, except to the extent that such liability resulted from such Indemnified Party's gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Borrower agrees not to assert any claim against any Agent-Related Person, any Lender, any of their Affiliates, or any of their respective directors, officers, employees, attorneys, agents, and advisers, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential, or punitive damages arising out of or otherwise relating to the Loan Documents, any of the transactions contemplated herein or the First Amendment or the actual or proposed use of the proceeds of the Loans.

Severability
     11.11 . This Agreement, together with the other Loan Documents, constitutes the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all previous proposals, negotiations, representations, commitments and other communications between or among the parties, both oral and written, with respect thereto (except that those provisions (if any) which by the express terms of (i) the commitment letter dated as of June 6, 2005, executed by JPMorgan Chase Bank, J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Bank of America, N.A. and Banc of America Securities LLC and accepted by the Borrower or (ii) the commitment letter, dated as of March 6, 2006, executed by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and accepted by the Borrower, survive the closing of the Revolving Credit Facility, the Term Facility or Letter of Credit Facility, as applicable, shall survive and continue in effect).

Agreement Controls
     11.13 . Notwithstanding any other provision herein, the aggregate interest rate charged hereunder, including all charges or fees in connection therewith deemed in the nature of interest under applicable law shall not exceed the Highest Lawful Rate (as such term is defined below). If the rate of interest (determined without regard to the preceding sentence) under this Agreement at any time exceeds the Highest Lawful Rate (as defined below), the outstanding amount of the Loans made hereunder shall bear interest at the Highest Lawful
Usury Savings Clause
 
89
Rate until the total amount of interest due hereunder equals the amount of interest which would have been due hereunder if the stated rates of interest set forth in this Agreement had at all times been in effect. In addition, if when the Loans made hereunder are repaid in full the total interest due hereunder (taking into account the increase provided for above) is less than the total amount of interest which would have been due hereunder if the stated rates of interest set forth in this Agreement had at all times been in effect, then to the extent permitted by law, the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to the difference between the amount of interest paid and the amount of interest which would have been paid if the Highest Lawful Rate had at all times been in effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is the intention of the Lenders and the Borrower to conform strictly to any applicable usury laws. Accordingly, if any Lender contracts for, charges, or receives any consideration which constitutes interest in excess of the Highest Lawful Rate, then any such excess shall be cancelled automatically and, if previously paid, shall at such Lender's option be applied to the outstanding amount of the Loans made hereunder or be refunded to the Borrower. As used in this paragraph, the term "Highest Lawful Rate" means the maximum lawful interest rate, if any, that at any time or from time to time may be contracted for, charged, or received under the laws applicable to such Lender which are presently in effect or, to the extent allowed by law, under such applicable laws which may hereafter be in effect and which allow a higher maximum nonusurious interest rate than applicable laws now allow.

As previously disclosed in AutoNation, Inc.s (the "Company") Current Report on Form 8-K and Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A, each filed on April 28, 2006, Mr. J.P. Bryan informed the Company on April 25, 2006 that he would retire from the Companys Board of Directors effective with the expiration of his annual term on June 1, 2006. Mr. Bryan also served on our audit committee and, accordingly, Mr. Bryans retirement caused our audit committee to have only two members. As a result, we are currently noncompliant with Section 303A.07(a) of the NYSE Listed Company Manual, which requires listed companies to have at least three (3) audit committee members. The Company gave notice to the NYSE of this non-compliance on June 8, 2006. The Board expects to appoint a new independent director to become a member of the audit committee by June 30, 2006 at which time the Company expects to be in full compliance with Section 303A.07(a).

Exhibit 99.1
     America's largest automotive retailer, today reported 2006 second-quarter net income from continuing operations of $74 million or $0.33 per share, compared to year-ago net income from continuing operations of $107 million or $0.40 per share. During the quarter, the Company repurchased $309 million in face value of its 9% senior notes for $334.2 million, incurring one-time repurchase costs of approximately $21 million after tax, or $.09 per share. Excluding this impact, the Company's second quarter adjusted net income from continuing operations was $95 million or $0.42 per share, up 5% versus the prior year. Second quarter results also include approximately $0.01 per share of non-cash compensation expense related to employee stock options, which is a component of selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, that was not in the prior year results.
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla., (July 27, 2006) AutoNation, Inc. (NYSE: AN),
     Second-quarter 2006 revenue totaled $5.0 billion, an increase of 1% compared to the year-ago period, with revenue growth in retail used vehicles of 7%, parts and service of 4%, and finance and insurance of 8%, more than offsetting a decline in new vehicle revenue. Premium luxury new vehicle revenue increased 18% over the prior year. Premium luxury and volume imports accounted for 61% of new vehicle revenue versus 55% a year ago. Total gross profit for the quarter increased 4%. Operating income was a second-quarter record of $213 million, up 1% versus the prior year.
     During the quarter, the Company successfully completed a tender offer for 50 million shares of its stock and other related debt financing transactions, including the senior notes repurchase mentioned above. These transactions allowed the Company to deliver $1.15 billion of cash to stockholders while retaining financial flexibility.
     Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Mike Jackson commented, "While the second quarter was a challenging economic environment for new vehicle sales, we were pleased with strong growth in our premium luxury new vehicle business, our high-margin parts and service business, used vehicles and finance & insurance."
     Discontinued operations in the second quarter were nominal compared to net income of $.33 per share last year. Last year's net income included a benefit of $0.36 per share from the resolution of various tax matters.
     AutoNation also announces that Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Craig Monaghan will be leaving AutoNation effective August 31, 2006 to take the position of Chief Financial Officer for Sears Holdings. "Craig has been a highly valued member of our
 
executive team since joining the organization in 2000, and has been instrumental in the successful development and execution of a number of our Company's most effective initiatives. All of us at AutoNation wish him well in his new duties," said Jackson. Beginning September 1, 2006, Alex McAllister, the Company's Vice President and Corporate Controller, will also serve as Interim CFO until December 31, 2006 when he will retire from the Company. Mr. McAllister had independently approached the Company about retiring for personal reasons unrelated to the Company. AutoNation will commence a national search for the CFO position immediately.
     For the six-month period ended June 30, 2006, the Company reported net income from continuing operations of $172 million or $0.70 per share. Excluding senior note repurchase costs, earnings per share from continuing operations for the six-month period ended June 30, 2006 were $193 million or $0.78 per share, compared to $0.76 per share in the prior year. The Company's revenue for the six-month period ended June 30, 2006 totaled $9.7 billion, up 3% compared to $9.4 billion in the prior year.

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
     In connection with its filing today of a Registration Statement on Form S-4 relating to an exchange offer for its $600 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes, AutoNation, Inc. ("AutoNation") is filing this Current Report on Form 8-K to update its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005 (the "2005 10-K").
     During the six months ended June 30, 2006, we approved the disposal of ten automotive retail franchises, either through sale or termination. In accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets", as described below, these franchises were removed from continuing operations and were treated as discontinued operations for financial statement reporting purposes ("Discontinued Operations") in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2006 and June 30, 2006. This update, which is required by applicable accounting rules because the Form S-4 incorporates information set forth in the 2005 10-K, reflects the reclassification of these automotive retail franchises from continuing operations to discontinued operations in our 2005 Form 10-K. The impact of the reclassification to total revenue was a decrease of $281.2 million, $360.4 million and $387.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The impact of the reclassification to net income from continuing operations was an increase/(decrease) of $2.7 million, $(.3) million and $(2.5) million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase/(decrease) by balance sheet account was as follows:
     The information contained in this Current Report is being provided to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under Items 2.02 and 9.01 of Form 8-K. Additionally, we are hereby incorporating this Current Report by reference into our existing and future prospectuses, registration statements and other filings with the Commission under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
     As previously disclosed, in April 2006 AutoNation issued $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes. The senior unsecured notes were offered solely by means of a confidential offering memorandum in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act and to persons outside the United States under Regulation S under the Securities Act. On August 28, 2006, AutoNation intends to file a Registration Statement on Form S-4 with the Commission for the registration of its senior unsecured exchange notes, which would be offered in exchange for the previously issued senior unsecured notes. Under applicable rules, the Form S-4 incorporates by reference AutoNation's latest Annual Report on Form 10-K (i.e., the 2005 10-K). As a result of the Discontinued Operations and in accordance with applicable rules, it is necessary to update certain information in the 2005 10-K to reflect the Discontinued Operations. Accordingly, this Current Report on Form 8-K updates certain financial information presented in Items 6, 7 and 8 of the 2005 Form 10-K to reflect the reclassifications of the franchises to discontinued operations from continuing operations, as discussed above, for each year in the five years ended December 31, 2005.
     These reclassifications had no impact on our:
 
     The updated financial information related to the Discontinued Operations is set forth in Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report. Except with respect to the updated financial information related to the Discontinued Operations, this Current Report on Form 8-K does not update the information set forth in the 2005 10-K in any manner. Accordingly, for a discussion of events that occurred subsequent to the filing of the 2005 10-K on March 3, 2006, reference should be made to AutoNation's filings with the Commission subsequent to March 3, 2006.
     Unless otherwise noted, the information in this Current Report and the exhibits filed herewith are as of the date of this Current Report.

For the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, $(144.1) million (consisting of $(142.6) million in continuing operations and $(1.5) million in discontinued operations) and $(121.2) million (consisting of $(117.5) million in continuing operations and $(3.7) million in discontinued operations), respectively, which were previously reported as operating activities are reported as a component of financing activities to reflect the net cash flow uses for floorplan facilities with lenders other than the automotive manufacturers' captive finance subsidiaries for that franchise ("non-trade lenders"). This change had the effect of increasing net cash from operating activities with the related offset in net cash from financing activities.
Overview
     AutoNation, Inc., through its subsidiaries, is the largest automotive retailer in the United States. As of December 31, 2005, we owned and operated 346 new vehicle franchises from 269 dealerships located in major metropolitan markets in 17 states, predominantly in the Sunbelt region of the United States. Our stores, which we believe include some of the most recognizable and well known in our key markets, sell 37 different brands of new vehicles. The core brands of vehicles that we sell, representing more than 90% of the new vehicles that we sold in 2005, are manufactured by Ford, General Motors, Daimler Chrysler, Toyota, Nissan, Honda and BMW.
     We operate in a single industry segment, automotive retailing. We offer a diversified range of automotive products and services, including new vehicles, used vehicles, vehicle maintenance and repair services, vehicle parts, extended service contracts, vehicle protection products and other aftermarket products. We also arrange financing for vehicle purchases through third-party finance sources. We believe that the significant scale of our operations and the quality of our managerial talent allow us to achieve efficiencies in our key markets by, among other things, reducing operating expenses, leveraging our market brands and advertising, improving asset management and sharing and implementing common processes across all of our stores.
     Historically, new vehicle sales have accounted for approximately 60% of our total revenue, but less than 30% of our total gross margin. Our parts and service and finance and insurance operations, while comprising less than 20% of total revenue, contribute approximately 60% of our gross margin. We believe that many factors affect industry-wide sales of new and used vehicles and finance and insurance products, and retailers' gross profit margins, including consumer confidence in the economy, the level of manufacturers' excess production capacity, manufacturer incentives (and consumers' reaction to such offers), intense industry competition, interest rates, the prospects of war, other international conflicts or terrorist attacks, severe weather conditions, the level of personal discretionary spending, product quality, affordability and innovation, fuel prices, credit availability, unemployment rates, the number of consumers whose vehicle leases are expiring and the length of consumer loans on existing vehicles. Our parts and service business is also impacted by these factors.
     In 2005, we had year-over-year overall same store gross profit growth driven by increases in used vehicles and parts and services. This was despite a challenging fourth quarter of 2005 which was impacted by the effects of Hurricane Wilma on our Florida stores and soft industry sales. Our performance is attributable to our emphasis on store processes, associate training and expense control.
     In 2006, we anticipate that industry-wide new vehicle sales will remain stable (nearly 17 million units) in the United States and continue to be highly competitive. However, the level of retail sales for 2006 is very difficult to predict.
     For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had net income from continuing operations of $398.2 million and $396.8 million, respectively, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.49 and $1.46, respectively. During 2005 and 2004, we recorded net income tax benefits in continuing operations totaling $14.5 million and $25.8 million, respectively, primarily related to resolution of various income tax matters. The results for 2005 include $10.6 million after-tax ($17.4 million pre-tax) of premium and deferred costs recognized as Other Interest Expense related to the repurchase of $123.1 million (face value) of our 9% senior unsecured notes. Additionally, the results for 2005 were impacted by higher floorplan interest expense primarily resulting from higher short-term LIBOR interest rates partially offset by lower average new vehicle inventory balances. The net inventory carrying benefit (floorplan interest expense net of
 
floorplan assistance recognized from manufacturers) for 2005 was $4.4 million, a decrease of $30.3 million compared to 2004. We expect net floorplan costs to continue to increase in 2006 as we experience increased interest rates.
     During 2005 and 2004, we had income from discontinued operations totaling $98.3 million and $36.8 million, respectively, net of income taxes. In 2005 and 2004, we recognized gains totaling $110.0 million and $52.2 million, respectively, included in discontinued operations related to the settlement of various income tax matters related to items previously reported in discontinued operations. In 2005 and 2004, we also recognized losses totaling $11.7 million and $15.4 million, respectively, net of income taxes, related to stores that were sold or for which we had entered into a definitive sale agreement. Certain amounts reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, have been adjusted to classify the results of the stores described above as discontinued operations.
     During 2005, we acquired 11.8 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $237.1 million leaving approximately $71.3 million available for share repurchases under the repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors. The indenture for our senior notes contains restrictions on our ability to make share repurchases. See further discussion under the heading "Financial Condition." During 2005, 9.8 million shares of our common stock were issued upon the exercise of stock options resulting in proceeds of $112.8 million.
Critical Accounting Policies
     We prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual outcomes could differ from those estimates. Set forth below are the policies that we have identified as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations or that involve significant estimates. For detailed discussion of other significant accounting policies see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
     Intangible and long-lived assets are a significant component of our consolidated balance sheets. Our policies regarding the valuation of intangible assets affect the amount of future amortization and possible impairment charges we may incur. Intangible assets consist primarily of the cost of acquired businesses in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired, using the purchase method of accounting.
Intangible and Long-Lived Assets 
     Acquired intangible assets are separately recognized if the benefit of the intangible asset is obtained through contractual or other legal rights, or if the intangible asset can be sold, transferred, licensed, rented, or exchanged, regardless of our intent to do so. Our principal identifiable intangible assets are rights under franchise agreements with vehicle manufacturers. We generally expect our franchise agreements to survive for the foreseeable future, and, when the agreements do not have indefinite terms, anticipate routine renewals of the agreements without substantial cost. We believe that our franchise agreements will contribute to cash flows for the foreseeable future and have indefinite lives.
     Goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives are tested for impairment annually at June 30 or more frequently when events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. We are subject to financial statement risk to the extent that intangible assets become impaired due to decreases in the fair market value of the related underlying business.
     We estimate the depreciable lives of our property, plant and equipment, including leasehold improvements, and review them for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may be impaired. We periodically evaluate the carrying value of assets held for sale to determine if, based on market conditions, the values of these assets should be adjusted. Although we believe our property, plant and equipment and assets held for sale are appropriately valued, the assumptions and estimates used may change and we may be required to record impairment charges to reduce the value of these assets.
      Revenue consists of the sales of new and used vehicles and commissions from related finance and insurance products and sales of parts and services. We recognize revenue in the period in which products are sold or services are provided. We recognize vehicle and finance and insurance revenue when a sales contract has been executed, the vehicle has been delivered and payment has been received or financing has been arranged. Revenue on finance and insurance products represents commissions earned by us for: (i) loans and leases placed with financial institutions in connection with customer vehicle purchases financed and (ii) vehicle protection products sold. An estimated liability for chargebacks against revenue recognized from sales of finance and vehicle protection products is established during the period in which the related revenue is recognized. We may also participate in future underwriting profit, pursuant to retrospective commission arrangements, that would be recognized over the life of the policies. Rebates, holdbacks, floorplan assistance and certain other dealer credits received from manufacturers are recorded as offsets to the cost of the vehicle and recognized into income upon the sale of the vehicle or when earned under a specific manufacturer program, whichever is later.
Revenue Recognition
      Additionally, significant estimates have been made by us in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements including allowances for doubtful accounts, and for accruals related to self-insurance programs, certain legal proceedings and estimated tax liabilities.

Reported Operating Data
 
     The following table details the net floorplan benefit consisting of floorplan assistance, a component of new vehicle gross profit, and floorplan interest expense.
 
Same Store Operating Data
     We have presented below our operating results on a same store basis to reflect our internal performance. Same store operating results include the results of stores for identical months in both years included in the comparison, starting with the first month of our ownership or operation.
 
New Vehicle
     The following table details the net floorplan benefit consisting of floorplan assistance, a component of new vehicle gross profit, and floorplan interest expense.
     Reported new vehicle performance for 2005 benefited from the impact of acquisitions and divestitures when compared to same store performance.
     Same store new vehicle revenue for 2005 decreased compared to 2004 primarily as a result of a same store unit volume decrease partially offset by an increase in revenue per unit. In June 2005, General Motors announced an "employee pricing for everyone" program, which was followed in July 2005 with similar programs by Ford and Chrysler. Although these programs helped drive unit volume during 2005, a challenging United States auto retail environment and the effects of Hurricane Wilma on our Florida stores negatively impacted same store new vehicle unit volume during the fourth quarter of 2005. Despite higher gas prices, rising interest rates, and a shift in consumer preferences from trucks to crossover vehicles and cars, we expanded revenue per vehicle retailed and gross profit per vehicle retailed through our focus on pricing and profitability and management of our new vehicle inventory levels and a shift in mix from domestics to imports and luxury.
 
     New vehicle revenue for 2004 increased compared to 2003 driven by increases in revenue per unit and unit volume. The increase in average revenue per unit retailed was attributable to increased dealer incentives and a shift in mix to more expensive trucks and luxury vehicles. The increase in unit volume was attributable to the impact of acquisitions in 2004, partially offset by a decrease in same store unit volume consistent with industry trends for our brand and market mix in part due to the four major hurricanes that caused store closings and substantial disruption of our business throughout Florida and the Southeast during the third quarter of 2004. During the fourth quarter of 2004, we saw improvements in these markets driven by post-hurricane demand and a stronger local economy. Gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased during 2004 due to intense competition at the retail level and high average inventory levels during the year.
     At December 31, 2005, our new vehicle inventories were at $2.2 billion or 55 days supply compared to new vehicle inventories of $2.1 billion or 52 days supply at December 31, 2004. In 2006, we anticipate that new vehicle sales in the United States will remain stable (nearly 17 million units) and continue to be highly competitive. However, the level of retail sales for 2006 is very difficult to predict.
     The net inventory carrying benefit (floorplan interest expense net of floorplan assistance from manufacturers) decreased in 2005 compared to 2004, primarily as a result of increased floorplan interest expense due to higher short-term LIBOR interest rates partially offset by lower average new vehicle inventory balances. We expect net floorplan costs to continue to increase in 2006 as we experience increased interest rates.
 
Used Vehicle
     Reported used vehicle performance benefited from the impact of acquisitions and divestitures when compared to same store performance.
     Same store used vehicle revenue for 2005 increased compared to 2004 due to an increase in same store average revenue per vehicle retailed partially offset by a slight decrease in same store unit volume. The increase in same store average revenue per unit is the result of strengthened used vehicle market prices and the availability of quality used vehicles from trade-ins. Consistent with the new vehicle unit volume decline, used vehicle unit volume was impacted by lower same store sales unit volumes resulting from a challenging United States' auto retail environment and the effects of Hurricane Wilma on our Florida stores during the fourth quarter of 2005. Same store gross profit and same store gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased as a result of better inventory management focused on optimizing used vehicle inventory supply, mix and pricing.
     Used vehicle revenue for 2004 increased compared to 2003 as a result of increases in average revenue per unit and volume. The increase in used vehicle unit volume is attributable to the impact of acquisitions in 2004 partially offset by same store unit volume declines in part due to strong manufacturer incentives for new vehicles and the effect of the four major hurricanes on our stores in Florida and the Southeast during the third quarter of 2004. During the fourth quarter of 2004, we saw improvements in these markets driven by post-hurricane demand and a stronger local economy. Gross profit for 2004 compared to 2003 increased due to acquisitions. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue for 2004 increased as a result of an improved inventory mix and a strengthening used vehicle market toward the end of 2004.
     Used vehicle inventories were at $323.9 million or 42 days supply at December 31, 2005 compared to $285.6 million or 37 days in 2004.
 
Parts and Service
     Parts and service revenue is primarily derived from repair orders for service labor and related parts paid directly by customers or via reimbursement from manufacturers and others under warranties.
     Reported parts and service revenue and gross profit benefited from the impact of acquisitions and divestitures when compared to same store performance.
     Despite one and a half less service days in the current year compared to prior year and the business disruption in our Florida stores due to the effects of Hurricane Wilma, same store parts and service revenue for 2005 increased compared to 2004 due to increases in customer-paid and warranty work as well as our parts wholesale business. Same store parts and service gross profit for 2005 increased compared to 2004 due to increases in customer-paid and warranty work. The improvements are attributable in part to our service drive process, maintenance menus and service marketing program, as well as the continued optimization of our pricing models and training programs.
     Parts and service revenue and gross profit increased during 2004 due to increases in customer-paid work for parts and service, attributable to the continued implementation of our service drive process, maintenance menu and service marketing program, as well as optimization of our pricing models and training programs. Parts and service was also impacted by the effect of the four major hurricanes on our stores in Florida and the Southeast during the third quarter of 2004. During the fourth quarter of 2004, we saw improvements in these markets driven by post-hurricane demand and a stronger local economy. Results in 2004 benefited from an additional service day as compared to 2003.
 
Finance and Insurance
     Reported finance and insurance revenue and gross profit benefited from the impact of acquisitions and divestitures when compared to same store performance.
     Same store finance and insurance revenue and gross profit increased slightly in 2005 compared to 2004. The improvement was driven by increased retrospective commissions received on extended service contracts partially offset by decreased new and used vehicle sales, which were caused in part due to the effects of Hurricane Wilma on our Florida stores. Improvements were also driven by our continued emphasis on training store associates. Substantially higher interest rates in the future may negatively impact finance and insurance revenue and gross profit.
     Finance and insurance revenue and gross profit increased for 2004 due to increased vehicle revenue, product penetration and retrospective commissions received on extended warranties. Additionally, our improvement has been driven by our ongoing concentration on our underperforming stores and our transparent sales process that is supported by the "AutoNation Pledge." The "AutoNation Pledge" is our commitment to provide our customers with disclosures relating to the finance and insurance sales process. Finance and insurance revenue and gross profit were also impacted by the effect of the four major hurricanes on our stores in Florida and the Southeast during the third quarter of 2004. During the fourth quarter of 2004, we saw improvements in these markets driven by post-hurricane demand and a stronger local economy.
 
Operating Expenses
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
     During 2005 selling, general and administrative expenses increased $70.8 million or 3.4%. As a percent of total gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 30 basis points in spite of property damage costs related to Hurricane Wilma which impacted our Florida stores during the fourth quarter of 2005. Improvements are due to our continued efforts to leverage our cost structure, particularly in the areas of compensation and other selling, general and administrative expenses, partially offset by increased occupancy costs.
     As a percent of total gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 70 basis points during 2004. Our cost structure was targeted for vehicle sales volumes and gross margins that did not materialize through the third quarter of 2004. During the fourth quarter, our results benefited from increased vehicle sales, as well as cost-control and productivity improvements. Throughout 2004, we continued to leverage our cost structure, especially in the areas of compensation and, to a lesser extent, advertising and occupancy costs. Occupancy costs benefited from lease buy-outs completed in 2004. Additionally, in September 2004, we announced a new streamlined regional structure.
Non-Operating Income (Expense)
Floorplan Interest Expense
     Floorplan interest expense was $107.7 million, $76.5 million and $64.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in 2005 compared to 2004 is primarily the result of higher short-term LIBOR interest rates partially offset by lower average new vehicle inventory levels. The increase in 2004 compared to 2003 is primarily the result of higher average inventory levels and higher interest rates.
Other Interest Expense
     Other interest expense was incurred primarily on borrowings under mortgage facilities and outstanding senior unsecured notes. Other interest expense was $63.3 million, $76.3 million and $71.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Other interest expense also includes interest related to the IRS settlement (as discussed in the "Provision for Income Taxes" section) totaling $4.8 million and $12.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, which represents interest due under the agreement from the date of the settlement. The decrease in 2005 compared to 2004 of other interest expense is primarily due to the repurchase of a portion of our senior unsecured notes. The increase in other interest expense for 2004 compared to 2003, excluding amounts related to the IRS settlement, is primarily due to higher average debt outstanding.
Other Interest Expense  Senior Note Repurchases
     During 2005 and 2004, we repurchased $123.1 million and $3.4 million (face value) of our 9.0% senior unsecured notes at an average price of 110.5% and 114.3% of face value or $136.0 million and $3.9 million, respectively. The $12.9 million and $.5 million premium paid for this repurchase plus related deferred costs of $4.5 million and $.1 million, respectively, were recognized as Other Interest Expense- Senior Note Repurchases in the accompanying 2005 and 2004 Consolidated Income Statements.
Other Income (Expense), Net
     Other income in 2003 primarily relates to the sale of our interest in an equity-method investment in LKQ Corporation, an auto parts recycling business, for $38.3 million, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $16.5 million.
 
Provision for Income Taxes
     The effective income tax rate was 36.5%, 34.7%, and 15.0% for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Income taxes are provided based upon our anticipated underlying annual blended federal and state income tax rates, adjusted, as necessary, for any other tax matters occurring during the period. As we operate in various states, our effective tax rate is also dependent upon our geographic revenue mix. In February 2006, we made estimated state tax and federal tax payments totaling approximately $100 million, primarily related to provisions for the third and fourth quarter of 2005.
     In March 2003, we entered into a settlement agreement with the IRS with respect to the tax treatment of certain transactions we entered into in 1997 and 1999. As a result of the settlement, during 2003, we recognized an income tax benefit of $127.5 million from the reduction of previously recorded deferred tax liabilities. In 2003, we made a $366.0 million prepayment of the initial installment due March 2004, including interest. Additionally, in 2004, we prepaid the remaining balance due related to the IRS settlement totaling $128.9 million, including accrued interest.
     During 2005, 2004 and 2003, we recorded net income tax benefits in our provision for income taxes of $14.5 million, $25.8 million and $140.9 million (which includes $127.5 million recognized as a result of the IRS settlement discussed above), respectively, primarily related to the resolution of various income tax matters. In 2005 and 2004, we also recognized gains totaling $110.0 million and $52.2 million, respectively, included in Discontinued Operations related to the settlement of various income tax matters.
     A federal income tax audit for 2002 through 2004 is being conducted by the IRS. In addition, we are routinely audited by the states in which we do business and remain under examination by various states. We could experience additional state and federal tax adjustments in the future as we continue to work through various tax matters. Once we resolve our open tax matters, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 39.5%.
     See Note 12, Income Taxes, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
Financial Condition
     At December 31, 2005, we had $245.2 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents. Through July 14, 2005, we had two revolving credit facilities with an aggregate borrowing capacity of $500.0 million. There were no borrowings on these revolving credit facilities during 2005 and 2004. On July 14, 2005, we terminated these credit facilities and entered into a new five-year revolving credit facility with an aggregate borrowing capacity of $600.0 million with investment-grade terms, including lower credit spreads compared to the facilities it replaced. The facility is guaranteed by substantially all of our subsidiaries. We have negotiated a letter of credit sub-limit as part of our revolving credit facility. The amount available to be borrowed under the $600.0 million multi-year revolving credit facility is reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the cumulative amount of any outstanding letters of credit, which totaled $87.6 million at December 31, 2005.
     In the ordinary course of business, we are required to post performance and surety bonds, letters of credit, and/or cash deposits as financial guarantees of our performance. At December 31, 2005, surety bonds, letters of credit and cash deposits totaled $120.3 million, including $87.6 million in letters of credit. We are not required to provide cash collateral for outstanding letters of credit.
     We also have $321.7 million of outstanding 9.0% senior unsecured notes due August 1, 2008. During 2005, we repurchased $123.1 million (face value) of senior unsecured notes at an average price of 110.5% of face value or $136.0 million. For 2005, the premium paid for this repurchase was $12.9 million plus related deferred financing costs of $4.5 million, which was recognized as Other Interest Expense in the accompanying 2005 Consolidated Income Statement. Through December 31, 2005, cumulative repurchases of senior unsecured notes, which began during the fourth quarter of 2004, totaled $126.5 million (face value). The senior unsecured notes are guaranteed by substantially all of our subsidiaries.
     Our senior unsecured notes, revolving credit facility and mortgage facility contain numerous customary financial and operating covenants that place significant restrictions on us, including our ability to incur additional indebtedness or repay existing indebtedness, to create liens or other encumbrances, to sell (or otherwise dispose of) assets and merge or consolidate with other entities. The indenture for our senior unsecured notes places significant restrictions on our ability to make certain payments (including dividends and share repurchases) and investments. The revolving credit facility also requires that we meet certain financial ratios including financial covenants requiring the maintenance of a maximum consolidated cash flow leverage ratio and a maximum capitalization ratio. In addition, the senior unsecured notes contain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio covenant, and the mortgage facility contains both maximum cash flow leverage ratio and minimum interest coverage ratio covenants. In the event that we were to default in the observance or performance of any of the financial covenants in the revolving credit facility or mortgage facilities and such
 
default were to continue beyond any cure period or waiver, the lender under the respective facility could elect to terminate the facility and declare all outstanding obligations under such facility immediately payable. Under the senior unsecured notes, should we be in violation of the financial covenants, we could be limited in incurring certain additional indebtedness. Our revolving credit facility, the indenture for our senior unsecured notes, vehicle floorplan payable facilities and mortgage facilities have cross-default provisions that trigger a default in the event of an uncured default under other material indebtedness. At December 31, 2005, we were in compliance with the requirements of all such financial covenants. The credit spread for the revolving credit facility is impacted by our senior unsecured credit ratings.
     During 2005, we repaid $164.4 million of the outstanding balance under mortgage facilities with certain automotive manufacturers' captive finance subsidiaries, which includes prepayments totaling $154.0 million. At December 31, 2005, we had $153.7 million outstanding under a mortgage facility. The facility bears interest at LIBOR-based interest rates (5.2% and 3.5% weighted average for 2005 and 2004, respectively) and is secured by mortgages on certain of our stores properties.
     At December 31, 2005 and 2004, vehicle floorplan payable-trade totaled $2.4 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively. Vehicle floorplan payable-trade reflects amounts borrowed to finance the purchase of specific vehicle inventories with manufacturers' captive finance subsidiaries. Vehicle floorplan payable-non-trade totaled $102.9 million and $79.0 million, at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and represents amounts payable borrowed to finance the purchase of specific vehicle inventories with non-trade lenders. All the Company's floorplan facilities are at LIBOR-based rates of interest (4.8% and 3.0% weighted average for 2005 and 2004, respectively). Secured floorplan facilities are used to finance new vehicle inventories and the amounts outstanding thereunder are due on demand, but are generally paid within several business days after the related vehicles are sold. Floorplan facilities are primarily collateralized by new vehicle inventories and related receivables. Our manufacturer agreements generally require that the manufacturer have the ability to draft against the floorplan facilities so that the lender directly funds the manufacturer for the purchase of inventory. The floorplan facilities contain certain financial and operational covenants. At December 31, 2005, we were in compliance with such covenants in all material respects. At December 31, 2005, aggregate capacity under the floorplan credit facilities to finance new vehicles was approximately $3.9 billion, of which $2.5 billion total was outstanding.
     We sell and receive commissions on the following types of vehicle protection and other products: extended warranties, guaranteed auto protection, credit insurance, lease "wear and tear" insurance and theft protection products. The products we offer include products that are sold and administered by independent third parties, including the vehicle manufacturers' captive finance subsidiaries. Pursuant to our arrangements with these third-party finance and vehicle protection product providers, we primarily sell the products on a straight commission basis; however, we may sell the product, recognize commission and participate in future profit pursuant to retrospective commission arrangements. Through 2002, we assumed some of the underwriting risk through reinsurance agreements with our captive insurance subsidiaries. Since January 1, 2003, we have not reinsured any new extended warranties or credit insurance products. We maintain restricted cash in trust accounts in accordance with the terms and conditions of certain reinsurance agreements to secure the payments of outstanding losses and loss adjustment expenses related to our captive insurance subsidiaries.
     During 2005, we repurchased 11.8 million shares of our common stock in the open market for an aggregate purchase price of $237.1 million leaving $71.3 million authorized for share repurchases. Repurchases are made pursuant to Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Future share repurchases are also subject to limitations contained in the indenture relating to our senior unsecured notes.
     On June 30, 2000, we completed the tax-free spin-off of ANC Rental Corporation ("ANC Rental"), which operated our former rental business. In connection with the spin-off, we agreed to provide certain guarantees on behalf of ANC Rental. In 2001, ANC Rental filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. In 2003, the bankruptcy court approved a settlement agreement among AutoNation, ANC Rental and the Committee of Unsecured Creditors in the bankruptcy.
     Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, we continued to guarantee $29.5 million, and committed to guarantee up to an additional $10.5 million, in surety bonds supporting obligations of the Rental Business until December 2006. In 2004, we were released from our $29.5 million guarantee obligation and our remaining $10.5 million surety bond guarantee obligations. This triggered an obligation under the Settlement Agreement for us to pay $20 million (one-half of the permanent reduction of the surety bond guarantee obligations) to a trust established for the benefit of the unsecured creditors in the bankruptcy, which payment was made in 2004. We had previously incurred a pre-tax charge of $20.0 million ($12.3 million after-tax) for this liability included in Loss from Discontinued Operations in the accompanying Consolidated Income Statements during 2003.
 
     As a matter of course, we are regularly audited by various tax authorities. From time to time, these audits result in proposed assessments. Other tax accruals totaled $54.5 million and $181.3 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and relate to various tax matters where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional tax payments. We believe that our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately provided for these matters. We completed the federal income tax audit for the years 1997 through 2001 and a federal income tax audit for 2002 through 2004 is being conducted by the IRS. We remain under examination by various states. We could experience additional state and federal tax adjustments in the future as we continue to work through various tax matters. Once we resolve our open tax matters, we expect our base effective tax rate to be approximately 39.5%. See Note 12, Income Taxes, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of income taxes.
Cash Flows
     Cash and cash equivalents increased (decreased) by $135.7 million, $(67.6) million and $(6.7) million during the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The major components of these changes are discussed below. We have revised our 2004 and 2003 Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows to separately disclose the operating, investing and financing cash flows attributable to our discontinued operations. We had previously reported these amounts on a combined basis.
     We have restated certain amounts in the 2004 and 2003 Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows from operating activities to financing activities to comply with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") 95, "Statement of Cash Flows," as a result of recent comments to us from the Securities and Exchange Commission. For the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, $(144.1) million (consisting of $(142.6) million in continuing operations and $(1.5) million in discontinued operations) and $(121.2) million (consisting of $(117.5) million in continuing operations and $(3.7) million in discontinued operations), respectively, which were previously reported as operating activities are reported as a component of financing activities to reflect the net cash flow uses for floorplan facilities with lenders other than the automotive manufacturers' captive finance subsidiaries for that franchise ("non-trade lenders"). This change had the effect of increasing net cash from operating activities within the related offset in net cash from financing activities.
Cash Flows from Operating Activities
     Cash provided by operating activities was $580.0 million, $562.9 million and $482.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
     Cash flows from operating activities include net income adjusted for non-cash items and the effects of changes in working capital including changes in vehicle floorplan payable-trade (vehicle floorplan payables with the automotive manufacturers' captive finance subsidiary for the related franchise), which directly relates to changes in new vehicle inventory for those franchises. Additionally, we paid portions of the IRS settlement totaling $128.9 million and $366.0 million during 2004 and 2003, respectively, representing the entire balance of the amount due under the settlement.
     In December 2001, we decided to exit the business of underwriting retail automobile loans for customers at our stores, which we determined was not a part of our core automotive retail business. In July 2003, we sold all of our finance receivables portfolio for proceeds totaling $52.4 million, resulting in no gain or loss on the transaction. Collections of installment loans receivable and other items related to the wind-down of this business totaled $27.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2003.
     Cash provided by (used in) discontinued operations was $(4.0) million, $(22.4) million and $1.7 million during 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. A portion of the cash used in 2005 and 2004 and all of the cash used in 2003 relates to payments made in conjunction with property leases assumed from ANC Rental.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities
     Cash flows from investing activities consist primarily of cash used in capital additions, activity from business acquisitions, property dispositions, purchases and sales of investments and other transactions as further described below.
     Capital expenditures, excluding property operating lease buy-outs, were $131.2 million, $132.6 million and $122.0 million during the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. We will make facility and infrastructure upgrades and improvements from time to time as we identify projects that are required to maintain our current business or that we expect to provide us with acceptable rates of return. We expect 2006 capital expenditures of approximately $130 million, excluding any acquisition-related spending or lease buy-outs.
     Property operating lease buy-outs were $10.3 million, $77.7 million and $9.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. We continue to analyze certain of our higher cost operating leases and evaluate alternatives in order to lower the effective financing costs.
 
     Proceeds from the disposal of assets held for sale were $33.4 million, $37.9 million and $23.1 million during the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. These amounts are primarily from the sales of megastores and other properties held for sale.
     Cash used in business acquisitions, net of cash acquired, was $15.9 million, $197.9 million and $48.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. During 2005, we acquired two automotive retail franchises and other related assets. Cash used in business acquisitions during 2005, 2004 and 2003 includes $9.9 million, $3.3 million and $3.2 million in deferred purchase price for certain prior year automotive retail acquisitions. See discussion in Note 16, Acquisitions, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
     During 2003, we sold all of our interest in an equity-method investment in LKQ Corporation, an auto parts recycling business, for $38.3 million, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $16.5 million.
Cash Flows from Financing Activities
     Cash flows from financing activities primarily include treasury stock purchases, stock option exercises, debt activity and changes in vehicle floorplan payable-non-trade.
     We have repurchased approximately 11.8 million, 14.1 million and 39.2 million shares of our common stock during the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, for an aggregate price of $237.1 million, $236.8 million, and $575.2 million, respectively, under our Board-approved share repurchase programs.
     During 2005, we repaid $164.4 million of amounts outstanding under our mortgage facilities, including prepayments totaling $154.0 million. During the year ended December 31, 2003, we drew amounts totaling $183.6 million under our mortgage facilities.
     Cash flows from financing activities include changes in vehicle floorplan payable-non-trade (vehicle floorplan payables with lenders other than the automotive manufacturers' captive finance subsidiaries for that franchise) totaling $23.9 million, $(142.6) million and $(117.5) million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
     During the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, proceeds from the exercises of stock options were $112.8 million, $94.2 million and $118.1 million, respectively.
     During 2005 and 2004, we repurchased $123.1 million and $3.4 million (face value) of our 9.0% senior unsecured notes at an average price of 110.5% and 114.3% of face value or $136.0 million and $3.9 million, respectively.
     Other cash used in financing activities totaled $7.8 million in 2003 and primarily includes upfront premium amounts paid in conjunction with interest rate hedge transactions.
Liquidity
     In July 2005, we terminated our existing credit facilities with aggregate borrowing capacity of $500.0 million, and entered into a new five-year revolving credit facility with an aggregate borrowing capacity of $600.0 million. We believe that our funds generated through future operations and availability of borrowings under our secured floorplan facilities (for new vehicles) and revolving credit facility will be sufficient to service our debt and fund our working capital requirements, pay our tax obligations, commitments and contingencies and meet any seasonal operating requirements for the foreseeable future. We do not foresee any difficulty in continuing to comply with covenants of our various financing facilities. At December 31, 2005, we have available capacity under our revolving credit facility and available cash totaling approximately $750 million, net of outstanding letters of credit.
     We have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock during our three most recent fiscal years. We do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The indenture for our senior unsecured notes restricts our ability to declare cash dividends.
 
Contractual Payment Obligations
     The following table summarizes our payment obligations under certain contracts at December 31, 2005 (in millions):
 
     In the ordinary course of business, we are required to post performance and surety bonds, letters of credit, and/or cash deposits as financial guarantees of our performance. At December 31, 2005, surety bonds, letters of credit and cash deposits totaled $120.3 million, including $87.6 million letters of credit. We do not currently provide cash collateral for outstanding letters of credit. We have negotiated a letter of credit sub-limit as part of our revolving credit facility. The amount available to be borrowed under this revolving credit facility is reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the cumulative amount of any outstanding letters of credit.
     As further discussed under the heading "Financial Condition," there are various tax matters where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional tax payments.
     In March 2006, we acquired a Mercedes-Benz dealership in Pompano Beach, Florida. We also signed a separate agreement in January 2006 to acquire certain rights to establish a new Mercedes-Benz dealership in Palm Beach County, Florida.
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
     We have no off balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2005 and 2004.
Seasonality
     Our operations generally experience higher volumes of vehicle sales and service in the second and third quarters of each year due in part to consumer buying trends and the introduction of new vehicle models. Also, demand for vehicles and light trucks is generally lower during the winter months than in other seasons, particularly in regions of the United States where stores may be subject to adverse winter conditions. Accordingly, we expect our revenue and operating results to be generally lower in our first and fourth quarters as compared to our second and third quarters. However, revenue may be impacted significantly from quarter to quarter by actual or threatened severe weather events, and by other factors unrelated to weather conditions, such as changing economic conditions and automotive manufacturer incentives programs.
 
New Accounting Pronouncements
     In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS 123R, "Share-Based Payment," a revision of SFAS 123. In March 2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 (SAB 107) regarding its interpretation of SFAS 123R. The standard requires companies to expense the grant-date fair value of stock options and other equity-based compensation issued to employees. In accordance with the revised statement, we will begin to recognize the expense attributable to stock options granted or vested subsequent to December 31, 2005 using the modified prospective method in the first quarter of 2006. We will continue using the Black-Scholes valuation model and straight-line amortization of compensation expense over the requisite service period of the grant. Based on an estimate of unvested stock options that have been issued through December 31, 2005, and potential future option grants consistent with levels in 2005, we expect compensation expense during 2006 related to stock-based awards consistent with the pro forma disclosures under SFAS 123 for 2005.
     In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 151, "Inventory Costs". SFAS 151 requires abnormal amounts of inventory costs related to idle facility, freight, handling and wasted materials to be recognized as current period expenses. SFAS 151 is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005 and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
     In March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation ("FIN") No. 47, "Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligationsan Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143." This Interpretation clarifies the timing of liability recognition for legal obligations associated with an asset retirement when the timing and (or) method of settling obligations are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. FIN 47 is effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005. The adoption of FIN 47 did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.
     In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, "Accounting Changes and Error Corrections" which replaces Accounting Principles Board Opinion ("PB") No. 20, "Accounting Changes," and SFAS No. 3, "Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements-An Amendment of APB Opinion No. 28." SFAS 154 provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections. SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and a correction of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005 and is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
     In September 2005, the Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") reached a consensus on issue EITF 05-06, "Determining the Amortization Period for Leasehold Improvements Purchased after Lease Inception or Acquired in a Business Combination." EITF 05-06 requires that leasehold improvements that are placed in service significantly after and not contemplated at or near the beginning of the lease term or that are acquired in a business combination should be amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the assets or a term that includes the required lease periods and renewals that are deemed to be reasonably assured as of the date the leasehold improvements are purchased or the date of acquisition, as applicable. EITF 05-06 is effective the first reporting period beginning after June 29, 2005. The adoption of EITF 05-06 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
     In October 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position ("FSP") No. FAS 13-1, "Accounting for Rental Costs Incurred during a Construction Period." FSP No. FAS 13-1 requires rental costs associated with operating leases that are incurred during a construction period to be recognized as rental expense. FSP No. FAS 13-1 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2005 and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
Forward Looking Statements
     Our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects, and the prevailing market price and performance of our common stock, may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including the matters discussed below.

INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
The Board of Directors and Shareholders AutoNation, Inc.:
     We have audited the 2005, 2004 and 2003 consolidated financial statements of AutoNation, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as listed in the Index at Item 8. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
     We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
     In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2005 and 2004 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2005, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
     We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated March 2, 2006, expressed an unqualified opinion on management's assessment of, and the effective operation of, internal control over financial reporting.
Internal Control  Integrated Framework

1. 2006 DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
     During the six months ended June 30, 2006, the Company approved the disposal of ten automotive retail franchises, either through sale or termination. In accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets", the results of operations of these franchises were removed from continuing operations and were treated as discontinued operations for financial statement reporting purposes in its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2006 and June 30, 2006. The accompanying consolidated balance sheets, income statements and statements of cash flows, as well as Notes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 12, 14, 16 and 21 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the reclassification of these automotive retail franchises from continuing operations to discontinued operations. The impact of the reclassification to total revenue was a decrease of $281.2 million, $360.4 million and $387.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The impact of the reclassification to net income from continuing operations was an increase/(decrease) of $2.7 million, $(.3) million and $ (2.5) million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase/(decrease) by balance sheet account was as follows:
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Organization and Business
     AutoNation, Inc. (the "Company"), through its subsidiaries, is the largest automotive retailer in the United States. As of December 31, 2005, the Company owned and operated 346 new vehicle franchises from 269 stores located in major metropolitan markets in 17 states, predominantly in the Sunbelt region of the United States. The Company offers a diversified range of automotive products and services, including new vehicles, used vehicles, vehicle maintenance and repair services, vehicle parts, extended service contracts, vehicle protection products and other aftermarket products. The Company also arranges financing for vehicle purchases through third-party finance sources.
Basis of Presentation
     The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of AutoNation, Inc. and its subsidiaries. All of the Company's automotive dealership subsidiaries are indirectly wholly owned by the parent company, AutoNation, Inc. The Company operates in a single industry segment, automotive retailing. The Company sells new and used vehicles, vehicle maintenance and repair services, vehicle parts, and financing and insurance products. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates made by the Company in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include allowances for doubtful accounts, accruals for chargebacks against revenue recognized from the sale of finance and insurance products, certain assumptions related to intangible and long-lived assets, and for accruals related to self-insurance programs, certain legal proceedings and estimated tax liabilities.
 
     Certain reclassifications of amounts previously reported have been made to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements in order to maintain consistency and comparability between periods presented.
Restatement and Revision
     The Company has restated certain amounts in the 2004 and 2003 Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows from operating activities to financing activities to comply with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") 95, "Statement of Cash Flows," as a result of recent comments to the Company from the Securities and Exchange Commission. Amounts that were previously reported as operating activities have been restated as a component of financing activities to reflect the net cash flow uses for floorplan facilities with lenders other than the automotive manufacturers' captive finance subsidiaries for that franchise ("non-trade lenders"). This change had the effect of increasing net cash from operating activities with the related offset in net cash from financing activities.
     Additionally, the Company has revised its 2004 and 2003 Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as a result of recent guidance given by the Securities and Exchange Commission to separately disclose the operating, investing and financing cash flows attributable to the Company's discontinued operations. The Company had previously reported these amounts on a combined basis.
 
     A summary of the effects of the restatement and revision is as follows:
     * Includes $2.3 million and $23.7 million of discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
     In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, "Accounting Changes and Error Corrections" which replaces Accounting Principles Board Opinion ("APB") No. 20, "Accounting Changes," and SFAS No. 3, "Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements-An Amendment of APB Opinion No. 28." SFAS 154 provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections. SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and a correction of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005 and is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change
     As of January 1, 2003, the Company adopted Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue No. 02-16, "Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor." EITF 02-16, as it applies to the Company, addresses the recognition of certain manufacturer allowances and requires that manufacturer allowances be treated as a reduction of inventory cost unless specifically identified as reimbursement for services or costs incurred. The adoption of EITF 02-16 resulted in a cumulative effect of accounting change, net of $9.1 million of income tax, totaling $14.6 million to reflect the deferral of certain allowances, primarily floorplan assistance, into inventory cost in 2003. Additionally, the adoption of EITF 02-16 impacted the accounting for certain manufacturers' advertising allowances resulting in a reclassification that increased Selling, General and Administrative Expenses and, correspondingly, reduced Cost of Sales by $18.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 to reflect these allowances as a reduction of Cost of Sales.
 
Inventory
     Inventory consists primarily of new and used vehicles held for sale valued using the specific identification method. Cost includes acquisition, reconditioning, dealer installed accessories and transportation expenses. Parts and accessories are valued at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market.
     In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 151, "Inventory Costs". SFAS 151 requires abnormal amounts of inventory costs related to idle facility, freight, handling and wasted materials to be recognized as current period expenses. SFAS 151 is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005 and is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
Investments
     Investments, included in Other Assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, consist of marketable securities. Restricted investments, included in Other Assets, consist primarily of marketable corporate and government debt securities. Marketable securities include investments in debt and equity securities and are primarily classified as available for sale and are stated at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. Other-than-temporary declines in investment values are recorded as a component of Other Income (Expense), Net in the Company's Consolidated Income Statements. Fair value is estimated based on quoted market prices.
Property and Equipment, net
     Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Expenditures for major additions and improvements are capitalized, while minor replacements, maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. When property is retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in Other Losses (Gains), Net in the Consolidated Income Statements.
     Depreciation is provided over the estimated useful lives of the assets involved using the straight-line method. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the estimated useful life of the asset or the respective lease term, whichever is shorter. The estimated useful lives are: fifteen to forty years for buildings and improvements, three to ten years for equipment and seven to ten years for furniture and fixtures.
     The Company continually evaluates property and equipment, including leasehold improvements, to determine whether events and circumstances have occurred that may warrant revision of the estimated useful life or whether the remaining balance should be evaluated for possible impairment. The Company uses an estimate of the related undiscounted cash flows over the remaining life of the property and equipment in assessing whether an asset has been impaired. The Company measures impairment losses based upon the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value. Fair values generally are estimated using prices for similar assets and/or discounted cash flows.
     In March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation ("FIN") No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligationan Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143." This interpretation clarifies the timing of liability recognition for legal obligations association with an asset retirement when the timing and (or) method of settling the obligation are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. FIN 47 is effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005. The adoption of FIN 47 did not have an impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
Intangible Assets, net
     The Company accounts for acquisitions using the purchase method. Additionally, acquired intangible assets are separately recognized if the benefit of the intangible asset is obtained through contractual or other legal rights, or if the intangible asset can be sold, transferred, licensed, rented, or exchanged, regardless of the Company's intent to do so. Other intangibles with definite lives are amortized primarily over three to sixteen years using a straight-line method.
     The Company's principal identifiable intangible assets are rights under franchise agreements with vehicle manufacturers. The Company generally expects its franchise agreements to survive for the foreseeable future and, when the agreements do not have indefinite terms, anticipates routine renewals of the agreements without substantial cost. The contractual terms of the Company's franchise agreements provide for various durations, ranging from one year to no expiration date, and in certain cases manufacturers have undertaken to renew such franchises upon expiration so long as the dealership is in compliance with the terms of the agreement. However, in general, the states in which the Company operates have automotive dealership franchise laws that provide that, notwithstanding the terms of any franchise agreement, it is unlawful for a manufacturer to terminate or not renew a franchise unless "good cause" exists. It is generally difficult for a manufacturer to terminate, or not renew, a franchise under these franchise laws, which were designed to
 
protect dealers. In addition, in the Company's experience and historically in the automotive retail industry, dealership franchise agreements are rarely involuntarily terminated or not renewed by the manufacturer. Accordingly, the Company believes that its franchise agreements will contribute to cash flows for the foreseeable future and have indefinite lives.
     The Company has completed impairment tests as of June 30, 2005 and 2004 for goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives. The goodwill test includes determining the fair value of the Company's single reporting unit and comparing it to the carrying value of the net assets allocated to the reporting unit. The test for intangibles with indefinite lives requires the comparisons of estimated fair value to its carrying value by store. No impairment charges resulted from the required impairment tests. Goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives will be tested for impairment annually at June 30 or more frequently when events or circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred.
Other Assets
     Other assets consist of various items, net of applicable amortization, including, among other items, service loaner and rental vehicle inventory, net, which is not available for sale, property held for sale, notes receivable, restricted assets and debt issuance costs. Debt issuance costs are amortized to Other Interest Expense using the effective interest method through maturity.
     At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company had $22.0 million and $31.1 million, respectively, of property held for sale.
     In 2003, the Company recognized a $27.5 million real estate impairment charge to write-down to fair value three underperforming franchised new vehicle stores. Of the charge, $10.4 million was included in Other Losses related to a store currently operating in a converted used vehicle megastore. The remainder of the charge, $17.1 million (or $10.5 million, net of taxes), was included in Loss from Discontinued Operations in the 2003 Consolidated Income Statement related to two stores that operated in converted used vehicle megastores which have been since closed.
Other Current Liabilities
     Other Current Liabilities consist of various items payable within one year including, among other items, accruals for payroll and benefits, sales taxes, finance and insurance chargeback liabilities, deferred revenue, accrued expenses, and customer deposits. Other Current Liabilities also includes other tax accruals, totaling $54.5 million and $181.3 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. See Note 12, Income Taxes, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of income taxes.
 
Stock Options
     The Company applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" in accounting for stock-based employee compensation arrangements whereby compensation cost related to stock options is generally not recognized in determining net income. Had compensation cost for the Company's stock option plans been determined pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation," the Company's net income and earnings per share would have decreased accordingly. Using the Black-Scholes option pricing model for all options granted, the Company's pro forma net income, pro forma earnings per share and pro forma weighted average fair value of options granted, with related assumptions, are as follows for the years ended December 31:
     In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued            SFAS 123R, "Share-Based Payment," a revision of SFAS 123. In March 2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 (SAB 107) regarding its interpretation of SFAS 123R. The standard requires companies to expense the grant-date fair value of stock options and other equity-based compensation issued to employees. In accordance with the revised statement and related guidance, the Company will begin to recognize the expense attributable to stock options granted or vested subsequent to December 31, 2005 using the modified prospective method in the first quarter of 2006. The Company will continue using the Black-Scholes valuation model and straight-line amortization of compensation expense over the requisite service period of the grant. The Company expects compensation expense during 2006 related to stock based awards consistent with the pro forma disclosures under SFAS 123 above for 2005.
Derivative Financial Instruments
     The Company's primary market risk exposure is increasing interest rates. Interest rate derivatives are used to hedge a portion of the Company's variable rate debt when appropriate based on market conditions.
     The Company recognizes all derivative instruments on the balance sheet at fair value. The related gains or losses on these transactions are deferred in stockholders' equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). These deferred gains and losses are recognized in income or expense in the period in which the related items being hedged are recognized in expense. However, to the extent that the change in value of a derivative contract does not perfectly offset the change in the value of the items being hedged, that ineffective portion is immediately recognized in income. The Company recognizes gains or losses when the underlying transaction settles. All of the Company's interest rate hedges are designated as cash flow hedges. The Company has a series of interest rate hedge transactions, with a notional value of $800.0 million, consisting of a combination of swaps, and cap and floor options (collars). The hedge instruments are designed to convert certain floating rate vehicle floorplan payable and portions of the Company's mortgage facility to fixed rate debt. The Company has $200 million in swaps, which started in 2004 and effectively lock in a rate of 3.0%, and $600 million in collars that cap floating rates to a maximum LIBOR-based rate no greater than 2.4%. All of its hedge instruments mature between February 2006 and July 2006. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, net unrealized losses, net of income taxes, related to hedges included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) were $2.1 million and $(1.5) million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, the income statement impact from interest rate hedges
 
was an additional income (expense) of $.2 million, $(2.9) million, and $(.6) million, respectively. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, all of the Company's derivative contracts were determined to be highly effective, and no ineffective portion was recognized in income.
Revenue Recognition
     Revenue consists of sales of new and used vehicles and related finance and insurance ("F&I") products, sales of parts and services and sales of other products. As further described below, the Company recognizes revenue in the period in which products are sold or services are provided. The Company recognizes vehicle and finance and insurance revenue when a sales contract has been executed, the vehicle has been delivered and payment has been received or financing has been arranged. Revenue on finance and insurance products represents commissions earned by the Company for: (i) loans and leases placed with financial institutions in connection with customer vehicle purchases financed and (ii) vehicle protection products sold. Rebates, holdbacks, floorplan assistance and certain other dealer credits received directly from manufacturers are recorded as a reduction of the cost of the vehicle and recognized into income upon the sale of the vehicle or when earned under a specific manufacturer program, whichever is later.
     The Company sells and receives a commission, which is recognized upon sale, on the following types of insurance products: extended warranties, guaranteed auto protection ("GAP," which covers the shortfall between loan balance and insurance payoff), credit insurance, lease "wear and tear" insurance and theft protection products. The Company may also participate in future profit, pursuant to retrospective commission arrangements, that would be recognized over the life of the policies. Certain commissions earned from the sales of insurance products are subject to chargebacks should the contracts be terminated prior to their expirations. An estimated liability for chargebacks against revenue recognized from sales of F&I products is recorded in the period in which the related revenue is recognized. Chargeback liabilities were $67.7 million and $65.8 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
     Through 2002, the Company reinsured through its captive insurance subsidiaries a portion of the underwriting risk related to extended warranty and credit insurance products sold and administered by certain independent third parties. Revenue and related direct costs from these reinsurance transactions were deferred and recognized over the life of the policies. Since January 1, 2003, the Company has not reinsured any new extended warranty or credit insurance products.
     For installment loans and leases that in the past had been underwritten by the Company and not securitized, revenue from retail financing and certain loan underwriting costs were recognized over the term of the contract using the interest method. As of December 2001, the Company had exited the auto loan and lease underwriting business, and in July 2003, sold all of its finance receivables portfolio.
Advertising
     The Company expenses the cost of advertising as incurred or when such advertising initially takes place, net of earned manufacturer credits and other discounts. Manufacturer advertising credits are earned in accordance with the respective manufacturers' program, which is typically after the Company has incurred the corresponding advertising expenses. Advertising expense, net of allowances was $209.4 million, $205.5 million and $200.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Advertising allowances from manufacturers were $44.7 million, $49.5 million and $51.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Income Taxes
     The Company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return. Deferred income taxes have been provided to show the effect of temporary differences between the recognition of revenue and expenses for financial and income tax reporting purposes and between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements.
Earnings (Loss) Per Share
     Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is based on the combined weighted average number of common shares and common share equivalents outstanding which include, where appropriate, the assumed exercise or conversion of options. In computing diluted earnings (loss) per share, the Company has utilized the treasury stock method.
 
3. RECEIVABLES, NET
     The components of receivables, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, at December 31 are as follows:
     Contracts-in-transit and vehicle receivables represent receivables from financial institutions for the portion of the vehicle sales price financed by the Company's customers.
4. INVENTORY AND VEHICLE FLOORPLAN PAYABLE
     The components of inventory at December 31 are as follows:
     At December 31, 2005 and 2004, vehicle floorplan payable-trade totaled $2.4 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively. Vehicle floorplan payable-trade reflects amounts borrowed to finance the purchase of specific vehicle inventories with manufacturers' captive finance subsidiaries. Vehicle floorplan payable-non-trade totaled $102.9 million and $79.0 million, at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and represents amounts borrowed to finance the purchase of specific vehicle inventories with non-trade lenders. Changes in vehicle floorplan payable-trade are reported as operating cash flows and changes in vehicle floorplan-non-trade are reported as financing cash flows in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
     All the Company's floorplan facilities are at LIBOR-based rates of interest (4.8% and 3.0% weighted average for 2005 and 2004, respectively). Secured floorplan facilities are used to finance new vehicle inventories and the amounts outstanding thereunder are due on demand, but are generally paid within several business days after the related vehicles are sold. Floorplan facilities are primarily collateralized by new vehicle inventories and related receivables. The Company's manufacturer agreements generally require that the manufacturer have the ability to draft against the floorplan facilities so that the lender directly funds the manufacturer for the purchase of inventory. The floorplan facilities contain certain financial and operational covenants. At December 31, 2005, the Company was in compliance with such covenants in all material respects. At December 31, 2005, aggregate capacity under the floorplan credit facilities to finance new vehicles was approximately $3.9 billion, of which $2.5 billion total was outstanding.
5. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, NET
     A summary of property and equipment, net, at December 31 is as follows:
 
6. INTANGIBLE ASSETS, NET
     Intangible assets, net, at December 31 consist of the following:
     Goodwill and franchise rights-indefinite-lived are not amortized. Goodwill was amortized until January 1, 2002 when the Company adopted provisions of SFAS 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." Other intangibles with definite lives are amortized primarily over three to sixteen years using a straight-line method.
7. INSURANCE
     Under self-insurance programs, the Company retains various levels of aggregate loss limits, per claim deductibles and claims handling expenses as part of its various insurance programs, including property and casualty and employee medical benefits. Costs in excess of this retained risk per claim may be insured under various contracts with third party insurance carriers. The ultimate costs of these retained insurance risks are estimated by management and by actuarial evaluation based on historical claims experience, adjusted for current trends and changes in claims-handling procedures.
     At December 31, 2005 and 2004 current insurance accruals were included in Other Current Liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and long-term insurance accruals were included in Other Liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as follows:
 
8. NOTES PAYABLE AND LONG-TERM DEBT
     Notes payable and long-term debt at December 31 are as follows:
     The Company has 9.0% senior unsecured notes outstanding due August 1, 2008. During 2005 and 2004, the Company repurchased $123.1 million and $3.4 million (face value) of senior unsecured notes at an average price of 110.5% and 114.3% of face value or $136.0 million and $3.9 million, respectively. The $12.9 million and the $.5 million in premium the Company paid for this repurchase plus related deferred costs of $4.5 million and $.1 million, respectively, were recognized as Other Interest Expense in the accompanying 2005 and 2004 Consolidated Income Statements. The senior unsecured notes are guaranteed by substantially all of the Company's subsidiaries.
     Through July 14, 2005, the Company had two revolving credit facilities with an aggregate borrowing capacity of $500.0 million. A 364-day revolving credit facility, which was scheduled to expire in August 2005, provided borrowing capacity up to $200.0 million at LIBOR-plus 125 basis points. A five-year facility, which was scheduled to expire in August 2006, provided borrowing capacity up to $300.0 million at LIBOR plus 225 basis points. There were no borrowings on these revolving credit facilities during 2005 and 2004. On July 14, 2005, the Company terminated the credit facilities and entered into a new five-year revolving credit facility with an aggregate borrowing capacity of $600.0 million presently at a rate of interest of LIBOR plus 75 basis points. The credit spread charged for the revolving credit facility is impacted by the Company's senior unsecured credit ratings. The facility is guaranteed by substantially all of the Company's subsidiaries. The Company has negotiated a letter of credit sublimit as part of its revolving credit facility. The amount available to be borrowed under the revolving credit facility is reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the cumulative amount of any outstanding letters of credit, which totaled $87.6 million at December 31, 2005.
     During 2005, the Company repaid $164.4 million of the outstanding balance under mortgage facilities with certain automotive manufacturers' captive finance subsidiaries, which includes prepayments totaling $154.0 million. At December 31, 2005, the Company had $153.7 million outstanding under a mortgage facility with various maturities through 2008. The facility bears interest at LIBOR-based interest rates (5.2% and 3.5% weighted average for 2005 and 2004, respectively) and is secured by mortgages on certain of the Company's store properties.
     The Company's senior unsecured notes, revolving credit facility and mortgage facility contain numerous customary financial and operating covenants that place significant restrictions on the Company, including the Company's ability to incur additional indebtedness or repay existing indebtedness, to create liens or other encumbrances, to sell (or otherwise dispose of) assets and merge or consolidate with other entities. The indenture for the Company's senior unsecured notes places significant restrictions on the Company's ability to make certain payments (including dividends and share repurchases) and investments. The revolving credit facility also requires the Company to meet certain financial ratios including financial covenants requiring the maintenance of a maximum consolidated cash flow leverage ratio and a maximum capitalization ratio. In addition, the senior unsecured notes contain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio covenant, and the mortgage facility contains both maximum cash flow leverage ratio and minimum interest coverage ratio covenants. In the event that the Company were to default in the observance or performance of any of the financial covenants in the revolving credit facility or mortgage facilities and such default were to continue beyond any cure period or waiver, the lender under the respective facility could elect to terminate the facility and declare all outstanding obligations under such facility immediately payable. Under the senior unsecured notes, should the Company be in violation of the financial covenants, it could be limited in incurring certain additional indebtedness. The Company's revolving credit facility, the indenture for the Company's senior unsecured notes, vehicle floorplan payable facilities and mortgage facilities have cross-default provisions that trigger a default in the event of an uncured default under other material indebtedness of the Company. At December 31, 2005, the Company was in compliance with the requirements of all such financial covenants.
 
     In the event of a downgrade in the Company's credit ratings, none of the covenants described above would be impacted. In addition, availability under the revolving credit facility described above would not be impacted should a downgrade in the senior unsecured debt credit ratings occur. Certain covenants in the senior unsecured note indenture would be eliminated with certain upgrades of our senior unsecured notes to investment grade.
     Within the meaning of Regulation S-X, Rule 3-10, AutoNation, Inc. (the parent company) has no independent assets or operations, the guarantees of its subsidiaries are full and unconditional and joint and several, and any subsidiaries other than the guarantor subsidiaries are minor.
     During 2000, the Company entered into a sale-leaseback transaction involving its corporate headquarters facility that resulted in net proceeds of approximately $52.1 million. This transaction was accounted for as a financing, wherein the property remains on the books and continues to be depreciated. The Company has the option to renew the lease at the end of the ten-year lease term subject to certain conditions. The gain on this transaction has been deferred and will be recognized at the end of the lease term, including renewals. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the remaining obligation related to this transaction of $44.9 million and $46.6 million, respectively, is included in Other Debt in the above table.
     At December 31, 2005, aggregate maturities of notes payable and long-term debt, excluding vehicle floorplan payable, were as follows:
9. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Legal Proceedings
     The Company is involved, and will continue to be involved, in numerous legal proceedings arising out of the conduct of its business, including litigation with customers, employment related lawsuits, class actions, purported class actions and actions brought by governmental authorities.
     Many of the Company's Texas store subsidiaries have been named in three class action lawsuits brought against the Texas Automobile Dealers Association ("TADA") and approximately 700 new vehicle stores in Texas that are members of the TADA. The three actions allege that since January 1994, Texas dealers have deceived customers with respect to a vehicle inventory tax and violated federal antitrust and other laws as well. In April 2002, in two actions (which have been consolidated), the state court certified two classes of consumers on whose behalf the action would proceed. In the federal antitrust case, in March 2003, the federal court conditionally certified a class of consumers. The Company and other defendants appealed the ruling to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, which on October 5, 2004, reversed the class certification order, and remanded the case back to the federal district court for further proceedings. In February 2005, the Company and the plaintiffs in each of the cases agreed to settlement terms. The state settlement, which was approved preliminarily by the state court on December 27, 2005, is contingent upon final court approval, the hearing for which is currently scheduled for June 2006. The claims against the Company in federal court also would be settled contingent upon final approval in the state action. The estimated expense of the settlements is not a material amount and includes the Company's stores issuing coupons for discounts off future vehicle purchases, refunding cash in certain circumstances, and paying attorneys' fees and certain costs. Under the terms of the settlements, the Company's stores would be permitted to continue to itemize and pass through to the customer the cost of the inventory tax. If the settlements are not finally approved, the Company would then vigorously assert available defenses in connection with the TADA lawsuits. Further, the Company may have certain rights of indemnification with respect to certain aspects of these lawsuits. However, an adverse resolution of the TADA lawsuits could result in the payment of significant costs and damages and negatively impact the Company's ability to itemize and pass through to the customer the cost of the tax in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and prospects.
     In addition to the foregoing cases, the Company is also a party to numerous other legal proceedings that arose in the conduct of its business. The Company does not believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. However, the results of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, and an unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
 
Lease Commitments
     The Company leases real property, equipment and software under various operating leases most of which have terms from one to twenty years.
     Expenses under real property, equipment and software leases were $61.9 million, $58.7 million and $69.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The leases require payment of real estate taxes, insurance and common area maintenance in addition to rent. Most of the leases contain renewal options and escalation clauses.
     Future minimum lease obligations under non-cancelable real property, equipment and software leases with initial terms in excess of one year at December 31, 2005 are as follows:
     In September 2005, the EITF reached a consensus on issue EITF 05-06, "Determining the Amortization Period for Leasehold Improvements Purchased after Lease Inception or Acquired in a Business Combination." EITF 05-06 requires that leasehold improvements that are placed in service significantly after and not contemplated at or near the beginning of the lease term or that are acquired in the business combination should be amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the assets or a term that includes the required lease periods and renewals that are deemed to be reasonable assured as of the date the leasehold improvements are purchased or the date of acquisition, as applicable. EITF 05-06 is effective the first reporting period beginning after June 29, 2005. The adoption of EITF 05-06 did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
     In October 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position ("FSP") No. FAS 13-1, "Accounting for Rental Costs Incurred during a Construction Period." FSP No. FAS 13-1 requires rental costs associated with operating leases that are incurred during a construction period to be recognized as rental expense. FSP No. FAS 13-1 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2005 and is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
Other Matters
     The Company, acting through its subsidiaries, is the lessee under many real estate leases that provide for the use by the Company's subsidiaries of their respective dealership premises. Pursuant to these leases, the Company's subsidiaries generally agree to indemnify the lessor and other related parties from certain liabilities arising as a result of the use of the leased premises, including environmental liabilities, or a breach of the lease by the lessee. Additionally, from time to time, the Company enters into agreements with third parties in connection with the sale of assets or businesses in which it agrees to indemnify the purchaser or related parties from certain liabilities or costs arising in connection with the assets or business. Also, in the ordinary course of business in connection with purchases or sales of goods and services, the Company enters into agreements that may contain indemnification provisions. In the event that an indemnification claim is asserted, liability would be limited by the terms of the applicable agreement.
     From time to time, primarily in connection with dispositions of automotive stores, the Company's subsidiaries assign or sublet to the dealership purchaser the subsidiaries' interests in any real property leases associated with such stores. In general, the Company's subsidiaries retain responsibility for the performance of certain obligations under such leases to the extent that the assignee or sublessee does not perform, whether such performance is required prior to or following the assignment or subletting of the lease. Additionally, the Company and its subsidiaries generally remain subject to the terms of any guarantees made by the Company and its subsidiaries in connection with such leases. Although the Company generally has indemnification rights against the assignee or sublessee in the event of non-performance under these leases, as well as certain defenses, and the Company presently has no reason to believe that it or its subsidiaries will be called on to perform under any such assigned leases or subleases, the Company estimates that lessee rental payment obligations during the remaining terms of these leases are approximately $70 million at December 31, 2005. The Company and its subsidiaries also may be called on to perform other obligations under these leases, such as environmental remediation of the leased premises or repair of the leased premises upon termination of the lease, although the Company presently has no reason to believe that it or its subsidiaries will be called on to so perform and such obligations cannot be quantified at this time. The Company's exposure under these leases is
 
difficult to estimate and there can be no assurance that any performance of the Company or its subsidiaries required under these leases would not have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and cash flows.
     At December 31, 2005, surety bonds, letters of credit and cash deposits totaled $120.3 million, including $87.6 million of letters of credit. In the ordinary course of business, the Company is required to post performance and surety bonds, letter of credit, and/or cash deposits as financial guarantees of the Company's performance. The Company does not currently provide cash collateral for outstanding letters of credit.
     In the ordinary course of business, the Company is subject to numerous laws and regulations, including automotive, environmental, health and safety and other laws and regulations. The Company does not anticipate that the costs of such compliance will have a material adverse effect on its business, consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial condition, although such outcome is possible given the nature of the Company's operations and the extensive legal and regulatory framework applicable to its business. The Company does not have any material known environmental commitments or contingencies.
10. SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY
     A summary of yearly repurchase activity follows:
     As of December 31, 2005, the Company has $71.3 million available for share repurchases under the repurchase program authorized by the Company's Board of Directors. Future share repurchases are subject to limitations contained in the indenture relating to the Company's senior unsecured notes.
     In 2004 and 2003, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the retirement of 20 million and 50 million treasury shares, respectively, which assumed the status of authorized but unissued shares. This had the effect of reducing treasury stock and issued common stock, which includes treasury stock. The Company's outstanding common stock, net of treasury stock, was not impacted by the treasury share retirements. The Company's common stock, additional paid-in capital and treasury stock accounts have been adjusted accordingly. There was no impact to shareholders' equity.
     The Company has 5.0 million authorized shares of preferred stock, par value $.01 per share, none of which are issued or outstanding. The Board of Directors has the authority to issue the preferred stock in one or more series and to establish the rights, preferences and dividends.
     During 2005, 2004 and 2003, proceeds from the exercise of stock options were $112.8 million, $94.2 million and $118.1 million, respectively.
11. STOCK OPTIONS
     The Company has various stock option plans under which options to purchase shares of common stock may be granted to key employees and directors of the Company. Options granted under the plans are non-qualified and are granted at a price equal to or above the closing market price of the common stock on the trading day immediately prior to the date of grant. Generally, options granted will have a term of 10 years from the date of grant, and will vest in increments of 25% per year over a four-year period on the yearly anniversary of the grant date.
 
     A summary of stock option transactions is as follows for the years ended December 31:
     The following table summarizes information about outstanding and exercisable stock options at December 31, 2005:
 
12. INCOME TAXES
     The components of the provision for income taxes from continuing operations for the years ended December 31 are as follows:
     A reconciliation of the provision for income taxes calculated using the statutory federal income tax rate to the Company's provision for income taxes from continuing operations for the years ended December 31 is as follows:
     Deferred income tax asset and liability components at December 31 are as follows:
     At December 31, 2005 and 2004, net current deferred income tax assets of $76.4 million and $83.8 million, respectively, are classified as Other Current Assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet.
 
     At December 31, 2005, the Company had available gross domestic state net operating loss carryforwards and capital loss carryforwards totaling approximately $520 million (representing a deferred tax asset of $20.2 million), which expire from 2006 through 2026. At December 31, 2005, the Company had $14.8 million of valuation allowance related to these loss carryforwards. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company provides valuation allowances to offset portions of deferred tax assets due to uncertainty surrounding the future realization of such deferred tax assets. The Company adjusts the valuation allowance in the period management determines it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will or will not be realized. Certain decreases to valuation allowances are offset against intangible assets associated with business acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method of accounting.
     In March 2003, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with the IRS with respect to the tax treatment of certain transactions the Company entered into in 1997 and 1999. Under the agreement, the Company agreed to pay the IRS net aggregate payments of approximately $470 million, which included an initial net payment of approximately $350 million due in March 2004 and three subsequent net payments of approximately $40 million each due March 2005, 2006, and 2007, respectively. As a result of the settlement, the Company recognized an income tax benefit of $127.5 million from the reduction of previously recorded tax liabilities.
     In 2003, the Company made a $366 million prepayment of the initial installment due March 2004, including interest. In 2004, the Company paid the remaining balance due related to the IRS settlement totaling $128.9 million, including accrued interest. The Company recorded interest expense on the IRS tax settlement payables totaling $4.8 million and $12.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
     During 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company recorded net benefits to the provision for income taxes totaling $14.5 million, $25.8 million and $140.9 million (which includes $127.5 million recognized as a result of an IRS settlement discussed above), respectively, primarily related to the resolution of various income tax matters. The Company also recognized a $110.0 million and $52.2 million gain included in Discontinued Operations in 2005 and 2004, respectively, related to the settlement of various income tax matters. The Company completed the federal income tax audit for the years 1997 though 2001 and a federal income tax audit for 2002 through 2004 is being conducted by the IRS. In addition, the Company is routinely audited by the states in which it does business and remains under examination by various states for the tax years discussed above. The Company could experience additional state and federal tax adjustments over the next eighteen months as it continues to work through various tax matters.
     As a matter of course, the Company is regularly audited by various taxing authorities. From time to time, these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in the Company owing additional taxes. The Company believes that its tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that it has adequately provided for these matters. Included in Other Current Liabilities at December 31, 2005 and 2004 are $54.5 million and $181.3 million, respectively, provided by the Company for these matters.
13. EARNINGS PER SHARE
     The computation of weighted average common and common equivalent shares used in the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share is as follows for the years ended December 31:
     As of December 31, 2005 the Company had employee stock options outstanding of 28.0 million of which 7.2 million have been excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share since they are anti-dilutive. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, outstanding employee stock options totaling 9.3 million and 6.6 million, respectively, have been excluded since they were anti-dilutive.
 
14. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
     Discontinued operations are related to stores that were sold or for which the Company has entered into a definitive sale agreement. Generally, the sale of a store is completed within 60 to 90 days after the date of a definitive sale agreement. The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for all the periods presented have been adjusted to classify these stores as discontinued operations, including properties identified as held for sale. Also included in results from discontinued operations is a gain from an income tax adjustment related to items previously reported in discontinued operations. Selected income statement data for the Company's discontinued operations is as follows:
     A summary of the total assets and liabilities of discontinued operations included in Other Current Assets and Other Current Liabilities is as follows:
     Responsibility for the Company's vehicle floorplan payable at the time of divestiture is assumed by the buyer. Cash received from business divestitures is net of vehicle floorplan payable assumed by the buyer.
     On June 30, 2000, the Company completed the tax-free spin-off of ANC Rental Corporation ("ANC Rental"), which operated its former rental business. In connection with the spin-off, the Company agreed to provide certain guarantees on behalf of ANC Rental. In 2001, ANC Rental filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. In 2003, the bankruptcy court approved a settlement agreement among AutoNation, ANC Rental and the Committee of Unsecured Creditors in the bankruptcy.
     Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, the Company continued to guarantee $29.5 million, and committed guarantee up to an additional $10.5 million, in surety bonds supporting obligations of the rental business until December 2006. In 2004, the Company was released from its $29.5 million guarantee obligation and its remaining $10.5 million surety bond guarantee obligation. This triggered an obligation under the Settlement Agreement for the Company to pay $20 million (one-half of the permanent reduction of the surety bond guarantee obligation), to a trust established for the benefit of the unsecured creditors in the bankruptcy, which payment was made in 2004. The Company had previously incurred a pre-tax charge of $20.0 million ($12.3 million after-tax) for this liability, included in Loss from Discontinued Operations in the accompanying Unaudited Consolidated Income Statements during 2003.
 
15. OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)
     The changes in the components of other comprehensive income (loss), net of income taxes, are as follows for the years ended December 31:
     The accumulated other comprehensive loss in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Shareholders' Equity and Comprehensive Income (Loss) of $1.8 million, $(1.5) million and $(3.2) million at December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, consists primarily of unrealized losses on cash flow hedges.
16. ACQUISITIONS
     The Company acquired various automotive retail franchises and related assets during the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. The Company paid approximately $6.0 million, $194.6 million and $45.6 million, respectively, in cash during 2005, 2004 and 2003 for automotive retail acquisitions. The Company also paid $9.9 million, $3.3 million and $3.2 million during 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, in deferred purchase price for certain prior year automotive retail acquisitions. During 2005 and 2004, the Company acquired two and eight automobile retail franchises and other related assets, respectively. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company had accrued approximately $1.0 million and $10.5 million, respectively, of deferred purchase price due to former owners of acquired businesses, which is included in Other Current Liabilities.
     Purchase price allocations for 2005 are tentative and subject to final adjustment due to their closing date. Purchase price allocations for business combinations accounted for under the purchase method of accounting related to continuing operations for the years ended December 31 were as follows:
     Responsibility for the vehicle floorplan payable is assumed by the Company in acquisition transactions. Typically, the Company refinances the vehicle floorplan payable, in which case the initial refinancing is accounted for as a vehicle floorplan payable-non-trade. The Company anticipates that all of the goodwill recorded in 2005 and 2004 will be deductible for federal income tax purposes.
     The Company's unaudited pro forma consolidated results of continuing operations assuming 2005 and 2004 acquisitions had occurred at January 1, 2004 are as follows for the years ended December 31:
 
     The unaudited pro forma results of continuing operations are presented for informational purposes only and may not necessarily reflect the future results of operations of the Company or what the results of operations would have been had the Company owned and operated these businesses as of the beginning of each period presented.
     In March 2006, the Company completed the acquisition of a Mercedes-Benz dealership in Pompano Beach, Florida. The Company also signed a separate agreement in January 2006 to acquire certain rights to establish a new Mercedes-Benz dealership in Palm Beach County, Florida.
17. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
     The following is a summary of significant agreements and transactions among certain related parties and the Company. It is the Company's policy that transactions with affiliated parties must be entered into in good faith on fair and reasonable terms that are no less favorable to the Company than those that would be available in a comparable transaction in arm's-length dealings with an unrelated third party. Based on the Company's experience, it believes that all of the transactions described below met that standard at the time the transactions were effected.
     In connection with the Company's spin-off of ANC Rental in June 2000, the Company entered into certain agreements and arrangements with ANC Rental. J.P. Bryan, a Company Director, and H. Wayne Huizenga, a former Company Director, were directors of ANC Rental from July 2000 until October 2003. ANC Rental agreed to buy automotive parts from the Company following the spin-off, and paid the Company approximately $3.0 million for parts purchases made during 2003. See further information in Note 14, Discontinued Operations.
18. CASH FLOW INFORMATION
     The Company considers all highly liquid investments with purchased maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents unless the investments are legally or contractually restricted for more than three months. The effect of non-cash transactions is excluded from the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
     The Company made interest payments of approximately $187.2 million, $152.4 million, and $132.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, including interest on vehicle inventory financing. The Company made income tax payments of approximately $43.4 million, $253.4 million and $471.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The tax payments for 2004 include prepayments of the IRS settlement totaling $128.9 million as further discussed in Note 12, Income Taxes, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In February 2006, the Company made estimated state tax and federal tax payments totaling approximately $100 million, primarily related to provisions for the third and fourth quarter of 2005.
19. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
     The fair value of a financial instrument represents the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced sale or liquidation. Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information about the financial instrument. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment, and therefore cannot be determined with precision. The assumptions used have a significant effect on the estimated amounts reported.
     The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating fair value disclosures for financial instruments:
 
20. BUSINESS AND CREDIT CONCENTRATIONS
     The Company owns and operates franchised automotive stores in the United States pursuant to franchise agreements with vehicle manufacturers. Franchise agreements generally provide the manufacturers or distributors with considerable influence over the operations of the store. The success of any franchised automotive dealership is dependent, to a large extent, on the financial condition, management, marketing, production and distribution capabilities of the vehicle manufacturers or distributors of which the Company holds franchises. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company had receivables from manufacturers or distributors of $174.8 million and $170.8 million, respectively. Additionally, a large portion of the Company's Contracts-in-Transit included in Accounts Receivable are due from automotive manufacturers' captive finance subsidiaries which provide financing directly to the Company's new and used vehicle customers.
     The Company purchases substantially all of its new vehicles from various manufacturers or distributors at the prevailing prices available to all franchised dealers. Additionally, the Company finances its new vehicle inventory primarily with automotive manufacturers' captive finance subsidiaries. The Company's sales volume could be adversely impacted by the manufacturers' or distributors' inability to supply the stores with an adequate supply of vehicles and related financing.
     Concentrations of credit risk with respect to non-manufacturer trade receivables are limited due to the wide variety of customers and markets in which the Company's products are sold as well as their dispersion across many different geographic areas in the United States. Consequently, at December 31, 2005, the Company does not consider itself to have any significant non-manufacturer concentrations of credit risk.
21. QUARTERLY INFORMATION (UNAUDITED)
     The Company's operations generally experience higher volumes of vehicle sales and service in the second and third quarters of each year in part due to consumer buying trends and the introduction of new vehicle models. Also, demand for cars and light trucks is generally lower during the winter months than in other seasons, particularly in regions of the United States where stores may be subject to adverse winter weather conditions. Accordingly, the Company expects revenue and operating results generally to be lower in the first and fourth quarters as compared to the second and third quarters. However, revenue may be impacted significantly from quarter to quarter by actual or threatened severe weather events, and by other factors unrelated to weather conditions, such as changing economic conditions and automotive manufacturer incentive programs.
     The following is an analysis of certain items in the Consolidated Income Statements by quarter for 2005 and 2004:
 
 
     The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the high and low prices per share of the Company's Common Stock as reported by the New York Stock Exchange:

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On October 26, 2006, AutoNation, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing its results of operations for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2006. A copy of the press release and related quarterly financial data supplement is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report and is incorporated herein by reference.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits
(c) Exhibits
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
Dated: October 26, 2006
 

 
Exhibit 99.1
     America's largest automotive retailer, today reported 2006 third-quarter net income from continuing operations of $85 million or $0.40 per share on revenue of $5.0 billion, compared to year-ago net income from continuing operations of $121 million or $0.45 per share on revenue of $5.1 billion. Adjusting the prior-year earnings for certain items as disclosed in the attached tables, the Company's third-quarter EPS from continuing operations was $0.40 versus $0.41 in the prior year, a decline of 2%.
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla., (October 26, 2006) AutoNation, Inc. (NYSE: AN),
     In the third quarter, industry new vehicle retail unit sales declined 11% in the U.S. and were down 16% in California according to CNW. AutoNation new vehicle retail unit sales were down 8% in total and 12% in California, which represents approximately 20% of the Company's new vehicle business. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Mike Jackson commented, "The third quarter was a challenging economic environment for new vehicle sales. California's economic situation has been declining during 2006 due to the rise in interest rates and a soft housing market." Mr. Jackson also noted, "The employee discount programs offered by domestic manufacturers last year make year-over-year comparisons difficult."
     In addition to the decline in new vehicle sales, results for the third quarter were impacted by increased floor plan interest expense due to higher interest rates and higher inventories, and higher other interest expense due to increased debt levels related to the Company's recapitalization earlier in 2006. The effect on EPS of higher other interest expense was more than offset by the 19% reduction in shares outstanding due to the 50 million share buyback in the second quarter.
     For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2006, the Company reported net income from continuing operations of $257 million or $1.09 per share compared to $1.18 per share in the prior year. After adjusting for certain items as disclosed in the attached tables, EPS from continuing operations for the nine-month period on a comparable basis increased 5% to $1.18 from $1.12 in the prior year. The Company's revenue for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2006 totaled $14.6 billion, up 1% compared to $14.4 billion in the prior year.
     Separately, the Company today announced that it has signed an agreement to acquire Harloff BMW in northern San Diego County, California. The acquisition, which is subject to certain conditions and approvals, is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2006. During the quarter, AutoNation acquired Land Rover Fort Lauderdale and Fairbanks Dodge in the South Florida market and Fremont Jeep in Fremont, California.
 
AutoNation estimates that the annual revenue from these acquisitions will be approximately $200 million.

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On February 7, 2007, AutoNation, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing its results of operations for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2006. A copy of the press release and related quarterly financial data supplement is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report and is incorporated herein by reference.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits
(d) Exhibits
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
Dated: February 7, 2007
 

 
Exhibit 99.1
     America's largest automotive retailer, today reported 2006 fourth-quarter net income from continuing operations of $74 million or $0.35 per share on revenue of $4.5 billion, compared to year-ago net income from continuing operations of $82 million or $0.31 per share on revenue of $4.4 billion. Fourth-quarter EPS from continuing operations increased 13%.
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla (February 7, 2007) AutoNation, Inc. (NYSE: AN),
     Fourth quarter 2006 results were positively impacted by a 2% increase in total revenue driven by increases of 2% in new vehicle, 5% in parts and service and 8% in finance and insurance. This was offset by lower used vehicle gross profit, higher floor plan and other interest expense and $.01 per share in stock option expense. Additionally, the fourth quarter EPS was positively impacted by continued share repurchases. Fourth quarter 2005 earnings were negatively affected by Hurricane Wilma in Florida.
     For full-year 2006, the Company reported net income from continuing operations of $331 million or $1.45 per share, compared to $397 million or $1.48 per share in 2005. After adjusting for certain items as disclosed in the attached financial tables, the Company's full-year EPS from continuing operations for 2006 increased 8% to $1.54 from $1.43 in 2005. The Company's revenue for the full year totaled $19.0 billion, an increase of 1% versus the prior year.
     Full year 2006 results were positively impacted by increased gross profits in parts and service and finance and insurance, offset by lower used vehicle gross profit, higher floor plan and other interest expense and $.04 per share stock option expense impact. The effect on EPS of higher other interest expense was more than offset by the 19% reduction in shares outstanding due to the 50 million share buyback in the second quarter.

Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On February 5, 2007, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of AutoNation, Inc. (the "Company") appointed Kim C. Goodman, Vice President of Software and Peripherals of Dell Inc., to serve as a director of the Company effective immediately. The appointment increases the size of the Companys Board to ten (10) members. The Board determined that Ms. Goodman qualifies as independent under the director independence standard set forth in the AutoNation, Inc. Corporate Governance Guidelines and under applicable NYSE corporate governance standards. Ms. Goodman was not appointed to any committees of the Board. Ms. Goodman will participate in the Companys outside director compensation program pursuant to which she will receive an annual fee for her service on the Board of $25,000, plus $1,000 for each Board meeting attended in excess of four annually (and, to the extent she is appointed to a Board committee in the future, $1,000 for each committee meeting attended). These Board fees are paid i n cash, and the annual fee is prorated based on the number of months served during the year. Ms. Goodman also will receive an annual vehicle allowance of $22,500 to purchase or lease a vehicle in accordance with the Companys Director Vehicle Allowance Program (prorated based on number of months served during the first year), and expense reimbursement in connection with Board and committee meeting attendance. Additionally, Ms. Goodman will be eligible to receive an initial grant of options to purchase 50,000 shares of common stock of the Company ("Company Stock") and an annual grant to purchase 20,000 shares of Company Stock (the "Annual Grant") on the date of the 2007 Annual Meeting (as defined below), in accordance with the Companys new 2007 Director Stock Option Plan (the "Option Plan"), which is subject to approval by the Companys stockholders at the Companys 2007 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "2007 Annual Meeting"). Commencing in 2008, the Annual Grant to outside directors will be made automatically under the Option Plan on the first business day of each year. All options granted under the Option Plan vest immediately upon the date of grant. On February 2, 2007, Irene B. Rosenfeld, who has served as a director of the Company since 1999, informed the Company that she will not stand for re-election to the Board at the 2007 Annual Meeting. Ms. Rosenfeld will continue to serve as a member of the Board and the Board's Compensation Committee and as Chair of the Boards Executive Compensation Subcommittee until the 2007 Annual Meeting. On February 5, 2007, the Board adopted a new AutoNation, Inc. Senior Executive Incentive Bonus Plan (the "2007 Bonus Plan"). The 2007 Bonus Plan, which is administered by the Executive Compensation Subcommittee (the "Subcommittee") of the Compensation Committee of the Board of the Company, is subject to approval by the Companys stockholders at the 2007 Annual Meeting. The 2007 Bonus Plan, which is substantia lly identical to and is intended to replace the AutoNation, Inc. Senior Executive Incentive Bonus Plan approved by the Board and the Companys stockholders in 2002, is designed to create a direct link between pay and performance for the Companys senior executives and to ensure that annual cash performance bonuses payable to executive officers of the Company are tax deductible by the Company pursuant to Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the 2007 Bonus Plan, the Subcommittee, in its sole discretion, shall determine which of the Companys executive officers or other key employees shall participate in the plan in any particular year. In addition, the Subcommittee is responsible for identifying annual "performance factors" and establishing specific performance targets with respect thereto that must be met in order for annual bonuses to be paid under the 2007 Bonus Plan. The Subcommittee retains absolute "negative discretion" to eliminate or reduce the amount of an y award under the 2007 Bonus Plan and to make all determinations under the 2007 Bonus Plan. On February 5, 2007, the Subcommittee selected participants in the 2007 Bonus Plan for 2007, established specific annual performance goals and set target awards for participants in the 2007 Bonus Plan for 2007 (subject to stockholder approval of the 2007 Bonus Plan). The Subcommittee selected the following senior executive officers to participate in the 2007 Bonus Plan for 2007: the Companys Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; President and Chief Operating Officer; Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Executive Vice President, General Counsel & Secretary. The performance goals under the 2007 Bonus Plan for 2007 that were established by the Subcommittee are based upon the achievement of specified levels of operating income per share (minus a charge for capital deployed for acquisitions or share repurchases) and operating income as a percentage of gross profit for the Company duri ng 2007. The Subcommittee also established an objective standard for calculating the amount of the target award for each 2007 Bonus Plan participant. The performance goals established under the 2007 Bonus Plan for 2007 also constitute the performance goals that have been established for the 2007 bonus plan for bonus-eligible corporate employees of the Company to ensure that the corporate management team is fully aligned to achieve improved operating performance for our existing business and to deploy capital effectively and profitably. A copy of a press release issued by the Company announcing Ms. Goodmans appointment and Ms. Rosenfelds decision to not stand for re-election to the Board at the 2007 Annual Meeting is attached as an exhibit hereto and incorporated herein by reference.

America's largest automotive retailer, today reported earnings from continuing operations of $0.39 per share compared to year-ago earnings from continuing operations of $0.37 per share, an increase of 5%. The first-quarter EPS was positively affected by the accretive impact of share repurchases, including the $1.15 billion April 2006 share buyback, and certain tax adjustments, substantially offset by a decline in new vehicle sales especially in California and Florida.
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla (April 26, 2007) AutoNation, Inc. (NYSE: AN)
In the first quarter, industry new vehicle retail sales for California and Florida were off approximately 13%, based on CNW Research data, in line with AutoNation's decline for new vehicles sales for California and Florida. Together, California and Florida represent approximately 50% of the Company's new vehicle business.
Commenting on the first-quarter and year ahead, Mike Jackson, chairman and chief executive officer said, "It is a very challenging economic environment for new vehicle sales, driven in large part by continued softening in the housing market and higher interest rates, especially in California and Florida." Mr. Jackson also noted, "As long as the housing market continues to be soft in California and Florida, it will continue to be a challenging market for new vehicle sales. AutoNation continues to have confidence in California and Florida and views them as healthy markets over the long term."
First quarter 2007 net income from continuing operations was $83 million compared to year-ago net income from continuing operations of $98 million. Results were negatively impacted by an after-tax $9 million increase ($15 million pre-tax) in other interest expense in 2007, primarily due to additional debt incurred in connection with our April 2006 share buyback which was accretive to EPS, as well as lower new vehicle sales especially in California and Florida. Additionally, the first quarter benefited from certain tax adjustments.
Separately, the Company's Board of Directors has authorized an additional $500 million for the repurchase of its common stock. The Company has $42.1 million remaining under the $250 million share repurchase program authorized in June 2006.

     Second-quarter 2007 revenue totaled $4.6 billion, compared to $4.9 billion in the year-ago period, driven primarily by lower new vehicle sales. In the second-quarter, industry new vehicle retail sales for California and Florida were off approximately 14%, based on CNW Research data. AutoNation's decline for new vehicle unit sales for California and Florida was 16%. Together, California and Florida represent approximately 50% of the Company's new vehicle business and 20% of the industry retail new vehicles sold in the U.S.
     Commenting on the second-quarter, Mike Jackson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, "The second quarter was a challenging economic environment for new vehicle sales driven largely by continued weakness in the housing market in our key markets of Florida and California." Mr. Jackson also noted, "A key force behind consumer spending in recent years was the perceived growth in household wealth consumers had from the value of increasing home prices and readily available home equity credit. With the slumping housing market, consumers have been less willing to purchase big-ticket items, including vehicles. We expect to continue to see a challenging new vehicle retail market as long as the housing market difficulties persist. AutoNation continues to have confidence in California and Florida and views them as healthy markets over the long term."
     For the six-month period ended June 30, 2007, the Company reported net income from continuing operations of $162 million or $0.77 per share compared to $172 million or $0.70 per share in the prior year. The Company's revenue for the six-month period ended June 30, 2007 totaled $8.9 billion, down 5% compared to $9.4 billion in the prior year.
     The Company also announced today that the Board of Directors approved an extension of the employment agreements of Mr. Jackson and Michael E. Maroone, the President and Chief Operating Officer of the Company, until 2010. Mr. Jackson has served as Chairman of the Board since January 2003 and as our Chief Executive Officer since September 1999. Mr. Maroone joined the Company in 1997 and has served as our President and Chief Operating Officer since August 1999.

Exhibit 99.1
 
America's largest automotive retailer, today reported 2007 third-quarter net income from continuing operations of $77 million or $0.39 per share, compared to year-ago net income from continuing operations of $85 million or $0.40 per share. Results for the third quarter of 2007 reflected a decline in new vehicle retail sales especially in California and Florida, partially offset by tax adjustments and continued share repurchases.
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (October 24, 2007) AutoNation, Inc. (NYSE: AN),
Third-quarter 2007 revenue totaled $4.6 billion, compared to $4.9 billion in the year-ago period, driven primarily by lower new vehicle sales. In the third-quarter, industry new vehicle retail sales for California and Florida were off approximately 11% compared to last year, based on CNW Research data. AutoNation's decline for new vehicle unit sales for California and Florida was 11%. Together, California and Florida represent approximately 50% of the Company's new vehicle business and 20% of the industry retail new vehicles sold in the U.S.
Commenting on the third-quarter, Mike Jackson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, "The third quarter was a challenging economic environment for new vehicle sales driven largely by continued weakness in the housing market in our key markets of Florida and California." Mr. Jackson also noted. "We expect to continue to see a challenging new vehicle retail market as long as the housing market difficulties persist. AutoNation continues to have confidence in California and Florida and views them as healthy markets over the long term."
For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2007, the Company reported net income from continuing operations of $238 million or $1.16 per share, compared to $257 million or $1.09 per share in the prior year.
 
AutoNation also announced earlier it has signed an agreement to acquire Don Mackey BMW in Tucson, Arizona. The store will be renamed BMW Tucson after the anticipated completion of the transaction in January 2008. BMW Tucson will become the 22 new vehicle franchise owned by AutoNation in Arizona and AutoNation's 13BMW dealership nationwide. Terms of the all-cash transaction, which is subject to customary conditions and approvals, were not disclosed. AutoNation estimates that revenue generated by the dealership in 2007 will total approximately $45 million.

th
Separately, the Company's Board of Directors has authorized an additional $250 million for the repurchase of its common stock. The Company has $11.6 million remaining under the $500 million share repurchase program authorized in April 2007.

Exhibit 99.1
America's largest automotive retailer, today reported 2007 fourth quarter net income from continuing operations of $50 million or $0.27 per share on revenue of $4.2 billion, compared to year-ago fourth quarter net income from continuing operations of $74 million or $0.35 per share on revenue of $4.4 billion. Results for the fourth quarter of 2007 reflected a decline in vehicle sales especially in California and Florida, partially offset by continued share repurchases. Together, California and Florida represent approximately 50% of the Company's new vehicle business, in contrast to 20% of industry retail new vehicles sold in the U.S.
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla., (February 7, 2008)  AutoNation, Inc. (NYSE: AN),
For full year 2007, the Company reported net income from continuing operations of $288 million or $1.44 per share, compared to $331 million or $1.44 per share in 2006. After adjusting for certain items as disclosed in the attached financial tables, the Company's full-year EPS from continuing operations for 2007 was $1.38 compared to $1.53 in 2006. The Company's revenue for 2007 totaled $17.7 billion, a decrease of 5% versus the prior year.
Commenting on the year ahead, Mike Jackson, chairman and chief executive officer said, "We expect to continue to see a challenging new vehicle retail market, especially in California and Florida. AutoNation continues to have confidence in California and Florida and views them as healthy markets over the long term." Jackson also added, "We believe that in 2008, U.S. new vehicle industry sales will decline to the mid-15 million unit level from 16.1 million units in 2007. However, the recent action by the Federal Reserve to reduce interest rates could improve the automotive retail outlook in the second half of 2008."

The performance goals under the Executive Bonus Plan for 2008 that were established by the Subcommittee are based upon the achievement of specified levels of adjusted operating income per share (minus a charge for capital deployed for acquisitions or share repurchases) and adjusted operating income as a percentage of gross profit for the Company during 2008.
     The performance goals established under the Executive Bonus Plan for 2008 also constitute the performance goals that have been established for bonus-eligible corporate employees of the Company to ensure that the corporate management team is fully aligned to achieve improved operating performance for our existing business and to deploy capital effectively and profitably.
Item 5.03 Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
     On February 5, 2008, the Board approved and adopted Amended and Restated By-Laws (the "By-Laws") of the Company. The only change effected by the adoption of the new By-Laws was an amendment to Article V to make clear that the Company is authorized to issue and transfer its shares in uncertificated form in order to comply with new New York Stock Exchange listing requirements. The By-Laws as amended and restated became effective immediately upon their approval by the Board.
     The foregoing description of the amendments to the By-Laws is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the By-Laws, a copy of which is being filed as Exhibit 3.1 to this Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.

The chairman of the meeting shall have power to adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, whether or not there is a quorum.

Without limiting the manner in which a stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act for him or her as proxy, either of the following shall constitute a valid means by which a stockholder may grant such authority:
Section 5
Proxies

Execution may be accomplished by the stockholder or his or her authorized officer, director, employee or agent signing such writing or causing his or her signature to be affixed to such writing by any reasonable means, including, but not limited to, by facsimile signature.
          (b) a stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act for him or her as proxy by transmitting or authorizing the transmission of a telegram or other means of electronic transmission to the person who will be the holder of the proxy or to a proxy solicitation firm, proxy support service organization or like agent duly authorized by the person who will be the holder of the proxy to receive such transmission, provided that any such telegram or other means of electronic transmission must either set forth or be submitted with information from which it can be determined that the telegram or other electronic transmission was authorized by the stockholder.
     Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reliable reproduction of the writing or transmission authorizing another person or persons to act as proxy for a stockholder may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing or transmission for any and all purposes for which the original writing or transmission could be used; provided that such copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing or transmission.
 
     . . At all meetings of the stockholders at which a quorum is present, except as otherwise required by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws, any question brought before any meeting of stockholders shall be decided by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the total number of votes of the capital stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on such question, voting as a single class. Except as otherwise required in the Certificate of Incorporation, the Board of Directors, in its discretion, or the officer of the Corporation presiding at a meeting of stockholders, in his or her discretion, may require that any votes cast at such meeting shall be cast by written ballot.
Section 6
Voting
     . . No business may be transacted at an annual meeting of stockholders, other than business that is either (a) specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors (or any duly authorized committee thereof), (b) otherwise properly brought before the annual meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors (or any duly authorized committee thereof) or (c) otherwise properly brought before the annual meeting by any stockholder of the Corporation (i) who is a stockholder of record on the date of the giving of the notice provided for in this Section 7 and on the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote at such annual meeting and (ii) who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 7.
Section 7
Nature of Business at Annual Meetings of Stockholders
     In addition to any other applicable requirements, for business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder, such stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in proper written form to the Secretary of the Corporation.
     To be timely, a stockholder's notice to the Secretary must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not less than ninety (90) days nor more than one-hundred twenty (120) days prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of stockholders; provided, however, that in the event that the annual meeting is called for a date that is not within thirty (30) days before or after such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder in order to be timely must be so received not later than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which such notice of the date of the annual meeting was mailed or such public announcement of the date of the annual meeting was made, whichever first occurs. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting commence a new time period for the giving of a stockholder's notice described above.
     To be in proper written form, a stockholder's notice to the Secretary must set forth as to each matter such stockholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting (i) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting, (ii) the name and record address of such stockholder, (iii) the class or series and number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation which are owned beneficially or of record by such stockholder, (iv) a description of all arrangements or understandings between such stockholder and any other person or persons (including their names) in connection with the proposal of such business by such stockholder and any material interest of such stockholder in such business and (v) a representation that such stockholder intends to appear in person or by proxy at the annual meeting to bring such business before the meeting.
 
     No business shall be conducted at the annual meeting of stockholders except business brought before the annual meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 7, provided, however, that, once business has been properly brought before the annual meeting in accordance with such procedures, nothing in this Section 7 shall be deemed to preclude discussion by any stockholder of any such business. If the chairman of an annual meeting determines that business was not properly brought before the annual meeting in accordance with the foregoing procedures, the chairman shall declare to the meeting that the business was not properly brought before the meeting and such business shall not be transacted.
     For purposes of this Section 7, "public announcement" shall mean an announcement in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, PR Newswire, Associated Press or comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed by the Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.
     . . In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors and which record date: (1) in the case of determination of stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders or adjournment thereof, shall not be more than sixty nor less than ten days before the date of such meeting; and (2) in the case of any other action, shall not be more than sixty days prior to such other action. If no record date is fixed: (1) the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held; and (2) the record date for determining stockholders for any other purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting. Nothing in this Section 8 shall in any way be construed to change the procedure for setting the record date and for determining the effectiveness of stockholder action by written consent as set forth in Section 9 of this Article II.
Section 8
Record Date
     . .
Section 9
Written Consents
          (a) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board of Directors may fix a record date (a "Consent Record Date"). The Consent Record Date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the Consent Record Date is adopted by the Board of Directors and shall not be more than ten (10) days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the Consent Record date is adopted by the Board of Directors. Any stockholder of record seeking to have the stockholders authorize or take corporate action by written consent shall, by written notice to the
 
Secretary of the Corporation, request the Board of Directors to fix a Consent Record Date. To be valid, such written request shall set forth the purpose or purposes for which the written consent is sought to be used, shall be signed by one or more stockholders of record (or their duly authorized proxies or other representatives) and shall bear the date of signature of each such stockholder (or proxy or other representative). The Board of Directors shall promptly, but in all events within ten (10) days after the date on which such a request is received, adopt a resolution fixing the Consent Record Date. If no Consent Record Date has been fixed by the Board of Directors within ten (10) days of the date on which such a request is received, the Consent Record Date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board of Directors is required by applicable law, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of business, or an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of stockholders meetings are recorded, to the attention of the Secretary of the Corporation. Delivery shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. If no Consent Record Date has been fixed by the Board of Directors and prior action by the Board of Directors is required by applicable law, the Consent Record Date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the date on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action.
          (b) Every written consent shall be signed by a person or persons who as of the Consent Record Date is a stockholder of record on the Consent Record Date, shall bear the date of signature of each such stockholder, shall set forth the name and address, as they appear in the Corporation's books, of each stockholder signing such consent and the class and number of shares of the Corporation which are owned of record and beneficially by each such stockholder, and shall be delivered to the Corporation in the manner specified in Section 9(a). No written consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless, within 60 days of the date the earliest dated written consent was received in accordance with Section 9(a), a written consent or consents signed by a sufficient number of holders to take such action are delivered to the Corporation in the manner prescribed in Section 9(a).
          (c) In the event of the delivery, in the manner provided in Section 9(a), to the Corporation of the requisite written consent or consents to take corporate action and/or any related revocation or revocations, the Corporation shall engage independent inspectors of elections for the purpose of promptly performing a ministerial review of the validity of the consents and revocations. For the purpose of permitting the inspectors to perform such review, no action by written consent without a meeting shall be effective until such date as the independent inspectors certify to the Corporation that the consents represent at least the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to take the corporate action. Nothing contained in this paragraph (c) of Section 9 shall in any way be construed to suggest or imply that the Board of Directors or any stockholder shall not be entitled to contest the validity of any consent or revocation thereof, whether before or after certification by the independent inspectors, or to take any other action (including, without limitation, the commencement, prosecution or defense of any litigation with respect thereto, and the seeking of injunctive relief in such litigation).
 
     . . The Board of Directors of the Corporation may adopt by resolution such rules and regulations for the conduct of the meeting of the stockholders as it shall deem appropriate. Except to the extent inconsistent with such rules and regulations as adopted by the Board of Directors, the chairman of any meeting of the stockholders shall have the right and authority to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and to do all such acts as, in the judgment of such chairman, are appropriate for the proper conduct of the meeting. Such rules, regulations or procedures, whether adopted by the Board of Directors or prescribed by the chairman of the meeting, may include, without limitation, the following: (i) the establishment of an agenda or order of business for the meeting; (ii) the determination of when the polls shall open and close for any given matter to be voted on at the meeting; (iii) rules and procedures for maintaining order at the meeting and the safety of those present; (iv) limitations on attendance at or participation in the meeting to stockholders of record of the Corporation, their duly authorized and constituted proxies or such other persons as the chairman of the meeting shall determine; (v) restrictions on entry to the meeting after the time fixed for the commencement thereof; and (vi) limitations on the time allotted to questions or comments by participants.

Section 11
Notices and Waivers
          (a) Whenever written notice is required by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws to be given to any stockholder, such notice may be given by mail, addressed to such stockholder, at such stockholder's address as it appears on the records of the Corporation, with postage thereon prepaid, and such notice shall be deemed to be given at the time when the same shall be deposited in the United States mail. Written notice may also be given personally or by telegram, facsimile or any other lawful method.
          (b) Whenever any notice is required by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws to be given to any stockholder, a waiver thereof in writing signed by the person or persons entitled to said notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting, present by person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except where the person attends the meeting for the express purpose of objecting at the beginning of the meeting to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the stockholders need be specified in any written waiver of notice unless so required by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws.
 
     . . In advance of any meeting of stockholders, the Board by resolution or the Chairman of the Board of Directors shall appoint one or more inspectors of election to act at the meeting and make a written report thereof. One or more other persons may be designated as alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act. If no inspector or alternate is present, ready and willing to act at a meeting of stockholders, the chairman of the meeting shall appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting. Unless otherwise required by law, inspectors may be officers, employees or agents of the Corporation. Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of his or her duties, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her ability. The inspector shall have the duties prescribed by law and shall take charge of the polls and, when the vote is completed, shall make a certificate of the result of the vote taken and of such other facts as may be required by law.
Section 12
Inspectors of Election
     . . The Board of Directors shall consist of not more than 12 members, the exact number of which shall be determined from time to time by resolution adopted by the Board of Directors. Except as provided in Section 3 of this Article III, directors shall be elected by the stockholders at the annual meetings of stockholders. Each director shall hold office for the term for which he or she is elected and qualified or until his or her successor shall have been elected and qualified or until his or her earlier resignation, removal from office or death. The Board of Directors may from time to time establish minimum qualifications for eligibility to become a director. Those qualifications may include, but shall not be limited to, a prerequisite stock ownership in the Corporation.
Section 1
Number and Election of Directors
     . . Only persons who are nominated in accordance with the following procedures shall be eligible for election as directors of the Corporation, except as may be otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation with respect to the right of holders of preferred stock of the Corporation to nominate and elect a specified number of directors in certain circumstances. Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors may be made at any annual meeting of stockholders, (a) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors (or any duly authorized committee thereof) or (b) by any stockholder of the Corporation (i) who is a stockholder of record on the date of the giving of the notice provided for in this Section 2 and on the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting and (ii) who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 2.
Section 2
Nomination of Directors
     In addition to any other applicable requirements, for a nomination to be made by a stockholder, such stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in proper written form to the Secretary of the Corporation.
     To be timely, a stockholder's notice to the Secretary must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not less than ninety (90) days nor more than one-hundred twenty (120) days prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of stockholders; provided, however, that in the event that the annual meeting is called for a date that is not within thirty (30) days before or after such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder in order to be timely must be so received not later than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which such notice of the date of the annual meeting was mailed or such public announcement of the date of the annual meeting was made, whichever first occurs. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting commence a new time period for the giving of a stockholder's notice described above.
 
     To be in proper written form, a stockholder's notice to the Secretary must set forth (a) as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election as a director (i) the name, age, business address and residence address of the person, (ii) the principal occupation or employment of the person, (iii) the class or series and number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation which are owned beneficially or of record by the person and (iv) any other information relating to the person that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings required to be made in connection with solicitations of proxies for election of directors pursuant to Section 14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder; and (b) as to the stockholder giving the notice (i) the name and record address of such stockholder, (ii) the class or series and number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation which are owned beneficially or of record by such stockholder, (iii) a description of all arrangements or understandings between such stockholder and each proposed nominee and any other person or persons (including their names) pursuant to which the nomination(s) are to be made by such stockholder, (iv) a representation that such stockholder intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the persons named in its notice and (v) any other information relating to such stockholder that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings required to be made in connection with solicitations of proxies for election of directors pursuant to Section 14 of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Such notice must be accompanied by a written consent of each proposed nominee to being named as a nominee and to serve as a director if elected.
     No person shall be eligible for election as a director of the Corporation unless nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2. If the chairman of the meeting determines that a nomination was not made in accordance with the foregoing procedures, the chairman shall declare to the meeting that the nomination was defective and such defective nomination shall be disregarded.
     Notwithstanding anything in the third paragraph of this Section 2 to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors of the Corporation is increased and there is no public announcement by the Corporation naming all of the nominees for director or specifying the size of the increased board of directors at least one hundred (100) days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, a stockholder's notice required by this Section 2 shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new positions created by such increase, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the Corporation.
     For purposes of this Section 2, "public announcement" shall mean an announcement in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, PR Newswire, Associated Press or comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed by the Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.
 
     . . Subject to the terms of any one or more classes or series of preferred stock, any vacancy on the Board of Directors that results from an increase in the number of directors may only be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, provided that a quorum is present, and any other vacancy occurring on the Board of Directors may only be filled by a majority of the Board of Directors then in office, even if less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director. Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever the holders of any one or more class or classes or series of preferred stock of the Corporation shall have the right, voting separately as a class, to elect directors at an annual or special meeting of stockholders, the election, term of office, filling of vacancies and other features of such directorships shall be governed by the Certificate of Incorporation.
Section 3
Vacancies
     . . The business of the Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of the Board of Directors which may exercise all such powers of the Corporation and do all such lawful acts and things as are not by statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation or by these By-Laws required to be exercised or done by the stockholders.
Section 4
Duties and Powers
     . . Each meeting of the Board of Directors shall be presided over by the Chairman of the Board of Directors, or in his or her absence, by the Vice Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer or such other member of the Board of Directors as is designated by the Chairman of the Board of Directors or as shall be chosen by the Board of Directors at the meeting. The Secretary of the Corporation shall act as Secretary at each meeting of the Board of Directors. In case the Secretary shall be absent from any meeting of the Board of Directors, the chairman of the meeting shall be entitled to designate any person, including an Assistant Secretary, to act as Secretary of the meeting.
Section 5
Organization
     . . Any director of the Corporation may resign at any time, by giving written notice to the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the President or the Secretary of the Corporation. Such resignation shall take effect at the time therein specified or, if no time is specified, immediately; and, unless otherwise specified in such notice, the acceptance of such resignation shall not be necessary to make it effective. Except as otherwise required by law and subject to the rights, if any, of the holders of shares of preferred stock then outstanding, any director or the entire Board of Directors may be removed from office at any time, only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority in voting power of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote in the election of directors.
Section 6
Resignations and Removals of Directors
     . . The Board of Directors of the Corporation may hold meetings, both regular and special, either within or without the State of Delaware. Regular meetings of the Board of Directors may be held at such time and at such place as may from time to time be determined by the Board of Directors and, unless required by resolution of the Board of Directors, without notice. Special meetings of the Board of Directors may be called by the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the Vice Chairman, if there be one, the Chief Executive Officer or a majority of the directors then in office. Notice thereof stating the place, date and hour of the meeting shall be given to each director either by mail not less than forty-eight (48) hours before the date of the meeting, or by telephone, facsimile, telegram or other means of electronic transmission, overnight express mail service or personally on twenty-four (24) hours' notice, or on such shorter notice as the person or persons calling such meeting may deem necessary or appropriate in the circumstances. Whenever any notice is required to be given to any director, a waiver thereof in writing, signed by such director, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a director at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except where the director attends the meeting for the express purpose of objecting at the beginning of the meeting to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.
Section 7
Meetings
 
     . . Except as may be otherwise required by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws, at all meetings of the Board of Directors or any committee thereof, a majority of the entire Board of Directors or a majority of the members of such committee, as the case may be, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business and the act of a majority of the directors present at any meeting at which there is a quorum shall be the act of the Board of Directors or any such committee, as the case may be.

Section 8
Quorum
     . Unless otherwise provided by the Certificate of Incorporation, any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors or of any committee thereof may be taken without a meeting, if all the members of the Board of Directors or committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing or by electronic transmission, and the writing or writings or electronic transmission or transmissions are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the Board of Directors or committee.
Section 9. Actions by Written Consent
     . . Unless otherwise provided by the Certificate of Incorporation, members of the Board of Directors of the Corporation, or any committee designated by the Board of Directors, may participate in a meeting of the Board of Directors or such committee by means of a conference telephone or other communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and participation in a meeting pursuant to this Section 10 shall constitute presence in person at such meeting.

Section 5
Severability
     . . Subject to Section 3 of this Article VII, the Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation) by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was a director or officer of the Corporation serving at the request of the Corporation as a director or officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, such person had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that such person did not act in good faith and in a manner which such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful.
Section 1
Power to Indemnify in Actions, Suits or Proceedings Other than Those by or in the Right of the Corporation
     . . Subject to Section 3 of this Article VII, the Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was a director or officer of the Corporation serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation; except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.
Section 2
Power to Indemnify in Actions, Suits or Proceedings by or in the Right of the Corporation
 
     . . Any indemnification under this Article VII (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the present or former director or officer is proper in the circumstances because such person has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 1 or Section 2 of this Article VII, as the case may be. Such determination shall be made, with respect to a person who is a director or officer at the time of such determination, (i) by a majority vote of the directors who are not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, even though less than a quorum, or (ii) by a committee of such directors designated by a majority vote of such directors, even though less than a quorum, or (iii) if there are no such directors, or if such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (iv) by the stockholders. To the extent, however, that a present or former director or officer of the Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding described above, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such person shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith, without the necessity of authorization in the specific case.
Section 3
Authorization of Indemnification
     . . For purposes of any determination under Section 3 of this Article VII, a person shall be deemed to have acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, or, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, to have had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful, if such person's action is based on the records or books of account of the Corporation or another enterprise, or on information supplied to such person by the officers of the Corporation or another enterprise in the course of their duties, or on the advice of legal counsel for the Corporation or another enterprise or on information or records given or reports made to the Corporation or another enterprise by an independent certified public accountant or by an appraiser or other expert selected with reasonable care by the Corporation or another enterprise. The term "another enterprise" as used in this Section 4 shall mean any other corporation or any partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise of which such person is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent. The provisions of this Section 4 shall not be deemed to be exclusive or to limit in any way the circumstances in which a person may be deemed to have met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 1 or 2 of this Article VII, as the case may be.
Section 4
Good Faith Defined
     . . Notwithstanding any contrary determination in the specific case under Section 3 of this Article VII, and notwithstanding the absence of any determination thereunder, any director or officer may apply to the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or any other court of competent jurisdiction in the State of Delaware for indemnification to the extent otherwise permissible under Sections 1 and 2 of this Article VII. The basis of such indemnification by a court shall be a determination by such court that indemnification of the director or officer is proper in the circumstances because such person has met the applicable standards of conduct set forth in Section 1 or 2 of this Article VII, as the case may be. Neither a contrary determination in the specific case under Section 3 of this Article
Section 5
Indemnification by a Court
 
VII nor the absence of any determination thereunder shall be a defense to such application or create a presumption that the director or officer seeking indemnification has not met any applicable standard of conduct. Notice of any application for indemnification pursuant to this Section 5 shall be given to the Corporation promptly upon the filing of such application. If successful, in whole or in part, the director or officer seeking indemnification shall also be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such application.
     . . Expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by a director or officer in defending or investigating a threatened or pending civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director or officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Article VII.
Section 6
Expenses Payable in Advance
     . . The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by or granted pursuant to this Article VII shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under the Certificate of Incorporation or any By-Law, agreement, contract, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or pursuant to the direction (howsoever embodied) of any court of competent jurisdiction or otherwise, both as to action in such person's official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, it being the policy of the Corporation that indemnification of the persons specified in Section 1 and 2 of this Article VII shall be made to the fullest extent permitted by law. The provisions of this Article VII shall not be deemed to preclude the indemnification of any person who is not specified in Section 1 or 2 of this Article VII but whom the Corporation has the power or obligation to indemnify under the provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or otherwise.
Section 7
Nonexclusivity of Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses
     . . The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was a director or officer of the Corporation serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise against any liability asserted against such person and incurred by such person in any such capacity, or arising out of such person's status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power or the obligation to indemnify such person against such liability under the provisions of this Article VII.
Section 8
Insurance
     . . For purposes of this Article VII, references to "the Corporation" shall include, in addition to the resulting corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors or officers, so that any person who is or was a director or officer of such constituent corporation, or is or was a director or officer of such constituent corporation serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, shall stand in the same
Section 9
Certain Definitions
 
position under the provisions of this Article VII with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as such person would have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued. For purposes of this Article VII, references to "fines" shall include any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to an employee benefit plan; and references to "serving at the request of the Corporation" shall include any service as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation which imposes duties on, or involves services by, such director or officer with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants or beneficiaries; and a person who acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to have acted in a manner "not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation" as referred to in this Article VII.
     . . The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this Article VII shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director or officer and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.
Section 10
Survival of Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses
     . . Notwithstanding anything contained in this Article VII to the contrary, except for proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification (which shall be governed by Section 5 hereof), the Corporation shall not be obligated to indemnify any director or officer (or his or her heirs, executors or personal or legal representatives) or advance expenses in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person unless such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized or consented to by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.
Section 11
Limitation on Indemnification
     . . The Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board of Directors, provide rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses to employees and agents of the Corporation similar to those conferred in this Article VII to directors and officers of the Corporation.
Section 12
Indemnification of Employees and Agents
     . . Any repeal or other modification of this Article VII shall not limit any rights of indemnification then existing or arising out of events, acts, omissions or circumstances occurring or existing prior to such repeal or modification, including, without limitation, the right to indemnification for proceedings commenced after such repeal or modification to enforce this Article VII with regard to acts, omissions, events or circumstances occurring or existing prior to such repeal or modification.
Section 13
Repeal or Modification
     . . If this Article VII or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each director and officer of the Corporation as to costs, charges and expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement with respect to any proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, including an action by or in the right of the Corporation, to the full extent permitted by any applicable portion of this Article VII that shall not have been invalidated and to the full extent permitted by applicable law.
Section 14

     . . These By-Laws may be altered, amended or repealed, in whole or in part, or new By-Laws may be adopted by the Board of Directors or by the stockholders.

Exhibit 99.1
      
     America's largest automotive retailer, today reported 2008 first quarter net income from continuing operations of $56 million or $0.31 per share, compared to year-ago net income from continuing operations of $83 million or $0.39 per share. Results for the first quarter of 2008 reflected a decline in vehicle retail sales, especially in AutoNation's key markets in California, Florida, Nevada and Arizona where the housing crisis has significantly impacted the automotive retail business. First quarter 2008 results also were impacted by lower gross profit per new and used vehicle sold, partially offset by continued share repurchases. Prior year results benefited from favorable tax adjustments of $0.02 per share.
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (April 24, 2008) AutoNation, Inc. (NYSE: AN),
     First quarter 2008 revenue totaled $4.0 billion, compared to $4.3 billion in the year-ago period, driven primarily by lower vehicle sales. In the first quarter, industry new vehicle U.S. retail sales declined approximately 11%, according to CNW Research. AutoNation new vehicle unit sales declined 8%. Industry new vehicle retail sales for California, Florida, Nevada and Arizona were off approximately 15% compared to last year, based on CNW Research data. AutoNation's decline for new vehicle unit sales in those markets was 11%. Together, California, Florida, Nevada and Arizona represent approximately 60% of the Company's new vehicle business and approximately 25% of the industry retail new vehicles sold in the U.S.
     Commenting on the first quarter, Mike Jackson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, "In the first quarter we continued to experience a challenging economic environment for new vehicle sales, particularly in our key markets of California, Florida, Nevada and Arizona where the housing crisis has clearly impacted overall economic activity and consumer demand for new vehicles." Mr. Jackson also noted, "We expect to continue to see a challenging automotive retail market as long as the current economic difficulties persist. However, AutoNation continues to have confidence in the long-term health of California, Florida, Nevada and Arizona."

Exhibit 99.1
 
America's largest automotive retailer, today reported 2008 second quarter net income from continuing operations of $53 million or $0.29 per share, compared to year-ago net income from continuing operations of $79 million or $0.38 per share. After adjusting for certain items disclosed in the attached financial tables, net income from continuing operations for the 2008 second quarter was $59 million or $0.33 per share, compared to $76 million or $0.36 per share in the prior year.
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (July 24, 2008) AutoNation, Inc. (NYSE: AN),
Second quarter 2008 revenue totaled $3.9 billion, compared to $4.5 billion in the year-ago period, driven primarily by lower new vehicle sales. In the second quarter, total U.S. industry retail sales declined 16%, based on CNW Research data. In comparison, in the second quarter AutoNation's new vehicle unit sales declined 12%.
Commenting on the second quarter, Mike Jackson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, "Despite the fact that this past quarter was the most challenging automotive sales environment any of us have encountered, AutoNation delivered solid profitability." Mr. Jackson also noted, "In the second quarter, the industry encountered $4.00 per gallon gasoline on top of the continued housing depression and credit crisis, resulting in a significant challenge as consumers are either postponing the purchase of vehicles or they are purchasing smaller vehicles that are more economical both at the time of purchase and at the pump. We now believe that, in 2008, U.S. new vehicle industry sales will decline to the low-14 million unit level."
Mr. Jackson added, "In continuing response to the ongoing macroeconomic and industry challenges, we are executing a cost reduction plan with a targeted annualized run rate pre-tax savings of $100 million. In the first half of the year, we achieved approximately $25 million of this benefit. In the second half of the year, we expect to achieve approximately $50 million of savings, for a full-year 2008 impact of $75 million on a pre-tax basis. Our targeted annualized cost savings include reductions in advertising spending, corporate overhead expense and store personnel expense."
 
For the six-month period ended June 30, 2008, the Company reported net income from continuing operations of $109 million or $0.60 per share compared to $162 million or $0.77 per share in the prior year. After adjusting for certain items as disclosed in the attached financial tables, net income from continuing operations for the six-month period ended June 30, 2008 was $115 million or $0.64 per share, compared to $153 million or $0.73 per share. The Company's revenue for the six-month period ended June 30, 2008 totaled $7.9 billion, down 10% compared to $8.8 billion in the prior year.

     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
Dated: November 6, 2008
 

Exhibit 99.1
America's largest automotive retailer, today reported a 2008 third quarter net loss from continuing operations of $1.40 billion or $7.95 per share. In the quarter, the Company recorded non-cash charges for goodwill and franchise impairments of $1.46 billion after-tax. After adjusting for the impairment charges and certain other items disclosed in the attached financial tables, net income from continuing operations for the 2008 third quarter was $44 million or $0.25 per share, compared to $73 million or $0.37 per share in the prior year.
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (November 6, 2008) AutoNation, Inc. (NYSE: AN),
Third quarter 2008 revenue totaled $3.5 billion, compared to $4.5 billion in the year-ago period, driven primarily by lower new vehicle sales. In the third quarter, total U.S. industry new vehicle retail sales declined 31%, based on CNW Research data. In comparison, in the third quarter AutoNation's new vehicle unit sales declined 24%.
Commenting on the third quarter, Mike Jackson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, "The third quarter was negatively impacted by the credit crisis that escalated in September into a full blown credit panic. This created a credit freeze that broke consumer confidence and, along with a continued housing depression, accelerated the decline in the U.S. economy and auto retail market. As a result of the adverse market conditions and a decline in our stock price, we were required under accounting rules to record non-cash goodwill and franchise impairment charges in the third quarter. Notwithstanding the impairment charges, the Company remains in compliance with all of the financial covenants in its credit facilities and the indenture for its senior notes. Furthermore, despite these headwinds, AutoNation continues to generate solid cash flow as demonstrated by the $104 million reduction in non-vehicle debt during the quarter, and excluding the non-cash charges, AutoNation was solidly profitable in the third quarter. Year to date, debt reduction totals $589 million, $362 million of non-vehicle debt and $227 million of vehicle floor plan debt."
 
Looking forward, Jackson also stated, "We expect the rest of 2008 will continue to be challenging and foresee U.S. industry new vehicle sales for 2008 in the low 13-million unit level, an 18-year low. While at this time it is hard to predict new vehicle sales for 2009, the most conservative industry forecast is in the range of 12 million new vehicle units. Even at a 12 million new vehicle level, we are confident that AutoNation will remain profitable and in compliance with debt covenants."
During the third quarter of 2008, in response to changes in the automotive retail market, including the disproportionate decline in revenue and earnings from the Company's domestic franchises relative to its import and premium luxury franchises, AutoNation made changes to its management approach that divided its business into three operating segments.
AutoNation has added supplemental reporting which provides additional detail on the three operating segments: Domestic, Import, and Premium Luxury. The Domestic segment is comprised of stores that sell vehicles manufactured by General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler, the Import segment is comprised of stores that sell vehicles manufactured primarily by Toyota, Honda, and Nissan, and the Premium Luxury segment is comprised of stores that sell vehicles manufactured primarily by Mercedes, BMW, and Lexus.
Segment Results for the Quarter
 
For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2008, the Company reported net loss from continuing operations of $1.30 billion or $7.27 per share, compared to net income from continuing operations of $238 million or $1.16 per share in the prior year. After adjusting for the impairment charges and certain other items as disclosed in the attached financial tables, net income from continuing operations for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2008 was $159 million or $0.89 per share, compared to $226 million or $1.10 per share in the prior year. The Company's revenue for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2008 totaled $11.4 billion, down 14% compared to $13.2 billion in the prior year.

Under the terms of the Honda Agreement, Honda has agreed not to assert its right to purchase the Company's Honda and Acura franchises and/or similar remedies under the manufacturer framework agreement between Honda and the Company in the event that ESL acquires fifty percent (50%) or more of the Common Stock. If ESL acquires more than fifty percent (50%) of the Common Stock, ESL has agreed to vote all shares in excess of fifty percent (50%) in the same proportion as all non-ESL-owned shares are voted. In addition, the Company has agreed to ensure that a majority of the Company's Board is independent of both the Company and ESL under existing New York Stock Exchange ("") listing standards. Furthermore, the Honda Agreement provides that Honda's consent does not apply to a "going private" transaction under Rule 13e-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

NYSE
Under the terms of the Toyota Agreement, Toyota has agreed not to assert its right to purchase the Company's Toyota and Lexus franchises and/or similar remedies under the manufacturer framework agreement between Toyota and the Company in the event that ESL acquires fifty percent (50%) or more of the Common Stock. If ESL acquires more than fifty percent (50%) of the Common Stock, ESL has agreed to vote all shares in excess of fifty percent (50%) in the same proportion as all non-ESL-owned shares are voted. Furthermore, the Company has agreed that a majority of the Company's Board will be independent from both the Company and from ESL under existing NYSE listing standards. The Company has also agreed not to merge, consolidate or combine with any entity owned or controlled by ESL unless Toyota consents thereto. In addition, the Toyota Agreement provides that in the event that the Company appoints a Chief Operating Officer who, in the good faith judgment of the Board, does not have sufficient breadth and depth of experience, a relevant, successful automotive track record and extensive successful automotive experience, ESL shall be required to divest its shares in excess of fifty percent (50%) within nine (9) months or its voting interest will be limited to twenty-five percent (25%), and if ESL does not divest such shares within eighteen (18) months, it will lose all voting rights until it divests such shares. The terms and conditions of the Toyota Agreement will only apply at such time and for so long as ESL owns more than fifty percent (50%) of the Common Stock and will terminate on December 31, 2009 with respect to future stock acquisitions by ESL, provided that ESL may seek successive annual one-year extensions, and Toyota shall not unreasonably withhold or delay its consent thereto.
 
In addition, on January 28, 2009, the Board authorized and approved a separate letter agreement between the Company and ESL (the "") in which ESL has agreed to vote shares of the Common Stock owned by ESL in excess of forty-five percent (45%) in the same proportion as all non-ESL-owned shares are voted.

ESL is not a party to any of these agreements.
As described in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007, some of the Company's manufacturer framework agreements give the manufacturer the right to acquire, or the right to compel the Company to sell, the automotive stores franchised by that manufacturer in the event of a change in control of the Company, which generally includes certain material changes in the composition of the Company's Board during a specified time period, the acquisition of twenty percent (20%) or more of the Company's voting stock by another vehicle manufacturer or distributor or the acquisition of fifty percent (50%) or more of the Company's voting stock by a person, entity or group not affiliated with a vehicle manufacturer or distributor or other extraordinary corporate transactions such as a merger or sale of the Company's assets. None of the aforementioned letter agreements modify, or provide consent to or waiver of, such provisions other than the acquisition by ESL of over fifty percent (50%) of the Common Stock.

SOLELY WITH RESPECT TO SECTIONS 1, 2, 3, 5 AND 6 ABOVE AND THE SECOND SENTENCE OF SECTION 4 ABOVE, ACKNOWLEDGED BY AND AGREED TO AS OF THE DATE FIRST WRITTEN ABOVE:
ESL INVESTMENTS, INC. (on behalf of itself and the ESL Parties)
 
Exhibit A
Attached.
 
This "Policy on the Granting of Security Interest in the Shares of Any Entity That Owns an Interest in a Honda or Acura Dealership" (the "Security Interest Policy") is intended to respond to questions that are frequently addressed to American Honda Motor Co., Inc. ("AHM") by its Dealers as to whether and when it may be appropriate under the Honda and/or Acura Automobile Dealer Sales and Service Agreement (the "Dealer Agreement") for Dealers to grant a security interest in an entity that owns any Honda and/or Acura dealership(s) and the form that such security interest may take.
     
III.
BACKGROUND
AHM requires that each Honda and or Acura dealership be organized as a separate legal entity. (Most frequently, a dealership is organized as a corporation, a limited liability company ("LLC") or a partnership.) In this Security Interest Policy, the separate legal entity that owns and operates the individual Honda or Acura dealership is referred to as a Direct Ownership Entity. Direct Ownership Entities are frequently owned, in whole or in part, by other companies, which, in turn, may be owned by other companies and so on. In this Security Interest Policy, a company that owns any interest in a Direct Ownership Entity, whether directly or through one or more layers of other companies, is referred to as an Indirect Ownership Entity. Direct Ownership Entities and Indirect Ownership Entities are referred to generally as Ownership Entities.
 
Security Interest Policy (104-0603) Revised 03/04 Page 2
In connection with financing the purchase of Honda and Acura Automobiles, Parts and Accessories and improvements to Dealership Premises, Ownership Entities generally grant security interests in the tangible assets (for example, automobiles, parts, tools, real estate) of their Dealership Operations. Such security interests are standard in the industry.
Nothing in this Security Interest Policy is intended to have any impact on the granting of security interests in tangible assets.
On a number of occasions, AHM has been approached by Dealer Owners who wish to grant a security interest in the shares (that is, the stock or membership interests) of a Direct Ownership Entity in order to secure a bank loan or some other financial obligation. In all cases, AHM has rejected such requests. The Dealer Agreement states that there shall be no voluntary or involuntary change, direct or indirect, in the legal or beneficial ownership or responsibility of Dealer for the Dealership Operations, without the prior written approval of American Honda. The grant of a security interest in the shares of a Direct Ownership Entity effects a change in the beneficial ownership of a Dealership Operations and would, in the event of a default by the Dealer Owner who has granted such security interest, vest control and/or ownership of the Dealership Operations in the party to whom the security interest has been granted.
The situation may be less critical with respect to the granting of a security interest in the shares of an Indirect Ownership Entity. At one extreme, if a large, publicly-traded corporation owned an interest in a Honda or Acura dealership, AHM would not attempt to prevent the owners of the publicly traded stock from granting a security interest in that stock for at least two reasons: (1) such prohibition would be impossible to monitor and enforce; and (2) granting a security interest in freely-tradeable stock would almost certainly have no greater impact on the control of the dealership than the sale of that stock, which is generally permitted.
1
Recently AHM has been confronted by what it considers to be an intermediate situation. By way of illustration, Investor X owns shares of A, an Indirect Ownership Entity that has an ownership interest in Direct Ownership Entity B. Investor X requests permission to pledge the shares of A to Bank C, to secure a loan that would be invested in improvements in the dealership. AHM would not approve the transaction for the reasons described above; that is, that, in the event of a default by Investor X, Bank C, through its control of the shares of Indirect Ownership Entity A, might control or influence the management of Direct Ownership Entity B.
However, AHM may permit the transaction to go forward provided that Bank C agrees that it will not, under any circumstances, exercise control over the dealership; that it will respect AHM's right to approve or, if appropriate, deny approval of the transfer of the dealership; and that its sole interest will be in the proceeds of the sale of the stock or membership interests. In such case, X would get his loan and AHM would have a contractual guarantee that B will at all times be managed by experienced, professional automobile-oriented personnel.
In summary, rather than pledging the shares of A to Bank C, Investor X would grant Bank C a security interest in the proceeds of the sale of the shares of A.

On January 29, 2009, AutoNation, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing its results of operations for the fiscal quarter and year ended December 31, 2008. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
The information furnished pursuant to this Item 2.02, including Exhibit 99.1, shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") or otherwise subject to the liabilities under that Section and shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any filing of the Registrant under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
(d) Exhibits
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
Dated: January 29, 2009
 

Exhibit 99.1
America's largest automotive retailer, today reported 2008 fourth quarter net income from continuing operations of $70 million, or $0.40 per share, compared to $51 million, or $0.28 per share, in the prior year. In the quarter, the Company had a net benefit from certain items of $48 million or $0.28 per share, including a net positive tax adjustment of $0.18 per share and a gain on the repurchase of the Company's senior notes of $0.14 per share. Additionally, other items had an unfavorable impact of $0.04 per share. After adjusting for these items as disclosed in the attached financial tables, net income from continuing operations for the 2008 fourth quarter was $22 million or $0.12 per share.
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla., (January 29, 2009) AutoNation, Inc. (NYSE: AN),
Fourth quarter 2008 revenue totaled $2.7 billion, compared to $4.1 billion in the year-ago period, driven primarily by lower vehicle sales. In the fourth quarter, total U.S. industry new vehicle retail unit sales declined 49%, based on CNW Research data. In comparison, in the fourth quarter AutoNation's new vehicle unit sales declined 40%.
Commenting on the fourth quarter, Mike Jackson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, "The fourth quarter was negatively impacted by the credit panic triggered on September 15 by the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers. Automotive retail sales collapsed from one day to the next as credit for our customers was withdrawn from the market. This panic continued to erode consumer confidence and accelerated the decline in the U.S. economy and auto retail market. In the fourth quarter, AutoNation continued to remain profitable even with a U.S. SAAR near 10 million new vehicle units, a 27 year low." Jackson also stated, "When we saw the auto retail
 
market deteriorate in the beginning of 2008, AutoNation began to identify cost reduction opportunities. In July we announced our plan to reduce cost by $100 million on an annual run rate basis and have successfully achieved this goal  a significant accomplishment in its own right. With the collapse of sales in the second half of September, additional actions became necessary in the fourth quarter to further reduce costs. We have successfully implemented additional cost reduction actions totaling approximately $100 million on an annualized run rate basis. Taken together, AutoNation's total annualized cost savings of $200 million demonstrates our Company's ability to effectively address the challenges created by the credit panic."
Jackson added, "Despite the severely depressed sales environment, AutoNation continues to generate solid cash flow which allowed the Company to reduce its non-vehicle debt by $155 million during the quarter and close the fourth quarter with a strong cash position of $110 million. Full-year debt reduction totals approximately three-quarters of a billion dollars, consisting of $517 million of non-vehicle debt and $195 million of vehicle floor plan debt. As a result, the Company remained in compliance with all financial covenants in its debt agreements as of December 31, 2008 with a leverage ratio of 2.45 versus 2.78 a year ago."
Looking forward, Jackson also stated, "We agree with industry projections that the 2009 SAAR will be in the range of 11 million new vehicle units with obvious weakness in the first half of the year. In this environment we believe we will be able to manage within all financial covenants."
AutoNation provides additional detail on its three operating segments: Domestic, Import, and Premium Luxury. The Domestic segment is comprised of stores that sell vehicles manufactured by General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler; the Import segment is comprised of stores that sell vehicles manufactured primarily by Toyota, Honda, and Nissan; and the Premium Luxury segment is comprised of stores that sell vehicles manufactured primarily by Mercedes, BMW, and Lexus.
 
Segment Results for the Quarter
For the full year ended December 31, 2008, the Company reported net loss from continuing operations of $1.23 billion or $6.89 per share, compared to net income from continuing operations of $289 million or $1.44 per share in the prior year. After adjusting for the impairment charges and certain other items as disclosed in the attached financial tables, net income from continuing operations for the full year ended December 31, 2008 was $181 million or $1.02 per share, compared to $277 million or $1.38 per share in the prior year. The Company's revenue for the year ended December 31, 2008 totaled $14.1 billion, down 19% compared to $17.3 billion in the prior year.
Manufacturer Consent Agreements Relating to Largest Stockholder, ESL Investments, Inc.
The Company also announced that it has obtained consents under its framework agreements with manufacturers in order to eliminate any potentially adverse consequences under such agreements in the event that ESL Investments, Inc. (with its affiliates, "ESL"), the Company's largest
 
stockholder, were to acquire over 50% of the Company's common stock. ESL currently owns approximately 45% of the Company's outstanding common stock.
"ESL has been a long-term significant stockholder of the Company," said Mike Jackson. "We are pleased to have entered into the manufacturer consents that provide the flexibility for ESL to increase its economic stake in the Company without triggering any potentially adverse consequences under the framework agreements, while also providing for appropriate governance arrangements, including a commitment to maintain an independent Board of Directors. We appreciate ESL's belief in the Company and its management over the past nine years and look forward to ESL's continued involvement in helping us to build a great company and drive long-term stockholder value."
The consents contain various terms and conditions, including that should ESL's percentage ownership of Company common stock exceed 50%, ESL would vote its shares owned above 50% in the same proportion as shares unaffiliated with ESL are actually voted and that a majority of AutoNation's directors shall be independent of AutoNation and ESL. In addition, pursuant to a separate agreement between AutoNation and ESL (the "ESL Voting Agreement"), ESL agreed to further limit its vote to 45%, with shares owned by ESL in excess of 45% voted in the same proportion as shares unaffiliated with ESL are actually voted. The ESL Voting Agreement expires in one year, unless extended by mutual agreement of the parties. Additional details are included in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission today.

Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
     
2009 Incentive Plan Targets
     On February 11, 2009, the Executive Compensation Subcommittee (the "Subcommittee") of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Board") of AutoNation, Inc. (the "Company") (i) selected the 2009 participants under the AutoNation, Inc. Senior Executive Incentive Bonus Plan (the "Incentive Plan"), (ii) established specific objective annual performance goals for 2009 and (iii) set target awards for the 2009 participants in the Incentive Plan.
     The Subcommittee selected the following senior executive officers to participate in the Incentive Plan for 2009: Mike Jackson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Michael E. Maroone, President and Chief Operating Officer; Michael J. Short, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jonathan P. Ferrando, Executive Vice President, General Counsel & Secretary. The 2009 performance goals under the Incentive Plan that were established by the Subcommittee are based upon the achievement of specified levels of adjusted operating income per share (minus a net charge for capital deployed for acquisitions or share repurchases) and adjusted operating income as a percentage of gross profit for the Company during 2009. Bonus awards will be payable on a sliding scale based on the Company's actual achievement relative to the predetermined goals, with the possibility that bonuses earned may exceed or be less than the targeted level. The Subcommittee has absolute "negative discretion" to eliminate or reduce the amount of any award under the Incentive Plan.
     The 2009 performance goals established under the Incentive Plan also constitute the performance goals that have been established for bonus-eligible corporate employees of the Company to ensure that our management team is fully aligned to achieve improved operating performance for our existing business and to deploy capital effectively and profitably.
     
2009 Annual Stock Option and Restricted Stock Awards
     On February 11, 2009, the Subcommittee also approved annual stock option and restricted stock awards to our equity grant-eligible employees under the AutoNation, Inc. 2008 Employee Equity and Incentive Plan (the "2008 Plan"). The annual awards included stock option awards to our named executive officers, specifically, Mike Jackson (265,648 options), Michael E. Maroone (212,608 options), Michael J. Short (159,752 options), Jonathan P. Ferrando (159,752 options), and Kevin P. Westfall, Senior Vice President, Sales (15,968 options).
     Prior to 2009, the Subcommittee's practice had been to award stock options during our third fiscal quarter at meetings of the Subcommittee with an effective grant date after the public release of the Company's second-quarter earnings results. For 2009, the Subcommittee modified this practice by approving the annual stock option awards in February and granting the awards in four equal increments over the year. One-fourth (1/4) of each stock option award will be granted on the first trading day of each of March, June, September and December, with an exercise price equal to the closing price of our common stock on each such grant date,
 
subject to continuous employment through each such grant date. Accordingly, the exercise price for each grant will be based on the closing price of our common stock on a future date. The Subcommittee believes that this practice is fair and reasonable to the award recipients, the Company and its stockholders since it minimizes the impact that any particular event could have on the exercise price of stock options, particularly during times of market volatility.
     The Subcommittee adopted this practice for all stock option-eligible employees of the Company and awarded stock options to all stock option-eligible employees on the same terms (other than the number of options granted, which varies primarily by position and based on individual performance). Each of the four option grants comprising the annual award to our named executive officers and other employees in 2009 will vest annually in equal installments over four years commencing on June 1, 2010 and will expire on March 2, 2019 (subject to earlier termination in accordance with the terms of the 2008 Plan and applicable award agreements).
     In addition to the stock options described above, on February 11, 2009, the Subcommittee also awarded to Mr. Westfall 5,324 shares of restricted stock, all of which will be granted on the first trading day of March 2009. The shares of restricted stock will vest annually in equal installments over four years commencing on June 1, 2010. The Subcommittee also awarded shares of restricted stock to all restricted stock-eligible employees of the Company on the same terms (other than the number of restricted shares granted, which varies primarily by position and based on individual performance).
     Copies of each of our form of stock option agreement and form of restricted stock agreement to be entered into in connection with the grants described above are filed as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2 hereto and are incorporated herein by reference.

          America's largest automotive retailer, today reported 2009 first quarter net income from continuing operations of $49 million or $0.27 per share, compared to year-ago net income from continuing operations of $56 million or $0.31 per share. In the quarter, the Company had a net benefit from certain items of $9 million after-tax or $0.04 per share, including a gain on the purchase of the Company's senior notes and a net gain on asset sales and dispositions, partially offset by property impairments. After adjusting for these items as disclosed in the attached financial tables, net income from continuing operations for the 2009 first quarter was $40 million or $0.23 per share.
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (April 23, 2009) -AutoNation, Inc. (NYSE: AN),
          First quarter 2009 revenue totaled $2.5 billion, compared to $3.8 billion in the year-ago period, driven primarily by lower vehicle sales. In the first quarter, industry new vehicle U.S. retail sales declined approximately 46%, according to CNW Research. AutoNation new vehicle unit sales declined 43%.
          Commenting on the first quarter, Mike Jackson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, "We are very pleased with the performance of AutoNation as we remained solidly profitable during the first quarter even with a U.S. SAAR near 9 million new vehicle units, the lowest in nearly 30 years. Our operating discipline, the hard work of our associates and savings generated from our $200 million cost reduction program led to sequential improvement from the fourth quarter 2008."
 
          AutoNation has three operating segments: Domestic, Import, and Premium Luxury. The Domestic segment is comprised of stores that sell vehicles manufactured by General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler; the Import segment is comprised of stores that sell vehicles manufactured primarily by Toyota, Honda, and Nissan; and the Premium Luxury segment is comprised of stores that sell vehicles manufactured primarily by Mercedes, BMW, and Lexus.
          Jackson added, "During the first quarter AutoNation reduced debt by approximately $500 million, for a cumulative debt reduction of approximately $1.25 billion, including $635 million of non-vehicle debt, since January 1, 2008. As a result of these actions and our financial performance we remained in compliance with all of the financial covenants in our debt agreements and improved our leverage ratio to 2.35 as of March 31, 2009. Our liquidity remains strong as we ended the quarter with approximately $400 million of cash and revolver availability." Looking forward, Jackson also stated, "Although first quarter industry sales were lower than expectations, we agree with industry projections that sales rates will improve in the second half of this year."

Exhibit 99.1
Contact: Marc Cannon (954) 769-3146 Cannonm@autonation.com
     FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (May 14, 2009)  , America's largest automotive retailer, today announced that it will be closing seven Chrysler dealerships. As part of the dealer consolidation plan filed by Chrysler today in its bankruptcy, approximately 789 Chrysler dealerships will be closed nationwide. The AutoNation stores that will be closed by the consolidation plan represented only 1% of AutoNation's 2008 operating income. AutoNation does not believe that any one-time charges that may be associated with these actions will be material to its continuing operations or debt covenants.
AutoNation, Inc. (NYSE: AN)
     Commenting on the consolidation plan, Mike Jackson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, "We believe Chrysler's consolidation plan is a difficult but positive step forward for Chrysler and the automotive retail industry. Dealer consolidation is a necessary measure in today's automotive industry and will strengthen America's dealer network and improve dealer profitability over the long term."
     Mr. Jackson commented further, "The consolidation plan is consistent with AutoNation's long-term strategy that we implemented in 2000 to consolidate domestic dealerships and realign our brand mix more towards import and premium luxury franchises. With our financial and operational strength and diversified brand mix, we are well-positioned to succeed in the rapidly changing automotive retail landscape."

America's largest automotive retailer, today reported 2009 second quarter net income from continuing operations of $55 million or $0.31 per share, compared to year-ago net income from continuing operations of $56 million or $0.31 per share. After adjusting for certain items disclosed in the attached financial tables, net income from continuing operations for the 2009 second quarter was $51 million or $0.29 per share, compared to $59 million or $0.33 per share in the prior year.
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (July 31, 2009) AutoNation, Inc. (NYSE: AN),
Second quarter 2009 revenue totaled $2.6 billion, compared to $3.7 billion in the year-ago period. The decrease was driven primarily by lower new vehicle sales. In the second quarter, total U.S. industry retail new vehicle sales declined 40% compared to last year, based on CNW Research data. In comparison, in the second quarter AutoNation's new vehicle unit sales declined 38%.
Commenting on the second quarter, Mike Jackson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, "Despite extraordinarily difficult industry conditions, AutoNation delivered solid profitability, driven by cost reduction, lower interest expense, and our disciplined operating model and inventory management. The second quarter was a pivotal moment for the automotive industry. Long-awaited volume stabilization, the successful government-led restructuring of General Motors and Chrysler, and significant dealer consolidations were accomplished. The industry is now positioned for a healthy rebound when macroeconomic conditions, particularly consumer credit, improve." Mr. Jackson also noted, "Our continued disciplined inventories led to a year-over-year improvement in gross profit per vehicle retailed and lower floor plan expense."
 
Mike Jackson added, "The stabilization of the SAAR in the second quarter is the first step to a gradual recovery and marks the first time since the end of 2007 that we did not see a significant sequential decline in industry new vehicle sales. We also expect the Cash for Clunkers' program to stimulate new vehicle sales. Going forward, we expect a gradual improvement of new vehicle sales beginning in the second half of 2009 and intend to increase our inventory of vehicles in a disciplined manner to meet demand. Having weathered the storm, AutoNation remains in an excellent position to capitalize on dealer consolidation and the gradual recovery in industry volumes. We will continue to benefit from our $200 million structural cost reduction program."
At the end of the second quarter, AutoNation had nearly $450 million in liquidity, including cash of $129 million and remained well within the limits of the financial covenants in our debt agreements.
AutoNation has three operating segments: Domestic, Import, and Premium Luxury. The Domestic segment is comprised of stores that sell vehicles manufactured by General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler; the Import segment is comprised of stores that sell vehicles manufactured primarily by Toyota, Honda, and Nissan; and the Premium Luxury segment is comprised of stores that sell vehicles manufactured primarily by Mercedes, BMW, and Lexus.
 
For the six-month period ended June 30, 2009, the Company reported net income from continuing operations of $108 million or $0.61 per share compared to $111 million or $0.62 per share in the prior year. After adjusting for certain items as disclosed in the attached financial tables, net income from continuing operations for the six-month period ended June 30, 2009 was $91 million or $0.51 per share, compared to $114 million or $0.63 per share. The Company's revenue for the six-month period ended June 30, 2009 totaled $5.0 billion, down 32% compared to $7.4 billion in the prior year.

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On October 29, 2009, AutoNation, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing its results of operations for the quarter ended September 30, 2009. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
The information furnished pursuant to this Item 2.02, including Exhibit 99.1, shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") or otherwise subject to the liabilities under that Section and shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any filing of the Company under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.

America's largest automotive retailer, today reported net income from continuing operations of $65 million or $0.36 per share for the third quarter of 2009, compared to a net loss from continuing operations of $1.40 billion or $7.90 per share for the same period in 2008. In the third quarter of 2008, the Company recorded non-cash charges for goodwill and franchise impairments of $1.46 billion after-tax. Net income from continuing operations for the 2009 third quarter improved 44% on a per-share basis, as compared to adjusted net income from continuing operations of $44 million or $0.25 per share for last year's third quarter, which excludes the impairment charges and certain other items disclosed in the attached financial tables.
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla., (October 29, 2009) AutoNation, Inc. (NYSE: AN),
Commenting on the third quarter, Mike Jackson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer said, "AutoNation delivered solid profitability driven by margin recovery, cost reduction, lower interest expenses, a disciplined operating model and inventory management. Our third quarter profitability improved from third quarter 2008 despite substantially lower new vehicle industry volume compared to last year. Cash for Clunkers was a highly effective stimulus program that provided a much needed lift in auto sales and has set the stage going forward for a gradual recovery of new vehicle sales. The program aided our third quarter results by an estimated 7 cents per share."
 
Jackson also stated, "We expect that the automotive retail market will remain challenging throughout the remainder of 2009 with a gradual recovery beginning in 2010. We are optimistic for the long term prospects of the auto industry based on the successful restructuring of the domestic auto industry, the move to a demand pull system, and the rationalization of the dealer network. As the U.S. economy, consumer confidence and credit markets improve, we expect to be well-positioned to capitalize on these trends."
The Company's third quarter 2009 revenue totaled $2.9 billion, compared to $3.4 billion in the year-ago period, driven primarily by lower vehicle sales, in an environment where industry new vehicle sales remain at depression levels. AutoNation's new vehicle unit sales decline was in line with the industry's new vehicle retail sales decline, based on CNW Research Data.
AutoNation has three operating segments: Domestic, Import and Premium Luxury. The Domestic segment is comprised of stores that sell vehicles manufactured by General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler; the Import segment is comprised of stores that sell vehicles manufactured primarily by Toyota, Honda, and Nissan; and the Premium Luxury segment is comprised of stores that sell vehicles manufactured primarily by Mercedes, BMW, and Lexus.
Segment Results for the Quarter
 
 
 
Notably in the quarter, Domestic and Import segments were the biggest beneficiary of the Cash for Clunkers program, which was concentrated in smaller fuel efficient vehicles retailing for less than $45,000.
 
 
Additionally, the Company's Board of Directors has approved a 65% increase in capital expenditures to $150 million for 2010 and has authorized an additional $250 million for the repurchase of its common stock. The Company repurchased 3.7 million shares of common stock in the third quarter for an aggregate purchase price of $65.8 million (average purchase price per share of $17.81). AutoNation also recently announced the acquisition of Honda and Acura dealerships in its AppleWay market in Spokane, Washington, which the Company expects to complete before the end of the year. Commenting on the Board authorization, AutoNation Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Mike Jackson said, "Investing in our facilities, investing in our stores through process and technology, repurchasing shares, and making strategic acquisitions reflects the Board's and senior management's continued confidence in AutoNation's financial strength and focus on generating additional value for shareholders."
For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009, the Company reported net income from continuing operations of $172 million or $0.96 per share, compared to a net loss from continuing operations of $1.29 billion or $7.22 per share in the prior year. After adjusting for the impairment charges and certain items as disclosed in the attached financial tables, net income from continuing operations for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009, was $155 million or $0.87 per share, compared to $158 million or $0.88 per share last year. The Company's revenue for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009 totaled $7.9 billion, down 26% compared to $10.8 billion in the prior year.

As previously announced on a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 29, 2009 (the "January 2009 8-K") by AutoNation, Inc. (the "Company"), the Board of Directors of the Company approved a letter agreement with Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. ("Toyota," and such agreement, the "Toyota Agreement") in order to, among other things, eliminate any potential adverse consequences under Toyota's framework agreement with the Company in the event that ESL Investments, Inc. and certain investment affiliates of ESL Investments, Inc. (together, "ESL") acquires more than fifty percent (50%) of the Company's common stock. Pursuant to the Toyota Agreement, Toyota's consent (the "Consent") to ESL acquiring more than fifty percent (50%) of the Company's common stock terminates on December 31, 2009, solely with respect to ESL purchases of the Company's common stock after such date unless extended by Toyota at ESL's request. The Toyota Agreement also contains governance-related and other provisions as described in the January 2009 8-K.
At ESL's request, Toyota has granted a one-year extension of its Consent under the Toyota Agreement (such extension, the "Extension Agreement"), and the Company signed an acknowledgement to the Extension Agreement, which is dated November 23, 2009. Toyota's Consent under the Toyota Agreement will now terminate on December 31, 2010, with respect to purchases of the Company's common stock by ESL after such date, provided that ESL may continue to seek successive annual one-year extensions of Toyota's Consent, and Toyota shall not unreasonably withhold or delay its consent thereto. All other terms and conditions of the Toyota Agreement were unchanged. ESL currently owns approximately forty-six percent (46%) of the Company's common stock.
As discussed in the January 2009 8-K, the Company and ESL are also parties to: (i) a letter agreement with American Honda Motor Co., Inc. ("Honda," and such agreement the "Honda Agreement"), in which, among other things, Honda has agreed not to assert its right to purchase the Company's Honda and Acura franchises and/or similar remedies under Honda's framework agreement with the Company in the event that ESL acquires fifty percent (50%) or more of the Company's common stock; and (ii) an agreement (the "ESL Agreement") in which ESL has agreed to vote shares of the Company's common stock owned by ESL in excess of forty-five percent (45%) in the same proportion as all non-ESL-owned shares are voted. The Honda Agreement also contains governance-related and other provisions as described in the January 2009 8-K. The ESL Agreement expires on January 28, 2010, unless extended by mutual agreement by all parties.
The foregoing summaries of the Toyota Agreement, the Extension Agreement, the Honda Agreement and the ESL Agreement are qualified in their entirety by reference to such agreements. The Toyota Agreement, the Honda Agreement and the ESL Agreement were filed as exhibits to the January 2009 8-K and are incorporated by reference herein.

2010 Incentive Plan and AOP Plan Targets
On February 4, 2010, the Executive Compensation Subcommittee (the "Subcommittee") of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Board") of AutoNation, Inc. (the "Company") (i) selected the 2010 participants under the AutoNation, Inc. Senior Executive Incentive Bonus Plan (the "Incentive Plan") and the AutoNation Operating Performance Plan (the "AOP Plan"), (ii) established specific objective annual performance goals for 2010 under the Incentive Plan and the AOP Plan, and (iii) set target awards for the 2010 participants under the Incentive Plan and the AOP Plan.
The Subcommittee selected the following senior executive officers to participate in the Incentive Plan for 2010, each of whom will be identified as a named executive officer in the Company's 2010 annual meeting proxy statement: Mike Jackson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Michael E. Maroone, President and Chief Operating Officer; Michael J. Short, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jonathan P. Ferrando, Executive Vice President, General Counsel & Secretary (collectively, the "Senior Executive Officers").
The 2010 performance goals established by the Subcommittee under the Incentive Plan are based upon the achievement of specified levels of adjusted operating income per share (minus a net charge for capital deployed for acquisitions or share repurchases) and adjusted operating income as a percentage of gross profit for the Company during 2010. The target awards under the Incentive Plan are expressed as a percentage of base salary for each Senior Executive Officer that ranges from 75% to 133 1/3%.
The 2010 performance goals established under the Incentive Plan also constitute the performance goals that the Subcommittee established under the AOP Plan for other bonus-eligible, corporate-level employees, including Kevin P. Westfall, Senior Vice President, Sales, who will also be identified as a named executive officer in the Company's 2010 annual meeting proxy statement. The target awards under the AOP Plan are also expressed as a percentage of base salary, and Mr. Westfall's target award for 2010 is 45% of his base salary. The Senior Executive Officers do not participate in the AOP Plan.
Bonus awards under both the Incentive Plan and the AOP Plan will be payable on a sliding scale based on the Company's actual achievement relative to the predetermined goals, with the possibility that bonuses earned may exceed or be less than the targeted level. The Subcommittee has absolute "negative discretion" to eliminate or reduce the amount of any award under the Incentive Plan or the AOP Plan.
2010 Annual Stock Option and Restricted Stock Awards
On February 4, 2010, the Subcommittee also approved annual stock option and restricted stock awards to all of our equity grant-eligible employees under the AutoNation, Inc. 2008 Employee Equity and Incentive Plan (the "2008 Plan"). The annual awards included stock option awards to our Senior Executive Officers and Kevin P. Westfall, specifically, Mike Jackson  255,024 options, Michael E. Maroone  204,104 options, Michael J. Short  153,364 options, Jonathan P. Ferrando  153,364 options, and Kevin P. Westfall  15,332 options. Additionally, the annual awards included a restricted stock award to Mr. Westfall, who will receive 5,112 shares of restricted stock. The Senior Executive Officers did not receive restricted stock awards.
One-fourth (1/4) of each stock option award approved by the Subcommittee will be granted on the first trading day of each of March, June, September and December 2010, with an exercise price equal to the closing price of our common stock on each such grant date, subject to continuous employment through each such grant date. Each of the four option grants comprising an annual award will vest annually in equal installments over four years commencing on June 1, 2011 and will expire on March 1, 2020 (subject to earlier termination in accordance with the terms of the 2008 Plan and applicable award agreements). The restricted stock awards approved by the Subcommittee will be granted on the first trading day of March 2010 and will vest annually in equal installments over four years commencing on June 1, 2011.

America's largest automotive retailer, today reported 2009 fourth quarter GAAP net income from continuing operations of $62 million or $0.36 per share, compared to $73 million or $0.42 per share for the prior year. In the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company had a benefit from a tax adjustment of $13 million or $0.07 per share. In the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company had a net benefit of $51 million or $0.29 per share, related primarily to favorable tax items and gains on the repurchase of senior notes. After adjusting for these items as disclosed in the attached financial tables, adjusted net income from continuing operations for the 2009 fourth quarter was $50 million or $0.29 per share, compared to $23 million or $0.13 per share for the prior year, a 123% increase on a per-share basis.
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla., (February 11, 2010) AutoNation, Inc. (NYSE: AN),
Fourth quarter 2009 revenue totaled $2.8 billion, compared to $2.6 billion in the year-ago period, an 8% increase, driven primarily by stronger new vehicle unit sales which increased 7%. In the fourth quarter, total U.S. industry new vehicle retail unit sales increased 6%, based on CNW Research data.
Commenting on the fourth quarter, Mike Jackson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, "We delivered solid profitability in the fourth quarter, achieved our first year-over-year increase in new vehicle unit sales since the second quarter of 2005, and maintained the benefits of our actions taken in response to the economic downturn. By lowering our structural costs and debt levels and more efficiently managing our inventory, we were able to deliver solid EPS growth in a very difficult environment."
AutoNation has three operating segments: Domestic, Import, and Premium Luxury. The Domestic segment is comprised of stores that sell vehicles manufactured by General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler; the Import segment is comprised of stores that sell vehicles manufactured primarily by Toyota, Honda, and Nissan; and the Premium Luxury segment is comprised of stores that sell vehicles manufactured primarily by Mercedes, BMW, and Lexus. Segment results for the fourth quarter were as follows:
 
 
 
(1) Segment income is defined as operating income less floorplan interest expense.
For the full year ended December 31, 2009, the Company reported GAAP net income from continuing operations of $234 million or $1.32 per share, compared to a GAAP net loss from continuing operations of $1.2 billion or $6.82 per share for the prior year. After adjusting for certain items (including the goodwill and franchise rights impairment charges recorded in the prior year) as disclosed in the attached financial tables, adjusted net income from continuing operations for the full year ended December 31, 2009 was $204 million or $1.15 per share, compared to $180 million or $1.01 per share for the prior year. The Company's revenue for the full year ended December 31, 2009 totaled $10.8 billion, down 20% compared to $13.4 billion in the prior year.
Jackson also stated, "We responded to the dramatic decline in industry volumes, the Chrysler and GM bankruptcies, the credit crisis and staggering unemployment and delivered a full-year adjusted EPS increase of 14%. We are optimistic for the long-term prospects of the auto industry based on the successful restructuring of the domestic auto industry, the move to a demand-pull system and the rationalization of the dealer network. We agree with the view that volumes will be higher this year. Our planning assumption for 2010 industry new unit sales is 11.5 million units with a gradual increase in the selling rate over the course of the year."

FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (March 31, 2010) (NYSE: AN), America's largest automotive retailer, today announced estimated financial results for the first quarter of 2010 and its intention to amend and extend its term loan and revolving credit facility.
AutoNation, Inc.
First Quarter 2010
Based on preliminary information, the Company currently expects first quarter 2010 earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations to be in the range of $0.29 to $0.32, compared to adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $0.22 for the first quarter of 2009. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2009 excludes the items detailed under "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $0.30 for the first quarter of 2009.
The Company expects first quarter 2010 revenue to be approximately $2.8 billion, compared to $2.4 billion for the first quarter of 2009. The Company also expects new vehicle sales to be approximately 45,000 units, or up approximately 18% as compared to the same period in 2009, and used vehicle sales to be approximately 38,000 units, or up approximately 12% as compared to the same period in 2009.
"We are pleased with our performance in a recovering but historically weak auto retail market. We saw a continuation of the gradual industry recovery in the first quarter of 2010," said Mike Jackson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of AutoNation.
Amendment to Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility
The Company is currently seeking consents from its existing lenders to amend and extend its term loan and revolving credit facility, which is scheduled to expire on July 18, 2012. Pursuant to the amendment, the maturity date will be extended to July 18, 2014 for those lenders that commit to the extension. For the extended commitments, the amended credit facility will offer a new leverage-based pricing grid and an increase in the interest rate on borrowings generally from LIBOR plus 0.875% to LIBOR plus 2.25%. The size of the term loan facility is expected to be reduced from $600 million to approximately $520 million, and the size of the revolving credit facility is expected to be reduced from $700 million to approximately $616 million. The financial covenants contained in the existing credit facility are also expected to be amended in certain respects, including an increase in the maximum leverage ratio from 2.75x to 3.25x. The Company expects the credit facility amendment and extension to be completed on or about April 14, 2010, subject to required lender consents and other standard conditions. A majority consent is required to amend the existing credit facility, and the lead and other lenders under the existing credit facility, representing more than 50%, have already committed to provide their consents to the amendment.
The amendment and extension of the credit facility, together with the senior note offering and debt tender offers announced today, are anticipated to be dilutive to full year 2010 adjusted EPS by approximately $0.06, excluding the effect of non-recurring transaction expenses and any share repurchases or other uses of capital in 2010.
"When completed, the transactions announced today will significantly enhance our financial strength and flexibility by extending our debt maturities, increasing our available liquidity, lowering our exposure to interest rate increases and providing additional flexibility to manage our business and optimize capital allocation," said Mr. Jackson.
AutoNation will release financial results for the first quarter of 2010 on Thursday, April 22, 2010 at approximately 7:00 a.m. Eastern Time. Mike Jackson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mike Maroone, President and Chief Operating Officer, and Mike Short, Chief Financial Officer, will discuss these results during a conference call and audio webcast that same day at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time.

Contribution
(a) If the indemnification provided for in Section 8 is for any reason unavailable to or otherwise insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount paid or payable by such indemnified party, as incurred, as a result of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions or inaccuracies in the representations and warranties herein which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the Guarantors, and the total underwriting discount received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the front cover page of the Prospectus bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of the Securities as set forth on such cover. The relative fault of the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact or any such inaccurate or alleged inaccurate representation or warranty relates to information supplied by the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, or the Underwriters, on the other hand, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
 
The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 8(c), any legal or other fees or disbursements reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim.
The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 9 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 9.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 9, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the underwriting commissions received by such Underwriter in connection with the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 9 are several, and not joint, in proportion to their respective underwriting commitments as set forth opposite their names in . For purposes of this Section 9, each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Company or a Guarantor, each officer of the Company or a Guarantor who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company or a Guarantor within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company and the Guarantors.

(a) If, on the Closing Date, any one or more of the several Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Securities that it or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on such date, and the aggregate principal amount of Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase does not exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities to be purchased on such date, the other Underwriters shall be obligated, severally, in the proportions that the principal amount of Securities to be purchased set forth opposite their respective names on bears to the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as may be specified by the Representatives with the consent of the non-defaulting Underwriters, to purchase the Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date. If, on the Closing Date, any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Securities and the principal amount of Securities with respect to which such default occurs exceeds 10% of the principal amount of Securities to be purchased on such date, and arrangements satisfactory to the Representatives and the Company for the purchase of such Securities are not made within 48 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability of any party to any other party except that the provisions of Section 5, Section 7, Section 8, Section 9, Section 13 and Section 17 shall at all times be effective and shall survive such termination. In any such case either the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days in order that the required changes, if any, to the Registration Statement, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus or any other documents or arrangements may be effected. As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" shall be deemed to include any person substituted for a defaulting Underwriter under this Section 10.

Any termination pursuant to this Section 11 shall be without liability on the part of (a) the Company or any Guarantor to any Underwriter, except that the Company shall be obligated to reimburse the expenses of the Representatives and the Underwriters pursuant to Sections 5, 7, 8 and 9 hereof or (b) any Underwriter to the Company.

This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings (whether written or oral) between the Company, the Guarantors and the several Underwriters, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof.

Offering of 6.75% Senior Notes due 2018
On April 14, 2010, AutoNation, Inc. (the "Company") completed its registered public offering of $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.75% Senior Notes due 2018 (the "2018 Notes") at a public offering price of 98.488% of the aggregate principal amount. The Company entered into the following agreements governing the terms of the 2018 Notes: (1) the indenture, dated as of April 14, 2010 (the "2018 Base Indenture"), among the Company, the guarantors named therein (the "Guarantors"), and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, a national banking association, as trustee (the "Trustee"), and (2) the supplemental indenture, dated as of April 14, 2010 (the "2018 Supplemental Indenture," and together with the 2018 Base Indenture, the "Indenture"), among the Company, the Guarantors and the Trustee. The 2018 Notes mature on April 15, 2018 and bear interest at a rate equal to 6.75% per annum, payable semiannually in arrears on April 15 and October 15, beginning on October 15, 2010. The 2018 Notes are jointly and severally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by substantially all of the Company's subsidiaries. The 2018 Notes rank equal in right of payment to the Company's current and future senior unsecured debt and senior in right of payment to any existing and future subordinated debt. The 2018 Notes are effectively subordinated in right of payment to the Company's current and future secured debt, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt, and to any future indebtedness of the Company's non-guarantor subsidiaries. The Indenture contains certain restrictive covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of the Company to incur liens, enter into sale and leaseback transactions and merge, consolidate, or transfer all or substantially all of its assets.
Cash Tender Offers for Old Notes
On April 14, 2010, the Company used a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of the 2018 Notes to pay the total consideration for the Floating Rate Notes due 2013 (the "Floating Rate Notes") and the 7% Senior Notes due 2014 (the "Fixed Rate Notes" and, together with the Floating Rate Notes, the "Old Notes") that were validly tendered and not validly withdrawn prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on April 13, 2010 (the "Consent Deadline"), pursuant to the Company's previously announced cash tender offers to purchase any and all of its outstanding Old Notes. As of the Consent Deadline, the Company received tenders and consents for approximately $145.5 million aggregate principal amount of Floating Rate Notes, representing 99.6% of the approximately $146.1 million aggregate principal amount of the Floating Rate Notes previously outstanding, and approximately $117.8 million aggregate principal amount of Fixed Rate Notes, representing 88.8% of the approximately $132.6 million aggregate principal amount of the Fixed Rate Notes previously outstanding. The total amount paid, approximately $273.8 million, represented the total consideration for the Old Notes (including the consent payments) plus accrued and unpaid interest.
On April 14, 2010, after receiving consents from the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of each series of the outstanding Old Notes, the Company also entered into a supplemental indenture (the "Old Notes Supplemental Indenture") to the indenture, dated as of April 12, 2006 (the "Old Notes Indenture"), among the Company, the subsidiary guarantors named therein and the Trustee. The Old Notes Supplemental Indenture amends the Old Notes Indenture, effective April 14, 2010, to (1) eliminate substantially all of the restrictive covenants
and certain events of default, (2) reduce the notice period required for an optional redemption of the Old Notes, and (3) make other related amendments.
The tender offers and consent solicitations remain open and are scheduled to expire at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on Tuesday, April 27, 2010 (the "Expiration Time"), unless extended or earlier terminated by the Company. This Current Report on Form 8-K (this "Form 8-K") shall not constitute an offer to purchase or a solicitation of an offer to sell the Old Notes. The cash tender offers are being made only pursuant to the offer to purchase and consent solicitation statement, letter of transmittal and consent, and related materials that were previously distributed to the holders of the Old Notes.
Amendment to Credit Agreement
On April 14, 2010, AutoNation entered into an amendment to the credit agreement (as amended, the "Amended Credit Agreement") governing its term loan and revolving credit facilities. Pursuant to such amendment, the maturity date for $479.4 million of term loan borrowings and $581.6 million of revolving credit commitments was extended from July 18, 2012 to July 18, 2014. The maturity date for $54.0 million of term loan borrowings and $57.0 million of revolving credit commitments, relating to lenders that did not consent to the extension, remains July 18, 2012. The size of the term loan facility was reduced from $600 million to $533.4 million, and the size of the revolving credit facility was reduced from $700 million to $638.6 million. The amendment also modified certain financial covenants, including an increase in the maximum leverage ratio from 2.75x to 3.25x and a decrease in the maximum capitalization ratio from 65% to 60%. In calculating the capitalization ratio, AutoNation is now permitted to exclude goodwill, franchise rights and long-lived asset impairments subsequent to 2007.
The 2018 Base Indenture is being filed as Exhibit 4.1, the 2018 Supplemental Indenture is being filed as Exhibit 4.2, the Old Notes Supplemental Indenture is being filed as Exhibit 4.3, and the Amended Credit Agreement is being filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Form 8-K, and each is incorporated by reference herein. The descriptions of the provisions of the 2018 Base Indenture, the 2018 Supplemental Indenture, the Old Notes Supplemental Indenture and the Amended Credit Agreement are summary in nature and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the provisions of the definitive agreements.
The agreements included with this 8-K (including the exhibits to such agreements), which are being filed to provide investors with information regarding their terms, contain various representations, warranties and covenants of the Company and the other parties thereto. They are not intended to provide any factual information about any of the parties thereto or any subsidiaries of the parties thereto. The assertions embodied in those representations, warranties and covenants were made for purposes of each of the agreements, solely for the benefit of the parties thereto.
In addition, certain representations and warranties were made as of a specific date, may be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from what a stockholder might view as material, or may have been made for purposes of allocating contractual risk among the parties rather than establishing matters as facts. The representations, warranties or covenants in the agreements (or any description thereof) should not be viewed as disclosures with respect to the actual state of facts concerning the business, operations or condition of any of the parties to the agreements (or their subsidiaries) and should not rely on them as such. In addition, information in any such representations, warranties or covenants may change after the dates covered by such provisions, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in the public disclosures of the parties. In any event, investors should read the agreements together with the other information concerning the Company and its subsidiaries contained in reports and statements that the Company files with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
The disclosure required by this Item is included in Item 1.01 of this Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein.
 
On April 14, 2010, the Company issued a press release regarding the transactions described in Item 1.01 of this Form 8-K. A copy of the press release is being filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein.

If Securities shall at any time be authenticated and delivered in any new name of a Successor Company pursuant to this Section 3.06 in exchange or substitution for or upon registration of transfer of any Securities, such Successor Company, at the option of the Holders but without expense to them, shall provide for the exchange of all Securities at the time Outstanding for Securities authenticated and delivered in such new name.
(j) Each Holder of a Security agrees to indemnify the Company and the Trustee against any liability that may result from the transfer, exchange or assignment of such Holder's Security in violation of any provision of this Indenture and/or applicable United States federal or state securities laws.
(k) The Trustee shall have no obligation or duty to monitor, determine or inquire as to compliance with any restrictions on transfer imposed under this Indenture or under applicable law with respect to any transfer of any interest in any Security other than to require delivery of such certificates and other documentation or evidence as are expressly required by, and to do so if and when expressly required by the terms of, this Indenture, and to examine the same to determine substantial compliance as to form with the express requirements hereof.
(l) Neither the Trustee nor any agent of the Trustee shall have any responsibility for any actions taken or not taken by the Depositary.
Section 3.07 .
Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Securities
(a) If (i) any mutilated Security is surrendered to the Trustee at its Corporate Trust Office or (ii) the Company and the Trustee receive evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Security, and there is delivered to the Company and the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to them to save each of them and any Paying Agent harmless, and neither the Company nor the Trustee receives notice that such Security has been acquired by a protected purchaser, then the Company shall execute and upon Company Order the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in exchange for or in lieu of any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security, a new Security of the same series and of like tenor, form, terms and principal amount, bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding, that neither gain nor loss in interest shall result from such exchange or substitution. In every case the applicant for a replacement Security shall furnish the Company and the Trustee such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them harmless.
 
(b) In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security, pay the amount due on such Security in accordance with its terms.
(c) Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in respect thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith.
(d) Every new Security of any series issued pursuant to this Section shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities of that series duly issued hereunder.
(e) The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities.
Section 3.08 .
Payment of Interest; Interest Rights Preserved
(a) Interest on any Security that is payable and is punctually paid or duly provided for on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the Person in whose name such Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Record Date for such interest notwithstanding the cancellation of such Security upon any transfer or exchange subsequent to the Record Date. Payment of interest on Securities shall be made at the Corporate Trust Office (except as otherwise specified pursuant to Section 3.01) or, at the option of the Company, by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the Register or, in accordance with arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee, by wire transfer to an account designated by the Holder.
(b) Any interest on any Security that is payable but is not punctually paid or duly provided for on any Interest Payment Date (herein called "Defaulted Interest") shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on the relevant Record Date by virtue of his, her or its having been such a Holder, and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company, at its election in each case, as provided in clause (i) or (ii) below:
(i) The Company may elect to make payment of any Defaulted Interest to the Persons in whose names such Securities (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on a special record date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest (a "Special Record Date"), which shall be fixed in the following manner. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each such Security and the date of the proposed payment, and at the same time the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this clause provided. Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall be not more than 15 calendar days and not less than 10 calendar days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 calendar days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of such Special Record Date and, in the name and at the expense of the Company, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to the Holders of such Securities at their addresses as they appear in the Register, not less than 10 calendar days prior to such Special Record Date. Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor having been mailed as aforesaid, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names such Securities (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on such Special Record Date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the following clause (ii).
 
(ii) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest on Securities in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which such Securities may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this clause, such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee.
(c) Subject to the provisions set forth herein relating to Record Dates, each Security delivered pursuant to any provision of this Indenture in exchange or substitution for, or upon registration of transfer of, any other Security shall carry all the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Security.
Section 3.09 . Unless otherwise specified pursuant to Section 3.01 for Securities of any series, all Securities surrendered for payment, redemption, registration of transfer or exchange or credit against any sinking fund or otherwise shall, if surrendered to any Person other than the Trustee, be delivered to the Trustee for cancellation and shall be promptly canceled by it and, if surrendered to the Trustee, shall be promptly canceled by it. The Company may at any time deliver to the Trustee for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated and delivered hereunder that the Company may have acquired in any manner whatsoever, and all Securities so delivered shall be promptly canceled by the Trustee. No Securities shall be authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any Securities canceled as provided in this Section, except as expressly permitted by this Indenture. The Trustee shall dispose of all canceled Securities held by it in accordance with its then customary procedures and , at the expense and written direction of the Company, deliver a certificate of such disposal to the Company upon its request therefor. The acquisition of any Securities by the Company shall not operate as a redemption or satisfaction of the Indebtedness represented thereby unless and until such Securities are surrendered to the Trustee for cancellation.
Cancellation
Section 3.10 . Except as otherwise specified pursuant to Section 3.01 for Securities of any series, interest on the Securities of each series shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.
Computation of Interest
Section 3.11 .
Currency of Payments in Respect of Securities
(a) Except as otherwise specified pursuant to Section 3.01 for Securities of any series, payment of the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on Securities of such series will be made in U.S. Dollars.
(b) For purposes of any provision of the Indenture where the Holders of Outstanding Securities may perform an action that requires that a specified percentage of the Outstanding Securities of all series perform such action and for purposes of any decision or determination by the Trustee of amounts due and unpaid for the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on the Securities of all series in respect of which moneys are to be disbursed ratably, the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on the Outstanding Securities denominated in a Foreign Currency will be the amount in U.S. Dollars based upon exchange rates, determined as specified pursuant to Section 3.01 for Securities of such series, as of the date for determining whether the Holders entitled to perform such action have performed it or as of the date of such decision or determination by the Trustee, as the case may be.
(c) Any decision or determination to be made regarding exchange rates shall be made by an agent appointed by the Company; provided, that such agent shall accept such appointment in writing and the terms of such appointment shall, in the opinion of the Company at the time of such appointment, require such agent to make such determination by a method consistent with the method provided pursuant to Section 3.01 for the making of such decision or determination. All decisions and determinations of such agent regarding exchange rates shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive for all purposes and irrevocably binding upon the Company, the Trustee and all Holders of the Securities.
 
Section 3.12 . The Company may provide pursuant to Section 3.01 for Securities of any series that (a) the obligation, if any, of the Company to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Securities of any series in a Foreign Currency or U.S. Dollars (the "Designated Currency") as may be specified pursuant to Section 3.01 is of the essence and agrees that, to the fullest extent possible under applicable law, judgments in respect of such Securities shall be given in the Designated Currency; (b) the obligation of the Company to make payments in the Designated Currency of the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on such Securities shall, notwithstanding any payment in any other Currency (whether pursuant to a judgment or otherwise), be discharged only to the extent of the amount in the Designated Currency that the Holder receiving such payment may, in accordance with normal banking procedures, purchase with the sum paid in such other Currency (after any premium and cost of exchange) on the business day in the country of issue of the Designated Currency or in the international banking community (in the case of a composite currency) immediately following the day on which such Holder receives such payment; (c) if the amount in the Designated Currency that may be so purchased for any reason falls short of the amount originally due, the Company shall pay such additional amounts as may be necessary to compensate for such shortfall; and (d) any obligation of the Company not discharged by such payment shall be due as a separate and independent obligation and, until discharged as provided herein, shall continue in full force and effect.
Judgments
Section 3.13 . The Company in issuing any Securities may use CUSIP, ISIN or other similar numbers, if then generally in use, and thereafter with respect to such series, the Trustee may use such numbers in any notice of redemption or exchange with respect to such series provided that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any notice of a redemption and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Securities, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. The Company will promptly notify the Trustee in writing of any change in the CUSIP, ISIN or other similar numbers.
CUSIP Numbers
Section 4.01 . Redemption of Securities (other than pursuant to a sinking fund, amortization or analogous provision) permitted by the terms of any series of Securities shall be made (except as otherwise specified pursuant to Section 3.01 for Securities of any series) in accordance with this Article; provided, however, that if any such terms of a series of Securities shall conflict with any provision of this Article, the terms of such series shall govern.
Applicability of Right of Redemption
Section 4.02 .
Selection of Securities to be Redeemed
(a) If the Company shall at any time elect to redeem all or any portion of the Securities of a series then Outstanding, it shall at least 45 days prior to the Redemption Date fixed by the Company (unless a shorter period shall be satisfactory to the Trustee) notify the Trustee of such Redemption Date and of the principal amount of Securities to be redeemed, and thereupon the Trustee shall select, by lot or in such other manner as the Trustee shall deem appropriate and which may provide for the selection for redemption of a portion of the principal amount of any Security of such series; provided that the unredeemed portion of the principal amount of any Security shall be in an authorized denomination (which shall not be less than the minimum authorized denomination) for such Security. In any case where more than one Security of such series is registered in the same name, the Trustee may treat the aggregate principal amount so registered as if it were represented by one Security of such series. The Trustee shall, as soon as practicable, notify the Company in writing of the Securities and portions of Securities so selected.
(b) For all purposes of this Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of Securities shall relate, in the case of any Security redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the principal amount of such Security that has been or is to be redeemed. If the Company shall so direct, Securities registered in the name of the Company, any Affiliate or any Subsidiary thereof shall not be included in the Securities selected for redemption.
 
Section 4.03 .
Notice of Redemption
(a) Notice of redemption shall be given by the Company or, at the Company's written request, by the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Company, not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date, to the Holders of Securities of any series to be redeemed in whole or in part pursuant to this Article, in the manner provided in Section 16.04. Any notice so given shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the Holder receives such notice. Failure to give such notice, or any defect in such notice to the Holder of any Security of a series designated for redemption, in whole or in part, shall not affect the sufficiency of any notice of redemption with respect to the Holder of any other Security of such series.
(b) All notices of redemption shall identify the Securities to be redeemed (including CUSIP, ISIN or other similar numbers, if available) and shall state:
(i) such election by the Company to redeem Securities of such series pursuant to provisions contained in this Indenture or the terms of the Securities of such series or a supplemental indenture establishing such series, if such be the case;
(ii) the Redemption Date;
(iii) the Redemption Price;
(iv) if less than all Outstanding Securities of any series are to be redeemed, the identification (and, in the case of partial redemption, the principal amounts) of the Securities of such series to be redeemed;
(v) that on the Redemption Date the Redemption Price will become due and payable upon each such Security to be redeemed, and that, if applicable, interest thereon shall cease to accrue on and after said date;
(vi) the Place or Places of Payment where such Securities are to be surrendered for payment of the Redemption Price; and
(vii) that the redemption is for a sinking fund, if such is the case.
Section 4.04 . On or prior to 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Redemption Date for any Securities, the Company shall deposit with the Trustee or with a Paying Agent (or, if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 6.03) an amount of money in the Currency in which such Securities are denominated (except as provided pursuant to Section 3.01) sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of such Securities or any portions thereof that are to be redeemed on that date.
Deposit of Redemption Price
Section 4.05 . Notice of redemption having been given as aforesaid, any Securities so to be redeemed shall, on the Redemption Date, become due and payable at the Redemption Price and from and after such date (unless the Company shall Default in the payment of the Redemption Price) such Securities shall cease to bear interest. Upon surrender of any such Security for redemption in accordance with said notice, such Security shall be paid by the Company at the Redemption Price; provided, however, that (unless otherwise provided pursuant to Section 3.01) installments of interest that have a Stated Maturity on or prior to the Redemption Date for such Securities shall be payable according to the terms of such Securities and the provisions of Section 3.08.
Securities Payable on Redemption Date
If any Security called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, the principal thereof and premium, if any, thereon shall, until paid, bear interest from the Redemption Date at the rate prescribed therefor in the Security.
Section 4.06 . Any Security that is to be redeemed only in part shall be surrendered at the Corporate Trust Office or such other office or agency of the Company as is specified pursuant to Section 3.01 with, if the Company, the Registrar or the Trustee so requires, due endorsement by, or a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company, the Registrar and the Trustee duly executed by the Holder thereof or his, her or its attorney duly authorized in writing, and the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of such Security without service charge, a new Security or Securities of the same series, of like tenor and form, of any authorized denomination as requested by such Holder in aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the principal of the Security so surrendered; except that if a Global Security is so surrendered, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Depositary for such Global Security, without service charge, a new Global Security in a denomination equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the principal of the Global Security so surrendered. In the case of a Security providing appropriate space for such notation, at the option of the Holder thereof, the Trustee, in lieu of delivering a new Security or Securities as aforesaid, may make a notation on such Security of the payment of the redeemed portion thereof.
Securities Redeemed in Part
 
Section 5.01 .
Applicability of Sinking Fund
(a) Redemption of Securities permitted or required pursuant to a sinking fund for the retirement of Securities of a series by the terms of such series of Securities shall be made in accordance with such terms of such series of Securities and this Article, except as otherwise specified pursuant to Section 3.01 for Securities of such series, provided, however, that if any such terms of a series of Securities shall conflict with any provision of this Article, the terms of such series shall govern.
(b) The minimum amount of any sinking fund payment provided for by the terms of Securities of any series is herein referred to as a "Mandatory Sinking Fund Payment," and any payment in excess of such minimum amount provided for by the terms of Securities of any series is herein referred to as an "Optional Sinking Fund Payment." If provided for by the terms of Securities of any series, the cash amount of any Mandatory Sinking Fund Payment may be subject to reduction as provided in Section 5.02.
Section 5.02 . The Company may, at its option, satisfy any Mandatory Sinking Fund Payment obligation, in whole or in part, with respect to a particular series of Securities by (a) delivering to the Trustee Securities of such series in transferable form theretofore purchased or otherwise acquired by the Company or redeemed at the election of the Company pursuant to Section 4.03 or (b) receiving credit for Securities of such series (not previously so credited) acquired by the Company and theretofore delivered to the Trustee. The Trustee shall credit such Mandatory Sinking Fund Payment obligation with an amount equal to the Redemption Price specified in such Securities for redemption through operation of the sinking fund and the amount of such Mandatory Sinking Fund Payment shall be reduced accordingly. If the Company shall elect to so satisfy any Mandatory Sinking Fund Payment obligation, it shall deliver to the Trustee not less than 45 days prior to the relevant sinking fund payment date a written notice signed on behalf of the Company by its Chairman of the Board of Directors, its President, one of its Vice Presidents, its Treasurer or one of its Assistant Treasurers, which shall designate the Securities (and portions thereof, if any) so delivered or credited and which shall be accompanied by such Securities (to the extent not theretofore delivered) in transferable form. In case of the failure of the Company, at or before the time so required, to give such notice and deliver such Securities the Mandatory Sinking Fund Payment obligation shall be paid entirely in moneys.
Mandatory Sinking Fund Obligation
Section 5.03 . In addition to the sinking fund requirements of Section 5.02, to the extent, if any, provided for by the terms of a particular series of Securities, the Company may, at its option, make an Optional Sinking Fund Payment with respect to such Securities. Unless otherwise provided by such terms, (a) to the extent that the right of the Company to make such Optional Sinking Fund Payment shall not be exercised in any year, it shall not be cumulative or carried forward to any subsequent year, and (b) such optional payment shall operate to reduce the amount of any Mandatory Sinking Fund Payment obligation as to Securities of the same series. If the Company intends to exercise its right to make such optional payment in any year it shall deliver to the Trustee not less than 45 days prior to the relevant sinking fund payment date a certificate signed by its Chairman of the Board of Directors, its President, one of its Vice Presidents, its Treasurer or one of its Assistant Treasurers stating that the Company will exercise such optional right, and specifying the amount which the Company will pay on or before the next succeeding sinking fund payment date. Such certificate shall also state that no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.
Optional Redemption at Sinking Fund Redemption Price
 
Section 5.04 .
Application of Sinking Fund Payment
(a) If the sinking fund payment or payments made in funds pursuant to either Section 5.02 or 5.03 with respect to a particular series of Securities plus any unused balance of any preceding sinking fund payments made in funds with respect to such series shall exceed $50,000 (or a lesser sum if the Company shall so request, or such equivalent sum for Securities denominated other than in U.S. Dollars), it shall be applied by the Trustee on the sinking fund payment date next following the date of such payment, unless the date of such payment shall be a sinking fund payment date, in which case such payment shall be applied on such sinking fund payment date, to the redemption of Securities of such series at the redemption price specified pursuant to Section 4.03(b). The Trustee shall select, in the manner provided in Section 4.02, for redemption on such sinking fund payment date, a sufficient principal amount of Securities of such series to absorb said funds, as nearly as may be, and shall, at the expense and in the name of the Company, thereupon cause notice of redemption of the Securities to be given in substantially the manner provided in Section 4.03(a) for the redemption of Securities in part at the option of the Company, except that the notice of redemption shall also state that the Securities are being redeemed for the sinking fund. Any sinking fund moneys not so applied by the Trustee to the redemption of Securities of such series shall be added to the next sinking fund payment received in funds by the Trustee and, together with such payment, shall be applied in accordance with the provisions of this Section 5.04. Any and all sinking fund moneys held by the Trustee on the last sinking fund payment date with respect to Securities of such series, and not held for the payment or redemption of particular Securities of such series, shall be applied by the Trustee to the payment of the principal of the Securities of such series at Maturity.
(b) On or prior to each sinking fund payment date, the Company shall pay to the Trustee a sum equal to all interest accrued to but not including the date fixed for redemption on Securities to be redeemed on such sinking fund payment date pursuant to this Section 5.04.
(c) The Trustee shall not redeem any Securities of a series with sinking fund moneys or mail any notice of redemption of Securities of such series by operation of the sinking fund during the continuance of a Default in payment of interest on any Securities of such series or of any Event of Default (other than an Event of Default occurring as a consequence of this paragraph) of which the Trustee has actual knowledge, except that if the notice of redemption of any Securities of such series shall theretofore have been mailed in accordance with the provisions hereof, the Trustee shall redeem such Securities if funds sufficient for that purpose shall be deposited with the Trustee in accordance with the terms of this Article. Except as aforesaid, any moneys in the sinking fund at the time any such Default or Event of Default shall occur and any moneys thereafter paid into the sinking fund shall, during the continuance of such Default or Event of Default, be held as security for the payment of all the Securities of such series; provided, however, that in case such Default or Event of Default shall have been cured or waived as provided herein, such moneys shall thereafter be applied on the next sinking fund payment date on which such moneys are required to be applied pursuant to the provisions of this Section 5.04.
The Company hereby covenants and agrees as follows:
Section 6.01 . The Company will duly and punctually pay the principal of and premium, if any, on each series of Securities, and the interest which shall have accrued thereon, at the dates and place and in the manner provided in the Securities and in this Indenture.
Payments of Securities
Section 6.02 .
Paying Agent
(a) The Company will maintain in each Place of Payment for any series of Securities, if any, an office or agency where Securities may be presented or surrendered for payment, where Securities of such series may be surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange and where notices and demands to or upon the Company in respect of the Securities and this Indenture may be served (the "Paying Agent"). The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of the location, and any change in the location, of such office or agency. If at any time the Company shall fail to maintain any such required office or agency or shall fail to furnish the Trustee with the address thereof, such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands may be made or served at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, and the Company hereby appoints the Trustee as Paying Agent to receive all presentations, surrenders, notices and demands.
 
(b) The Company may also from time to time designate different or additional offices or agencies where the Securities of any series may be presented or surrendered for any or all such purposes (in or outside of such Place of Payment), and may from time to time rescind any such designations; provided, however, that no such designation or rescission shall in any manner relieve the Company of its obligations described in the preceding paragraph. The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any such additional designation or rescission of designation and of any change in the location of any such different or additional office or agency. The Company shall enter into an appropriate agency agreement with any Paying Agent not a party to this Indenture. The agreement shall implement the provisions of this Indenture that relate to such agent. The Company shall notify the Trustee of the name and address of each such agent. The Company or any Affiliate thereof may act as Paying Agent.
Section 6.03 .
To Hold Payment in Trust
(a) If the Company or an Affiliate thereof shall at any time act as Paying Agent with respect to any series of Securities, then, on or before the date on which the principal of and premium, if any, or interest on any of the Securities of that series by their terms or as a result of the calling thereof for redemption shall become payable, the Company or such Affiliate will segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the Holders of such Securities or the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay such principal and premium, if any, or interest which shall have so become payable until such sums shall be paid to such Holders or otherwise disposed of as herein provided, and will notify the Trustee of its action or failure to act in that regard. Upon any proceeding under any federal bankruptcy laws with respect to the Company or any Affiliate thereof, if the Company or such Affiliate is then acting as Paying Agent, the Trustee shall replace the Company or such Affiliate as Paying Agent.
(b) If the Company shall appoint, and at the time have, a Paying Agent for the payment of the principal of and premium, if any, or interest on any series of Securities, then prior to 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the date on which the principal of and premium, if any, or interest on any of the Securities of that series shall become payable as aforesaid, whether by their terms or as a result of the calling thereof for redemption, the Company will deposit with such Paying Agent a sum sufficient to pay such principal and premium, if any, or interest, such sum to be held in trust for the benefit of the Holders of such Securities or the Trustee, and (unless such Paying Agent is the Trustee), the Company or any other obligor of such Securities will promptly notify the Trustee of its payment or failure to make such payment.
(c) If the Paying Agent shall be other than the Trustee, the Company will cause such Paying Agent to execute and deliver to the Trustee an instrument in which such Paying Agent shall agree with the Trustee, subject to the provisions of this Section 6.03, that such Paying Agent shall:
(i) hold all moneys held by it for the payment of the principal of and premium, if any, or interest on the Securities of that series in trust for the benefit of the Holders of such Securities until such sums shall be paid to such Holders or otherwise disposed of as herein provided;
(ii) give to the Trustee notice of any Default by the Company or any other obligor upon the Securities of that series in the making of any payment of the principal of and premium, if any, or interest on the Securities of that series; and
(iii) at any time during the continuance of any such Default, upon the written request of the Trustee, pay to the Trustee all sums so held in trust by such Paying Agent.
(d) Anything in this Section 6.03 to the contrary notwithstanding, the Company may at any time, for the purpose of obtaining a release, satisfaction or discharge of this Indenture or for any other reason, pay or cause to be paid to the Trustee all sums held in trust by the Company or by any Paying Agent other than the Trustee as required by this Section 6.03, such sums to be held by the Trustee upon the same trusts as those upon which such sums were held by the Company or such Paying Agent.
 
(e) Any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then held by the Company, in trust for the payment of the principal of and premium, if any, or interest on any Security of any series and remaining unclaimed for two years after such principal and premium, if any, or interest has become due and payable shall be paid to the Company upon Company Order along with any interest that has accumulated thereon as a result of such money being invested at the direction of the Company, or (if then held by the Company) shall be discharged from such trust, and the Holder of such Security shall thereafter, as an unsecured general creditor, look only to the Company for payment of such amounts without interest thereon, and all liability of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust money, and all liability of the Company as trustee thereof, shall thereupon cease; provided, however, that the Trustee or such Paying Agent before being required to make any such repayment, may at the expense of the Company cause to be published once, in a newspaper published in the English language, customarily published on each Business Day and of general circulation in The City of New York, notice that such money remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein, which shall not be less than 30 days from the date of such publication, any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining will be repaid to the Company.
Section 6.04 . Except as otherwise provided as contemplated by Section 3.01 with respect to any series of Securities:
Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets
(a) The Company will not consolidate with any other entity or accept a merger of any other entity into the Company or permit the Company to be merged into any other entity, or sell other than for cash or lease all or substantially all its assets to another entity, or purchase all or substantially all the assets of another entity, unless (i) either the Company shall be the continuing entity, or the successor, transferee or lessee entity (if other than the Company) shall expressly assume, by indenture supplemental hereto, executed and delivered by such entity prior to or simultaneously with such consolidation, merger, sale or lease, the due and punctual payment of the principal of and interest and premium, if any, on all the Securities, according to their tenor, and the due and punctual performance and observance of all other obligations to the Holders and the Trustee under this Indenture or under the Securities to be performed or observed by the Company; and (ii) immediately after such consolidation, merger, sale, lease or purchase the Company or the successor, transferee or lessee entity (if other than the Company) would not be in Default in the performance of any covenant or condition of this Indenture. A purchase by a Subsidiary of all or substantially all of the assets of another entity shall not be deemed to be a purchase of such assets by the Company.
(b) Upon any consolidation with or merger into any other entity, or any sale other than for cash, or any conveyance or lease of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company in accordance with this Section 6.04, the successor entity formed by such consolidation or into or with which the Company is merged or to which the Company is sold or to which such conveyance, transfer or lease is made shall succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the Company under this Indenture with the same effect as if such successor entity had been named as the Company herein, and thereafter, except in the case of a lease, the predecessor Company shall be relieved of all obligations and covenants under this Indenture and the Securities, and from time to time such entity may exercise each and every right and power of the Company under this Indenture, in the name of the Company, or in its own name; and any act or proceeding by any provision of this Indenture required or permitted to be done by the Board of Directors or any officer of the Company may be done with like force and effect by the like board or officer of any entity that shall at the time be the successor of the Company hereunder. In the event of any such sale or conveyance, but not any such lease, the Company (or any successor entity which shall theretofore have become such in the manner described in this Section 6.04) shall be discharged from all obligations and covenants under this Indenture and the Securities and may thereupon be dissolved and liquidated.
Section 6.05 . Except as otherwise provided as contemplated by Section 3.01 with respect to any series of Securities, the Company shall furnish to the Trustee annually, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, a brief certificate from the principal executive officer, principal financial officer or principal accounting officer as to his or her knowledge of the Company's compliance with all conditions and covenants under this Indenture (which compliance shall be determined without regard to any period of grace or requirement of notice provided under this Indenture) and, in the event of any Default, specifying each such Default and the nature and status thereof of which such person may have knowledge. Such certificates need not comply with Section 16.01 of this Indenture.
Compliance Certificate
 
Section 6.06 . Anything in this Indenture to the contrary notwithstanding, the Company or a guarantor of any series of Securities may fail or omit in any particular instance to comply with a covenant or condition set forth herein with respect to any series of Securities if the Company shall have obtained and filed with the Trustee, prior to the time of such failure or omission, evidence (as provided in Article VIII) of the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of such series at the time Outstanding, either waiving such compliance in such instance or generally waiving compliance with such covenant or condition, but no such waiver shall extend to or affect such covenant or condition except to the extent so expressly waived, or impair any right consequent thereon and, until such waiver shall have become effective, the obligations of the Company or a guarantor of any series of Securities and the duties of the Trustee in respect of any such covenant or condition shall remain in full force and effect.
Conditional Waiver by Holders of Securities
Section 6.07 . The Company shall deliver to the Trustee as soon as possible and in any event within 30 days after the Company becomes aware of the occurrence of any Event of Default or an event which, with the giving of notice or the lapse of time or both, would constitute an Event of Default, an Officer's Certificate setting forth the details of such Event of Default or Default and the action which the Company proposes to take with respect thereto.
Statement by Officers as to Default
Section 6.08 . The Company shall file with the Trustee promptly at the end of each calendar year (i) a written notice specifying the amount of original issue discount (including daily rates and accrual periods) accrued on Outstanding Securities as of the end of such year and (ii) such other specific information relating to such original issue discount as may then be relevant under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to time.
Calculation of Original Issue Discount
Section 7.01 . Except where otherwise indicated by the context or where the term is otherwise defined for a specific purpose, the term "Event of Default" as used in this Indenture with respect to Securities of any series shall mean one of the following described events unless it is either inapplicable to a particular series or it is specifically deleted or modified in the manner contemplated in Section 3.01:
Events of Default
(a) the failure to pay any installment of interest on any Security of such series when and as the same shall become payable, which failure shall have continued unremedied for a period of 30 days;
(b) the failure to pay the principal of (and premium, if any, on) any Security of such series, when and as the same shall become payable, whether at Maturity as therein expressed, by call for redemption (otherwise than pursuant to a sinking fund), by declaration as authorized by this Indenture or otherwise;
(c) the failure to pay a sinking fund installment, if any, when and as the same shall become payable by the terms of a Security of such series, which failure shall have continued unremedied for a period of 30 days;
(d) the failure, subject to the provisions of Section 6.06, to perform any covenants or agreements contained in this Indenture (including any indenture supplemental hereto pursuant to which the Securities of such series were issued as contemplated by Section 3.01) (other than a covenant or agreement which has been expressly included in this Indenture solely for the benefit of a series of Securities other than that series and other than a covenant or agreement a default in the performance of which is elsewhere in this Section 7.01 specifically addressed), which failure shall not have been remedied, or without provision deemed to be adequate for the remedying thereof having been made, for a period of 90 days after written notice shall have been given to the Company by the Trustee or shall have been given to the Company and the Trustee by Holders of 25% or more in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of such series then Outstanding, specifying such failure, requiring the Company to remedy the same and stating that such notice is a "Notice of Default" hereunder;
(e) the entry by a court having jurisdiction in the premises of a decree or order for relief in respect of the Company in an involuntary case under the federal bankruptcy laws, as now or hereafter constituted, or any other applicable federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law now or hereafter in effect, or appointing a receiver, liquidator, assignee, custodian, trustee or sequestrator (or similar official) of the Company or of substantially all the property of the Company or ordering the winding-up or liquidation of its affairs and such decree or order shall remain unstayed and in effect for a period of 90 consecutive days;
 
(f) the commencement by the Company of a voluntary case under the federal bankruptcy laws, as now or hereafter constituted, or any other applicable federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law now or hereafter in effect, or the consent by the Company to the entry of an order for relief in an involuntary case under any such law, or the consent by the Company to the appointment of or taking possession by a receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, custodian or sequestrator (or similar official) of the Company or of substantially all the property of the Company or the making by it of an assignment for the benefit of creditors or the admission by it in writing of its inability to pay its debts generally as they become due, or the taking of corporate action by the Company in furtherance of any action; or
(g) the occurrence of any other Event of Default with respect to Securities of such series as provided in Section 3.01;
provided, however, that no event described in clause (d) or (other than with respect to a payment default) (g) above shall constitute an Event of Default hereunder until a Responsible Officer assigned to and working in the Trustee's corporate trust department has actual knowledge thereof or until a written notice of any such event is received by the Trustee at the Corporate Trust Office, and such notice refers to the facts underlying such event, the Securities generally, the Company and the Indenture.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 7.01, if the principal or any premium or interest on any Security is payable in a Currency other than the Currency of the United States and such Currency is not available to the Company for making payment thereof due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond the control of the Company, the Company will be entitled to satisfy its obligations to Holders of the Securities by making such payment in the Currency of the United States in an amount equal to the Currency of the United States equivalent of the amount payable in such other Currency, as determined by the Trustee by reference to the noon buying rate in The City of New York for cable transfers for such Currency ("Exchange Rate"), as such Exchange Rate is reported or otherwise made available by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on the date of such payment, or, if such rate is not then available, on the basis of the most recently available Exchange Rate. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 7.01, any payment made under such circumstances in the Currency of the United States where the required payment is in a Currency other than the Currency of the United States will not constitute an Event of Default under this Indenture.
Section 7.02 .
Acceleration; Rescission and Annulment
(a) Except as otherwise provided as contemplated by Section 3.01 with respect to any series of Securities, if any one or more of the above-described Events of Default (other than an Event of Default specified in Section 7.01(e) or 7.01(f)) shall happen with respect to Securities of any series at the time Outstanding, then, and in each and every such case, during the continuance of any such Event of Default, the Trustee or the Holders of 25% or more in principal amount of the Securities of such series then Outstanding may declare the principal (or, if the Securities of that series are Original Issue Discount Securities, such portion of the principal amount as may be specified in the terms of that series) of and all accrued but unpaid interest on all the Securities of such series then Outstanding to be due and payable immediately by a notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by Holders), and upon any such declaration such principal amount (or specified amount) shall become immediately due and payable. If an Event of Default specified in Section 7.01(e) or 7.01(f) occurs and is continuing, then in every such case, the principal amount of all of the Securities of that series then Outstanding shall automatically, and without any declaration or any other action on the part of the Trustee or any Holder, become due and payable immediately. Upon payment of such amounts in the Currency in which such Securities are denominated (subject to Section 7.01 and except as otherwise provided pursuant to Section 3.01), all obligations of the Company in respect of the payment of principal of and interest on the Securities of such series shall terminate.
(b) The provisions of Section 7.02(a), however, are subject to the condition that, at any time after the principal of all the Securities of such series, to which any one or more of the above-described Events of Default is applicable, shall have been so declared to be due and payable, and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee as hereinafter provided in this Article, the Event of Default giving rise to such declaration of acceleration shall, without further act, be deemed to have been waived, and such declaration and its consequences shall, without further act, be deemed to have been rescinded and annulled, if:
(i) the Company has paid or deposited with the Trustee or Paying Agent a sum in the Currency in which such Securities are denominated (subject to Section 7.01 and except as otherwise provided pursuant to Section 3.01) sufficient to pay
 
(A) all amounts owing the Trustee and any predecessor trustee hereunder under Section 11.01(a) (provided, however, that all sums payable under this clause (A) shall be paid in U.S. Dollars);
(B) all arrears of interest, if any, upon all the Securities of such series (with interest, to the extent that interest thereon shall be legally enforceable, on any overdue installment of interest at the rate borne by such Securities at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Securities); and
(C) the principal of and premium, if any, on any Securities of such series that have become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and interest thereon;
(ii) every other Default and Event of Default with respect to Securities of that series, other than the non-payment of the principal of Securities of that series which have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in Section 7.06.
(c) No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.
(d) For all purposes under this Indenture, if a portion of the principal of any Original Issue Discount Securities shall have been accelerated and declared due and payable pursuant to the provisions hereof, then, from and after such declaration, unless such declaration has been rescinded and annulled, the principal amount of such Original Issue Discount Securities shall be deemed, for all purposes hereunder, to be such portion of the principal thereof as shall be due and payable as a result of such acceleration, and payment of such portion of the principal thereof as shall be due and payable as a result of such acceleration, together with interest, if any, thereon and all other amounts owing thereunder, shall constitute payment in full of such Original Issue Discount Securities.
Section 7.03 . Except as otherwise provided as contemplated by Section 3.01 with respect to any series of Securities, upon failure for a period of 30 days to pay any installment of interest on the Securities of any series or failure to pay the principal of and premium, if any, on any of the Securities of such series when and as the same shall become due and payable, whether at Maturity, or by call for redemption (other than pursuant to the sinking fund), by declaration as authorized by this Indenture, or otherwise, or failure for a period of 30 days to make any required sinking fund payment as to a series of Securities, then, upon demand of the Trustee, the Company will pay to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the Holders of Securities of such series then Outstanding the whole amount which then shall have become due and payable on all the Securities of such series, with interest on the overdue principal and premium, if any, and (so far as the same may be legally enforceable) on the overdue installments of interest at the rate borne by the Securities of such series, and all amounts owing the Trustee and any predecessor trustee hereunder under Section 11.01(a).
Other Remedies
In case of failure forthwith to pay such amounts upon such demand, the Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, shall be entitled and empowered to institute any action or proceeding at law or in equity for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, and may prosecute any such action or proceeding to judgment or final decree, and may enforce any such judgment or final decree against the Company or any other obligor upon the Securities of such series, and collect the moneys adjudged or decreed to be payable out of the property of the Company or any other obligor upon the Securities of such series, wherever situated, in the manner provided by law. Every recovery of judgment in any such action or other proceeding, subject to the payment to the Trustee of all amounts owing the Trustee and any predecessor trustee hereunder under Section 11.01(a), shall be for the ratable benefit of the Holders of such series of Securities which shall be the subject of such action or proceeding. All rights of action upon or under any of the Securities or this Indenture may be enforced by the Trustee without the possession of any of the Securities and without the production of any thereof at any trial or any proceeding relative thereto.
 
Section 7.04 . The Trustee is hereby appointed, and each and every Holder of the Securities, by receiving and holding the same, shall be conclusively deemed to have appointed the Trustee, the true and lawful attorney-in-fact of such Holder, with authority to make or file (whether or not there shall be a Default in respect of the payment of the principal of, or interest on, any of the Securities), in its own name and as trustee of an express trust or otherwise as it shall deem advisable, in any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization or other judicial proceeding relative to the Company or any other obligor upon the Securities or to their respective creditors or property, any and all claims, proofs of claim, proofs of debt, petitions, consents, other papers and documents and amendments of any thereof, as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee and any predecessor trustee hereunder and of the Holders of the Securities allowed in any such proceeding and to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claim, and to execute and deliver any and all other papers and documents and to do and perform any and all other acts and things, as it may deem necessary or advisable in order to enforce in any such proceeding any of the claims of the Trustee and any predecessor trustee hereunder and of any of such Holders in respect of any of the Securities; and any receiver, assignee, trustee, custodian or debtor in any such proceeding is hereby authorized, and each and every taker or Holder of the Securities, by receiving and holding the same, shall be conclusively deemed to have authorized any such receiver, assignee, trustee, custodian or debtor, to make any such payment or delivery only to or on the order of the Trustee, and to pay to the Trustee any amount due it and any predecessor trustee hereunder under Section 11.01(a); provided, however, that nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize or empower the Trustee to consent to or accept or adopt, on behalf of any Holder of Securities, any plan of reorganization or readjustment affecting the Securities or the rights of any Holder thereof, or to authorize or empower the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder of any Securities in any such proceeding.
Trustee as Attorney-in-Fact
Section 7.05 . Any moneys or properties collected by the Trustee with respect to a series of Securities under this Article VII shall be applied in the order following, at the date or dates fixed by the Trustee for the distribution of such moneys or properties and, in the case of the distribution of such moneys or properties on account of the Securities of any series, upon presentation of the Securities of such series, and stamping thereon the payment, if only partially paid, and upon surrender thereof, if fully paid:
Priorities
FIRST: To the payment of all amounts due to the Trustee and any predecessor trustee hereunder under Section 11.01(a).
SECOND: In case the principal of the Outstanding Securities of such series shall not have become due and be unpaid, to the payment of interest on the Securities of such series, in the chronological order of the Maturity of the installments of such interest, with interest (to the extent that such interest has been collected by the Trustee) upon the overdue installments of interest at the rate borne by such Securities, such payments to be made ratably to the Persons entitled thereto.
THIRD: In case the principal of the Outstanding Securities of such series shall have become due, by declaration or otherwise, to the payment of the whole amount then owing and unpaid upon the Securities of such series for principal and premium, if any, and interest, with interest on the overdue principal and premium, if any, and (to the extent that such interest has been collected by the Trustee) upon overdue installments of interest at the rate borne by the Securities of such series, and in case such moneys shall be insufficient to pay in full the whole amounts so due and unpaid upon the Securities of such series, then to the payment of such principal and premium, if any, and interest without preference or priority of principal and premium, if any, over interest, or of interest over principal and premium, if any, or of any installment of interest over any other installment of interest, or of any Security of such series over any other Security of such series, ratably to the aggregate of such principal and premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest.
Any surplus then remaining shall be paid to the Company or as directed by a court of competent jurisdiction.
Section 7.06 . The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities of any series at the time Outstanding may direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee hereunder, or of exercising any trust or power hereby conferred upon the Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series, provided, however, that, subject to the provisions of Sections 11.01 and 11.02, the Trustee shall have the right to decline to follow any such direction if the Trustee being advised by counsel determines that the action so directed may not lawfully be taken or would be unduly prejudicial to Holders not joining in such direction or would involve the Trustee in personal liability. The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of such series of Securities at the time Outstanding may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Securities of such series waive any past Default or Event of Default hereunder and its consequences except a Default in the payment of interest or any premium on or the principal of the Securities of such series. Upon any such waiver the Company, any guarantor of any series of Securities, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities of such series shall be restored to their former positions and rights hereunder, respectively; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon. Whenever any Default or Event of Default hereunder shall have been waived as permitted by this Section 7.06, said Default or Event of Default shall for all purposes of the Securities of such series and this Indenture be deemed to have been cured and to be not continuing.
Control by Securityholders; Waiver of Past Defaults
 
Section 7.07 . No Holder of any Security of any series shall have any right to institute any action, suit or proceeding at law or in equity for the execution of any trust hereunder or for the appointment of a receiver or for any other remedy hereunder, in each case with respect to an Event of Default with respect to such series of Securities, unless (a) such Holder previously shall have given to the Trustee written notice of one or more of the Events of Default herein specified with respect to such series of Securities, (b) the Holders of 25% in principal amount of the Securities of such series then Outstanding shall have requested the Trustee in writing to take action in respect of the matter complained of, (c) such Holder or Holders shall have offered to the Trustee security and indemnity satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred therein or thereby, (d) the Trustee, for 60 days after receipt of such notification, request and offer of indemnity, shall have neglected or refused to institute any such action, suit or proceeding and (e) during such 60-day period the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities do not give the Trustee a direction inconsistent with the request; and such notification, request and offer of indemnity are hereby declared in every such case to be conditions precedent to any such action, suit or proceeding by any Holder of any Security of such series; it being understood and intended that no one or more of the Holders of Securities of such series shall have any right in any manner whatsoever by his, her, its or their action to enforce any right hereunder, except in the manner herein provided, and that every action, suit or proceeding at law or in equity shall be instituted, had and maintained in the manner herein provided and for the equal benefit of all Holders of the Outstanding Securities of such series; provided, however, that nothing in this Indenture or in the Securities of such series shall affect or impair the obligation of the Company or any guarantor of any series of Securities, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Securities of such series to the respective Holders of such Securities at the respective due dates in such Securities stated, or affect or impair the right, which is also absolute and unconditional, of such Holders to institute suit to enforce the payment thereof.
Limitation on Suits
Section 7.08 . All parties to this Indenture and each Holder of any Security, by such Holder's acceptance thereof, shall be deemed to have agreed that any court may in its discretion require, in any action, suit or proceeding for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture, or in any action, suit or proceeding against the Trustee for any action taken or omitted by it as Trustee, the filing by any party litigant in such action, suit or proceeding of an undertaking to pay the costs of such action, suit or proceeding, and that such court may in its discretion assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, against any party litigant in such action, suit or proceeding, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by such party litigant; provided, however, that the provisions of this Section 7.08 shall not apply to any action, suit or proceeding instituted by the Trustee, to any action, suit or proceeding instituted by any one or more Holders of Securities holding in the aggregate more than 25% in principal amount of the Securities of any series Outstanding, or to any action, suit or proceeding instituted by any Holder of Securities of any series for the enforcement of the payment of the principal of or premium, if any, or the interest on, any of the Securities of such series, on or after the respective due dates expressed in such Securities.
Undertaking for Costs
Section 7.09 . No remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee or to the Holders of Securities of any series is intended to be exclusive of any other remedy or remedies, and each and every remedy shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to every other remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute. No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Holder of the Securities of any series to exercise any right or power accruing upon any Default or Event of Default shall impair any such right or power or shall be construed to be a waiver of any such Default or Event of Default or an acquiescence therein; and every power and remedy given by this Article VII to the Trustee and to the Holders of Securities of any series, respectively, may be exercised from time to time and as often as may be deemed expedient by the Trustee or by the Holders of Securities of such series, as the case may be. In case the Trustee or any Holder of Securities of any series shall have proceeded to enforce any right under this Indenture and the proceedings for the enforcement thereof shall have been discontinued or abandoned because of waiver or for any other reason or shall have been adjudicated adversely to the Trustee or to such Holder of Securities, then and in every such case the Company, any guarantor of any series of Securities, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities of such series shall severally and respectively be restored to their former positions and rights hereunder, and thereafter all rights, remedies and powers of the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities of such series shall continue as though no such proceedings had been taken, except as to any matters so waived or adjudicated.
Remedies Cumulative
 
Section 8.01 . Whenever in this Indenture it is provided that the Holders of a specified percentage or a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities or of any series of Securities may take any action (including the making of any demand or request, the giving of any notice, consent or waiver or the taking of any other action), the fact that at the time of taking any such action the Holders of such specified percentage or majority have joined therein may be evidenced by (a) any instrument or any number of instruments of similar tenor executed by Securityholders in person, by an agent or by a proxy appointed in writing, including through an electronic system for tabulating consents operated by the Depositary for such series or otherwise (such action becoming effective, except as herein otherwise expressly provided, when such instruments or evidence of electronic consents are delivered to the Trustee and, where it is hereby expressly required, to the Company), or (b) by the record of the Holders of Securities voting in favor thereof at any meeting of Securityholders duly called and held in accordance with the provisions of Article IX, or (c) by a combination of such instrument or instruments and any such record of such a meeting of Securityholders.
Evidence of Action of Securityholders
Section 8.02 . Proof of the execution of any instrument by a Securityholder or his, her or its agent or proxy and proof of the holding by any Person of any of the Securities shall be sufficient if made in the following manner:
Proof of Execution or Holding of Securities
(a) The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such instrument may be proved (i) by the certificate of any notary public or other officer in any jurisdiction who, by the laws thereof, has power to take acknowledgments or proof of deeds to be recorded within such jurisdiction, that the Person who signed such instrument did acknowledge before such notary public or other officer the execution thereof, or (ii) by the affidavit of a witness of such execution sworn to before any such notary or other officer. Where such execution is by a Person acting in other than his or her individual capacity, such certificate or affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of his or her authority.
(b) The ownership of Securities of any series shall be proved by the Register of such Securities or by a certificate of the Registrar for such series.
(c) The record of any Holders' meeting shall be proved in the manner provided in Section 9.06.

(e) If the Company shall solicit from the Holders of Securities of any series any action, the Company may, at its option fix in advance a record date for the determination of Holders of Securities entitled to take such action, but the Company shall have no obligation to do so. Any such record date shall be fixed at the Company's discretion. If such a record date is fixed, such action may be sought or given before or after the record date, but only the Holders of Securities of record at the close of business on such record date shall be deemed to be Holders of Securities for the purpose of determining whether Holders of the requisite proportion of Outstanding Securities of such series have authorized or agreed or consented to such action, and for that purpose the Outstanding Securities of such series shall be computed as of such record date.
 
Section 8.03 .
Persons Deemed Owners
(a) The Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name any Security is registered as the owner of such Security for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of and premium, if any, and (subject to Section 3.08) interest, if any, on, such Security and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary. All payments made to any Holder, or upon his, her or its order, shall be valid, and, to the extent of the sum or sums paid, effectual to satisfy and discharge the liability for moneys payable upon such Security.
(b) None of the Company, the Trustee, any Paying Agent or the Registrar will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in a Global Security or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests.
Section 8.04 . After an amendment, supplement, waiver or other action becomes effective as to any series of Securities, a consent to it by a Holder of such series of Securities is a continuing consent conclusive and binding upon such Holder and every subsequent Holder of the same Securities or portion thereof, and of any Security issued upon the transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in place thereof, even if notation of the consent is not made on any such Security. An amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective in accordance with its terms and thereafter binds every Holder.

(b) The Trustee shall, by an instrument in writing, appoint a temporary chairman of the meeting, unless the meeting shall have been called by the Company or by Securityholders as provided in Section 9.03, in which case the Company or the Securityholders calling the meeting, as the case may be, shall in like manner appoint a temporary chair.

Section 11.01 . The Trustee accepts the trusts created by this Indenture upon the terms and conditions hereof, including the following, to all of which the parties hereto and the Holders from time to time of the Securities agree:
Rights of Trustees; Compensation and Indemnity
(a) The Trustee shall be entitled to such compensation as the Company and the Trustee shall from time to time agree in writing for all services rendered by it hereunder (including in any agent capacity in which it acts). The compensation of the Trustee shall not be limited by any provision of law in regard to the compensation of a trustee of an express trust. The Company shall reimburse the Trustee promptly upon its request for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, disbursements and advances incurred or made by the Trustee (including the reasonable expenses and disbursements of its agents and counsel), except any such expense, disbursement or advance as may be attributable to its negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct.
The Company also agrees to indemnify each of the Trustee and any predecessor Trustee hereunder for, and to hold it harmless against, any and all loss, liability, damage, claim, or expense incurred without its own negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the trust or trusts hereunder and the performance of its duties (including in any agent capacity in which it acts), as well as the costs and expenses of defending itself against any claim (whether asserted by the Company, a Holder or any other Person) or liability in connection with the exercise or performance of any of its powers or duties hereunder, except those attributable to its negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith. The Trustee shall notify the Company promptly of any claim for which it may seek indemnity. The Company shall defend the claim and the Trustee shall cooperate in the defense.

As security for the performance of the obligations of the Company under this Section 11.01(a), the Trustee shall have a lien upon all property and funds held or collected by the Trustee as such, except funds held in trust by the Trustee to pay principal of and interest on any Securities. Notwithstanding any provisions of this Indenture to the contrary, the obligations of the Company to compensate and indemnify the Trustee under this Section 11.01(a) shall survive the resignation or removal of the Trustee and any satisfaction and discharge under Article XII. When the Trustee incurs expenses or renders services after an Event of Default specified in clause (e) or (f) of Section 7.01 occurs, the expenses and compensation for the services are intended to constitute expenses of administration under any applicable federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws.

(d) The Trustee may consult with counsel of its selection and the advice of such counsel or, to the extent permitted by Section 11.02, any Opinion of Counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by the Trustee hereunder in good faith and in reliance thereon.
 
(e) The Trustee, to the extent permitted by Section 11.02, may conclusively rely upon the certificate of the Secretary or one of the Assistant Secretaries of the Company as to the adoption of any Board Resolution or resolution of the stockholders of the Company, and any request, direction, order or demand of the Company mentioned herein shall be sufficiently evidenced by, and whenever in the administration of this Indenture the Trustee shall deem it desirable that a matter be proved or established prior to taking, suffering or omitting any action hereunder, the Trustee may rely upon, an Officer's Certificate of the Company (unless other evidence in respect thereof be herein specifically prescribed).
(f) Subject to Section 11.04, the Trustee or any agent of the Trustee, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Securities and, subject to Sections 310(b) and 311 of the Trust Indenture Act, may otherwise deal with the Company with the same rights it would have had if it were not the Trustee or such agent.
(g) Money held by the Trustee in trust hereunder need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law. The Trustee shall be under no liability for interest on any money received by it hereunder except as otherwise agreed in writing with the Company.
(h) Any action taken by the Trustee pursuant to any provision hereof at the request or with the consent of any Person who at the time is the Holder of any Security shall be conclusive and binding in respect of such Security upon all future Holders thereof or of any Security or Securities which may be issued for or in lieu thereof in whole or in part, whether or not such Security shall have noted thereon the fact that such request or consent had been made or given.
(i) Subject to the provisions of Section 11.02, the Trustee may conclusively rely and shall be protected in acting or refraining from acting upon any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, order, approval, bond, debenture or other paper or document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties.
(j) Subject to the provisions of Section 11.02, the Trustee shall not be under any obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it by this Indenture at the request, order or direction of any of the Holders of the Securities, pursuant to any provision of this Indenture, unless one or more of the Holders of the Securities shall have offered to the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and liabilities which may be incurred by it therein or thereby.
(k) Subject to the provisions of Section 11.02, the Trustee shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted by it in good faith and believed by it to be authorized or within its discretion or within the rights or powers conferred upon it by this Indenture.

(m) Subject to the provisions of the first paragraph of Section 11.02, the Trustee shall not be bound to make any investigation into the facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, direction, consent, order, bond, debenture, note, other evidence of Indebtedness or other paper or document, but the Trustee, may, but shall not be required to, make further inquiry or investigation into such facts or matters as it may see fit.
(n) The rights, privileges, protections, immunities and benefits given to the Trustee, including, without limitation, its right to be indemnified, are extended to, and shall be enforceable by, the Trustee in each of its capacities hereunder.
(o) In no event shall the Trustee be responsible or liable for special, indirect, punitive or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever (including, but not limited to, loss of profit) irrespective of whether the Trustee has been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless of the form of action.
 
(p) The Trustee may request that the Company deliver a certificate setting forth the names of individuals and/or titles of officers authorized at such time to take specified actions pursuant to this Indenture.
(q) The Trustee shall not be required to give any bond or surety in respect of the performance of its powers and duties hereunder.

(c) None of the provisions of this Indenture shall require the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise to incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder, or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if it shall have reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it.

Such court may thereupon, in any such case, after such notice, if any, as such court may deem proper and prescribe, appoint a successor Trustee.
(c) Any successor Trustee appointed hereunder with respect to the Securities of one or more series shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to its predecessor Trustee and to the Company, or to the receivers, trustees, assignees or court appointing it, as the case may be, an instrument accepting such appointment hereunder, and thereupon such successor Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the authority, rights, powers, trusts, immunities, duties and obligations with respect to such series of such predecessor Trustee with like effect as if originally named as Trustee hereunder, and such predecessor Trustee, upon payment of its charges and disbursements then unpaid, shall thereupon become obligated to pay over, and such successor Trustee shall be entitled to receive, all moneys and properties held by such predecessor Trustee as Trustee hereunder, subject nevertheless to its lien provided for in Section 11.01(a).

Deposits to Be Held in Escrow
 
If Securities of a series with respect to which such deposits are made may be subject to later redemption at the option of the Company or pursuant to optional sinking fund payments, the applicable escrow trust agreement may, at the option of the Company, provide therefor.

Distribution on Dissolution, Liquidation and Reorganization; Subrogation of Securities
(a) the holders of all Senior Indebtedness shall be entitled to receive payment in full of the principal thereof (and premium, if any) and interest due thereon before the Holders of the Securities are entitled to receive any payment upon the principal (or premium, if any) or interest, if any, on Indebtedness evidenced by the Securities; and
(b) any payment or distribution of assets of the Company of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities, to which the Holders of the Securities or the Trustee would be entitled except for the provisions of this Article XV shall be paid by the liquidation trustee or agent or other Person making such payment or distribution, whether a trustee in bankruptcy, a receiver or liquidating trustee or otherwise, directly to the holders of Senior Indebtedness or their representative or representatives or to the trustee or trustees under any indenture under which any instruments evidencing any of such Senior Indebtedness may have been issued, ratably according to the aggregate amounts remaining unpaid on account of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on the Senior Indebtedness held or represented by each, to the extent necessary to make payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness remaining unpaid, after giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness; and
(c) in the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing, any payment or distribution of assets of the Company of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities prohibited by the foregoing, shall be received by the Trustee or the Holders of the Securities before all Senior Indebtedness is paid in full, such payment or distribution shall be paid over, upon written notice to a Responsible Officer of the Trustee, to the holder of such Senior Indebtedness or his, her or its representative or representatives or to the trustee or trustees under any indenture under which any instrument evidencing any of such Senior Indebtedness may have been issued, ratably as aforesaid, as calculated by the Company, for application to payment of all Senior Indebtedness remaining unpaid until all such Senior Indebtedness shall have been paid in full, after giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness.
 
(d) Subject to the payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness, the Holders of the Securities shall be subrogated to the rights of the holders of Senior Indebtedness (to the extent that distributions otherwise payable to such holder have been applied to the payment of Senior Indebtedness) to receive payments or distributions of cash, property or securities of the Company applicable to Senior Indebtedness until the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, on the Securities shall be paid in full and no such payments or distributions to the Holders of the Securities of cash, property or securities otherwise distributable to the holders of Senior Indebtedness shall, as between the Company, its creditors other than the holders of Senior Indebtedness, and the Holders of the Securities be deemed to be a payment by the Company to or on account of the Securities. It is understood that the provisions of this Article XV are and are intended solely for the purpose of defining the relative rights of the Holders of the Securities, on the one hand, and the holders of the Senior Indebtedness, on the other hand. Nothing contained in this Article XV or elsewhere in this Indenture or in the Securities is intended to or shall impair, as between the Company, its creditors other than the holders of Senior Indebtedness, and the Holders of the Securities, the obligation of the Company, which is unconditional and absolute, to pay to the Holders of the Securities the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, on the Securities as and when the same shall become due and payable in accordance with their terms, or to affect the relative rights of the Holders of the Securities and creditors of the Company other than the holders of Senior Indebtedness, nor shall anything herein or in the Securities prevent the Trustee or the Holder of any Security from exercising all remedies otherwise permitted by applicable law upon default under this Indenture, subject to the rights, if any, under this Article XV of the holders of Senior Indebtedness in respect of cash, property or securities of the Company received upon the exercise of any such remedy. Upon any payment or distribution of assets of the Company referred to in this Article XV, the Trustee, subject to the provisions of Section 15.05, shall be entitled to conclusively rely upon a certificate of the liquidating trustee or agent or other person making any distribution to the Trustee for the purpose of ascertaining the Persons entitled to participate in such distribution, the holders of Senior Indebtedness and other indebtedness of the Company, the amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereof and all other facts pertinent thereto or to this Article XV.
Section 15.03 . Subject to Section 15.01, no payment by the Company on account of principal (or premium, if any), sinking funds or interest, if any, on the Securities shall be made at anytime if: (i) a default on Senior Indebtedness exists that permits the holders of such Senior Indebtedness to accelerate its maturity and (ii) the default is the subject of judicial proceedings or the Company has received notice of such default. The Company may resume payments on the Securities when full payment of amounts then due for principal (premium, if any), sinking funds and interest on Senior Indebtedness has been made or duly provided for in money or money's worth.
No Payment on Securities in Event of Default on Senior Indebtedness
In the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing, any payment shall be received by the Trustee when such payment is prohibited by the preceding paragraph of this Section 15.03, such payment shall be held in trust for the benefit of, and shall be paid over or delivered to, the holders of such Senior Indebtedness or their respective representatives, or to the trustee or trustees under any indenture pursuant to which any of such Senior Indebtedness may have been issued, as their respective interests may appear, as calculated by the Company, but only to the extent that the holders of such Senior Indebtedness (or their representative or representatives or a trustee) notify the Trustee in writing within 90 days of such payment of the amounts then due and owing on such Senior Indebtedness and only the amounts specified in such notice to the Trustee shall be paid to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness.
Section 15.04 . Subject to Section 15.01, nothing contained in this Indenture or in any of the Securities shall (a) affect the obligation of the Company to make, or prevent the Company from making, at any time except as provided in Sections 15.02 and 15.03, payments of principal of (or premium, if any) or interest, if any, on the Securities or (b) prevent the application by the Trustee of any moneys or assets deposited with it hereunder to the payment of or on account of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest, if any, on the Securities, unless a Responsible Officer of the Trustee shall have received at its Corporate Trust Office written notice of any fact prohibiting the making of such payment from the Company or from the holder of any Senior Indebtedness or from the trustee for any such holder, together with proof satisfactory to the Trustee of such holding of Senior Indebtedness or of the authority of such trustee more than two Business Days prior to the date fixed for such payment.
Payments on Securities Permitted

SECTION 8.02 .
With Consent of Holders of Notes
Except as provided below in this Section 8.02, the Company, the Guarantors and the Trustee may amend or supplement the Indenture or the Notes and/or any Subsidiary Guarantees may be amended or supplemented (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes) of the holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of Outstanding Notes affected by such modifications or amendments; and, subject to Section 7.06 of the Base Indenture, any existing Default or Event of Default (other than a Default or Event of Default in the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the Notes, except a payment default resulting from an acceleration that has been rescinded) or compliance with any provision of the Indenture, the Notes or the Subsidiary Guarantees may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then Outstanding Notes (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes).
Upon the written request of the Company accompanied by a resolution of its Board of Directors authorizing the execution of any such amended or supplemental Indenture, and upon the filing with the Trustee of evidence satisfactory to the Trustee of the consent of the Holders of Notes as aforesaid, and upon receipt by the Trustee of any document requested by it pursuant to Section 11.02(e) of the Base Indenture, the Trustee shall join with the Company and the Guarantors in the execution of such amended or supplemental Indenture and to make any further appropriate agreements and stipulations that may be therein contained, unless such amended or supplemental Indenture directly affects the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under the Indenture or otherwise, in which case the Trustee may in its discretion, but shall not be obligated to, enter into such amended or supplemental Indenture.
It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Holders of Notes under this Section 8.02 to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment or waiver, but it shall be sufficient if such consent approves the substance thereof.
 
After an amendment, supplement or waiver under this Section 8.02 becomes effective, the Company shall mail to the Holders of Notes affected thereby a notice briefly describing the amendment, supplement or waiver. Any failure of the Company to mail such notice, or any defect therein, shall not, however, in any way impair or affect the validity of any such amended or supplemental Indenture or waiver. Subject to Section 7.06, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then Outstanding voting as a single class may waive compliance in a particular instance by the Company and/or the Guarantors with any provision of this Indenture, the Notes or the Subsidiary Guarantees. However, without the consent of each Holder affected, an amendment or waiver under this Section 8.02 may not (with respect to any Notes held by a non-consenting Holder):
(1) reduce the principal amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver;
(2) reduce the principal of or change the fixed maturity of any Note or alter the provisions with respect to the redemption of Notes (other than provisions relating to the covenants described in Section 4.01 of this Supplemental Indenture);
(3) reduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest on any Note;
(4) waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of and interest on the Notes (except a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Notes and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration);
(5) make any Note payable in money other than that stated in the Notes;
(6) make any change in the provisions of the Indenture relating to waivers of past Defaults or the rights of Holders of Notes to receive payments of principal of or interest on the Notes;
(7) waive a redemption payment with respect to any Note (other than a payment required by one of the covenants described in Section 4.01 of this Supplemental Indenture);
(8) make any change in the foregoing amendment and waiver provisions;
(9) modify, without the written consent of the Trustee, the rights, duties or immunities of the Trustee; or
(10) release any Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary from its Subsidiary Guarantee, except as provided in the Indenture.
SECTION 8.03 . Until an amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective, a consent to it by a Holder of a Note is a continuing consent by the Holder of a Note and every subsequent Holder of a Note or portion of a Note that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder's Note, even if notation of the consent is not made on any Note. However, any such Holder of a Note or subsequent Holder of a Note may revoke the consent as to its Note if the Trustee receives written notice of revocation before the date the waiver, supplement or amendment becomes effective. An amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective in accordance with its terms and thereafter binds every Holder.
Revocation and Effect of Consents
SECTION 8.04 . The Trustee may place an appropriate notation about an amendment, supplement or waiver on any affected Note thereafter
Notation on or Exchange of Notes
 
authenticated. The Company in exchange for all affected Notes may issue and the Trustee shall, upon receipt of an authentication order, authenticate new Notes that reflect the amendment, supplement or waiver. Failure to make the appropriate notation or issue a new Note shall not affect the validity and effect of such amendment, supplement or waiver.
SECTION 8.05 The Trustee shall sign any amended or supplemental Indenture authorized pursuant to this Article VIII if the amendment or supplement does not in the judgment of the Trustee adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee. The Company may not sign an amendment or supplemental Indenture until its Board of Directors approves it. In executing any amended or supplemental indenture, the Trustee shall receive and (subject to Section 11.01 of the Base Indenture) shall be fully protected in conclusively relying upon an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel stating that the execution of such amended or supplemental Indenture is authorized or permitted by this Indenture.
Trustee to Sign Amendments, etc.
SECTION 9.01 .
Guarantee
Subject to this Article IX, each of the Guarantors hereby, jointly and severally, unconditionally guarantees to each Holder of a Note authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and to the Trustee and its successors and assigns, irrespective of the validity and enforceability of the Indenture, the Notes or the obligations of the Company hereunder or thereunder, that: (a) the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes will be promptly paid by the Company in full when due, whether at Maturity, by acceleration, redemption or otherwise, and interest on the overdue principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes, if any, if lawful, and all other obligations of the Company to the Holders or the Trustee hereunder or thereunder will be promptly paid by the Company in full or performed by the Company, all in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof; and (b) in case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any Notes or any of such other obligations, that same will be promptly paid by the Company in full when due or performed by the Company in accordance with the terms of the extension or renewal, whether at Stated Maturity, by acceleration or otherwise. Failing payment when due by the Company of any amount so guaranteed or any performance so guaranteed which failure continues for ten (10) days after demand therefor is made to the Company for whatever reason, the Guarantors shall be jointly and severally obligated to pay the same immediately. Each Guarantor agrees that this is a Guarantee of payment and not a Guarantee of collection.
The Guarantors hereby agree that their obligations hereunder shall be unconditional, irrespective of the validity, regularity or enforceability of the Notes or the Indenture, the absence of any action to enforce the same, any waiver or consent by any Holder of the Notes with respect to any provisions hereof or thereof, the recovery of any judgment against the Company, any action to enforce the same or any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a Guarantor. Each Guarantor hereby waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment (except as specifically provided in the preceding paragraph), filing of claims with a court in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company, any right to require a proceeding first against the Company, protest, notice and all demands (except as specifically provided in the preceding paragraph) whatsoever and covenant that this Subsidiary Guarantee shall not be discharged except by complete performance of the obligations contained in the Notes and the Indenture. Each Guarantor also expressly waives,
 
without any requirement of any notice to or further assent by such Guarantor, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the benefit of all principles or provisions of applicable law which are or might be in conflict with the terms hereof, including, without limitation, Section 10-7-23 and Section 10-7-24 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated.
If any Holder or the Trustee is required by any court or otherwise to return to the Company, the Guarantors or any custodian, trustee, liquidator or other similar official acting in relation to either the Company or the Guarantors, any amount paid by either to the Trustee or such Holder, this Subsidiary Guarantee, to the extent theretofore discharged, shall be reinstated in full force and effect.
Each Guarantor agrees that it shall not be entitled to any right of subrogation in relation to the Holders in respect of any obligations guaranteed hereby until payment in full of all obligations guaranteed hereby. Each Guarantor further agrees that, as between the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Holders and the Trustee, on the other hand, (x) the maturity of the obligations guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as provided in Article VII of the Base Indenture and Article VI of this Supplemental Indenture for the purposes of this Subsidiary Guarantee, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the obligations guaranteed hereby, and (y) in the event of any declaration of acceleration of such obligations as provided in Article VII of the Base Indenture and Article VI of this Supplemental Indenture, such obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall forthwith become due and payable by the Guarantors for the purpose of this Subsidiary Guarantee, failing payment when due by the Company which failure continues for ten (10) days after demand therefor is made to the Company. The Guarantors shall have the right to seek contribution from any non-paying Guarantor so long as the exercise of such right does not impair the rights of the Holders under the Subsidiary Guarantee.
SECTION 9.02 . Each Guarantor, and by its acceptance of Notes, each Holder, hereby confirms that it is the intention of all such parties that the Subsidiary Guarantee of such Guarantor not constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance for purposes of Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar federal or state law to the extent applicable to any Subsidiary Guarantee. To effectuate the foregoing intention, the Trustee, the Holders and the Guarantors hereby irrevocably agree that the obligations of such Guarantor under its Subsidiary Guarantee and this Article IX shall be limited to the maximum amount as will, after giving effect to such maximum amount and all other contingent and fixed liabilities of such Guarantor that are relevant under such laws, and after giving effect to any collections from, rights to receive contribution from or payments made by or on behalf of any other Guarantor in respect of the obligations of such other Guarantor under this Article IX, result in the obligations of such Guarantor under its Subsidiary Guarantee not constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance.
Limitation on Guarantor Liability
SECTION 9.03 .
Execution and Delivery of Guarantee
To evidence the Subsidiary Guarantees set forth in Section 9.01 of this Supplemental Indenture, the Company hereby agrees to cause a notation of such Subsidiary Guarantee substantially in the form of hereto to be endorsed by manual or facsimile signature by an officer of each Guarantor on each Note authenticated and delivered by the Trustee. The Company shall cause all future Guarantors to execute a supplemental indenture substantially in the form of hereto.
Exhibit B
Exhibit C
Each Guarantor hereby agrees that its Subsidiary Guarantee set forth in Section 9.01 of this Supplemental Indenture and in any subsequent supplemental indentures shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any failure to endorse on each Note a notation of such Subsidiary Guarantee.
 
If an officer whose signature is on any supplemental indenture or on the Subsidiary Guarantee no longer holds that office at the time the Trustee authenticates the Note on which a Subsidiary Guarantee is endorsed, the Subsidiary Guarantee shall be valid and obligatory nevertheless.
The delivery of any Note by the Trustee, after the authentication thereof hereunder, shall constitute due delivery of the Subsidiary Guarantee set forth in this Supplemental Indenture on behalf of the Guarantors.
In the event that the Company creates or acquires any new Domestic Subsidiaries subsequent to the date of this Supplemental Indenture, if required by Section 5.03 of this Supplemental Indenture, the Company shall cause such Domestic Subsidiaries to execute supplemental indentures to the Indenture and Subsidiary Guarantees in accordance with Section 5.03 of this Supplemental Indenture and this Article IX, to the extent applicable.

(b) either Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance occurs with respect to such Notes in compliance with Article VII of this Supplemental Indenture; or
(c) with respect to any Subsidiary Guarantees created after the Issue Date, the release by the holders of the Indebtedness of the Company described in Section 5.03(a) of this Supplemental Indenture of their Guarantee by such Domestic Subsidiary (including any deemed release upon payment in full of all obligations under such Indebtedness), at such time as (A) no other Indebtedness of the Company has been guaranteed by such Domestic Subsidiary or (B) the holders of all such other Indebtedness which is guaranteed by such Domestic Subsidiary also release their Guarantee by such Domestic Subsidiary (including any deemed release upon payment in full of all obligations under such Indebtedness).
The Trustee, at the expense and written direction of the Company, will execute proper instruments acknowledging the termination of such Subsidiary Guarantee as reasonably required by the representative of such Guarantor.
Any Guarantor not released from its obligations under its Subsidiary Guarantee shall remain liable for the full amount of principal and premium, if any, of and interest on the Notes and for the other obligations of any Guarantor under the Indenture as provided in this Article IX.

(b) each Guarantor waives any and all other rights and defenses available to the Guarantor by reason of Sections 2787 to 2855, inclusive, 2899 and 3433 of the California Civil Code, including any and all rights or defenses Guarantor may have by reason of protection afforded to the principal with respect to any of the Guarantor's obligations, or to any other guarantor of any of the Guarantor's obligations with respect to any of such guarantor's obligations under its guaranty, in either case pursuant to the antideficiency or other laws of the State of California limiting or discharging the principal's indebtedness or such guarantor's obligations, including Section 580a, 580b, 580d, or 726 of the California Code of Civil Procedure; and
(c) each Guarantor waives all rights and defenses arising out of an election of remedies by the creditor, even though that election of remedies, such as a nonjudicial foreclosure with respect to security for any Subsidiary Guarantee obligation, has destroyed Guarantor's rights of subrogation and reimbursement against the principal by the operation of Section 580d of the Code of Civil Procedure or otherwise; and even though that election of remedies by the creditor, such as nonjudicial foreclosure with respect to security for an obligation of any other guarantor of any of the Guarantor's obligations, has destroyed Guarantor's rights of contribution against such other guarantor.
No other provision of this Article IX shall be construed as limiting the generality of any of the covenants and waivers set forth in this Section 9.06. In accordance with Section 10.06 of this Supplemental Indenture, the Subsidiary Guarantees shall be governed by, and shall be construed and enforced in accordance with, the internal laws of the State of New York. This Section 9.06 is included solely out of an abundance of caution, and shall not be construed to mean that any of the above-referenced provisions of California law are in any way applicable to the Subsidiary Guarantees or to any of the Guarantor's obligations.

The Company issued the Notes under an Indenture dated as of April 14, 2010 (the "Base Indenture"), as supplemented by that Supplemental Indenture dated as of April 14, 2010 (the "Supplemental Indenture" and, together with the Base Indenture, the "Indenture"), each among the Company, the Guarantors and the Trustee. The terms of the Notes include those stated in the Indenture and those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (15 U.S.C.   77aaa-77bbbb) as in effect on the date of the Indenture (the "Trust Indenture Act"). Terms defined in the Indenture and not defined herein have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Indenture. The Notes are subject to all such terms, and Holders are referred to the Indenture and the Trust Indenture Act for a statement of those terms.
The Company shall be entitled, subject to its compliance with Section 2.03(e) of the Supplemental Indenture, to create and issue further securities having the same ranking and terms and conditions as the Notes in all respects, except for the issue date, the public offering price and, in some cases, the first Interest Payment Date. The Notes initially issued on the Issue Date and any additional Notes shall be treated as a single class for all purposes under the Indenture.
 
Except as described below, the Notes will not be redeemable by the Company prior to Maturity.
At any time prior to April 15, 2013, the Company may redeem up to 35% of the principal amount of the Notes with the net cash proceeds of one or more Public Equity Offerings of its common stock at a redemption price (expressed as a percentage of principal amount) of 106.75%, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the Redemption Date; : (1) at least 65% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes originally issued on the Issue Date remains Outstanding after each such redemption; and (2) notice of any such redemption is mailed within 60 days of each such Public Equity Offering (with a copy to the Trustee).
provided that
"Public Equity Offering" means an underwritten public offering of common stock (other than redeemable Capital Stock) of the Company with gross cash proceeds to the Company of at least $50.0 million pursuant to an effective registration statement filed pursuant to the Securities Act (other than a registration statement on Form S-4 (or any successor form covering substantially the same transactions), Form S-8 (or any successor form covering substantially the same transactions) or otherwise relating to equity securities issuable under any employee benefit plan).
In addition, the Company shall have the right to redeem the Notes at any time in whole, or from time to time, in part at a redemption price (the "Redemption Price") equal to the greater of: (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed; and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Notes to be redeemed, exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption, discounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Yield, plus fifty (50) basis points, plus accrued interest to the date of redemption.
 
The Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. Notice of redemption (with a copy to the Trustee) shall be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the Redemption Date to each Holder to be redeemed at his or her registered address.
 
If a Change of Control Repurchase Event occurs, unless the Company has exercised its right to redeem the Notes pursuant to the Indenture, the Company shall be required to make an offer to each Holder of the Notes to repurchase all or a portion of such Holder's Notes (the "Change of Control Offer"), at a purchase price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued interest, if any, to the date of purchase (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on an interest payment date that is on or prior to the date fixed for redemption). Within 30 days following the date upon which the Change of Control Repurchase Event occurred, the Company must send (with a copy to the Trustee), by first class mail, a notice to each Holder, which notice shall govern the terms of the Change of Control Offer and shall be in compliance with the Indenture. Holders electing to have a Note purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer shall be required to surrender the Note, with the form entitled "Option of Holder to Elect Purchase" on the reverse of the Note completed, to the Paying Agent at the address specified in the notice.
 
The Notes are in registered form without coupons in minimum denominations of $2,000 principal and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. A Holder may register, transfer or exchange Notes in accordance with the Indenture. The Registrar may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements or transfer documents and to pay any taxes and fees required by law or permitted by the Indenture. The Registrar need not register the transfer of or exchange any Notes selected for redemption (except, in the case of a Note to be redeemed in part, the portion of the Note not to be redeemed) or any Notes for a period of 15 days before a selection of Notes to be redeemed.
 
The registered Holder of this Note may be treated as the owner of it for all purposes.
 
Subject to certain conditions set forth in the Indenture, the Company at any time shall be entitled to terminate some or all of its and the Guarantors' obligations under the Notes and the Indenture if the Company deposits with the Trustee money or U.S. Government Obligations for the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes to redemption or maturity, as the case may be.
 
The Indenture, the Subsidiary Guarantees or the Notes may be amended or supplemented as provided in the Indenture.
 
If any Event of Default (as defined in the Indenture) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then Outstanding Notes may declare all the Notes to be due and payable by notice in writing to the Company and the Trustee (if declared by the Holders) specifying the respective Event of Default and that it is a "notice of acceleration," and the same shall
 
become immediately due and payable. Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture and the Trust Indenture Act. Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then Outstanding Notes may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. However, the Trustee may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines may be unduly prejudicial to the rights of other Holders of Notes or that may involve the Trustee in personal liability. The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement regarding compliance with the Indenture, and the Company is required upon becoming aware of any Default or Event of Default, to deliver to the Trustee a statement specifying such Default or Event of Default.

AutoNation, Inc.

Fort Lauderdale, FL 33301
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as special counsel to AutoNation, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the public offering of $400,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 6.750% Senior Notes due 2018 (the "Notes") to be issued under the Indenture, dated as of the date hereof (the "Base Indenture"), among the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by the supplemental indenture, dated as of the date hereof, to the Base Indenture (the "Supplemental Indenture" and together with the Base Indenture, the "Indenture") among the Company, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto (the "Guarantors") and the Trustee. The Indenture provides that the Notes will be guaranteed (the "Guarantees" and, together with the Notes, the "Securities") by the Guarantors.
This opinion is being furnished in accordance with the requirements of Item 601(b)(5) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act").
In connection with this opinion, we have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of

We have also examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such records of the Company and the Guarantors and such agreements, certificates and receipts of public officials, certificates of officers or other representatives of the Company, the Guarantors and others, and such other documents as we have deemed necessary or appropriate as a basis for the opinions set forth below.
In our examination, we have assumed the legal capacity of all natural persons, the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as facsimile, electronic, certified or photostatic copies, and the authenticity of the originals of such copies. In making our examination of executed documents, we have assumed that the parties thereto, other than the Company but including the Guarantors, had the power, corporate or other, to enter into and perform all obligations thereunder and have also assumed the due authorization by all requisite action, corporate or other, and the execution and delivery by such parties of such documents and the validity and binding effect thereof on such parties. We have also assumed that each Guarantor has been duly organized and is validly existing in good standing, and has requisite legal status and legal capacity, under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization and that each Guarantor has complied and will comply with all aspects of the laws of all relevant jurisdictions (including the laws of each such Guarantors jurisdiction of organization) in connection with the transactions contemplated by, and the performance of obligations under, the Indenture and the Securities, other than the laws of the United States of America and the State of New York insofar as we express our opinions herein. As to any facts material to the opinions expressed herein that we did not independently establish or verify, we have relied upon statements and representations of officers and other representatives of the Company, the Guarantors and others and of public officials, including the facts set forth in the Company's Certificate.
The opinions set forth below are subject to the following further qualifications, assumptions and limitations:

We do not express any opinion as to any laws other than Delaware corporate law and those laws, rules and regulations of the State of New York that, in our experience, are normally applicable to transactions of the type contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement and the Indenture and, to the extent that judicial or regulatory orders or decrees or consents, approvals, licenses, authorizations, validations, filings, recordings or registrations with governmental authorities are relevant, to those required under such laws (all of the foregoing being referred to as "Opined on Law"). We do not express any opinion with respect to the law of any jurisdiction other than Opined on Law or as to the effect of any such non-Opined on Law on the opinion herein. Insofar as the opinions expressed herein relate to matters governed by laws other than those set forth in the preceding sentence, we have assumed, without having made any independent investigation, that such laws do not affect any of the opinions set forth herein.
Based upon the foregoing and subject to the limitations, qualifications, exceptions and assumptions set forth herein, we are of the opinion that:
 
 
We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion with the Commission as an exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the Commission on the date hereof. We also hereby consent to the reference to our firm under the caption "Legal Matters" in the Registration Statement. In giving this consent, we do not thereby admit that we are included in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act or the rules and regulations of the Commission promulgated thereunder. This opinion is expressed as of the date hereof unless otherwise expressly stated, and we disclaim any undertaking to advise you of any subsequent changes in the facts stated or assumed herein or of any subsequent changes in applicable law.
Very truly yours,

Except as otherwise provided in this , no more than two (2) Competitive Bid Quote Requests shall be given within five (5) Business Days (or such other number of days as the Borrower and the Administrative Agent may agree) of any other Competitive Bid Quote Request.
Section 2.5(b)
(c) (i) Each Revolving Credit Lender may submit one or more Competitive Bid Quotes, each containing an offer to make a Competitive Bid Loan in response to any Competitive Bid Quote Request; provided that, if the Borrower's request under hereof specified more than one Interest Period, such Lender may make a single submission containing one or more Competitive Bid Quotes for each such Interest Period.

(ii) Each Competitive Bid Quote shall be substantially in the form of attached hereto and shall specify:
Exhibit H
(A) the proposed date of borrowing and the Interest Period therefor;
(B) the principal amount of the Competitive Bid Loan for which each such offer is being made, which principal amount shall be at least $5,000,000 (or in increments of $1,000,000 in excess thereof); that the aggregate principal amount of all Competitive Bid Loans for which a Lender submits Competitive Bid Quotes may not exceed the principal amount of the Competitive Bid Borrowing for a particular Interest Period for which offers were requested;
provided
(C) in the case of a Competitive Bid Quote for Competitive Bid Loans at an Absolute Rate, the rate of interest per annum (rounded upwards, if necessary, to the nearest 1/10,000th of 1%) offered for each such Competitive Bid Loan (the "Absolute Rate");
(D) in the case of a Competitive Bid Quote for Competitive Bid Loans at the Eurodollar Competitive Rate, the positive or negative margin to be added to or deducted from the Interbank Offered Rate; and
(E) the identity of the quoting Lender.
Unless otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, no Competitive Bid Quote shall contain qualifying, conditional or similar language or propose terms other than or in addition to those set forth in the applicable Competitive Bid Quote Request and, in particular, no Competitive Bid Quote may be conditioned upon acceptance by the Borrower of all (or some specified minimum) of the principal amount of the Competitive Bid Loan for which such Competitive Bid Quote is being made. Any subsequent Competitive Bid Quote submitted by a Revolving Credit Lender that amends, modifies or is otherwise inconsistent with a previous Competitive Bid Quote submitted by such Lender with respect to the same Competitive Bid Quote Request shall be disregarded by the Borrower unless such subsequent Competitive Bid Quote is submitted solely to correct a manifest error in such former Competitive Bid Quote.
(d) The Borrower shall as promptly as practicable after the Competitive Bid Quote is submitted (but in any event not later than 12:00 Noon on (A) in the case of a Competitive Bid Loan at an Absolute Rate, the Quotation Date (or such other time and date as the Borrower and the Administrative Agent may agree) or (B) in the case of a Competitive Bid Loan at a Eurodollar Competitive Rate, the third Business Day prior to the proposed date of borrowing) notify the Administrative Agent and Revolving Credit Lenders of (x) the aggregate principal amount of the Competitive Bid Borrowing for which Competitive Bid Quotes have been received as well as the ranges of bids submitted for each Interest Period requested, (y) the respective principal amounts and Absolute Rates or Eurodollar Competitive Rates, as the case may be, so offered by each Revolving Credit Lender (identifying the Lender that made each Competitive Bid Quote), and (z) its acceptance or nonacceptance of the Competitive Bid Quotes.

The Borrower may accept any Competitive Bid Quote in whole or in part ( that any Competitive Bid Quote accepted in part shall be at least $5,000,000 or in increments of $1,000,000 in excess thereof); that:
provided
provided

Section 2.5(c)(ii)
Section 2.5(a)
Any of the conditions above notwithstanding, the Borrower may, in its sole discretion, accept a Competitive Bid Quote that does not contain the lowest Absolute Rate or Eurodollar Competitive Rates, as the case may be, where acceptance of the Competitive Bid Quote containing the lowest Absolute Rate or Eurodollar Competitive Rate, as the case may be, would be less favorable to the Borrower or would cause the principal amount of Outstanding Revolving Credit Obligations to exceed the Total Revolving Credit Commitment.
If Competitive Bid Quotes are made by two or more Revolving Credit Lenders with the same Absolute Rates or Eurodollar Competitive Rates, as the case may be, for a greater aggregate principal amount than the amount in respect of which Competitive Bid Quotes are accepted for the related Interest Period after the acceptance of all Competitive Bid Quotes, if any, of all lower Absolute Rates or Eurodollar Competitive Rates, as the case may be, offered by any Revolving Credit Lender for such related Interest Period, the principal amount of Competitive Bid Loans in respect of which such Competitive Bid Quotes are accepted shall be allocated by the Borrower among such Lenders as nearly as possible (in amounts of at least $1,000,000 or in increments of $100,000 in excess thereof) in proportion to the aggregate principal amount of such Competitive Bid Quotes. Determinations by the Borrower of the amounts of Competitive Bid Loans and the lowest bid after adjustment as provided in shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.
Section 2.5(d)(iii)
(e) Any Revolving Credit Lender whose offer to make any Competitive Bid Loan has been accepted shall, not later than 1:00 P.M. on the date specified for the making of such Loan, make the amount of such Loan available to the Borrower as shall be directed by the Authorized Representative in Dollars and in immediately available funds.

The Administrative Agent's notice to the Borrower shall specify (A) the aggregate principal amount of the Competitive Bid Borrowing for which Competitive Bid Quotes have been received and (B) the respective principal amounts and Absolute Rates or Eurodollar Competitive Rate, as the case may be, offered by each Revolving Credit Lender (identifying the Lender that made each Competitive Bid Quote). Not later than 12:00 Noon on (A) the third Business Day prior to the proposed date of borrowing, in the case of Competitive Bid Loans at the Eurodollar Competitive Rate or (B) the Quotation Date (or, in any such case, such other time and date as the Borrower and the Administrative Agent may agree), the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of their acceptance or nonacceptance of the Competitive Bid Quotes so notified to it (and the failure of the Borrower to give such notice by such time shall constitute nonacceptance) and the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each affected Lender.

The Borrower agrees that no Indemnified Party shall have any liability (whether direct or indirect, in contract or tort or otherwise) to it, any of its Subsidiaries, any Guarantor, or any security holders or creditors thereof arising out of, related to or in connection with the transactions contemplated herein, except to the extent that such liability resulted from such Indemnified Party's gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Borrower agrees not to assert any claim against any Agent-Related Person, any Lender, any of their Affiliates, or any of their respective directors, officers, employees, attorneys, agents, and advisers, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential, or punitive damages arising out of or otherwise relating to the Loan Documents, any of the transactions contemplated herein or the Fourth Amendment or the actual or proposed use of the proceeds of the Loans.

11.11 . This Agreement, together with the other Loan Documents, constitutes the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all previous proposals, negotiations, representations, commitments and other communications between or among the parties, both oral and written, with respect thereto (except that those provisions (if any) which by the express terms of (i) the commitment letter dated as of June 6, 2005, executed by JPMorgan Chase Bank, J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Bank of America, N.A. and Banc of America Securities LLC and accepted by the Borrower, (ii) the commitment letter, dated as of March 6, 2006, executed by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P.

Agreement Controls
11.13 . Notwithstanding any other provision herein, the aggregate interest rate charged hereunder, including all charges or fees in connection therewith deemed in the nature of interest under applicable law shall not exceed the Highest Lawful Rate (as such term is defined below). If the rate of interest (determined without regard to the preceding sentence) under this Agreement at any time exceeds the Highest Lawful Rate (as defined below), the outstanding amount of the Loans made hereunder shall bear interest at the Highest Lawful Rate until the total amount of interest due hereunder equals the amount of interest which would have been due hereunder if the stated rates of interest set forth in this Agreement had at all times been in effect. In addition, if when the Loans made hereunder are repaid in full the total interest due hereunder (taking into account the increase provided for above) is less than the total amount of interest which would have been due hereunder if the stated rates of interest set forth in this Agreement had at all times been in effect, then to the extent permitted by law, the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to the difference between the amount of interest paid and the amount of interest which would have been paid if the Highest Lawful Rate had at all times been in effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is the intention of the Lenders and the Borrower to conform strictly to any applicable usury laws. Accordingly, if any Lender contracts for, charges, or receives any consideration which constitutes interest in excess of the Highest Lawful Rate, then any such excess shall be cancelled automatically and, if previously paid, shall at such Lender's option be applied to the outstanding amount of the Loans made hereunder or be refunded to the Borrower. As used in this paragraph, the term "Highest Lawful Rate" means the maximum lawful interest rate, if any, that at any time or from time to time may be contracted for, charged, or received under the laws applicable to such Lender which are presently in effect or, to the extent allowed by law, under such applicable laws which may hereafter be in effect and which allow a higher maximum nonusurious interest rate than applicable laws now allow.

EXHIBIT B

Exhibit 99.1
 
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla., (April 14, 2010)  (NYSE: AN), America's largest automotive retailer, announced that today it closed its previously announced offering of $400 million aggregate principal amount of 6.75% senior unsecured notes due 2018 (referred to as the "2018 Notes").
AutoNation, Inc.
AutoNation also announced that today it accepted for payment all Floating Rate Notes due 2013 and 7% Senior Notes due 2014 (these two series of notes are referred to as the "old notes") that were validly tendered prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on April 13, 2010 (the "consent deadline") pursuant to the previously announced cash tender offers and related consent solicitations. Holders of 99.6% of the outstanding Floating Rate Notes due 2013 and holders of 88.8% of the outstanding 7% Senior Notes due 2014, representing $263.3 million aggregate principal amount of old notes, validly tendered their old notes and provided their consents prior to the consent deadline. As a result of receiving consents from the holders of more than 50% of each series of the old notes, AutoNation entered into a supplemental indenture primarily to eliminate most of the restrictive covenants and certain events of default contained in the indenture for the old notes. The cash tender offers remain open for holders of old notes that have not yet tendered, and are scheduled to expire at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on April 27, 2010, (the "expiration time"), unless extended or earlier terminated by AutoNation.
AutoNation also announced that today it entered into an amendment to the credit agreement governing its term loan and revolving credit facilities. Pursuant to such amendment, the maturity date for $479.4 million of term loan borrowings and $581.6 million of revolving credit commitments was extended from July 18, 2012 to July 18, 2014. The maturity date for $54.0 million of term loan borrowings and $57.0 million of revolving credit commitments, relating to lenders that did not consent to the extension, remains July 18, 2012. The size of the term loan facility was reduced from $600 million to $533.4 million, and the size of the revolving credit facility was reduced from $700 million to $638.6 million. The amendment also modified certain financial covenants, including an increase in the maximum leverage ratio from 2.75x to 3.25x and a decrease in the maximum capitalization ratio from 65% to 60%. In calculating the capitalization ratio, AutoNation is now permitted to exclude goodwill, franchise rights and long-lived asset impairments subsequent to 2007.
A portion of the proceeds from the sale of the 2018 Notes was used to pay $273.8 million (which included the consent payments and accrued and unpaid interest) for the old notes that were validly tendered prior to the consent deadline, and also to reduce borrowings under the term loan facility of the credit agreement. The remaining proceeds from the issuance of the 2018 Notes will be used to pay the consideration with respect to any additional old notes validly tendered prior to the expiration time, transaction fees and expenses and for general corporate purposes.
The depositary and information agent for the offers and consent solicitations is Global Bondholder Services Corporation. The dealer managers for the offers are Banc of America Securities LLC ((888) 292-0070 (toll-free), (980) 388-9217 (collect)), J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. ((866) 834-4666 (toll-free), (212) 834-3424 (collect)) and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC ((866) 309-6316 (toll-free), (704) 715-8341 (collect)).

Based on CNW Research data, in the first quarter, total U.S. industry new retail vehicle unit sales increased 15%. AutoNation's new vehicle unit sales increased 19%.
AutoNation's 2010 first quarter used retail vehicle revenue increased 23%, as unit sales increased 12% and revenue per vehicle increased 11%. Parts and service revenue increased 1% and finance and insurance revenue increased 25% compared to the first quarter 2009.
Commenting on the first quarter, Mike Jackson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, "We delivered strong double-digit growth in the first quarter, which was driven by both new and used vehicle unit sales and revenue. We have seen growth in all regions for two quarters led by our largest state Florida, which was one of the first states to experience the effects of the economic downturn. First quarter revenue for Florida was up 29%. We see an improved sales environment going forward." Mr. Jackson also stated, "By lowering our structural costs, and efficiently managing our inventory, we were able to deliver substantial EPS growth in a steadily improving retail sales environment."
Commenting on the debt refinancing transactions previously announced by AutoNation, Michael Short, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, stated, "These transactions extended our debt maturities, increased our available liquidity, and lowered our exposure to interest rate increases in the future. We believe that these transactions will provide us with additional flexibility to manage our business and optimize capital allocation going forward."

The Domestic segment is comprised of stores that sell vehicles manufactured by General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler; the Import segment is comprised of stores that sell vehicles manufactured primarily by Toyota, Honda, and Nissan; and the Premium Luxury segment is comprised of stores that sell vehicles manufactured primarily by Mercedes, BMW, and Lexus.

According to Amendment No. 26 to Schedule 13D (the "") filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "") on November 24, 2009 by a group consisting of ESL Partners, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, ESL Institutional Partners, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, ESL Investors, L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company, ESL Investments, Inc., a Delaware S corporation, CBL Partners, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, Tynan, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, ESL Investment Management, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, RBS Partners, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, RBS Investment Management, L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company, Edward S.

As a result of the Repurchase, the ESL Affiliates beneficially own approximately 50.2% of the Company's Common Stock. The ESL Schedule 13D and all amendments thereto, filed with the SEC by the ESL Affiliates, and the various Form 4s of certain members of the ESL Affiliates filed with the SEC subsequent to Amendment No. 26 to the ESL Schedule 13D, contain additional information regarding the ESL Affiliates' beneficial ownership, including the amount of consideration and source of funds used by the ESL Affiliates to purchase the Company's Common Stock.

As reported on the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K, filed with the SEC on January 29, 2009 (the ""), the Company entered into letter agreements with certain automotive manufacturers in order to, among other things, eliminate any potential adverse consequences under such manufacturers' framework agreements with the Company in the event that the ESL Affiliates acquire fifty percent (50%) or more of the Company's Common Stock, including letter agreements with American Honda Motor Co., Inc. ("") and Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc ("") (such agreements, as amended, the "" and the "," respectively). Also parties to both the Honda and Toyota Agreements are certain of the ESL Affiliates. Among other things, the Toyota and Honda Agreements contain consents and waivers by Toyota and Honda of all the rights and remedies available to them pursuant to the manufacturers' framework agreements with the Company with respect to the acquisition by the ESL Affiliates of fifty percent (50%) or more of the Company's Common Stock, provided that: (1) the ESL Affiliates will appear at each stockholders meeting of the Company or otherwise cause all of their shares of the Company's Common Stock to be counted as present for the purpose of establishing a quorum and (2) the ESL Affiliates will vote all shares of the Company's Common Stock in excess of fifty percent (50%) of the then outstanding shares on each matter subject to a stockholder vote in the same proportion as all outstanding shares not owned by the ESL Affiliates are actually voted on such matter. Furthermore, under both the Honda and Toyota Agreements, the Company agreed that a majority of the Company's Board of Directors will be independent from both the Company and from the ESL Affiliates under existing New York Stock Exchange listing standards. The Honda and Toyota Agreements also contain other governance-related provisions as disclosed in the January 2009 8-K.

Certain additional matters relating to the Toyota Agreement are discussed in the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 24, 2009 and Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2010.
While the ESL Affiliates may be deemed beneficial owners of more than fifty percent (50%) of the Company's Common Stock, it is the Company's belief that the Repurchase, and the resulting percentage change in beneficial ownership by the ESL Affiliates in the Company's Common Stock, do not constitute a change in "control" as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
The foregoing summaries of the Honda Agreement and Toyota Agreement do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to such agreements.

Based on CNW Research data, in the second quarter, total U.S. industry new retail vehicle unit sales increased 12%. AutoNation's new vehicle unit sales increased 20%.
AutoNation's 2010 second quarter used retail vehicle revenue increased 28% compared to the year-ago period, as retail unit sales increased 20% and revenue per vehicle retailed increased 7%. Parts and service revenue increased 3% and finance and insurance revenue increased 18% compared to the second quarter 2009.
Mike Jackson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, "We delivered strong double-digit growth in the second quarter, which was driven by both new and used vehicle unit sales and revenue. We continue to expect full year industry new vehicle unit sales to be in the range of 11.5 million new units. We expect third quarter new vehicle industry sales will equal or surpass third quarter 2009 new vehicle industry sales even though the prior year included the highly successful Cash for Clunkers program. We continue to see a solid automotive recovery going forward."
AutoNation repurchased 20.9 million shares of its common stock in the second quarter for $414.4 million ($19.83 per share). On July 20, 2010, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $250 million of AutoNation common stock. As of such date, AutoNation had utilized substantially all of the amounts previously approved by its Board of Directors under its existing share repurchase program. As a result of the share buybacks, AutoNation had 149.3 million shares outstanding at the end of the second quarter, down from 169.9 million at the end of the first quarter. There are currently 146.4 million shares outstanding.
AutoNation also announced that it has signed agreements to acquire Toyota Mall of Georgia and Hyundai Mall of Georgia in the Atlanta market and that it recently completed the acquisition of Hyundai of Seattle. Toyota Mall of Georgia, which includes Scion, is one of the largest Toyota dealerships in the United States. The annual revenue run rate for all three acquisitions is approximately $200 million. The acquisitions of Toyota Mall of Georgia and Hyundai Mall of Georgia are subject to customary closing conditions and are expected to be completed in third quarter 2010.
Mr. Jackson stated, "We believe that we have a compelling opportunity to create significant value for stockholders over the next several years as the industry recovers. Our stock repurchases, together with the acquisitions that we announced, reflect our confidence in AutoNation's financial and operating strength and the long-term prospects in the auto industry. The combination of these drivers presents a significant long term growth and value creation opportunity."
AutoNation has three operating segments: Domestic, Import, and Premium Luxury. The Domestic segment is comprised of stores that sell vehicles manufactured by General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler; the Import segment is comprised of stores that sell vehicles manufactured primarily by Toyota, Honda, and Nissan; and the Premium Luxury segment is comprised of stores that sell vehicles manufactured primarily by Mercedes, BMW, and Lexus. Segment results for the second quarter were as follows:
 
 
 
(1) Segment income is defined as operating income less floorplan interest expense.
 
For the six-month period ended June 30, 2010, the Company reported adjusted net income from continuing operations of $121 million or $0.72 per share compared to $90 million or $0.51 for the same period in the prior year. Adjusted net income excludes refinancing costs of $12 million after-tax, or $0.07 per share, for the first half of 2010, and a net benefit of $17 million after-tax, or $0.09 per share, primarily related to a net gain on asset sales and a gain on senior note repurchases for the first half of 2009. On a GAAP basis, net income from continuing operations for the six-month period ended June 30, 2010 was $108 million or $0.65 per share compared to $107 million or $0.60 per share for prior year period. The Company's revenue for the six-month period ended June 30, 2010 totaled $6.0 billion, up 19% compared to $5.0 billion in the prior year.

AutoNation's 2010 third quarter revenue totaled $3.3 billion, compared to $2.9 billion in the year-ago period, an increase of 13%, driven primarily by stronger new and used retail vehicle revenue which increased 15%.

On December 7, 2010, AutoNation, Inc. (the "Company" or "AutoNation") received a notice from the Plan Administrator of the AutoNation 401(k) Plan (the "Plan") notifying the Company of a blackout period under the Plan, pursuant to Section 101(i)(2)(E) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended. The blackout period is required due to a change in the recordkeepers for the Plan. During the blackout period, participants in the Plan will be temporarily unable to change their contribution rates, request withdrawals or distributions, request new loans, change investment selections or otherwise perform account transactions under the Plan. The blackout period is expected to begin on December 28, 2010 and end on January 22, 2011.
On December 7, 2010, the Company sent a notice to its directors and executive officers informing them of the blackout period and the related AutoNation common stock trading restrictions (including with respect to derivatives) that apply to them during the blackout period, pursuant to Section 306 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Section 104 of Regulation BTR under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
A copy of the notice to the Company's directors and executive officers is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. Stockholders or other interested parties may obtain, without charge, information regarding the blackout period by contacting AutoNation Corporate Human Resources Compensation Department at (954) 769-7315 or YourTotalRewards@AutoNation.com.
 
 
99.1    Notice to Directors and Executive Officers dated December 7, 2010.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
Federal securities laws require us to send you a notice whenever restrictions are imposed on your trading in common stock (including derivatives) of AutoNation, Inc. ("AutoNation") due to a blackout of the AutoNation 401(k) Plan (the "Plan") that lasts for a period of more than three consecutive business days. The Plan will be changing recordkeepers from Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated to Wells Fargo Institutional Retirement and Trust, and as a result, there will be a blackout period (the "Blackout Period") during which participants in the Plan will be temporarily unable to change their contribution rates, request withdrawals or distributions, request new loans, change investment selections or otherwise perform account transactions under the Plan. The Blackout Period is expected to begin December 28, 2010 and end on January 22, 2011.
. As a director or executive officer of AutoNation, these prohibitions apply to you and to members of your immediate family who share your household, as well as to trusts, corporations and other entities whose stock ownership may be attributed to you. The trading prohibition does not apply, however, to certain transactions, such as qualified Rule 10b5-1 trading plan transactions, bona fide gifts or transactions involving equity securities that were not acquired in connection with your services as a director or executive officer.
Under Section 306(a)(1) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Rule 101 of Regulation BTR under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, during the Blackout Period,
all directors and executive officers of AutoNation are prohibited, with limited exceptions, from purchasing, selling or otherwise acquiring or transferring any AutoNation common stock (including exercising stock options) or any derivatives of AutoNation common stock, regardless of whether the director or officer participates in the Plan
Any profit realized by a director or executive officer from any non-exempt transaction involving AutoNation common stock during the Blackout Period is recoverable by AutoNation. You should seek securities law advice if you plan to engage in any potential stock transactions during the Blackout Period.
If you have questions regarding the Blackout Period, including when it has started or ended, you may contact the AutoNation Corporate Human Resources Compensation Department at 200 SW 1st Ave, Ste 1400, Fort Lauderdale, FL 33301, telephone: (954) 769-7315, email: YourTotalRewards@AutoNation.com.

As previously disclosed on a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 29, 2009 (the "January 2009 8-K") by AutoNation, Inc. (the "Company"), the Board of Directors of the Company approved a letter agreement with Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. ("Toyota," and such agreement, as amended to date, the "Toyota Agreement") in order to, among other things, eliminate any potential adverse consequences under Toyota's framework agreement with the Company in the event that ESL Investments, Inc. and certain investment affiliates of ESL Investments, Inc. (together, "ESL") acquires more than fifty percent (50%) of the Company's common stock. The Toyota Agreement includes certain governance-related and other provisions as described in the January 2009 8-K. ESL currently owns approximately 55% of the Company's outstanding common stock.
Under the Toyota Agreement (as previously extended), Toyota's consent (the "Consent") to ESL acquiring more than fifty percent (50%) of the Company's common stock would have terminated on December 31, 2010, solely with respect to ESL purchases of the Company's common stock after such date.
At ESL's request, Toyota has granted a one-year extension of its Consent under the Toyota Agreement (such extension, the "Second Extension Agreement"), and the Company signed an acknowledgement to the Second Extension Agreement, which is dated December 16, 2010. Toyota's Consent under the Toyota Agreement will now terminate on December 31, 2011, solely with respect to purchases of the Company's common stock by ESL after such date, provided that ESL may continue to seek successive annual one-year extensions of Toyota's Consent, and Toyota shall not unreasonably withhold or delay its consent thereto. All other terms and conditions of the Toyota Agreement were unchanged.
The foregoing summaries of the Toyota Agreement and the Second Extension Agreement are qualified in their entirety by reference to such agreements. The Toyota Agreement, together with all amendments thereto, including the Second Extension Agreement, are filed as exhibits hereto, and each is incorporated herein by reference.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

On January 7, 2011, pursuant to Section 306 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Section 104 of Regulation BTR, the Company sent an updated notice (the "Updated Notice") to its directors and executive officers informing them that because the change in recordkeepers and the related data transfers are expected to be completed earlier than anticipated, the blackout period is now expected to end on January 10, 2011. A copy of the Updated Notice is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
(d) Exhibits
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
This is an update to the notice we sent you on December 7, 2010. As you may recall, we sent that notice because federal securities laws require us to send you a notice whenever restrictions are imposed on your trading in common stock (including derivatives) of AutoNation, Inc. ("AutoNation") due to a blackout of the AutoNation 401(k) Plan (the "Plan") that lasts for a period of more than three consecutive business days. The Plan is changing recordkeepers from Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated to Wells Fargo Institutional Retirement and Trust, and as a result, there has been a blackout period (the "Blackout Period") during which participants in the Plan have been temporarily unable to change their contribution rates, request withdrawals or distributions, request new loans, change investment selections or otherwise perform account transactions under the Plan.
The Blackout Period was expected to end on January 22, 2011.
Because the change in recordkeepers and the related data transfers are expected to be completed earlier than anticipated, the Blackout Period is now expected to end on January 10, 2011.

Full Year 2010 Results
 
 
 
Acquisition
 
America's largest automotive retailer, today reported fourth quarter 2010 net income from continuing operations of $68 million, or $0.45 per share, an improvement of 55% (on a per share basis) compared to adjusted net income from continuing operations of $50 million, or $0.29 per share, for the same period in the prior year. Adjusted net income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2009 excludes a benefit from a tax adjustment of $13 million, or $0.07 per share, as disclosed in the attached financial tables. On a GAAP basis, fourth quarter 2009 net income from continuing operations was $63 million, or $0.36 per share. There were no adjusting items for the fourth quarter of 2010.
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla., (February 3, 2011) AutoNation, Inc. (NYSE: AN),
Fourth quarter 2010 revenue totaled $3.2 billion, compared to $2.8 billion in the year-ago period, a 16% increase driven primarily by stronger new vehicle revenue. In the fourth quarter, total U.S. industry new vehicle retail unit sales increased 6%, based on CNW Research data. AutoNation's new vehicle unit sales increased 15%, or 12% on a same-store basis.
AutoNation's 2010 fourth quarter used retail vehicle revenue increased 24% compared to the year-ago period, as used retail unit sales increased 21%. Parts and service revenue increased 9% and finance and insurance revenue increased 21% compared to the fourth quarter of 2009.
In the fourth quarter of 2010, gross profit per new vehicle retailed improved $405, or 20%, compared to the third quarter of 2010, primarily due to a $247 benefit per new vehicle retailed from the recognition of certain performance-based manufacturer incentives, which were primarily related to premium luxury vehicles previously sold. Operating income in the fourth quarter of 2010 was favorably impacted by $11.8 million related to these incentives.
Commenting on the fourth quarter, Mike Jackson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, "We are pleased to have delivered our highest ever annual and quarterly adjusted EPS from continuing operations while driving growth in all operating lines of business. We are proud of our strong year-over-year growth across all areas of our business, demonstrating our ability to perform in what we expect to be a multi-year recovery in auto retail."
AutoNation has three operating segments: Domestic, Import, and Premium Luxury. The Domestic segment is comprised of stores that sell vehicles manufactured by General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler; the Import segment is comprised of stores that sell vehicles manufactured primarily by Toyota, Honda, and Nissan; and the Premium Luxury segment is comprised of stores that sell vehicles manufactured primarily by Mercedes, BMW, and Lexus. Segment results for the fourth quarter were as follows:
 
 
 
For the full year ended December 31, 2010, the Company reported adjusted net income from continuing operations of $247 million or $1.56 per share, compared to $204 million or $1.15 per share for the prior year. Adjusted net income from continuing operations for 2010 excludes debt refinancing costs of $12 million after-tax, or $0.08 per share. Adjusted net income from continuing operations for 2009 excludes a net benefit of $29 million after-tax, or $0.16 per share, primarily related to a favorable tax adjustment, a net gain on asset sales and a gain on senior note repurchases. On a GAAP basis, net income from continuing operations for 2010 was $235 million, or $1.48 per share, compared to $233 million, or $1.31 per share, for the prior year. The Company's revenue for the full year ended December 31, 2010 totaled $12.5 billion, up 17% compared to $10.7 billion in the prior year.
Jackson also stated, "We are optimistic for the long-term prospects of the auto industry based on the successful restructuring of the domestic auto industry and the move to a demand-pull system. We expect a continued gradual increase in the selling rate over the course of the year and are using a planning assumption for 2011 industry new unit sales of 12.8 million units."
AutoNation also announced that it signed an agreement to acquire Ft. Myers Toyota in Florida. The annual revenue run rate is approximately $135 million. The acquisition of Ft. Myers Toyota is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to be completed by the end of the 2011 first quarter.

2011 Incentive Plan and AOP Plan Targets
On February 1, 2011, the Executive Compensation Subcommittee (the "Subcommittee") of the Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors (the "Board") of AutoNation, Inc. (the "Company") (i) selected the 2011 participants under the AutoNation, Inc. Senior Executive Incentive Bonus Plan (the "Incentive Plan"), (ii) established specific objective annual performance goals for 2011 under the Incentive Plan and the AutoNation Operating Performance Plan (the "AOP Plan"), which is the Company's corporate bonus plan, and (iii) set target awards for the 2011 participants under the Incentive Plan and the AOP Plan.
The Subcommittee selected the following senior executive officers to participate in the Incentive Plan for 2011, each of whom will be identified as a named executive officer in the Company's 2011 annual meeting proxy statement: Mike Jackson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Michael E. Maroone, President and Chief Operating Officer; Jonathan P. Ferrando, Executive Vice President, General Counsel & Secretary; and Michael J. Short, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (collectively, the "Senior Executive Officers"). These officers were selected to participate in the Incentive Plan to ensure tax deductibility of bonuses under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
The 2011 performance goals established by the Subcommittee under the Incentive Plan are based upon the achievement of specified levels of adjusted operating income per share (minus a net charge for capital deployed for acquisitions or share repurchases and certain extraordinary or other items) and adjusted operating income as a percentage of gross profit for the Company during 2011. The target awards under the Incentive Plan are expressed as a percentage of base salary for each Senior Executive Officer that ranges from 75% to 133 1/3%.
The 2011 performance goals established under the Incentive Plan also constitute the performance goals that the Committee established under the AOP Plan for other bonus-eligible, corporate-level employees, including Kevin P. Westfall, Senior Vice President, Sales, who will also be identified as a named executive officer in the Company's 2011 annual meeting proxy statement. The target awards under the AOP Plan are also expressed as a percentage of base salary, and Mr. Westfall's target award for 2011 is 45% of his base salary. The Senior Executive Officers do not participate in the AOP Plan.
Bonus awards under both the Incentive Plan and the AOP Plan will be payable on a sliding scale based on the Company's actual achievement relative to the predetermined goals, meaning that bonuses earned may exceed or be less than the targeted level, and bonus payouts are subject to minimum thresholds of performance. The Subcommittee has absolute "negative discretion" to eliminate or reduce the amount of any award under the Incentive Plan or the AOP Plan.
2011 Annual Stock Option and Restricted Stock Awards
On February 1, 2011, the Subcommittee also approved annual stock option and restricted stock awards to all of our equity grant-eligible employees under the AutoNation, Inc. 2008 Employee Equity and Incentive Plan (the "2008 Plan"). The annual awards include stock option awards to our Senior Executive Officers and Kevin P. Westfall, specifically, Mike Jackson  221,516 options, Michael E. Maroone  177,288 options, Jonathan P. Ferrando  133,212 options, Michael J. Short  133,212 options, and Kevin P. Westfall  13,316 options. Additionally, the annual awards include a restricted stock award to Mr. Westfall, who will receive 4,440 shares of restricted stock. The Senior Executive Officers did not receive restricted stock awards.
One-fourth (1/4) of each stock option award approved by the Subcommittee will be granted on the first trading day of each of March, June, September and December 2011, with an exercise price equal to the closing price of our common stock on each such grant date, subject to continuous employment through each such grant date. Each of the four option grants comprising an annual award will vest annually in equal installments over four years commencing on June 1, 2012 and will expire on March 1, 2021 (subject to earlier termination in accordance with the terms of the 2008 Plan and applicable award agreements). The restricted stock awards approved by the Subcommittee will be granted on the first trading day of March 2011 and will vest annually in equal installments over four years commencing on June 1, 2012.
On February 2, 2011, the Board approved an amendment and restatement of the Company's By-Laws (as amended and restated, the "Amended and Restated By-Laws") effective immediately. The following is a summary of the key amendments to the By-Laws:

The descriptions of the amendments to the By-Laws contained in this report are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the Amended and Restated By-Laws, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.1 and is incorporated herein by reference, and the Company's prior By-Laws, a copy of which was filed as Exhibit 3.1 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 8, 2008 and is incorporated herein by reference.

Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reliable reproduction of the writing or transmission authorizing another person or persons to act as proxy for a stockholder may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing or transmission for any and all purposes for which the original writing or transmission could be used; provided that such copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing or transmission.
. . At all meetings of the stockholders at which a quorum is present, except as otherwise required by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws, any question brought before any meeting of stockholders shall be decided by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the total number of votes of the capital stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on such question, voting as a single class. Except as otherwise required in the Certificate of Incorporation, the Board of Directors, in its discretion, or the officer of the Corporation presiding at a meeting of stockholders, in his or her discretion, may require that any votes cast at such meeting shall be cast by written ballot.

Only such business (other than the nominations for election to the Board of Directors, which must comply with the provisions of Section 2 of Article III) may be transacted at an annual meeting of stockholders as is either (a) specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors (or any duly authorized committee thereof), (b) otherwise properly brought before the annual meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors (or any duly authorized committee thereof) or (c) otherwise properly brought before the annual meeting by any stockholder of the Corporation (i) who is a stockholder of record on the date of the giving of the notice provided for in this Section 7 and on the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote at such annual meeting and (ii) who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 7.
Section 7
Nature of Business at Annual Meetings of Stockholders
In addition to any other applicable requirements, for business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder, such stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in proper written form to the Secretary of the Corporation.
To be timely, a stockholder's notice to the Secretary must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not less than ninety (90) days nor more than one-hundred twenty (120) days prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of stockholders (the "Meeting Anniversary Date"); provided, however, that in the event that the annual meeting is called for a date that is not within thirty (30) days before or after the Meeting Anniversary Date, notice by the stockholder in order to be timely must be so received not later than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which such notice of the date of the annual meeting was mailed or such public disclosure of the date of the annual meeting was made, whichever first occurs. In no event shall the adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting, or the public disclosure of such an adjournment or postponement, commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described above.
 
To be in proper written form, a stockholder's notice to the Secretary must set forth the following information: (a) as to each matter such stockholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting, a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting, and (b) as to the stockholder giving notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is being made, (i) the name and address of such person, (ii) (A) the class or series and number of all shares of stock of the Corporation which are owned beneficially or of record by such person and any affiliates (as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")) or associates (as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act) of such person, (B) the name of each nominee holder of shares of all stock of the Corporation owned beneficially but not of record by such person or any affiliates or associates of such person, and the number of such shares of stock of the Corporation held by each such nominee holder, (C) whether and the extent to which any derivative instrument, swap, option, warrant, short interest, hedge or profit interest or other transaction has been entered into by or on behalf of such person, or any affiliates or associates of such person, with respect to stock of the Corporation and (D) whether and the extent to which any other transaction, agreement, arrangement or understanding (including any short position or any borrowing or lending of shares of stock of the Corporation) has been made by or on behalf of such person, or any affiliates or associates of such person, the effect or intent of any of the foregoing being to mitigate loss to, or to manage risk or benefit of stock price changes for, such person, or any affiliates or associates of such person, or to increase or decrease the voting power or pecuniary or economic interest of such person, or any affiliates or associates of such person, with respect to stock of the Corporation, (iii) a description of all agreements, arrangements, or understandings (whether written or oral) between or among such person, or any affiliates or associates of such person, and any other person or persons (including their names) in connection with the proposal of such business and any material interest of such person or any affiliates or associates of such person, in such business, including any anticipated benefit therefrom to such person, or any affiliates or associates of such person, (iv) a representation that the stockholder giving notice intends to appear in person or by proxy at the annual meeting to bring such business before the meeting, and (v) any other information relating to such person that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filing required to be made in connection with the solicitation of proxies by such person with respect to the proposed business to be brought by such person before the annual meeting pursuant to Section 14 of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
A stockholder providing notice of business proposed to be brought before an annual meeting shall further update and supplement such notice, if necessary, so that the information provided or required to be provided in such notice pursuant to this Section 7 shall be true and correct as of the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to receive notice of the annual meeting and such update and supplement shall be delivered to or be mailed and received by the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than five (5) business days after the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to receive notice of the annual meeting.
 
No business shall be conducted at the annual meeting of stockholders except business brought before the annual meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 7; provided, however, that, once business has been properly brought before the annual meeting in accordance with such procedures, nothing in this Section 7 shall be deemed to preclude discussion by any stockholder of any such business. If the chairman of an annual meeting determines that business was not properly brought before the annual meeting in accordance with the foregoing procedures, the chairman shall declare to the meeting that the business was not properly brought before the meeting and such business shall not be transacted.
Nothing contained in this Section 7 shall be deemed to affect any rights of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the Corporation's proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act (or any successor provision of law).
. . In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors and which record date: (1) in the case of determination of stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders or adjournment thereof, shall not be more than sixty nor less than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting; and (2) in the case of any other action, shall not be more than sixty (60) days prior to such other action. If no record date is fixed: (1) the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held; and (2) the record date for determining stockholders for any other purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting. Nothing in this Section 8 shall in any way be construed to change the procedure for setting the record date and for determining the effectiveness of stockholder action by written consent as set forth in Section 9 of this Article II.
Section 8
Record Date
. .
Section 9
Written Consents
(a) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board of Directors may fix a record date (a "Consent Record Date"). The Consent Record Date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the Consent Record Date is adopted by the Board of Directors and shall not be more than ten (10) days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the Consent Record date is adopted by the Board of Directors. Any stockholder of record seeking to have the stockholders authorize or take corporate action by written consent shall, by written notice to the Secretary of the Corporation, request the Board of Directors to fix a Consent Record Date. To be valid, such written request shall set forth the purpose or purposes for which the written consent is
 
sought to be used, shall be signed by one or more stockholders of record (or their duly authorized proxies or other representatives) and shall bear the date of signature of each such stockholder (or proxy or other representative). The Board of Directors shall promptly, but in all events within ten (10) days after the date on which such a request is received, adopt a resolution fixing the Consent Record Date. If no Consent Record Date has been fixed by the Board of Directors within ten (10) days of the date on which such a request is received, the Consent Record Date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board of Directors is required by applicable law, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of business, or an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of stockholders meetings are recorded, to the attention of the Secretary of the Corporation. Delivery shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. If no Consent Record Date has been fixed by the Board of Directors and prior action by the Board of Directors is required by applicable law, the Consent Record Date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the date on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action.
(b) Every written consent shall be signed by a person or persons who as of the Consent Record Date is a stockholder of record on the Consent Record Date, shall bear the date of signature of each such stockholder, shall set forth the name and address, as they appear in the Corporation's books, of each stockholder signing such consent and the class and number of shares of the Corporation which are owned of record and beneficially by each such stockholder, and shall be delivered to the Corporation in the manner specified in Section 9(a). No written consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless, within sixty (60) days of the date the earliest dated written consent was received in accordance with Section 9(a), a written consent or consents signed by a sufficient number of holders to take such action are delivered to the Corporation in the manner prescribed in Section 9(a).
(c) In the event of the delivery, in the manner provided in Section 9(a), to the Corporation of the requisite written consent or consents to take corporate action and/or any related revocation or revocations, the Corporation shall engage independent inspectors of elections for the purpose of promptly performing a ministerial review of the validity of the consents and revocations. For the purpose of permitting the inspectors to perform such review, no action by written consent without a meeting shall be effective until such date as the independent inspectors certify to the Corporation that the consents represent at least the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to take the corporate action. Nothing contained in this paragraph (c) of Section 9 shall in any way be construed to suggest or imply that the Board of Directors or any stockholder shall not be entitled to contest the validity of any consent or revocation thereof, whether before or after certification by the independent inspectors, or to take any other action (including, without limitation, the commencement, prosecution or defense of any litigation with respect thereto, and the seeking of injunctive relief in such litigation).
 
. . The Board of Directors of the Corporation may adopt by resolution such rules and regulations for the conduct of the meeting of the stockholders as it shall deem appropriate. Except to the extent inconsistent with such rules and regulations as adopted by the Board of Directors, the chairman of any meeting of the stockholders shall have the right and authority to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and to do all such acts as, in the judgment of such chairman, are appropriate for the proper conduct of the meeting. Such rules, regulations or procedures, whether adopted by the Board of Directors or prescribed by the chairman of the meeting, may include, without limitation, the following: (i) the establishment of an agenda or order of business for the meeting; (ii) the determination of when the polls shall open and close for any given matter to be voted on at the meeting; (iii) rules and procedures for maintaining order at the meeting and the safety of those present; (iv) limitations on attendance at or participation in the meeting to stockholders of record of the Corporation, their duly authorized and constituted proxies or such other persons as the chairman of the meeting shall determine; (v) restrictions on entry to the meeting after the time fixed for the commencement thereof; and (vi) limitations on the time allotted to questions or comments by participants.

Section 11
Notices and Waivers
(a) Whenever written notice is required by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws, to be given to any stockholder, such notice may be given by mail, addressed to such stockholder, at such stockholder's address as it appears on the records of the Corporation, with postage thereon prepaid, and such notice shall be deemed to be given at the time when the same shall be deposited in the United States mail. Written notice may also be given personally or by electronic transmission, facsimile or any other lawful method.
(b) Whenever any notice is required by applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws, to be given to any stockholder, a waiver thereof in writing, signed by the person or persons entitled to notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent thereto. Attendance of a person at a meeting, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except where the person attends the meeting for the express purpose of objecting at the beginning of the meeting to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the stockholders need be specified in any written waiver of notice unless so required by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws.
. . In advance of any meeting of stockholders, the Board by resolution or the Chairman of the Board of Directors shall appoint one or more inspectors of election to act at the meeting and make a written report thereof. One or more other persons may be designated as alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act. If no inspector or alternate is present, ready and willing to act at a meeting of stockholders, the chairman of the meeting shall appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting. Unless otherwise required by law, inspectors may be officers, employees or agents of the Corporation. Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of his or her duties, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her ability. The inspector shall have the duties prescribed by law and shall take charge of the polls and, when the vote is completed, shall make a certificate of the result of the vote taken and of such other facts as may be required by law.
Section 12
Inspectors of Election
 
. . The Board of Directors shall consist of not more than 12 members, the exact number of which shall be determined from time to time by resolution adopted by the Board of Directors. Except as provided in Section 3 of this Article III, directors shall be elected by the stockholders at the annual meetings of stockholders (or special meetings called for the purpose of electing directors). Notwithstanding any provision in these By-Laws to the contrary, a nominee for director shall be elected to the Board of Directors if the votes cast for such nominee's election exceed the votes against such nominee's election; provided, however, that directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast at any meeting of stockholders for which the Secretary of the Corporation determines that the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected as of the date seven (7) days prior to the scheduled mailing date of the proxy statement for such meeting. Each director shall hold office for the term for which he or she is elected and qualified or until his or her successor shall have been elected and qualified or until his or her earlier resignation, removal from office or death. The Board of Directors may from time to time establish minimum qualifications for eligibility to become a director. Those qualifications may include, but shall not be limited to, a prerequisite stock ownership in the Corporation.
Section 1
Number and Election of Directors
. . Only persons who are nominated in accordance with the following procedures shall be eligible for election as directors of the Corporation, except as may be otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation with respect to the right of holders of preferred stock of the Corporation to nominate and elect a specified number of directors in certain circumstances. Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors may be made at any annual meeting of stockholders, or at any special meeting of stockholders called for the purpose of electing directors, (a) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors (or any duly authorized committee thereof) or (b) by any stockholder of the Corporation (i) who is a stockholder of record on the date of the giving of the notice provided for in this Section 2 and on the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at such annual meeting or special meeting and (ii) who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 2.
Section 2

In addition to any other applicable requirements, for a nomination to be made by a stockholder, such stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in proper written form to the Secretary of the Corporation.
To be timely, a stockholder's notice to the Secretary must be delivered to or be mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the Corporation (a) in the case of an annual meeting, not less than ninety (90) days nor more than one-hundred twenty (120) days prior to the Meeting Anniversary Date; provided, however, that in the event that the annual meeting is called for a date that is not within thirty (30) days before or after the Meeting Anniversary Date, notice by the stockholder in order to be timely must be so received not later
 
than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which such notice of the date of the annual meeting was mailed or such public disclosure of the date of the annual meeting was made, whichever first occurs, and (b) in the case of a special meeting of stockholders called for the purpose of electing directors, not later than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which notice of the date of the special meeting was mailed or public disclosure of the date of the special meeting was made, whichever first occurs. In no event shall the adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting or a special meeting called for the purpose of electing directors, or the public disclosure of such an adjournment or postponement, commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described above.
To be in proper written form, a stockholder's notice to the Secretary must set forth the following information: (a) as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election as a director (i) the name, age, business address and residence address of such person, (ii) the principal occupation or employment of such person, (iii) (A) the class or series and number of all shares of stock of the Corporation which are owned beneficially or of record by such person and any affiliates or associates of such person, (B) the name of each nominee holder of shares of all stock of the Corporation owned beneficially but not of record by such person or any affiliates or associates of such person, and the number of such shares of stock of the Corporation held by each such nominee holder, (C) whether and the extent to which any derivative instrument, swap, option, warrant, short interest, hedge or profit interest or other transaction has been entered into by or on behalf of such person, or any affiliates or associates of such person, with respect to stock of the Corporation and (D) whether and the extent to which any other transaction, agreement, arrangement or understanding (including any short position or any borrowing or lending of shares of stock of the Corporation) has been made by or on behalf of such person, or any affiliates or associates of such person, the effect or intent of any of the foregoing being to mitigate loss to, or to manage risk or benefit of stock price changes for, such person, or any affiliates or associates of such person, or to increase or decrease the voting power or pecuniary or economic interest of such person, or any affiliates or associates of such person, with respect to stock of the Corporation, and (iv) any other information relating to such person that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings required to be made in connection with solicitations of proxies for election of directors pursuant to Section 14 of the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder; and (b) as to the stockholder giving the notice, and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination is being made, (i) the name and record address of the stockholder giving the notice and the name and principal place of business of such beneficial owner, (ii) (A) the class or series and number of all shares of stock of the Corporation which are owned beneficially or of record by such person and any affiliates or associates of such person, (B) the name of each nominee holder of shares of the Corporation owned beneficially but not of record by such person or any affiliates or associates of such person, and the number of shares of stock of the Corporation held by each such nominee holder, (C) whether and the extent to which any derivative instrument, swap, option, warrant, short interest, hedge or profit interest or other transaction has been entered into by or on behalf of such person, or any affiliates or associates of such person, with respect to stock of the Corporation and (D) whether and the extent to which any other transaction, agreement, arrangement or understanding (including any short position or any borrowing or lending of shares of stock of the Corporation) has been made by or on behalf of such person, or
 
any affiliates or associates of such person, the effect or intent of any of the foregoing being to mitigate loss to, or to manage risk or benefit of stock price changes for, such person, or any affiliates or associates of such person, or to increase or decrease the voting power or pecuniary or economic interest of such person, or any affiliates or associates of such person, with respect to stock of the Corporation, (iii) a description of all agreements, arrangements, or understandings (whether written or oral) between such person, or any affiliates or associates of such person, and any proposed nominee or any other person or persons (including their names) pursuant to which the nomination(s) are being made by such person, and any material interest of such person, or any affiliates or associates of such person, in such nomination, including any anticipated benefit therefrom to such person, or any affiliates or associates of such person, (iv) a representation that the stockholder giving notice intends to appear in person or by proxy at the annual meeting or special meeting to nominate the persons named in its notice, and (v) any other information relating to such person that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings required to be made in connection with the solicitation of proxies for election of directors pursuant to Section 14 of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Such notice must be accompanied by a written consent of each proposed nominee to being named as a nominee and to serve as a director if elected.
A stockholder providing notice of any nomination proposed to be made at an annual meeting or special meeting shall further update and supplement such notice, if necessary, so that the information provided or required to be provided in such notice pursuant to this Section 2 shall be true and correct as of the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to receive notice of the annual meeting or special meeting, and such update and supplement shall be delivered to or be mailed and received by the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than five (5) business days after the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to receive notice of such annual meeting or special meeting.
No person shall be eligible for election as a director of the Corporation unless nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2. If the chairman of the meeting determines that a nomination was not made in accordance with the foregoing procedures, the chairman shall declare to the meeting that the nomination was defective and such defective nomination shall be disregarded.
For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding any notice requirement provided in Rule 14a-11 of the Exchange Act, in order for a nomination for election to the Board of Directors to be valid, such nomination must comply with this Section 2.
. . Subject to the terms of any one or more classes or series of preferred stock, any vacancy on the Board of Directors that results from an increase in the number of directors may only be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, provided that a quorum is present, and any other vacancy occurring on the Board of Directors may only be filled by a majority of the Board of Directors then in office, even if less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director. Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever the holders of any one or more class or classes or series of preferred stock of the Corporation shall have the right, voting separately as a class, to elect directors at an annual or special meeting of stockholders, the election, term of office, filling of vacancies and other features of such directorships shall be governed by the Certificate of Incorporation.
Section 3
Vacancies
 
. . The business of the Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of the Board of Directors which may exercise all such powers of the Corporation and do all such lawful acts and things as are not by statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation or by these By-Laws required to be exercised or done by the stockholders.
Section 4
Duties and Powers
. . Each meeting of the Board of Directors shall be presided over by the Chairman of the Board of Directors, or in his or her absence, by the Vice Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer or such other member of the Board of Directors as is designated by the Chairman of the Board of Directors or as shall be chosen by the Board of Directors at the meeting. The Secretary of the Corporation shall act as Secretary at each meeting of the Board of Directors.

Except as otherwise required by law and subject to the rights, if any, of the holders of shares of preferred stock then outstanding, any director or the entire Board of Directors may be removed from office at any time, only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority in voting power of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote in the election of directors.
Section 6

Whenever any notice is required to be given to any director or member of a committee, a waiver thereof in writing, signed by such director or member of a committee, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a director or member of a committee at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except where the director or member of a committee attends the meeting for the express purpose of objecting at the beginning of the meeting to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.
Section 7
Meetings
 
. .

instructions from the registered holder of the shares or by such person's attorney lawfully constituted in writing, and upon payment of all necessary transfer taxes and compliance with appropriate procedures for transferring shares in uncertificated form; provided, however, that such surrender and endorsement, compliance or payment of taxes shall not be required in any case in which the officers of the Corporation shall determine to waive such requirement.

. . The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision hereof shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof.
Section 5
Severability
. . Subject to Section 3 of this Article VII, the Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation) by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was a director or officer of the Corporation serving at the request of the Corporation as a director or officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, such person had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that such person did not act in good faith and in a manner which such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful.
Section 1
Power to Indemnify in Actions, Suits or Proceedings Other than Those by or in the Right of the Corporation
. . Subject to Section 3 of this Article VII, the Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was a director or officer of the Corporation serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation; except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.
Section 2
Power to Indemnify in Actions, Suits or Proceedings by or in the Right of the Corporation
 
. . Any indemnification under this Article VII (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the present or former director or officer is proper in the circumstances because such person has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 1 or Section 2 of this Article VII, as the case may be. Such determination shall be made, with respect to a person who is a director or officer at the time of such determination, (i) by a majority vote of the directors who are not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, even though less than a quorum, or (ii) by a committee of such directors designated by a majority vote of such directors, even though less than a quorum, or (iii) if there are no such directors, or if such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (iv) by the stockholders. To the extent, however, that a present or former director or officer of the Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding described above, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such person shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith, without the necessity of authorization in the specific case.
Section 3
Authorization of Indemnification
. . For purposes of any determination under Section 3 of this Article VII, a person shall be deemed to have acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, or, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, to have had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful, if such person's action is based on the records or books of account of the Corporation or another enterprise, or on information supplied to such person by the officers of the Corporation or another enterprise in the course of their duties, or on the advice of legal counsel for the Corporation or another enterprise or on information or records given or reports made to the Corporation or another enterprise by an independent certified public accountant or by an appraiser or other expert selected with reasonable care by the Corporation or another enterprise. The term "another enterprise" as used in this Section 4 shall mean any other corporation or any partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise of which such person is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent. The provisions of this Section 4 shall not be deemed to be exclusive or to limit in any way the circumstances in which a person may be deemed to have met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 1 or 2 of this Article VII, as the case may be.
Section 4
Good Faith Defined
. . Notwithstanding any contrary determination in the specific case under Section 3 of this Article VII, and notwithstanding the absence of any determination thereunder, any director or officer may apply to the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or any other court of competent jurisdiction in the State of Delaware for indemnification to the extent otherwise permissible under Sections 1 and 2 of this Article VII. The basis of such indemnification by a court shall be a determination by such court that indemnification of the director or officer is proper in the circumstances because such person has met the applicable standards of conduct set forth in Section 1 or 2 of this Article VII, as the case may be. Neither a contrary determination in the specific case under Section 3 of this Article VII nor the absence of any determination thereunder shall be a defense to such application or create a presumption that the director or officer seeking indemnification has not met any
Section 5
Indemnification by a Court
 
applicable standard of conduct. Notice of any application for indemnification pursuant to this Section 5 shall be given to the Corporation promptly upon the filing of such application. If successful, in whole or in part, the director or officer seeking indemnification shall also be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such application.
. . Expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by a director or officer in defending or investigating a threatened or pending civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director or officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Article VII.
Section 6
Expenses Payable in Advance
. . The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by or granted pursuant to this Article VII shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under the Certificate of Incorporation or any By-Law, agreement, contract, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or pursuant to the direction (howsoever embodied) of any court of competent jurisdiction or otherwise, both as to action in such person's official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, it being the policy of the Corporation that indemnification of the persons specified in Section 1 and 2 of this Article VII shall be made to the fullest extent permitted by law. The provisions of this Article VII shall not be deemed to preclude the indemnification of any person who is not specified in Section 1 or 2 of this Article VII but whom the Corporation has the power or obligation to indemnify under the provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or otherwise.
Section 7
Nonexclusivity of Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses
. . The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was a director or officer of the Corporation serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise against any liability asserted against such person and incurred by such person in any such capacity, or arising out of such person's status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power or the obligation to indemnify such person against such liability under the provisions of this Article VII.
Section 8
Insurance
. . For purposes of this Article VII, references to "the Corporation" shall include, in addition to the resulting corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors or officers, so that any person who is or was a director or officer of such constituent corporation, or is or was a director or officer of such constituent corporation serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Article VII with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as such person would have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate
Section 9
Certain Definitions
 
existence had continued. For purposes of this Article VII, references to "fines" shall include any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to an employee benefit plan; and references to "serving at the request of the Corporation" shall include any service as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation which imposes duties on, or involves services by, such director or officer with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants or beneficiaries; and a person who acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to have acted in a manner "not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation" as referred to in this Article VII.
. . The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this Article VII shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director or officer and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.
Section 10
Survival of Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses
. . Notwithstanding anything contained in this Article VII to the contrary, except for proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification (which shall be governed by Section 5 hereof), the Corporation shall not be obligated to indemnify any director or officer (or his or her heirs, executors or personal or legal representatives) or advance expenses in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person unless such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized or consented to by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.
Section 11
Limitation on Indemnification
. . The Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board of Directors, provide rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses to employees and agents of the Corporation similar to those conferred in this Article VII to directors and officers of the Corporation.
Section 12
Indemnification of Employees and Agents
. . Any repeal or other modification of this Article VII shall not limit any rights of indemnification then existing or arising out of events, acts, omissions or circumstances occurring or existing prior to such repeal or modification, including, without limitation, the right to indemnification for proceedings commenced after such repeal or modification to enforce this Article VII with regard to acts, omissions, events or circumstances occurring or existing prior to such repeal or modification.
Section 13
Repeal or Modification
. . If this Article VII or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each director and officer of the Corporation as to costs, charges and expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement with respect to any proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, including an action by or in the right of the Corporation, to the full extent permitted by any applicable portion of this Article VII that shall not have been invalidated and to the full extent permitted by applicable law.
Section 14
Severability
 
. . The Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for (a) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation, (b) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer, or other employee of the Corporation to the Corporation or the Corporation's stockholders, (c) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws, or (d) any other action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine.
Section 1
Exclusive Forum
. . These By-Laws may be altered, amended or repealed, in whole or in part, or new By-Laws may be adopted by the Board of Directors or by the stockholders.

The information provided in this news release is based on sales reports provided by our stores, including stores acquired since February 2010, to the applicable automotive manufacturers and is provided on a continuing operations basis.

On April 4, 2011, AutoNation, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing March 2011 retail new vehicle unit sales. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
The information furnished pursuant to this Item 7.01, including Exhibit 99.1, shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Exchange Act or otherwise subject to the liabilities under that Section and shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any filing of the Company under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
 
(d) Exhibits
The following exhibit is furnished as part of this report:
99.1    Press Release of AutoNation, Inc. dated April 4, 2011 regarding March 2011 retail new vehicle unit sales.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
AutoNation, Inc. (NYSE: AN), America's largest automotive retailer, today announced that its retail new vehicle unit sales in March 2011, as reported to the applicable automotive manufacturers, totaled 22,246, an increase of 19% as compared to March 2010. Retail new vehicle unit sales in March 2011 for AutoNation's operating segments were as follows:

For the first quarter of 2011, AutoNation's retail new vehicle unit sales, as reported to the applicable automotive manufacturers, totaled 54,198, an increase of 23% compared to the first quarter of 2010.
Japan Earthquake Impact
"We would like to extend our deepest sympathies to the victims of the earthquake in Japan," said Mike Jackson, AutoNation's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
Commenting on the earthquake's impact on the auto industry, Mr. Jackson said, "Based on current information from the manufacturers, we expect production disruptions will significantly impact product availability from Japanese auto manufacturers in the second and third quarters of 2011. However, we believe that the auto retail market and underlying consumer demand will continue to recover throughout 2011. Our planning assumption for 2011 industry new unit sales remains 12.8 million units, and we believe that we will manage through these production shortfalls."
While 52% of AutoNation's total new unit sales in 2010 were produced by Japanese manufacturers, approximately two-thirds of those units are assembled in North America.
Mr. Jackson concluded, "The situation is still developing, and therefore at this time it is difficult to fully predict the impact of the production disruption on the industry and our business."
The Company will provide additional information during the first quarter earnings call, scheduled for April 26, 2011 at 11:00 a.m. Eastern.
The information provided in this news release is based on sales reports provided by our stores, including stores acquired since March 2010, to the applicable automotive manufacturers and is provided on a continuing operations basis. These reports are prepared based on the standards established by the applicable automotive manufacturers, which differ from GAAP revenue recognition and other requirements and are based on the time periods set by the automotive manufacturers for reporting monthly sales (which
generally differ from the calendar month). As a result, our operating results calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, including our new vehicle unit sales, may differ materially from any results expressed or implied by the information provided in our monthly sales reports and summarized in this news release and future news releases. In addition, new vehicle unit sales are subject to seasonal trends. Consequently, new vehicle unit sales for a particular month are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for a full quarter or year. Please refer to our public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including without limitation our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010, for additional information regarding our operations. Investors should not assume that our disclosure of the information in this news release means that we have determined that such information is material to the Company.

On April 26, 2011, AutoNation, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing its results of operations for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2011. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
The information furnished pursuant to this Item 2.02, including Exhibit 99.1, shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") or otherwise subject to the liabilities under that Section and shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any filing of the Company under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
 
(d) Exhibits
The following exhibit is furnished as part of this report:
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 
America's largest automotive retailer, today reported 2011 first quarter net income from continuing operations of $70 million or $0.46 per share, compared to net income from continuing operations of $59 million or $0.34 per share for the same period in the prior year, a 35% improvement on a per-share basis.
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla., (April 26, 2011) AutoNation, Inc.
(NYSE: AN),
2011 first quarter revenue totaled $3.3 billion, compared to $2.8 billion in the year-ago period, an increase of 17%, driven primarily by stronger retail new and used vehicle revenue which increased 19%. AutoNation's new vehicle unit sales increased 20% on a same store basis and 23% overall which were in line with the industry according to CNW research data.
AutoNation's 2011 first quarter retail used vehicle revenue increased 13%. Parts and service revenue increased 6%, and finance and insurance revenue increased 16% compared to the first quarter 2010.
In the first quarter of 2011, gross profit per new vehicle retailed benefited by $82 from the recognition of certain performance-based manufacturer incentives, which were related to premium luxury vehicles previously sold. Gross profit and operating income in the first quarter of 2011 were favorably impacted by $4.6 million related to these incentives.
Mike Jackson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, "We delivered solid double-digit growth in the first quarter, which was driven by both new and used vehicle unit sales and revenue."
Commenting on the impact of the Japan earthquake on the full-year industry outlook, Mr. Jackson said, "While the underlying recovery in consumer demand for autos remains on track in the United States, due to Japanese supply constraints throughout the remainder of 2011, we are revising our planning assumption for 2011 full-year U.S. industry new vehicle sales downward from 12.8 million units to mid-12 million units. Based on current information, we see significant reductions in vehicle shipments from Japanese manufacturers through year-end, with the resumption of normal shipment levels in early 2012."
Mr. Jackson added, "Our diversified business model is resilient and adaptable. We are confident we can manage through the challenges presented by Japanese product constraints. We also continue to be optimistic about the long-term recovery for the U.S. auto market."
AutoNation has three operating segments: Domestic, Import, and Premium Luxury. The Domestic segment is comprised of stores that sell vehicles manufactured by General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler; the Import segment is comprised of stores that sell vehicles manufactured primarily by Toyota, Honda, and Nissan; and the Premium Luxury segment is comprised of stores that sell vehicles manufactured primarily by Mercedes, BMW, and Lexus. Segment results for the first quarter were as follows:

FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla., (
July 27,
2011) AutoNation, Inc.
(NYSE: AN),
2011 second quarter revenue totaled $3.3 billion, compared to $3.1 billion in the year-ago period, an increase of 8%, driven primarily by higher retail new and used vehicle average selling prices. AutoNation's new vehicle unit sales decreased 4% on a same store basis and were flat overall. Based on CNW Research data, in the second quarter, total U.S. industry new retail vehicle unit sales decreased 2%.
AutoNation's 2011 second quarter retail used vehicle revenue increased 12%. Parts and service revenue increased 5%, and finance and insurance revenue increased 12% compared to the 2010 second quarter.
2011 second quarter gross profit totaled $583 million, compared to $529 million in the year-ago period, an increase of 10%, primarily due to an increase in retail new and used vehicle gross profit, as well as an increase in finance and insurance gross profit. Gross profit in the second quarter of 2011 was favorably impacted by $1.4 million related to incentives on premium luxury vehicles previously sold. On a per-vehicle basis, gross profit per new vehicle retailed increased $539 or 26%, while gross profit per used vehicle retailed increased $174 or 11%, as compared to the year-ago period.
Mike Jackson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, "We delivered solid double-digit growth in operating income in the second quarter, which was driven by strong new and used vehicle gross profit." Mr. Jackson added, "This quarter we once again demonstrated the strength of our diversified business model, and our ability to react quickly and execute effectively in a changing marketplace."
Commenting on the automotive retail environment, Mr. Jackson added, "We estimate that vehicle shipments from the Japanese manufacturers were approximately 40% below planned levels in the second quarter and that, by September, they will be approximately 10-15% below planned levels. Margins on vehicles from Japanese manufacturers benefitted from constrained supply, and while we believe that they will remain strong in the third quarter, we expect that the improving supply environment will result in lower margins on those vehicles as compared to the second quarter. We believe that the new vehicle sales environment will begin to normalize in the fourth quarter of 2011, and we continue to be optimistic about the long-term recovery for the U.S. auto market."
AutoNation has three operating segments: Domestic, Import, and Premium Luxury. The Domestic segment is comprised of stores that sell vehicles manufactured by General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler; the Import segment is comprised of stores that sell vehicles manufactured primarily by Toyota, Honda, and Nissan; and the Premium Luxury segment is comprised of stores that sell vehicles manufactured primarily by Mercedes, BMW, and Lexus. Segment results for the second quarter were as follows:
 
 
 
For the six-month period ended June 30, 2011, the Company reported net income from continuing operations of $144 million, or $0.95 per share, compared to adjusted net income from continuing operations of $121 million, or $0.72 per share for the same period in the prior year, an improvement of 32% on a per-share basis. Adjusted net income from continuing operations for the six-month period ended June 30, 2010 excludes debt refinancing costs of $12 million after-tax, or $0.07 per share, as disclosed in the attached financial tables. There were no adjusting items for the six-month period ended June 30, 2011. On a GAAP basis, net income from continuing operations for the six-month period ended June 30, 2010 was $109 million, or $0.65 per share. The Company's revenue for the six-month period ended June 30, 2011, totaled $6.6 billion, up 12% compared to $5.9 billion for the same period in the prior year.

per share, for the same period in the prior year, a
23%
improvement on a per-share basis.
2011
third
quarter revenue totaled
$3.5 billion
, compared to
$3.3 billion
in the year-ago period, an increase of
7%
, driven primarily by higher new and used vehicle average selling prices. AutoNations new vehicle unit sales decreased
2%
on a same store basis and were flat overall, as the Japanese earthquake affected availability of vehicles produced by Japanese manufacturers. Based on CNW Research data, in the
third
quarter, total U.S. industry new retail vehicle unit sales increased 1%.
AutoNations 2011
third
quarter retail used vehicle revenue increased

third
quarter.
2011
third
quarter gross profit totaled

Mike Jackson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, We continued to deliver solid double-digit growth in operating income in the third quarter, which was driven by strong gross margins in new vehicles and finance and insurance. Mr. Jackson added, While shipments from the Japanese manufacturers improved in the third quarter, inventory levels of these vehicles remained constrained. We would expect that the improving supply environment will result in lower margins on these vehicles in the fourth quarter.
Mr. Jackson concluded, We believe that the new vehicle sales environment will continue to improve in the fourth quarter, and we remain optimistic about the long-term recovery of the U.S. auto market.

A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and its contents are incorporated herein by reference.

Exhibit 99.1
 
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (November 17, 2011) (NYSE: AN), America's largest automotive retailer, announced today that it is in discussions with its existing lenders as well as new lenders with respect to a proposed new five year credit agreement with term loan and revolving credit facilities in the aggregate amount of approximately $1.5 billion, with an accordion feature that would allow the Company, subject to credit availability, to increase the amount of such facilities by up to $500 million in the aggregate.
AutoNation, Inc.
The new credit agreement, which would represent an approximate $328 million increase in commitments compared to the Company's existing credit agreement (without giving any effect to the accordion feature), would terminate in 2016 and would replace the Company's existing credit agreement (including the term loan facilities due 2012 and 2014 and the revolving credit facilities due 2012 and 2014). With the new credit agreement, the Company expects to increase its maximum leverage ratio covenant to 3.75x and its maximum capitalization ratio to 65%. The Company also expects to lower its borrowing costs due to reduced interest rate spreads as compared to the interest rate spreads in its term loan and revolving credit facilities due 2014. Although the Company anticipates entering into the new credit agreement in December 2011, there can be no assurance that it will enter into the new credit agreement under the terms described above, or at all.
The Company continues to monitor current market conditions. If attractive opportunities become available, it may consummate one or more additional financings, including in the near term.

Item 1.01
    
Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
As previously announced on a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
SEC
) on January 29, 2009 (the January 2009 8-K) by AutoNation, Inc. (the Company), the Board of Directors of the Company approved a letter agreement with Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. (Toyota, and such agreement, the Toyota Agreement) in order to, among other things, eliminate any potential adverse consequences under Toyota's framework agreement with the Company in the event that ESL Investments, Inc. and certain investment affiliates of ESL Investments, Inc. (together, ESL) acquired more than fifty percent (50%) of the Company's common stock. The Toyota Agreement also contains governance-related and other provisions as described in the January 2009 8-K. Based on a Schedule 13D/A filed by ESL with the SEC on October 31, 2011, ESL beneficially owns approximately fifty-six percent (56%) of the Company's common stock.
Under the Toyota Agreement (as previously extended and amended), Toyota's consent (the Consent) to ESL acquiring more than fifty percent (50%) of the Company's common stock would have terminated on December 31, 2011, solely with respect to ESL purchases of the Company's common stock after such date, unless it was extended by Toyota.
On November 29, 2011, the Company entered into an extension and amendment agreement to the Toyota Agreement (the Extension and Amendment Agreement) with Toyota and ESL. The Extension and Amendment Agreement grants an additional one-year extension of Toyota's Consent under the Toyota Agreement and amends the Toyota Agreement to provide that the Toyota Agreement and Toyota's Consent will terminate in the event that ESL's ownership of the Company's outstanding common stock falls to forty percent (40%) or lower (rather than fifty percent (50%) or lower). Toyota's Consent under the Toyota Agreement will now terminate on December 31, 2012 (unless it is terminated earlier as provided in the Toyota Agreement) with respect to purchases of the Company's common stock by ESL after such date, provided that ESL may continue to seek successive annual one-year extensions of Toyota's Consent, and Toyota may not unreasonably withhold or delay its consent thereto, except that if ESL has owned fifty percent (50%) or less of the Company's outstanding common stock for two years preceding the date that ESL seeks an extension, then Toyota may withhold such consent in its sole discretion.
The foregoing summaries of the Toyota Agreement and the Extension and Amendment Agreement are qualified in their entirety by reference to such agreements. The Toyota Agreement, together with all amendments thereto, including the Extension and Amendment Agreement, are filed as exhibits hereto, and each is incorporated herein by reference.

INDEX TO EXHIBITS

Exhibit 10.5
November 29, 2011
Dear Mr. Lentz:
Reference is made to that certain letter agreement (the

), dated as of January 28, 2009, as extended and amended from time to time, by and among Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. (
Toyota
), AutoNation, Inc. (

Capitalized terms used but not defined in this letter agreement shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Consent Agreement.
Each of the parties hereto hereby agrees that:
(i) the phrase which shall only apply at such time and for so long as ESL Owns more than fifty percent (50%) of the then outstanding Common Stock shall be deleted from the second paragraph of the Consent Agreement;
(ii) the first sentence of the Consent Agreement shall be amended to read Reference is made to that certain Framework Agreement, dated as of September 26, 1997 (as amended or supplemented from time to time, the 
Framework Agreement
), by and between Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. (
Toyota
) and AutoNation, Inc. (formerly known as Republic Industries, Inc.) (
AutoNation
).;
(iii) the first sentence of paragraph 7 of the Consent Agreement shall be amended to read Toyota's consent and waiver pursuant to this letter agreement shall terminate on December 31, 2012 (the 
Termination Date
) solely with respect to shares of Common Stock acquired by ESL after the Termination Date, provided that ESL may seek successive annual one-year extensions of the Termination Date and Toyota shall not unreasonably withhold or delay its consent thereto, except that if ESL has owned fifty percent (50%) or less of the outstanding Common Stock for two years preceding the date that ESL seeks an extension hereunder, then Toyota shall have the right to withhold such consent in its sole discretion.;
(iv) the last sentence of paragraph 7 of the Consent Agreement shall be amended to read Notwithstanding the foregoing, this letter agreement shall remain in effect so long as ESL continues to Own in excess of forty percent (40%) of the then outstanding Common Stock.;
(v) paragraph 8 of the Consent Agreement shall be amended to read In the event that ESL no longer Owns in excess of forty percent (40%) of the then outstanding Common Stock (including, without limitation, because of a disposal of shares under Section 2 above), then (a) this letter agreement, and Toyota's consent and waiver hereunder, shall automatically terminate and be of no further force and effect, and (b) Sections 6.1.1 and 10 of the Framework Agreement shall apply to any future acquisition of in excess of fifty percent (50%) of the then outstanding Common Stock by ESL; provided, however, that if (i) the exercise of options to purchase Common Stock and/or (ii) the issuance or vesting of restricted shares of Common Stock causes ESL to no longer Own in excess of forty percent (40%) of the then outstanding Common Stock, then this letter agreement, and Toyota's waiver and consent hereunder, shall continue to be in effect until any subsequent disposition of Common Stock by ESL during the time when ESL's Ownership is not in excess of forty percent (40%) of the then outstanding Common Stock as a result of such exercise, issuance or vesting.; and
(vi) the Consent Agreement shall be re-numbered and re-lettered as set forth in the Amended and Restated Consent Agreement attached hereto as
Exhibit 1
(the 
Amended and Restated Consent Agreement
).
Each of the parties hereto hereby reaffirms the terms of the Consent Agreement, as amended by the Amendment and this letter agreement, and as extended by the First Extension Agreement, the Second Extension Agreement and this letter agreement, and agrees that the Consent Agreement, as so amended and extended, shall remain in full force and effect until terminated in accordance with its terms.
This letter agreement (a) may not be amended, waived or modified except by an instrument in writing signed by Toyota, AutoNation and ESL Investments, Inc. and (b) may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but which when taken together shall constitute one and the same letter agreement.
The parties further agree that the Consent Agreement, as amended and extended through the date hereof, shall from and after the date of this letter agreement, be represented by the Amended and Restated Consent Agreement, except as set forth in an instrument in writing signed by Toyota, AutoNation and ESL Investments, Inc.

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Agreement.
On December 7, 2011, AutoNation, Inc. ("Company") entered into a new unsecured credit agreement (the "New Credit Agreement"), with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as Administrative Agent (in such capacity, the "Administrative Agent") and as a lender; Bank of America, N.A., as Syndication Agent and as a lender; Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., Suntrust Bank, Toyota Motor Credit Corporation, and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as Documentation Agents and as lenders; certain lenders named therein; and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Suntrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as Co-Lead Arrangers and Joint Bookrunners. The New Credit Agreement provides for a $500 million term loan facility and a $1.2 billion revolving credit facility. The New Credit Agreement contains an accordion feature that allows the Company, subject to credit availability, to increase the amount of the term loan and revolving credit facilities by up to $500 million in the aggregate. The New Credit Agreement replaces the Company's prior unsecured credit agreement, dated as of July 14, 2005, by and among the Company, the various lenders party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified, the "Old Credit Agreement"). The Old Credit Agreement was terminated concurrently with the Company's entry into the New Credit Agreement, and the indebtedness outstanding under the Old Credit Agreement was paid off with proceeds from the New Credit Agreement.
Funds borrowed under the New Credit Agreement may be used to repay indebtedness, finance acquisitions and for working capital, capital expenditures, share repurchases and other general corporate purposes of the Company and its subsidiaries. The New Credit Agreement will terminate and all amounts owing thereunder will be due and payable on December 7, 2016, unless (a) the commitments are terminated earlier, either at the request of the Company or, if an event of default occurs, by the lenders (or automatically in the case of certain bankruptcy-related events), or (b) the maturity date is extended upon the request of the Company, subject to the agreement of the lenders.
The term loan and revolving credit facilities under the New Credit Agreement provide for various interest rates generally at (1) the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus 1.75% (subject to adjustment, based on the Company's consolidated leverage ratio) or (2) the sum of (a) the highest of (i) the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50%, (ii) the Administrative Agent's prime rate and (iii) LIBOR plus 1.00%, plus (b) 0.75% (subject to adjustment, based on the Company's consolidated leverage ratio), at the Company's election.
The New Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, and events of default. Among other covenants, the Company may not permit (i) the consolidated leverage ratio as of the end of any four consecutive quarter period to exceed 3.75 to 1.00 and (ii) the consolidated capitalization ratio to exceed 0.65 to 1.00.
The New Credit Agreement is guaranteed by substantially all of the Company's direct and indirect, existing and future domestic subsidiaries, with certain limited exceptions.
The lenders party to the New Credit Agreement and/or their affiliates have from time to time provided, and/or may in the future provide, various financial advisory, commercial banking, investment banking and other services to the Company and its affiliates, for which they received or may receive customary compensation and expense reimbursement.
The foregoing description does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the New Credit Agreement, which is attached as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
Item 1.02. Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement.
The information set forth above under Item 1.01, relating to the Old Credit Agreement, is hereby incorporated by reference into this Item 1.02, as if fully set forth herein.
Item 2.03. Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
The information set forth above under Item 1.01, relating to the New Credit Agreement, is hereby incorporated by reference into this Item 2.03, as if fully set forth herein.
Item 8.01 Other Events.
On December 7, 2011, the Company issued a press release announcing the New Credit Agreement. A copy of the press release is being filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.
 
 
* Portions of the schedules to this exhibit have been omitted and will be filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to a request for confidential treatment under Rule 24b-2 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934.
The Credit Agreement included with this Form 8-K (including the schedules and exhibits to such agreement), which is being filed to provide investors with information regarding its terms, contains various representations, warranties and covenants of the Company and the other parties thereto. It is not intended to provide any factual information about any of the parties thereto or any subsidiaries of the parties thereto. The assertions embodied in those representations, warranties and covenants were made for purposes of such agreement, solely for the benefit of the parties thereto. In addition, certain representations and warranties were made as of a specific date, may be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from what a security holder might view as material, or may have been made for purposes of allocating contractual risk among the parties rather than establishing matters as facts. Investors should not view the representations, warranties and covenants in the agreement (or any description thereof) as disclosures with respect to the actual state of facts concerning the business, operations or condition of any of the parties to the agreement (or their subsidiaries) and should not rely on them as such. In addition, information in any such representations, warranties or covenants may change after the dates covered by such provisions, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in the public disclosures of the parties. In any event, investors should read the agreement together with the other information concerning the Company contained in reports and statements that it files with the SEC.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Notwithstanding any other provision herein, the aggregate interest rate charged hereunder, including all charges or fees in connection therewith deemed in the nature of interest under applicable law shall not exceed the Highest Lawful Rate (as such term is defined below). If the rate of interest (determined without regard to the preceding sentence) under this Agreement at any time exceeds the Highest Lawful Rate (as defined below), the outstanding amount of the Loans made hereunder shall bear interest at the Highest Lawful Rate until the total amount of interest due hereunder equals the amount of interest which would have been due hereunder if the stated rates of interest set forth in this Agreement had at all times been in effect. In addition, if when the Loans made hereunder are repaid in full the total interest due hereunder (taking into account the increase provided for above) is less than the total amount of interest which would have been due hereunder if the stated rates of interest set forth in this Agreement had at all times been in effect, then to the extent permitted by law, the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to the difference between the amount of interest paid and the amount of interest which would have been paid if the Highest Lawful Rate had at all times been in effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is the intention of the Lenders and the Borrower to conform strictly to any applicable usury laws. Accordingly, if any Lender contracts for, charges, or receives any consideration which constitutes interest in excess of the Highest Lawful Rate, then any such excess shall be cancelled automatically and, if previously paid, shall at such Lender's option be applied to the outstanding amount of the Loans made hereunder or be refunded to the Borrower. As used in this , the term "" means the maximum lawful interest rate, if any, that at any time or from time to time may be contracted for, charged, or received under the laws applicable to such Lender which are presently in effect or, to the extent allowed by law, under such applicable laws which may hereafter be in effect and which allow a higher maximum nonusurious interest rate than applicable laws now allow.

THIS GUARANTY AGREEMENT (this "Guaranty Agreement"), dated as of                     , 20    , is made by EACH OF THE UNDERSIGNED (each a "Guarantor" and collectively the "Guarantors") to JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., a national banking association organized and existing under the laws of the United States, in its capacity as administrative agent (the "Administrative Agent") for the Lenders (as defined below). The Lenders and the Administrative Agent are referred to collectively as the "Guaranteed Parties". All capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this Guaranty Agreement shall have the respective meanings assigned to such terms in the Credit Agreement (as defined below).
WHEREAS, AutoNation, Inc. (the "Borrower") has entered into that certain Credit Agreement dated as of December 7, 2011, by and among the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the lenders party thereto from time to time (the "Lenders"); such agreement as from time to time amended, modified, supplemented or restated, being referred to as the "Credit Agreement"); and
WHEREAS, pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Lenders have provided to the Borrower a revolving credit facility, including a letter of credit facility and a swing line facility, and a term loan facility; and
WHEREAS, each Guarantor is, directly or indirectly, a Subsidiary of the Borrower and will materially benefit from the Loans and Advances made and to be made, and the Letters of Credit issued and to be issued, under the Credit Agreement; and
WHEREAS, each Guarantor is required to enter into this Guaranty Agreement pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement; and
WHEREAS, a material part of the consideration given in connection with and as an inducement to the execution and delivery of the Credit Agreement by the Guaranteed Parties was the obligation of the Borrower to cause each Guarantor to enter into this Guaranty Agreement, and the Guaranteed Parties are unwilling to maintain the credit facilities provided under the Loan Documents unless the Guarantors enter into this Guaranty Agreement;
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises contained herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:
1. . Each Guarantor hereby jointly and severally, unconditionally, absolutely, continually and irrevocably guarantees to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Guaranteed Parties the payment and performance in full of the Borrower's Liabilities (as defined below). For all purposes of this Guaranty Agreement, "Borrower's Liabilities" means: (a) the Borrower's prompt payment in full, when due or declared due and at all such times, of all Obligations and all other amounts pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement and all other Loan Documents heretofore, now or at any time or times hereafter owing, arising, due or payable from the Borrower to any one or more of the Guaranteed Parties, including principal, interest, premiums, indemnification obligations, reimbursement obligations, and fees (including, but not limited to, loan fees and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses); (b) the Borrower's prompt, full and faithful performance, observance and discharge of each
Guaranty
 
and every agreement, undertaking, covenant and provision to be performed, observed or discharged by the Borrower under the Credit Agreement and all other Loan Documents; and (c) the Borrower's prompt payment in full, when due or declared due and at all such times, of Rate Hedging Obligations now or hereafter arising under Existing Swap Agreements (as defined below). The Guarantors' obligations to the Guaranteed Parties under this Guaranty Agreement are hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Guarantors' Obligations" and, with respect to each Guarantor individually, the "Guarantor's Obligations". Notwithstanding the foregoing, the liability of each Guarantor individually with respect to its Guarantor's Obligations shall be limited to an aggregate amount equal to the largest amount that would not render its obligations hereunder subject to avoidance under Section 548 of the United States Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provisions of any applicable state law.
Each Guarantor agrees that it is jointly and severally, directly and primarily liable (subject to the limitation in the immediately preceding sentence) for the Borrower's Liabilities.
As used herein, "" means one or more agreements in effect on the Closing Date between the Borrower and any Lender or any Affiliate of any Lender with respect to Permitted Indebtedness of the Borrower, which agreements create Rate Hedging Obligations. All obligations of the Borrower under Existing Swap Agreements to which any Lender or its affiliates are a party shall be deemed to be Borrower's Liabilities, and each Lender or affiliate of a Lender party to any such Existing Swap Agreement shall be deemed to be a Guaranteed Party hereunder with respect to such Borrower's Liabilities; , , that such obligations shall cease to be Borrower's Liabilities at such time as such Person (or affiliate of such Person) shall cease to be a "Lender" under the Credit Agreements. No Person who obtains the benefit of this Guaranty Agreement by virtue of the provisions of this paragraph shall have any right to notice of any action or to consent to, direct or object to any action hereunder or otherwise in respect of the Guarantors' Obligations (including the release or modification of any Guarantors' Obligations) other than in its capacity as a Lender and only to the extent expressly provided in the Loan Documents.
Existing Swap Agreement

2. . Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default under the Credit Agreement, then any or all of the Guarantors will, upon demand thereof by the Administrative Agent, fully pay to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Guaranteed Parties, subject to any restriction on each Guarantor's Obligations set forth in Section 1 hereof, an amount equal to all of the Borrower's Liabilities then due and owing.
Payment
3. . This is a guaranty of payment and not of collection. The Guarantors' Obligations under this Guaranty Agreement shall be joint and several, absolute and unconditional irrespective of, and each Guarantor hereby expressly waives, to the extent permitted by law, any defense to its obligations under this Guaranty Agreement to which it is a party by reason of:
Absolute Rights and Obligations

(b) any action taken under any of the Related Agreements, any exercise of any right or power therein conferred, any failure or omission to enforce any right conferred thereby, or any waiver of any covenant or condition therein provided;
 
(c) any acceleration of the maturity of any of the Borrower's Liabilities, of the Guarantor's Obligations of any other Guarantor, or of any other obligations or liabilities of any Person under any of the Related Agreements;
(d) any release, exchange, non-perfection, lapse in perfection, disposal, deterioration in value, or impairment of any security for any of the Borrower's Liabilities, for any of the Guarantor's Obligations of any Guarantor, or for any other obligations or liabilities of any Person under any of the Related Agreements;
(e) any dissolution of the Borrower or any Guarantor or any other party to a Related Agreement, or the combination or consolidation of the Borrower or any Guarantor or any other party to a Related Agreement into or with another entity or any transfer or disposition of any assets of the Borrower or any Guarantor or any other party to a Related Agreement;
(f) any extension (including without limitation extensions of time for payment), renewal, amendment, restructuring or restatement of, and any acceptance of late or partial payments or any increase in any credit facilities available or amounts borrowed (including, without limitation, increases pursuant to of the Credit Agreement) under the Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document or any other Related Agreement, in whole or in part;

(h) any waiver of, forbearance or indulgence under, or other consent to any change in or departure from any term or provision contained in the Credit Agreement, this Guaranty Agreement with respect to any other Guarantor, any other Loan Document or any other Related Agreement, including without limitation any term pertaining to the payment or performance of any of the Borrower's Liabilities, any of the Guarantor's Obligations of any other Guarantor, or any of the obligations or liabilities of any party to any other Related Agreement;
(i) any other circumstance whatsoever (with or without notice to or knowledge of any Guarantor) which may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risks of such Guarantor, or might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable defense available to, or discharge of, a surety or a guarantor, including without limitation any right to require or claim that resort be had to the Borrower or any other Guarantor or to any collateral in respect of the Borrower's Liabilities or Guarantors' Obligations (other than (subject to hereof) payment in full of the Borrower's Liabilities and occurrence of the Facility Termination Date.)
Section 12
Subject to hereof, it is the express purpose and intent of the parties hereto that this Guaranty Agreement and the Guarantors' Obligations hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances and shall not be discharged except (subject to hereof) by payment in full of the Borrower's Liabilities and occurrence of the Facility Termination Date.
Section 19

4. . All Guarantors' Obligations will be paid in lawful currency of the United States of America and in immediately available funds, regardless of any law, regulation or decree now or hereafter in effect that might in any manner affect the Borrower's Liabilities, or the rights of any Guaranteed Party with respect thereto as against the Borrower, or cause or permit to be invoked any alteration in the time, amount or manner of payment by the Borrower of any or all of the Borrower's Liabilities.
Currency and Funds of Payment

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (December 7, 2011) (NYSE: AN), America's largest automotive retailer (the "Company"), announced today that it entered into a new unsecured credit agreement with a $500 million term loan facility and a $1.2 billion revolving credit facility. The new credit agreement contains an accordion feature that allows the Company, subject to credit availability, to increase the amount of the term loan and revolving credit facilities by up to $500 million in the aggregate. The new credit agreement will terminate on December 7, 2016.
AutoNation, Inc.
The new credit agreement replaces the Company's existing credit agreement (including the term loan facilities due 2012 and 2014 and the revolving credit facilities due 2012 and 2014). With the new credit agreement, the Company increased its maximum leverage ratio from 3.25x to 3.75x and its maximum capitalization ratio from 60% to 65%. The Company also lowered its borrowing costs due to reduced interest rate spreads as compared to the interest rate spreads in its term loan and revolving credit facilities due 2014.
The Company continues to monitor current market conditions. If attractive opportunities become available, it may consummate one or more additional financings, including in the near term.

On February 1, 2012, AutoNation, Inc. (the "Company") closed its sale of $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.500% Senior Notes due 2020 (the "Notes"), pursuant to an underwriting agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement") entered into on January 27, 2012, among the Company, the Company's subsidiary guarantors (the "Guarantors") and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, as representative of the several underwriters named therein. The Notes sold pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement were registered under the Company's registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-157354) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The Notes were issued under a senior indenture, dated as of April 14, 2010 (the "Base Indenture"), between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee (the "Trustee"), as amended and supplemented by a supplemental indenture entered into on February 1, 2012 (the "Supplemental Indenture," and together with the Base Indenture, the "Indenture") among the Company, the Trustee and the Guarantors.
The Notes will mature on February 1, 2020 and bear interest at a rate equal to 5.500% per year, payable on February 1 and August 1 of each year, beginning on August 1, 2012. The Notes are guaranteed by substantially all of the Company's subsidiaries. The Indenture contains certain restrictive covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of the Company to incur liens, enter into sale and leaseback transactions and merge, consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of its assets.
The Underwriting Agreement is being filed as Exhibit 1.1, the Base Indenture is being filed as Exhibit 4.1 and the Supplemental Indenture (which includes the Form of 5.500% Senior Notes due 2020) is being filed as Exhibit 4.2, and each is incorporated herein by reference. The descriptions of the provisions of the Underwriting Agreement, the Base Indenture and the Supplemental Indenture are summary in nature and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the provisions of the definitive agreements.
 
On January 27, 2012, the Company announced the pricing of the Notes. A copy of the press release announcing the pricing of the Notes is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference.
The information furnished pursuant to this Item 7.01, including Exhibit 99.1, shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") or otherwise subject to the liabilities under that Section and shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any filing of the Company under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
 
 
 
        Certain of the agreements listed as exhibits to this Form 8-K (including the schedules and exhibits to such agreements), which are being filed to provide investors with information regarding their terms, contains various representations, warranties and covenants of the Company and the other parties thereto. They are not intended to provide any factual information about any of the parties thereto or any subsidiaries of the parties thereto. The assertions embodied in those representations, warranties and covenants were made for purposes of each of the agreements, solely for the benefit of the parties thereto. In addition, certain representations and warranties were made as of a specific date, may be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from what a security holder might view as material, or may have been made for purposes of allocating contractual risk among the parties rather than establishing matters as facts. Investors should not view the representations, warranties and covenants in the agreements (or any description thereof) as disclosures with respect to the actual state of facts concerning the business, operations or condition of any of the parties to the agreements (or their subsidiaries) and should not rely on them as such. In addition, information in any such representations, warranties or covenants may change after the dates covered by such provisions, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in the public disclosures of the parties. In any event, investors should read the agreements together with the other information concerning the Company contained in reports and statements that it files with the SEC.

In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party and such indemnified party seeks or intends to seek indemnity from an indemnifying party, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate in, and, to the extent that it shall elect, jointly with all other indemnifying parties similarly notified, by written notice delivered to the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party; , , if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that a conflict may arise between the positions of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party in conducting the defense of any such action or that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or the other indemnified parties that are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to assume such legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties.

Contribution
(a) If the indemnification provided for in Section 8 is for any reason unavailable to or otherwise insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount paid or payable by such indemnified party, as incurred, as a result of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions or inaccuracies in the representations and warranties herein which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the Guarantors, and the total underwriting discount received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the front cover page of the Prospectus bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of the Securities as set forth on such cover. The relative fault of the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact or any such inaccurate or alleged inaccurate representation or warranty relates to information supplied by the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, or the Underwriters, on the other hand, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 8(c), any legal or other fees or disbursements reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim.
 
The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 9 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 9.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 9, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the underwriting commissions received by such Underwriter in connection with the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 9 are several, and not joint, in proportion to their respective underwriting commitments as set forth opposite their names in . For purposes of this Section 9, each director, officer, employee, affiliates and agent of an Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Company or a Guarantor, each officer of the Company or a Guarantor who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company or a Guarantor within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company and the Guarantors.

Default of One or More of the Several Underwriters
(a) If, on the Closing Date, any one or more of the several Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Securities that it or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on such date, and the aggregate principal amount of Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase does not exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities to be purchased on such date, the other Underwriters shall be obligated, severally, in the proportions that the principal amount of Securities to be purchased set forth opposite their respective names on bears to the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as may be specified by the Representatives with the consent of the non-defaulting Underwriters, to purchase the Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date. If, on the Closing Date, any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Securities and the principal amount of Securities with respect to which such default occurs exceeds 10% of the principal amount of Securities to be purchased on such date, and arrangements satisfactory to the Representatives and the Company for the purchase of such Securities are not made within 48 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability of any party to any other party except that the provisions of Section 5, Section 7, Section 8, Section 9, Section 13 and Section 17 shall at all times be effective and shall survive such termination. In any such case either the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days in order that the required changes, if any, to the Registration Statement, any Issuer

Free Writing Prospectus, the Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus or any other documents or arrangements may be effected. As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" shall be deemed to include any person substituted for a defaulting Underwriter under this Section 10.

11. .
Termination of this Agreement
(a) Prior to the Closing Date this Agreement may be terminated by the Representatives by notice given to the Company if at any time (i) trading or quotation in any of the Company's securities shall have been suspended or limited by the Commission or by the Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc., (ii) trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. shall have been suspended or limited, or minimum or maximum prices shall have been generally established on any of such stock exchanges by the Commission; (iii) a general banking moratorium shall have been declared by federal or New York authorities or a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States has occurred; or (iv) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of national or international hostilities or any crisis or calamity, or any change in the United States or international financial markets, or any substantial change or development involving a prospective substantial change in United States' or international political, financial or economic conditions, as in the judgment of the Representatives is material and adverse and makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering, sales or delivery of the Securities in the manner and on the terms described in the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus or to enforce contracts for the sale of securities. Any termination pursuant to this Section 11 shall be without liability on the part of (a) the Company or any Guarantor to any Underwriter, except that the Company shall be obligated to reimburse the expenses of the Representatives and the Underwriters pursuant to Sections 5, 7, 8 and 9 hereof or (b) any Underwriter to the Company.

No Advisory or Fiduciary Responsibility
(a) The Company and each Guarantor acknowledge and agree that: (i) the purchase and sale of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement, including the determination of the public offering price of the Securities and any related discounts and commissions, is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company and such Guarantor, on the one hand, and the several Underwriters, on the other hand, and the Company and such Guarantor are capable of evaluating and understanding and understand and accept the terms, risks and conditions of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) in connection with each transaction contemplated hereby and the process leading to such transaction each Underwriter is and has been acting solely as a principal and is not the advisor, agent or fiduciary of the Company, the Guarantors or any of their respective affiliates, stockholders, creditors or employees or any other party; (iii) no Underwriter has assumed or will assume an advisory, agency or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Company or such Guarantor with respect to any of the transactions contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such Underwriter has advised or is currently advising the Company or such Guarantor on other matters) and no Underwriter has any obligation to the Company or such Guarantor with respect
 
to the offering contemplated hereby except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement; (iv) the several Underwriters and their respective affiliates may be engaged in a broad range of transactions that involve interests that differ from those of the Company and the Guarantors and that the several Underwriters have no obligation to disclose any of such interests by virtue of any advisory, agency or fiduciary relationship; and (v) the Underwriters have not provided any legal, accounting, regulatory or tax advice with respect to the offering contemplated hereby and the Company and the Guarantors have consulted their own legal, accounting, regulatory and tax advisors to the extent they deemed appropriate.
This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings (whether written or oral) between the Company, the Guarantors and the several Underwriters, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof. The Company and each Guarantor hereby waive and release, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any claims that the Company or such Guarantor may have against the several Underwriters with respect to any breach or alleged breach of agency or fiduciary duty.
13. . The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the Guarantors, of their respective officers and of the several Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any (A) investigation, or statement as to the results thereof, made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, the QIU, the officers or employees of any Underwriter or the QIU, or any person controlling the Underwriter or the QIU or (B) acceptance of the Securities and payment for them hereunder.

Morgan Securities LLC, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Inc. and the other underwriters party thereto (collectively, the "Underwriters"), hereby certifies that, as of the date hereof:
1. The undersigned has reviewed the Company's preliminary prospectus supplement, dated January 27, 2012, as supplemented by the pricing term sheet dated January 27, 2012, including each of the documents incorporated by reference therein (collectively, the "Offering Materials"), each relating to the offering of the Notes.
2. The undersigned is knowledgeable with respect to the accounting records and internal accounting practices, policies, procedures and controls of the Company and, together with the Company's chief executive officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the Company.

in such Section 7.04, payments in respect of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on such Notes when such payments are due, (b) the Company's obligations with respect to such Notes under Article II of the Supplemental Indenture and Article III and Section 6.02 of the Base Indenture, (c) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee hereunder and the Company's obligations in connection therewith and (d) this Article VII. Subject to compliance with this Article VII, the Company may exercise its option under this Section 7.02 notwithstanding the prior exercise of its option under Section 7.03.
SECTION 7.03 . Upon the Company's exercise under Section 7.01 hereof of the option applicable to this Section 7.03, the Company and each Guarantor shall, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 7.04 hereof, be released from their obligations under the covenants contained in Sections 4.01, 5.01, 5.02, 5.03, 5.04 and 5.05 of this Supplemental Indenture with respect to the Outstanding Notes, and the Events of Default set forth in Sections 6.01(a)(i), 6.01(a)(ii), 6.01(a)(iii) and 6.01(a)(iv) of this Supplemental Indenture shall cease to apply, in each case, on and after the date the conditions set forth in Section 7.04 are satisfied (hereinafter, "Covenant Defeasance"), and the Notes shall thereafter be deemed not "Outstanding" for the purposes of any direction, waiver, consent or declaration or act of Holders (and the consequences of any thereof) in connection with such covenants, but shall continue to be deemed "Outstanding" for all other purposes hereunder (it being understood that the Notes shall not be deemed Outstanding for accounting purposes). For this purpose, Covenant Defeasance means that, with respect to the Outstanding Notes, the Company and each Guarantor may omit to comply with and shall have no liability in respect of any term, condition or limitation set forth in any such covenant, whether directly or indirectly, by reason of any reference elsewhere herein to any such covenant or by reason of any reference in any such covenant to any other provision herein or in any other document and such omission to comply shall not constitute a Default or an Event of Default under Section 6.01 of this Supplemental Indenture or Section 7.01 of the Base Indenture with respect to the Notes, but, except as specified above, the remainder of the Indenture and such Notes shall be unaffected thereby.
Covenant Defeasance

(b) in the case of an election under Section 7.02 of this Supplemental Indenture, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel from independent counsel in the United States stating that (A) the Company has received from, or there has been published by, the Internal Revenue Service a ruling, or (B) since the Issue Date, there has been a change in the applicable U.S. federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such Opinion of Counsel from independent counsel in the United States shall confirm that, the Holders of such Outstanding Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Defeasance had not occurred;
 
(c) in the case of an election under Section 7.03, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel from independent counsel in the United States to the effect that the Holders of such Outstanding Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Covenant Defeasance had not occurred;

(f) such Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not result in the trust arising from such deposit constituting an investment company within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, unless such trust shall be registered under such Act or exempt from registration thereunder;
(g) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel from independent counsel in the United States to the effect that after the 91st day following the date of deposit, the trust funds will not be subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally;
(h) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Company with the intent of preferring the Trustee, Holders of such Notes or any Subsidiary Guarantee over the other creditors of the Company or any Guarantor with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors of the Company or any Guarantor or others; and

The Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect (except as to surviving rights of registration of transfer or exchange of the notes as expressly provided for in the Indenture) and the Trustee, at the expense and written direction of the Company, will execute proper instruments acknowledging satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture as to all Outstanding Notes under the Indenture when:

SECTION 8.01 . Notwithstanding Section 8.02 of this Supplemental Indenture, the Company, the Guarantors and the Trustee may amend or supplement the Indenture or the Notes without notice to or the consent of any Holder of a Note:
Without Consent of Holders of Notes
(1) to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency in the Indenture or the Notes;
(2) to provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes;
(3) to provide for the assumption of the Company's obligations to Holders of Notes in the case of a merger or consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of the Company's assets;
(4) to make any change that, in the good faith opinion of the Board of Directors of the Company, would provide any additional rights or benefits to the Holders of Notes or that does not adversely affect the legal rights under the Indenture of any such Holder;
(5) to secure the Notes or to add additional Guarantors;
(6) to comply with the requirements of the SEC in order to effect or maintain the qualification of the Indenture under the Trust Indenture Act;
 
(7) to conform the text of the Indenture or the Notes to any provision of the "Description of the Notes" in the Prospectus Supplement to the extent that such provision in the "Description of the Notes" in the Prospectus Supplement was intended to be a verbatim recitation of the Indenture, the Subsidiary Guarantees or the Notes;
(8) to remove a Guarantor which, in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, ceases to be liable in respect of its Subsidiary Guarantee;
(9) to add to the covenants of the Company or any Guarantor for the benefit of the Holders of Notes or to surrender any right or power conferred upon the Company or any Guarantor;

(11) to comply with the provisions of the DTC or the Trustee with respect to the provisions in the Indenture and the Notes relating to transfer and exchanges of Notes or beneficial interests in Notes; and
(12) evidence and provide for the acceptance of appointment by a successor trustee.
SECTION 8.02 .
With Consent of Holders of Notes
Except as provided below in this Section 8.02, the Company, the Guarantors and the Trustee may amend or supplement the Indenture or the Notes and/or any Subsidiary Guarantees may be amended or supplemented (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes) of the holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of Outstanding Notes affected by such modifications or amendments; and, subject to Section 7.06 of the Base Indenture, any existing Default or Event of Default (other than a Default or Event of Default in the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the Notes, except a payment default resulting from an acceleration that has been rescinded) or compliance with any provision of the Indenture, the Notes or the Subsidiary Guarantees may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then Outstanding Notes (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes).
Upon the written request of the Company accompanied by a resolution of its Board of Directors authorizing the execution of any such amended or supplemental Indenture, and upon the filing with the Trustee of evidence satisfactory to the Trustee of the consent of the Holders of Notes as aforesaid, and upon receipt by the Trustee of any document requested by it pursuant to Section 11.02(e) of the Base Indenture, the Trustee shall join with the Company and the Guarantors in the execution of such amended or supplemental Indenture and to make any further appropriate agreements and stipulations that may be therein contained, unless such amended or supplemental Indenture directly affects the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under the Indenture or otherwise, in which case the Trustee may in its discretion, but shall not be obligated to, enter into such amended or supplemental Indenture.
It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Holders of Notes under this Section 8.02 to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment or waiver, but it shall be sufficient if such consent approves the substance thereof.
 
After an amendment, supplement or waiver under this Section 8.02 becomes effective, the Company shall mail to the Holders of Notes affected thereby a notice briefly describing the amendment, supplement or waiver. Any failure of the Company to mail such notice, or any defect therein, shall not, however, in any way impair or affect the validity of any such amended or supplemental Indenture or waiver. Subject to Section 7.06, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then Outstanding voting as a single class may waive compliance in a particular instance by the Company and/or the Guarantors with any provision of this Indenture, the Notes or the Subsidiary Guarantees. However, without the consent of each Holder affected, an amendment or waiver under this Section 8.02 may not (with respect to any Notes held by a non-consenting Holder):
(1) reduce the principal amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver;
(2) reduce the principal of or change the fixed maturity of any Note or alter the provisions with respect to the redemption of Notes (other than provisions relating to the covenants described in Section 4.01 of this Supplemental Indenture);
(3) reduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest on any Note;
(4) waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of and interest on the Notes (except a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Notes and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration);
(5) make any Note payable in money other than that stated in the Notes;
(6) make any change in the provisions of the Indenture relating to waivers of past Defaults or the rights of Holders of Notes to receive payments of principal of or interest on the Notes;
(7) waive a redemption payment with respect to any Note (other than a payment required by one of the covenants described in Section 4.01 of this Supplemental Indenture);
(8) make any change in the foregoing amendment and waiver provisions;
(9) modify, without the written consent of the Trustee, the rights, duties or immunities of the Trustee; or
(10) release any Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary from its Subsidiary Guarantee, except as provided in the Indenture.
SECTION 8.03 . Until an amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective, a consent to it by a Holder of a Note is a continuing consent by the Holder of a Note and every subsequent Holder of a Note or portion of a Note that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder's Note, even if notation of the consent is not made on any Note. However, any such Holder of a Note or subsequent Holder of a Note may revoke the consent as to its Note if the Trustee receives written notice of revocation before the date the waiver, supplement or amendment becomes effective. An amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective in accordance with its terms and thereafter binds every Holder.
Revocation and Effect of Consents
SECTION 8.04 . The Trustee may place an appropriate notation about an amendment, supplement or waiver on any affected Note thereafter
Notation on or Exchange of Notes
 
authenticated. The Company in exchange for all affected Notes may issue and the Trustee shall, upon receipt of an authentication order, authenticate new Notes that reflect the amendment, supplement or waiver. Failure to make the appropriate notation or issue a new Note shall not affect the validity and effect of such amendment, supplement or waiver.
SECTION 8.05 The Trustee shall sign any amended or supplemental Indenture authorized pursuant to this Article VIII if the amendment or supplement does not in the judgment of the Trustee adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee. The Company may not sign an amendment or supplemental Indenture until its Board of Directors approves it. In executing any amended or supplemental indenture, the Trustee shall receive and (subject to Section 11.01 of the Base Indenture) shall be fully protected in conclusively relying upon an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel stating that the execution of such amended or supplemental Indenture is authorized or permitted by this Indenture.
Trustee to Sign Amendments, etc.
SECTION 9.01 .
Guarantee
Subject to this Article IX, each of the Guarantors hereby, jointly and severally, unconditionally guarantees to each Holder of a Note authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and to the Trustee and its successors and assigns, irrespective of the validity and enforceability of the Indenture, the Notes or the obligations of the Company hereunder or thereunder, that: (a) the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes will be promptly paid by the Company in full when due, whether at Maturity, by acceleration, redemption or otherwise, and interest on the overdue principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes, if any, if lawful, and all other obligations of the Company to the Holders or the Trustee hereunder or thereunder will be promptly paid by the Company in full or performed by the Company, all in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof; and (b) in case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any Notes or any of such other obligations, that same will be promptly paid by the Company in full when due or performed by the Company in accordance with the terms of the extension or renewal, whether at Stated Maturity, by acceleration or otherwise. Failing payment when due by the Company of any amount so guaranteed or any performance so guaranteed which failure continues for ten (10) days after demand therefor is made to the Company for whatever reason, the Guarantors shall be jointly and severally obligated to pay the same immediately. Each Guarantor agrees that this is a Guarantee of payment and not a Guarantee of collection.
The Guarantors hereby agree that their obligations hereunder shall be unconditional, irrespective of the validity, regularity or enforceability of the Notes or the Indenture, the absence of any action to enforce the same, any waiver or consent by any Holder of the Notes with respect to any provisions hereof or thereof, the recovery of any judgment against the Company, any action to enforce the same or any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a Guarantor. Each Guarantor hereby waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment (except as specifically provided in the preceding paragraph), filing of claims with a court in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company, any right to require a proceeding first against the Company, protest, notice and all demands (except as specifically provided in the preceding paragraph) whatsoever and covenant that this Subsidiary Guarantee shall not be discharged except by complete performance of the obligations contained in the Notes and the Indenture. Each Guarantor also expressly waives,
 
without any requirement of any notice to or further assent by such Guarantor, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the benefit of all principles or provisions of applicable law which are or might be in conflict with the terms hereof, including, without limitation, Section 10-7-23 and Section 10-7-24 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated.
If any Holder or the Trustee is required by any court or otherwise to return to the Company, the Guarantors or any custodian, trustee, liquidator or other similar official acting in relation to either the Company or the Guarantors, any amount paid by either to the Trustee or such Holder, this Subsidiary Guarantee, to the extent theretofore discharged, shall be reinstated in full force and effect.
Each Guarantor agrees that it shall not be entitled to any right of subrogation in relation to the Holders in respect of any obligations guaranteed hereby until payment in full of all obligations guaranteed hereby. Each Guarantor further agrees that, as between the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Holders and the Trustee, on the other hand, (x) the maturity of the obligations guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as provided in Article VII of the Base Indenture and Article VI of this Supplemental Indenture for the purposes of this Subsidiary Guarantee, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the obligations guaranteed hereby, and (y) in the event of any declaration of acceleration of such obligations as provided in Article VII of the Base Indenture and Article VI of this Supplemental Indenture, such obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall forthwith become due and payable by the Guarantors for the purpose of this Subsidiary Guarantee, failing payment when due by the Company which failure continues for ten (10) days after demand therefor is made to the Company. The Guarantors shall have the right to seek contribution from any non-paying Guarantor so long as the exercise of such right does not impair the rights of the Holders under the Subsidiary Guarantee.
SECTION 9.02 . Each Guarantor, and by its acceptance of Notes, each Holder, hereby confirms that it is the intention of all such parties that the Subsidiary Guarantee of such Guarantor not constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance for purposes of Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar federal or state law to the extent applicable to any Subsidiary Guarantee. To effectuate the foregoing intention, the Trustee, the Holders and the Guarantors hereby irrevocably agree that the obligations of such Guarantor under its Subsidiary Guarantee and this Article IX shall be limited to the maximum amount as will, after giving effect to such maximum amount and all other contingent and fixed liabilities of such Guarantor that are relevant under such laws, and after giving effect to any collections from, rights to receive contribution from or payments made by or on behalf of any other Guarantor in respect of the obligations of such other Guarantor under this Article IX, result in the obligations of such Guarantor under its Subsidiary Guarantee not constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance.
Limitation on Guarantor Liability
SECTION 9.03 .
Execution and Delivery of Guarantee
To evidence the Subsidiary Guarantees set forth in Section 9.01 of this Supplemental Indenture, the Company hereby agrees to cause a notation of such Subsidiary Guarantee substantially in the form of hereto to be endorsed by manual or facsimile signature by an officer of each Guarantor on each Note authenticated and delivered by the Trustee. The Company shall cause all future Guarantors to execute a supplemental indenture substantially in the form of hereto.
Exhibit B
Exhibit C
Each Guarantor hereby agrees that its Subsidiary Guarantee set forth in Section 9.01 of this Supplemental Indenture and in any subsequent supplemental indentures shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any failure to endorse on each Note a notation of such Subsidiary Guarantee.
 
If an officer whose signature is on any supplemental indenture or on the Subsidiary Guarantee no longer holds that office at the time the Trustee authenticates the Note on which a Subsidiary Guarantee is endorsed, the Subsidiary Guarantee shall be valid and obligatory nevertheless.
The delivery of any Note by the Trustee, after the authentication thereof hereunder, shall constitute due delivery of the Subsidiary Guarantee set forth in this Supplemental Indenture on behalf of the Guarantors.
In the event that the Company creates or acquires any new Domestic Subsidiaries subsequent to the date of this Supplemental Indenture, if required by Section 5.03 of this Supplemental Indenture, the Company shall cause such Domestic Subsidiaries to execute supplemental indentures to the Indenture and Subsidiary Guarantees in accordance with Section 5.03 of this Supplemental Indenture and this Article IX, to the extent applicable.
SECTION 9.04 . The Subsidiary Guarantee of a Guarantor will be released:
Release of Guarantor
(a) upon any sale, exchange or transfer, to any Person not an Affiliate of the Company, of all of the Company's Capital Stock in, or all or substantially all the assets of, such Domestic Subsidiary, which transaction is in compliance with the terms of the Indenture and such Domestic Subsidiary is released from all guarantees, if any, by it of other Indebtedness of the Company or any Domestic Subsidiary;
(b) either Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance occurs with respect to such Notes in compliance with Article VII of this Supplemental Indenture; or
(c) with respect to any Subsidiary Guarantees created after the Issue Date, the release by the holders of the Indebtedness of the Company described in Section 5.03(a) of this Supplemental Indenture of their Guarantee by such Domestic Subsidiary (including any deemed release upon payment in full of all obligations under such Indebtedness), at such time as (A) no other Indebtedness of the Company has been guaranteed by such Domestic Subsidiary or (B) the holders of all such other Indebtedness which is guaranteed by such Domestic Subsidiary also release their Guarantee by such Domestic Subsidiary (including any deemed release upon payment in full of all obligations under such Indebtedness).
The Trustee, at the expense and written direction of the Company, will execute proper instruments acknowledging the termination of such Subsidiary Guarantee as reasonably required by the representative of such Guarantor.
Any Guarantor not released from its obligations under its Subsidiary Guarantee shall remain liable for the full amount of principal and premium, if any, of and interest on the Notes and for the other obligations of any Guarantor under the Indenture as provided in this Article IX.
SECTION 9.05 . It is hereby acknowledged that the enforcement of certain rights with respect to the Subsidiary Guarantees is subject to the terms and conditions of the Manufacturers' Letter Agreements.
Acknowledgement of Manufacturers' Letter Agreements
 
SECTION 9.06 . As used in this Section 9.06, any reference to "the principal" includes the Company, and any reference to "the creditor" includes the Holders. In accordance with Section 2856 of the California Civil Code:
Certain California Law Waivers
(a) each Guarantor agrees (i) to waive any and all rights of subrogation and reimbursement against the Company or against any collateral or security granted by the Company for any of the Guarantor's obligations and (ii) to withhold the exercise of any and all rights of contribution against any other guarantor of any of the Guarantor's obligations and against any collateral or security granted by any such other guarantor for any of the Guarantor's obligations until the Guarantor's obligations shall have been indefeasibly paid in full;
(b) each Guarantor waives any and all other rights and defenses available to the Guarantor by reason of Sections 2787 to 2855, inclusive, 2899 and 3433 of the California Civil Code, including any and all rights or defenses Guarantor may have by reason of protection afforded to the principal with respect to any of the Guarantor's obligations, or to any other guarantor of any of the Guarantor's obligations with respect to any of such guarantor's obligations under its guaranty, in either case pursuant to the antideficiency or other laws of the State of California limiting or discharging the principal's indebtedness or such guarantor's obligations, including Section 580a, 580b, 580d, or 726 of the California Code of Civil Procedure; and
(c) each Guarantor waives all rights and defenses arising out of an election of remedies by the creditor, even though that election of remedies, such as a nonjudicial foreclosure with respect to security for any Subsidiary Guarantee obligation, has destroyed Guarantor's rights of subrogation and reimbursement against the principal by the operation of Section 580d of the Code of Civil Procedure or otherwise; and even though that election of remedies by the creditor, such as nonjudicial foreclosure with respect to security for an obligation of any other guarantor of any of the Guarantor's obligations, has destroyed Guarantor's rights of contribution against such other guarantor.
No other provision of this Article IX shall be construed as limiting the generality of any of the covenants and waivers set forth in this Section 9.06. In accordance with Section 10.06 of this Supplemental Indenture, the Subsidiary Guarantees shall be governed by, and shall be construed and enforced in accordance with, the internal laws of the State of New York. This Section 9.06 is included solely out of an abundance of caution, and shall not be construed to mean that any of the above-referenced provisions of California law are in any way applicable to the Subsidiary Guarantees or to any of the Guarantor's obligations.

Capitalized terms used herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture referred to below unless otherwise indicated.

The Company shall pay interest semi-annually in arrears on February 1 and August 1 of each year, or, if such date is not a Business Day, on the next succeeding Business Day (each, an "Interest Payment Date"), commencing August 1, 2012.

Such payment shall be in such coin or currency of the United States of America at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts.
 
Initially, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, the Trustee under the Indenture, shall act as Paying Agent and Registrar. The Company may appoint and change any Paying Agent or Registrar without notice to any holder. The Company or any of its Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or Registrar.
 
 
The Company issued the Notes under an Indenture dated as of April 14, 2010 (the "Base Indenture"), as supplemented by that Supplemental Indenture dated as of February 1, 2012 (the "Supplemental Indenture" and, together with the Base Indenture, the "Indenture"), each among the Company, the Guarantors and the Trustee. The terms of the Notes include those stated in the Indenture and those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (15 U.S.C.   77aaa-77bbbb) as in effect on the date of the Indenture (the "Trust Indenture Act"). Terms defined in the Indenture and not defined herein have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Indenture. The Notes are subject to all such terms, and Holders are referred to the Indenture and the Trust Indenture Act for a statement of those terms.
The Company shall be entitled, subject to its compliance with Section 2.03(e) of the Supplemental Indenture, to create and issue further securities having the same ranking and terms and conditions as the Notes in all respects, except for the issue date, the public offering price and, in some cases, the first Interest Payment Date. The Notes initially issued on the Issue Date and any additional Notes shall be treated as a single class for all purposes under the Indenture.
 
Except as described below, the Notes will not be redeemable by the Company prior to Maturity.
At any time prior to February 1, 2015, the Company may redeem up to 35% of the principal amount of the Notes with the net cash proceeds of one or more Public Equity Offerings of its common stock at a redemption price (expressed as a percentage of principal amount) of 105.5%, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the Redemption Date; : (1) at least 65% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes originally issued on the Issue Date remains Outstanding after each such redemption; and (2) notice of any such redemption is mailed within 60 days of each such Public Equity Offering (with a copy to the Trustee).
provided that
"Public Equity Offering" means an underwritten public offering of common stock (other than redeemable Capital Stock) of the Company with gross cash proceeds to the Company of at least $50.0 million pursuant to an effective registration statement filed pursuant to the Securities Act (other than a registration statement on Form S-4 (or any successor form covering substantially the same transactions), Form S-8 (or any successor form covering substantially the same transactions) or otherwise relating to equity securities issuable under any employee benefit plan).
In addition, the Company shall have the right to redeem the Notes at any time in whole, or from time to time, in part at a redemption price (the "Redemption Price") equal to the greater of: (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed; and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Notes to be redeemed, exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption, discounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Yield, plus fifty (50) basis points, plus accrued interest to the date of redemption.
 
The Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. Notice of redemption (with a copy to the Trustee) shall be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the Redemption Date to each Holder to be redeemed at his or her registered address.
 
If a Change of Control Repurchase Event occurs, unless the Company has exercised its right to redeem the Notes pursuant to the Indenture, the Company shall be required to make an offer to each Holder of the Notes to repurchase all or a portion of such Holder's Notes (the "Change of Control Offer"), at a purchase price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued interest, if any, to the date of purchase (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on an interest payment date that is on or prior to the date fixed for redemption). Within 30 days following the date upon which the Change of Control Repurchase Event occurred, the Company must send (with a copy to the Trustee), by first class mail, a notice to each Holder, which notice shall govern the terms of the Change of Control Offer and shall be in compliance with the Indenture. Holders electing to have a Note purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer shall be required to surrender the Note, with the form entitled "Option of Holder to Elect Purchase" on the reverse of the Note completed, to the Paying Agent at the address specified in the notice.
 
The Notes are in registered form without coupons in minimum denominations of $2,000 principal and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. A Holder may register, transfer or exchange Notes in accordance with the Indenture. The Registrar may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements or transfer documents and to pay any taxes and fees required by law or permitted by the Indenture. The Registrar need not register the transfer of or exchange any Notes selected for redemption (except, in the case of a Note to be redeemed in part, the portion of the Note not to be redeemed) or any Notes for a period of 15 days before a selection of Notes to be redeemed.
 
The registered Holder of this Note may be treated as the owner of it for all purposes.
 
Subject to certain conditions set forth in the Indenture, the Company at any time shall be entitled to terminate some or all of its and the Guarantors' obligations under the Notes and the Indenture if the Company deposits with the Trustee money or U.S. Government Obligations for the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes to redemption or maturity, as the case may be.
 
The Indenture, the Subsidiary Guarantees or the Notes may be amended or supplemented as provided in the Indenture.
 
If any Event of Default (as defined in the Indenture) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then Outstanding Notes may declare all the Notes to be due and payable by notice in writing to the Company and the Trustee (if declared by the Holders) specifying the respective Event of Default and that it is a "notice of acceleration," and the same shall
 
become immediately due and payable. Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture and the Trust Indenture Act. Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then Outstanding Notes may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. However, the Trustee may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines may be unduly prejudicial to the rights of other Holders of Notes or that may involve the Trustee in personal liability. The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement regarding compliance with the Indenture, and the Company is required upon becoming aware of any Default or Event of Default, to deliver to the Trustee a statement specifying such Default or Event of Default.
 
The full and punctual payment by the Company of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes is fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several senior unsecured basis by each of the Guarantors. Reference is hereby made to the Indenture for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and obligations thereunder of the Guarantors, the Trustee and the Holders.
 
Subject to certain limitations imposed by the Trust Indenture Act, the Trustee under the Indenture, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Notes and may otherwise deal with and collect obligations owed to it by the Company or its Affiliates and may make loans to, accept deposits from, and perform services for the Company or its Affiliates, and may otherwise deal with the Company or its Affiliates, as if it were not the Trustee.
 
Any past, present, or future director, officer, employee, incorporator or stockholder, as such, of the Company, any Guarantors or the Trustee shall not have any liability for any obligations of the Company or any Guarantor under the Notes, the Indenture, the Subsidiary Guarantees or for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such obligations or their creation. By accepting a Note, each Holder waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for the issue of the Notes.
 
This Note shall not be valid until an authorized signatory of the Trustee (or an authenticating agent) signs the certificate of authentication on the other side of this Note.
 
Customary abbreviations may be used in the name of a Holder or an assignee, such as TEN COM (=tenants in common), TEN ENT (=tenants by the entireties), JT TEN (=joint tenants with rights of survivorship and not as tenants in common), CUST (=custodian), and U/G/M/A (=Uniform Gift to Minors Act).
 
Pursuant to a recommendation promulgated by the Committee on Uniform Security Identification Procedures the Company has caused CUSIP numbers to be printed on the Notes and has directed the Trustee to use CUSIP numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders. No representation is made as to the accuracy of such numbers either as printed on the Notes or as contained in any notice of redemption and reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers placed thereon.
 
THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK SHALL GOVERN AND BE USED TO CONSTRUE THIS NOTE.

New Incentive Bonus Plan
On February 1, 2012, the Board of Directors (the Board) of AutoNation, Inc. (the Company) adopted a new incentive bonus plan, the AutoNation, Inc. Senior Executive Incentive Bonus Plan (the Incentive Plan). The Incentive Plan, which is administered by the Executive Compensation Subcommittee (the Subcommittee) of the Compensation Committee (the Committee) of the Board, is subject to approval by the Companys stockholders at the 2012 Annual Meeting of AutoNation, Inc. Stockholders. The Incentive Plan, which is substantially identical to and is intended to replace the AutoNation, Inc. Senior Executive Incentive Bonus Plan approved by the Board and the Companys stockholders in 2007, is designed to create a direct link between pay and performance for the Companys executive officers and to ensure that annual cash performance bonuses payable to executive officers of the Company are tax deductible by the Company pursuant to Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code).
A copy of the Incentive Plan is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
Incentive Plan and AOP Plan Targets for 2012
On February 1, 2012, the Subcommittee (i) selected the 2012 participants under the Incentive Plan, (ii) established specific objective annual performance goals for 2012 under the Incentive Plan and the AutoNation Operating Performance Plan (the AOP Plan), a separate bonus plan for bonus-eligible, corporate-level employees who are not participants under the Incentive Plan, and (iii) set target awards for the 2012 participants under the Incentive Plan and the AOP Plan.
The Subcommittee selected the following executive officers to participate in the Incentive Plan for 2012: Mike Jackson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Michael E. Maroone, President and Chief Operating Officer; Jonathan P. Ferrando, Executive Vice President, General Counsel & Secretary; Michael J. Short, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; David L. Koehler, Senior Vice President, Sales; and Alan J. McLaren, Senior Vice President, Customer Care (collectively, the Executive Officers). These officers were selected to participate in the Incentive Plan to ensure tax deductibility of bonuses under Section 162(m) of the Code.
The 2012 performance goals established by the Subcommittee under the Incentive Plan are based upon the achievement of specified levels of adjusted operating income per basic share (
minus a net charge for capital deployed for acquisitions or share repurchases
and subject to an adjustment for certain extraordinary or other items
) and adjusted operating income as a percentage of gross profit for the Company during 2012. The target awards under the Incentive Plan are expressed as a percentage of base salary for each Executive Officer that ranges from 45% to 133-1/3%.
The 2012 performance goals established under the Incentive Plan also constitute the performance goals that the Committee established under the AOP Plan. The target awards under the AOP Plan are also expressed as a percentage of base salary. The Executive Officers do not participate in the AOP Plan.
Bonus awards under both the Incentive Plan and the AOP Plan will be payable on a sliding scale based on the Companys actual achievement relative to the predetermined goals, meaning that bonuses earned may exceed or be less than the targeted level, and bonus payouts are subject to minimum thresholds of performance. The Subcommittee has absolute negative discretion to eliminate or reduce the amount of any award under the Incentive Plan or the AOP Plan.
2012 Annual Stock Option and Restricted Stock Awards
On February 1, 2012, the Subcommittee also approved annual stock option and restricted stock awards for all of the Companys equity grant-eligible employees under the AutoNation, Inc. 2008 Employee Equity and Incentive Plan (the 2008 Plan). The annual awards include stock option awards for our Executive Officers, specifically, Mike Jackson - 201,336 options, Michael E. Maroone - 161,140 options, Jonathan P. Ferrando - 121,080 options, Michael J. Short - 121,080 options, David L. Koehler - 12,108 options, and Alan J. McLaren - 12,108 options. Additionally, the annual awards include restricted stock awards for Messrs. Koehler and McLaren, who will each receive 4,036 shares of restricted stock (the other Executive Officers did not receive restricted stock awards).
One-fourth (1/4) of each stock option award approved by the Subcommittee will be granted on the first trading day of each of March, June, September and December 2012, with an exercise price equal to the closing price of our common stock on
each such grant date, subject to continuous employment through each such grant date. Each of the four option grants comprising an annual award will vest in 25% annual increments on each of the first four anniversaries of June 1, 2012 and will expire on March 1, 2022 (subject to earlier termination in accordance with the terms of the 2008 Plan and the applicable award agreements). The restricted stock awards approved by the Subcommittee will be granted on the first trading day of March 2012 and will vest in 25% annual increments on each of the first four anniversaries of June 1, 2012.
Amendment to 2007 Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan
On February 1, 2012, the Board approved an amendment (the Amendment) to the AutoNation, Inc. 2007 Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan (as amended on October 26, 2010, the 2007 Plan), pursuant to which each of the Companys non-employee directors receives an automatic option grant on the first trading day of each March, June, September, and December. Prior to the adoption of the Amendment, each option granted under the 2007 Plan was immediately exercisable and expired on the tenth anniversary of the option grant date. The Amendment provides that, after February 1, 2012, (1) each option granted under the 2007 Plan shall vest and become exercisable with respect to 25% of the total number of shares underlying the option on June 1 of the year following the year in which the option is granted (the Initial Vesting Date) and with respect to an additional 25% on each of the next three succeeding anniversaries of the Initial Vesting Date, (2) except as set forth in (3) below, in the event an optionee ceases to be a non-employee director, then any options held by such director shall become immediately vested and exercisable until the earlier of (a) 30 days following the date the optionee ceases to be a non-employee director and (b) the expiration of the options, (3) in the event an optionee ceases to be a non-employee director because of retirement, death or permanent and total disability (each as defined in the 2007 Plan), then any options held by such director shall become immediately vested and exercisable until the earlier of (x) the third anniversary of the date of such retirement, death or permanent and total disability and (y) the expiration of the options, and (4) each option granted thereunder shall expire on the tenth anniversary of the first option grant date in the year in which the option was granted.
A copy of the Amendment is filed as Exhibit 10.2 to this report and is incorporated herein by reference.

Unless otherwise provided by the Committee in connection with specified terminations of employment, payment in respect of Awards shall be made only if and to the extent the Performance Factors with respect to such Performance Period are attained.
(b) Special Provisions Regarding Awards. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in no event shall payment in respect of Awards granted hereunder exceed $5,000,000 to any one Participant in any one year.

(b) Nontransferability. Awards shall not be transferable by a Participant except upon the Participant's death following the end of the Performance Period but prior to the date payment is made, in which case the Award shall be transferable in accordance with any beneficiary designation made by the Participant in accordance with Section 7(k) below or, in the absence thereof, by will or the laws of descent and distribution.
(c) No Right To Continued Employment. Nothing in the Plan or in any Award granted pursuant hereto shall confer upon any Participant the right to continue in the employ of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or to be entitled to any remuneration or benefits not set forth in the Plan or to interfere with or limit in any way whatever rights otherwise exist of the Company or its Subsidiaries to terminate such Participant's employment or change such Participant's remuneration.
(d) Withholding Taxes. Where a Participant or other person is entitled to receive a payment pursuant to an Award hereunder, the Company shall have the right either to deduct from the payment, or to require the Participant or such other person to pay to the Company prior to delivery of such payment, an amount sufficient to satisfy any federal, state, local or other withholding tax requirements related thereto.
(e) Amendment and Termination of the Plan. The Board or the Committee may at any time and from time to time alter, amend, suspend, or terminate the Plan in whole or in part; provided that no amendment that requires stockholder approval in order for the Plan to continue to comply with Code Section 162(m) shall be effective unless the same shall be approved by the requisite vote of the stockholders of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no amendment shall affect adversely any of the rights of any Participant under any Award following the end of the Performance Period to which such Award relates, provided that the exercise of the Committee's discretion pursuant to Section 5(b) to reduce the amount of an Award shall not be deemed an amendment of the Plan.
(f) Participant Rights. No Participant shall have any claim to be granted any Award under the Plan, and there is no obligation for uniformity of treatment for Participants.
(g) Termination of Employment.
(h) Unfunded Status of Awards. The Plan is intended to constitute an unfunded plan for incentive and deferred compensation. With respect to any payments not yet made to a Participant pursuant to an Award, nothing contained in the Plan or any Award shall give any such Participant any rights that are greater than those of a general creditor of the Company.
(i) Governing Law. The Plan and all determinations made and actions taken pursuant hereto shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to the conflict of laws principles thereof.
(j) Effective Date. The Plan shall take effect upon its adoption by the Board; provided, however, that the Plan shall be subject to the requisite approval of the stockholders of the Company in order to comply with Section 162(m) of the Code. In the absence of such approval, the Plan (and any Awards made pursuant to the Plan prior to the date of such approval) shall be null and void.
(k) Beneficiary. A Participant may file with the Committee a written designation of a beneficiary on such form as may be prescribed by the Committee and may, from time to time, amend or revoke such designation. If no designated beneficiary survives the Participant and an Award is payable to the Participant's beneficiary pursuant to Section 7(b), the executor or administrator of the Participant's estate shall be deemed to be the grantee's beneficiary.
(l) Interpretation. The Plan is designed and intended to comply, to the extent applicable, with Section 162(m) of the Code, and all provisions hereof shall be construed in a manner to so comply.

2007 NON-EMPLOYEE
DIRECTOR STOCK OPTION PLAN
AMENDED AND RESTATED AS OF FEBRUARY 1, 2012
1. STATEMENT OF PURPOSE. This 2007 Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan (this Plan) is intended to promote the interests of AutoNation, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the Company), by offering non-employee members of the Board of Directors of the Company (individually, a Non-Employee Director, and collectively, Non-Employee Directors) the opportunity to participate in a stock option program designed to provide them with significant incentives to remain in the service of the Company.
2. ELIGIBILITY. Each Non-Employee Director shall be eligible to receive grants of nonstatutory options under this Plan (individually, an Option, collectively, Options) pursuant to the provisions of Section 5 hereof. Except for the automatic grants of Options to be made pursuant to the provisions of Section 5 hereof, Non-Employee Directors shall not be eligible to receive any additional Option grants or stock issuances under this Plan.
3. ADMINISTRATION.
The Plan shall be administered by the Board of Directors of the Company (the Board), which shall have the full power and authority to take all actions, and to make all determinations required or provided for under the Plan or any Option granted under the Plan and all such other actions and determinations not inconsistent with the specific terms and provisions of the Plan deemed by the Board to be necessary or appropriate to the administration of the Plan or any Option granted hereunder. All such actions and determinations shall be by the affirmative vote of a majority of the members of the Board present at a meeting at which any issue relating to the Plan is properly raised for consideration or without a meeting by written consent of the Board executed in accordance with the Company's Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, and with applicable law. The interpretation and construction by the Board of any provision of the Plan or of any Option granted hereunder shall be final and conclusive.
The Board may from time to time appoint a committee or subcommittee (the Committee) consisting of not less than two members of the Board, none of whom shall be an officer or other salaried employee of the Company or any Subsidiary. The Board, in its sole discretion, may provide that the role of the Committee shall be limited to making recommendations to the Board concerning any determinations to be made and actions to be taken by the Board pursuant to or with respect to the Plan, or the Board may delegate to the Committee such powers and authorities related to the administration of the Plan as the Board shall determine, consistent with the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Company and applicable law. The Board may remove members, add members, and fill vacancies on the Committee from time to time, all in accordance with the Company's Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, and with applicable law. The majority vote of the Committee, or acts reduced to or approved in writing by a majority of the members of the Committee, shall be the valid acts of the Committee.
No member of the Board or of the Committee shall be liable for any action or determination made in good faith with respect to the Plan or any Option granted hereunder.
In the event that the Plan or any Option granted hereunder provides for any action to be taken by or determination to be made by the Board, such action may be taken by or such determination may be made by the Committee if the power and authority to do so has been delegated to the Committee by the Board as provided above. Unless otherwise expressly determined by the Board, any such action or determination by the Committee shall be final and conclusive.
4. STOCK SUBJECT TO PLAN. The stock issuable under this Plan shall be the shares of the Company's common stock, par value of $.01 per share (Common Stock). Such shares may be made available from authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock or shares of Common Stock reacquired by the Company. The aggregate number of shares of Common Stock issuable under exercise of Options upon this Plan shall not exceed 2,000,000 shares, subject to adjustment from time to time in accordance with Section 11 hereof.
5. AUTOMATIC GRANTING OF OPTIONS. Commencing with the first trading day of March 2011, on the first trading day of each March, June, September and December while the Plan is in effect, each individual who is at the time serving as a Non-Employee Director shall receive an automatic grant of an Option to purchase 5,000 shares of Common Stock. The foregoing dates are herein referred to individually as an Automatic Grant Date and collectively as Automatic Grant Dates and the Non-Employee Directors receiving Options are herein referred to individually as an Optionee and collectively as Optionees. Options granted under the Plan are not intended to be treated as incentive stock options as defined in Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code). For purposes of this Plan, the term trading day shall mean a day on which the New York Stock Exchange or the principal U.S. stock exchange upon the Company's common stock
is listed is open for trading.
In the event that an Option expires or is terminated or canceled and is unexercised as to any shares of Common Stock, the shares subject to the Option, or the portion thereof not so exercised, shall be available for subsequent automatic Option grants under this Plan. Should the total number of shares of Common Stock at the time available under this Plan not be sufficient for the automatic grants to be made at that particular time, the available shares shall be allocated proportionately among all the automatic grants to be made at that time.
6. EXERCISE PRICE. The price per share payable upon exercise of an Option (Exercise Price) shall be the composite closing price of a share of Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange or the principal U.S. stock exchange upon which the Company's Common Stock is listed (the Closing Price) on the Automatic Grant Date.
7. DURATION OF OPTIONS AND EXERCISABILITY. Subject to the provisions of Section 9 hereof, each Option shall expire on the tenth (10th) anniversary of the first Automatic Grant Date in the year in which the Option was granted. Subject to the provisions of Section 9 hereof, each Option shall become exercisable with respect to 25% of the total number of shares subject to the Option on June 1st of the calendar year next following the calendar year in which the applicable Automatic Grant Date occurs (the Initial Vesting Date) and with respect to an additional 25% of the number of such shares on each of the next three succeeding anniversaries of the Initial Vesting Date. The Option shall thereafter remain so exercisable until the expiration or sooner termination of the Option term.
Notwithstanding any such provision in this Plan, no later than thirty (30) days after a Change of Control (as defined below), each Optionee shall have the right to require the Company to purchase from the Optionee any Option granted under this Plan at a purchase price equal to (i) the excess of the Closing Price (determined on the trading day preceding the day on which the Optionee provides the written notice described below or, if later, the date preceding the date of the Change of Control) over the Exercise Price, multiplied by (ii) the number of Option shares specified by such individual for purchase by the Company, in a written notice to the Company, attention of the Secretary. A Change of Control shall be deemed to occur if any person shall (a) acquire direct or indirect beneficial ownership of at least 50% of the issued and outstanding Common Stock of the Company, or (b) has the power (whether such power arises as a result of the ownership of capital stock, by contract or otherwise), or the ability to elect or cause the election of directors consisting at the time of such election of a majority of the Board of Directors of the Company. As used herein, person shall mean any person, corporation, partnership, joint venture or other entity or any group (as such term is defined in Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules promulgated thereunder). The amount payable to each such individual by the Company shall be in cash or by certified check and shall be reduced by any taxes required to be withheld.
8. EXERCISE OF OPTION. An Option may be exercised (i) by giving written notice to the Company, attention of the Secretary, specifying the number of shares to be purchased, accompanied by the full purchase price for the shares to be purchased in cash or (ii) in such other manner permitted by the Company, whether through the Company or the Company's stock option administrator.
At any time of any exercise of any Option, the Company may, if it shall determine it necessary or desirable for any reason, require the Optionee (or his or her heirs, legatees, or legal representative, as the case may be), as a condition upon the exercise thereof, to deliver to the Company a written representation of present intention to purchase the shares for investment and not for distribution. In the event such representation is required to be delivered, an appropriate legend may be placed upon each certificate delivered to the Optionee (or his or her heirs, legatees or legal representative, as the case may be) upon his or her exercise of part or all of the Option and a stop transfer order may be placed with the transfer agent. Each Option shall also be subject to the requirement that, if at any time the Company determines, in its discretion, that the listing, registration or qualification of the shares subject to the Option upon any securities exchange or under any state or federal law, or the consent or approval of any governmental regulatory body is necessary or desirable as a condition or in connection with, the issue or purchase of shares thereunder, the Option may not be exercised in whole or in part unless such listing, registration, qualification, consent or approval shall have been effected or obtained free of any conditions not acceptable to the Company.
At the time of the exercise of any Option the Company may require, as a condition of the exercise of such Option, the Optionee to pay the Company an amount equal to the amount of tax the Company is required to withhold to obtain a deduction for federal income tax purposes as a result of the exercise of such Option by the Optionee.
9. TERMINATION OF BOARD MEMBERSHIP - EXERCISE THEREAFTER. Should an Optionee cease to be a Non-Employee Director for any reason other than Retirement, death or permanent and total disability (as that term is defined in Section 22(e)(3) of the Code, as now in effect or as subsequently amended), such Optionee's Options shall become exercisable in full and shall remain exercisable (including, in the event of the Optionee's death, by the Optionee's heirs, legatees, or legal
representative, as the case may be), until the earlier of (i) thirty (30) days following the date the Optionee ceases to be a Non-Employee Director and (ii) the expiration date of the Option.
Should an Optionee cease to be a Non-Employee Director because of Retirement, death or permanent and total disability (as that term is defined in Section 22(e)(3) of the Code, as now in effect or as subsequently amended), such Optionee's Options shall become exercisable in full and shall remain exercisable (including, in the event of the Optionee's death, by the Optionee's heirs, legatees, or legal representative, as the case may be) until the earlier of (i) the third anniversary of the date of such Retirement, death or permanent and total disability and (ii) the expiration date of the Option. For purposes of this Plan, Retirement shall mean termination of Board service as a result of a Non-Employee Director's retirement or resignation from the Board after having reached age 55 and having provided at least six (6) years of Board service to the Company.
10. TRANSFERABILITY OF OPTIONS. No Option shall be assignable or transferable by the Optionee to whom it is granted, other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, except that, upon approval by the Board, the Optionee may transfer an Option (a) pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order as defined for purposes of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, or (b) by gift: to a member of the Family (as defined below) of the Optionee, to or for the benefit of one or more organizations qualifying under Code Sections 501(c) (3) and 170(c) (2) (a Charitable Organization) or to a trust for the exclusive benefit of the Optionee, one or more members of the Optionee's Family, one or more Charitable Organizations, or any combination of the foregoing, provided that any such transferee shall enter into a written agreement to be bound by the terms of this Plan. For this purpose, Family shall mean the ancestors, spouse, siblings, spouses of siblings, lineal descendants and spouses of lineal descendants of the Optionee.
11. ADJUSTMENTS. The number of shares subject to this Plan and to Options granted under this Plan shall be adjusted as follows: (a) in the event that the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock is changed by any stock dividend, stock split or combination of shares, the number of shares subject to this Plan and to Options granted hereunder shall be proportionately adjusted; (b) in the event of any merger, consolidation or reorganization of the Company with any other corporation or corporations, there shall be substituted, on an equitable basis, for each share of Common Stock then subject to this Plan, whether or not at the time subject to outstanding Options, the number and kind of shares of stock or other securities or property to which the holders of shares of Common Stock will be entitled pursuant to the transaction; and (c) in the event of any other relevant change in the capitalization of the Company, an equitable adjustment shall be made in the number and kind of shares of stock or other securities or property then subject to this Plan, whether or not then subject to outstanding Options. In the event of any such adjustment, the Exercise Price per share shall be proportionately adjusted.
12. AMENDMENT OF PLAN. This Plan may from time to time be amended or discontinued by action of the Board of Directors of the Company, provided that (i) no such amendment or discontinuance shall change or impair any Options previously granted without the consent of the Optionee, and (ii) any amendment which would (A) materially increase the benefits accruing to the participants under this Plan, (B) materially increase the number of securities which may be issued under this Plan, and/or (C) materially modify the requirements as to the eligibility for participation in this Plan shall require the approval of the stockholders of the Company, unless such approval is not required by Rule 16b-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 1934 Act), or any other applicable law.
13. CASH PROCEEDS. Any cash proceeds received by the Company from the sale of shares pursuant to the Options granted under this Plan shall be used for general corporate purposes.
14. NO IMPAIRMENT OF RIGHTS. Nothing in this Plan or any automatic grant made pursuant to this Plan shall be construed or interpreted so as to affect adversely or otherwise impair the Company's right to remove any Optionee from service on the Board of Directors of the Company at any time in accordance with the Company's Bylaws or any provisions of applicable law.
15. COMPLIANCE WITH RULE 16b-3. This Plan is intended to comply with all applicable conditions of Rule 16b-3 or its successors promulgated under the 1934 Act, regardless of whether such conditions are set forth in this Plan.

As part of the amendment, Article IX of the Companys By-Laws was renumbered as Article VIII.
The foregoing description of the amendment to the Companys By-Laws is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the Amended and Restated By-Laws, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
Item 8.01 Other Events.
On March 23, 2012, the Company issued a press release announcing that its Board has authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $250 million of the Companys common stock under the Companys share repurchase program.

Quorum; Adjournment, Postponement or Cancellation of Meetings
. Except as otherwise required by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation, the holders of a majority of the capital stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders for the transaction of business. A quorum, once established, shall not be broken by the withdrawal of enough votes to leave less than a quorum.

Without limiting the manner in which a stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act for him or her as proxy, either of the following shall constitute a valid means by which a stockholder may grant such authority:
(a)    a stockholder may execute a writing authorizing another person or persons to act for him or her as proxy. Execution may be accomplished by the stockholder or his or her authorized officer, director, employee or agent signing such writing or causing his or her signature to be affixed to such writing by any reasonable means, including, but not limited to, by facsimile signature.
(b)    a stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act for him or her as proxy by transmitting or authorizing the transmission of an electronic transmission to the person who will be the holder of the proxy or to a proxy solicitation firm, proxy support service organization or like agent duly authorized by the person who will be the holder of the proxy to receive such electronic transmission, provided that any such electronic transmission must either set forth or be submitted with information from which it can be determined that the electronic transmission was authorized by the stockholder. If it is determined that such electronic
3
transmissions are valid, the inspectors, or if there are no inspectors, such other persons making that determination shall specify the information on which they relied.
Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reliable reproduction of the writing or transmission authorizing another person or persons to act as proxy for a stockholder may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing or transmission for any and all purposes for which the original writing or transmission could be used; provided that such copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing or transmission.
Section 6
.
Voting
. At all meetings of the stockholders at which a quorum is present, except as otherwise required by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws, any question brought before any meeting of stockholders shall be decided by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the total number of votes of the capital stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on such question, voting as a single class. Except as otherwise required in the Certificate of Incorporation, the Board of Directors, in its discretion, or the officer of the Corporation presiding at a meeting of stockholders, in his or her discretion, may require that any votes cast at such meeting shall be cast by written ballot.
Section 7
.
Nature of Business at Annual Meetings of Stockholders
. Only such business (other than the nominations for election to the Board of Directors, which must comply with the provisions of Section 2 of Article III) may be transacted at an annual meeting of stockholders as is either (a) specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors (or any duly authorized committee thereof), (b) otherwise properly brought before the annual meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors (or any duly authorized committee thereof) or (c) otherwise properly brought before the annual meeting by any stockholder of the Corporation (i) who is a stockholder of record on the date of the giving of the notice provided for in this Section 7 and on the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote at such annual meeting and (ii) who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 7.
In addition to any other applicable requirements, for business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder, such stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in proper written form to the Secretary of the Corporation.
To be timely, a stockholder's notice to the Secretary must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not less than ninety (90) days nor more than one-hundred twenty (120) days prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of stockholders (the Meeting Anniversary Date); provided, however, that in the event that the annual meeting is called for a date that is not within thirty (30) days before or after the Meeting Anniversary Date, notice by the stockholder in order to be timely must be so received not later than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which such notice of the date of the annual meeting was mailed or such public disclosure of the date of the annual meeting was made, whichever first occurs. In no event shall the adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting, or the public disclosure of such an
4
adjournment or postponement, commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described above.
To be in proper written form, a stockholder's notice to the Secretary must set forth the following information: (a) as to each matter such stockholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting, a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting, and (b) as to the stockholder giving notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is being made, (i) the name and address of such person, (ii) (A) the class or series and number of all shares of stock of the Corporation which are owned beneficially or of record by such person and any affiliates (as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) or associates (as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act) of such person, (B) the name of each nominee holder of shares of all stock of the Corporation owned beneficially but not of record by such person or any affiliates or associates of such person, and the number of such shares of stock of the Corporation held by each such nominee holder, (C) whether and the extent to which any derivative instrument, swap, option, warrant, short interest, hedge or profit interest or other transaction has been entered into by or on behalf of such person, or any affiliates or associates of such person, with respect to stock of the Corporation and (D) whether and the extent to which any other transaction, agreement, arrangement or understanding (including any short position or any borrowing or lending of shares of stock of the Corporation) has been made by or on behalf of such person, or any affiliates or associates of such person, the effect or intent of any of the foregoing being to mitigate loss to, or to manage risk or benefit of stock price changes for, such person, or any affiliates or associates of such person, or to increase or decrease the voting power or pecuniary or economic interest of such person, or any affiliates or associates of such person, with respect to stock of the Corporation, (iii) a description of all agreements, arrangements, or understandings (whether written or oral) between or among such person, or any affiliates or associates of such person, and any other person or persons (including their names) in connection with the proposal of such business and any material interest of such person or any affiliates or associates of such person, in such business, including any anticipated benefit therefrom to such person, or any affiliates or associates of such person, (iv) a representation that the stockholder giving notice intends to appear in person or by proxy at the annual meeting to bring such business before the meeting, and (v) any other information relating to such person that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filing required to be made in connection with the solicitation of proxies by such person with respect to the proposed business to be brought by such person before the annual meeting pursuant to Section 14 of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
A stockholder providing notice of business proposed to be brought before an annual meeting shall further update and supplement such notice, if necessary, so that the information provided or required to be provided in such notice pursuant to this Section 7 shall be true and correct as of the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to receive notice of the annual meeting and such update and supplement shall be delivered to or be mailed and received by the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than five (5) business days after the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to receive notice of the annual meeting.
        
5
No business shall be conducted at the annual meeting of stockholders except business brought before the annual meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 7; provided, however, that, once business has been properly brought before the annual meeting in accordance with such procedures, nothing in this Section 7 shall be deemed to preclude discussion by any stockholder of any such business. If the chairman of an annual meeting determines that business was not properly brought before the annual meeting in accordance with the foregoing procedures, the chairman shall declare to the meeting that the business was not properly brought before the meeting and such business shall not be transacted.
Nothing contained in this Section 7 shall be deemed to affect any rights of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the Corporation's proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act (or any successor provision of law).
Section 8
.
Record Date
. In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors and which record date: (1) in the case of determination of stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders or adjournment thereof, shall not be more than sixty nor less than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting; and (2) in the case of any other action, shall not be more than sixty (60) days prior to such other action. If no record date is fixed: (1) the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held; and (2) the record date for determining stockholders for any other purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting. Nothing in this Section 8 shall in any way be construed to change the procedure for setting the record date and for determining the effectiveness of stockholder action by written consent as set forth in Section 9 of this Article II.
Section 9
.
Written Consents
.
(a)    In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board of Directors may fix a record date (a Consent Record Date). The Consent Record Date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the Consent Record Date is adopted by the Board of Directors and shall not be more than ten (10) days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the Consent Record date is adopted by the Board of Directors. Any stockholder of record seeking to have the stockholders authorize or take corporate action by written consent shall, by written notice to the Secretary of the Corporation, request the Board of Directors to fix a Consent Record Date. To be valid, such written request shall set forth the purpose or purposes for which the
6
written consent is sought to be used, shall be signed by one or more stockholders of record (or their duly authorized proxies or other representatives) and shall bear the date of signature of each such stockholder (or proxy or other representative). The Board of Directors shall promptly, but in all events within ten (10) days after the date on which such a request is received, adopt a resolution fixing the Consent Record Date. If no Consent Record Date has been fixed by the Board of Directors within ten (10) days of the date on which such a request is received, the Consent Record Date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board of Directors is required by applicable law, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of business, or an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of stockholders meetings are recorded, to the attention of the Secretary of the Corporation. Delivery shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. If no Consent Record Date has been fixed by the Board of Directors and prior action by the Board of Directors is required by applicable law, the Consent Record Date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the date on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action.
(b)     Every written consent shall be signed by a person or persons who as of the Consent Record Date is a stockholder of record on the Consent Record Date, shall bear the date of signature of each such stockholder, shall set forth the name and address, as they appear in the Corporation's books, of each stockholder signing such consent and the class and number of shares of the Corporation which are owned of record and beneficially by each such stockholder, and shall be delivered to the Corporation in the manner specified in Section 9(a). No written consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless, within sixty (60) days of the date the earliest dated written consent was received in accordance with Section 9(a), a written consent or consents signed by a sufficient number of holders to take such action are delivered to the Corporation in the manner prescribed in Section 9(a).
(c)     In the event of the delivery, in the manner provided in Section 9(a), to the Corporation of the requisite written consent or consents to take corporate action and/or any related revocation or revocations, the Corporation shall engage independent inspectors of elections for the purpose of promptly performing a ministerial review of the validity of the consents and revocations. For the purpose of permitting the inspectors to perform such review, no action by written consent without a meeting shall be effective until such date as the independent inspectors certify to the Corporation that the consents represent at least the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to take the corporate action. Nothing contained in this paragraph (c) of Section 9 shall in any way be construed to suggest or imply that the Board of Directors or any stockholder shall not be entitled to contest the validity of any consent or revocation thereof, whether before or after certification by the independent inspectors, or to take any other action (including, without limitation, the commencement, prosecution or defense of any litigation with respect thereto, and the seeking of injunctive relief in such litigation).

Section 10
.
Conduct of Meetings
. The Board of Directors of the Corporation may adopt by resolution such rules and regulations for the conduct of the meeting of the stockholders as it shall deem appropriate. Except to the extent inconsistent with such rules and regulations as adopted by the Board of Directors, the chairman of any meeting of the stockholders shall have the right and authority to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and to do all such acts as, in the judgment of such chairman, are appropriate for the proper conduct of the meeting. Such rules, regulations or procedures, whether adopted by the Board of Directors or prescribed by the chairman of the meeting, may include, without limitation, the following: (i) the establishment of an agenda or order of business for the meeting; (ii) the determination of when the polls shall open and close for any given matter to be voted on at the meeting; (iii) rules and procedures for maintaining order at the meeting and the safety of those present; (iv) limitations on attendance at or participation in the meeting to stockholders of record of the Corporation, their duly authorized and constituted proxies or such other persons as the chairman of the meeting shall determine; (v) restrictions on entry to the meeting after the time fixed for the commencement thereof; and (vi) limitations on the time allotted to questions or comments by participants.
Section 11
.
Notices and Waivers
.
(a)    Whenever written notice is required by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws, to be given to any stockholder, such notice may be given by mail, addressed to such stockholder, at such stockholder's address as it appears on the records of the Corporation, with postage thereon prepaid, and such notice shall be deemed to be given at the time when the same shall be deposited in the United States mail. Written notice may also be given personally or by electronic transmission, facsimile or any other lawful method.
(b)    Whenever any notice is required by applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws, to be given to any stockholder, a waiver thereof in writing, signed by the person or persons entitled to notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent thereto. Attendance of a person at a meeting, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except where the person attends the meeting for the express purpose of objecting at the beginning of the meeting to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the stockholders need be specified in any written waiver of notice unless so required by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws.
Section 12
.
Inspectors of Election
. In advance of any meeting of stockholders, the Board by resolution or the Chairman of the Board of Directors shall appoint one or more inspectors of election to act at the meeting and make a written report thereof. One or more other persons may be designated as alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act. If no inspector or alternate is present, ready and willing to act at a meeting of stockholders, the chairman of the meeting shall appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting. Unless otherwise required by law, inspectors may be officers, employees or agents of the Corporation. Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of his or her duties, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her ability. The inspector shall have the duties prescribed by law and shall take charge
8
of the polls and, when the vote is completed, shall make a certificate of the result of the vote taken and of such other facts as may be required by law.
ARTICLE III
DIRECTORS
Section 1
.
Number and Election of Directors
. The Board of Directors shall consist of not more than 12 members, the exact number of which shall be determined from time to time by resolution adopted by the Board of Directors. Except as provided in Section 3 of this Article III, directors shall be elected by the stockholders at the annual meetings of stockholders (or special meetings called for the purpose of electing directors). Notwithstanding any provision in these By-Laws to the contrary, a nominee for director shall be elected to the Board of Directors if the votes cast for such nominee's election exceed the votes against such nominee's election; provided, however, that directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast at any meeting of stockholders for which the Secretary of the Corporation determines that the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected as of the date seven (7) days prior to the scheduled mailing date of the proxy statement for such meeting. Each director shall hold office for the term for which he or she is elected and qualified or until his or her successor shall have been elected and qualified or until his or her earlier resignation, removal from office or death. The Board of Directors may from time to time establish minimum qualifications for eligibility to become a director. Those qualifications may include, but shall not be limited to, a prerequisite stock ownership in the Corporation.
Section 2
.
Nomination of Directors
. Only persons who are nominated in accordance with the following procedures shall be eligible for election as directors of the Corporation, except as may be otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation with respect to the right of holders of preferred stock of the Corporation to nominate and elect a specified number of directors in certain circumstances. Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors may be made at any annual meeting of stockholders, or at any special meeting of stockholders called for the purpose of electing directors, (a) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors (or any duly authorized committee thereof) or (b) by any stockholder of the Corporation (i) who is a stockholder of record on the date of the giving of the notice provided for in this Section 2 and on the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at such annual meeting or special meeting and (ii) who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 2.
In addition to any other applicable requirements, for a nomination to be made by a stockholder, such stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in proper written form to the Secretary of the Corporation.
 
To be timely, a stockholder's notice to the Secretary must be delivered to or be mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the Corporation (a) in the case of an annual meeting, not less than ninety (90) days nor more than one-hundred twenty (120) days prior to the Meeting Anniversary Date; provided, however, that in the event that the annual meeting is called for a date that is not within thirty (30) days before or after the Meeting Anniversary Date, notice by the stockholder in order to be timely must be so received not later
9
than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which such notice of the date of the annual meeting was mailed or such public disclosure of the date of the annual meeting was made, whichever first occurs, and (b) in the case of a special meeting of stockholders called for the purpose of electing directors, not later than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which notice of the date of the special meeting was mailed or public disclosure of the date of the special meeting was made, whichever first occurs. In no event shall the adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting or a special meeting called for the purpose of electing directors, or the public disclosure of such an adjournment or postponement, commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described above.

The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that such person did not act in good faith and in a manner which such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful.
Section 2
.

18
Section 3
.
Authorization of Indemnification
. Any indemnification under this Article VII (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the present or former director or officer is proper in the circumstances because such person has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 1 or Section 2 of this Article VII, as the case may be. Such determination shall be made, with respect to a person who is a director or officer at the time of such determination, (i) by a majority vote of the directors who are not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, even though less than a quorum, or (ii) by a committee of such directors designated by a majority vote of such directors, even though less than a quorum, or (iii) if there are no such directors, or if such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (iv) by the stockholders. To the extent, however, that a present or former director or officer of the Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding described above, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such person shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith, without the necessity of authorization in the specific case.

For purposes of any determination under Section 3 of this Article VII, a person shall be deemed to have acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, or, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, to have had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful, if such person's action is based on the records or books of account of the Corporation or another enterprise, or on information supplied to such person by the officers of the Corporation or another enterprise in the course of their duties, or on the advice of legal counsel for the Corporation or another enterprise or on information or records given or reports made to the Corporation or another enterprise by an independent certified public accountant or by an appraiser or other expert selected with reasonable care by the Corporation or another enterprise. The term another enterprise as used in this Section 4 shall mean any other corporation or any partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise of which such person is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent.

The basis of such indemnification by a court shall be a determination by such court that indemnification of the director or officer is proper in the circumstances because such person has met the applicable standards of conduct set forth in Section 1 or 2 of this Article VII, as the case may be. Neither a contrary determination in the specific case under Section 3 of this Article VII nor the absence of any determination thereunder shall be a defense to such application or create a presumption that the director or officer seeking indemnification has not met any
19
applicable standard of conduct. Notice of any application for indemnification pursuant to this Section 5 shall be given to the Corporation promptly upon the filing of such application. If successful, in whole or in part, the director or officer seeking indemnification shall also be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such application.

Section 7
.
Nonexclusivity of Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses
. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by or granted pursuant to this Article VII shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under the Certificate of Incorporation or any By-Law, agreement, contract, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or pursuant to the direction (howsoever embodied) of any court of competent jurisdiction or otherwise, both as to action in such person's official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, it being the policy of the Corporation that indemnification of the persons specified in Section 1 and 2 of this Article VII shall be made to the fullest extent permitted by law. The provisions of this Article VII shall not be deemed to preclude the indemnification of any person who is not specified in Section 1 or 2 of this Article VII but whom the Corporation has the power or obligation to indemnify under the provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or otherwise.

Section 9
.
Certain Definitions
. For purposes of this Article VII, references to the Corporation shall include, in addition to the resulting corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors or officers, so that any person who is or was a director or officer of such constituent corporation, or is or was a director or officer of such constituent corporation serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Article VII with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as such person would have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate
20
existence had continued.

Exhibit 99.1
 
AutoNation Reports All-Time Record Quarterly EPS
from Continuing Operations
 
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla., (
April 25, 2012
)  AutoNation, Inc.
(NYSE: AN),
Americas largest automotive retailer, today reported
2012
first
quarter net income from continuing operations of
$74 million
, or
$0.56
per share, compared to net income from continuing operations of
$70 million
, or
$0.46
per share, for the same period in the prior year, a
22%
improvement on a per-share basis.
2012
first
quarter revenue totaled
$3.7 billion
, compared to
$3.3 billion
in the year-ago period, an increase of
10%
, driven primarily by stronger retail new vehicle unit sales. AutoNations new vehicle unit sales
increased
8%
on a same store basis and
10%
overall. According to CNW Research data, total U.S. industry retail new vehicle unit sales increased 7%.
2012
first
quarter gross profit totaled
$603 million
, compared to
$566 million
in the year-ago period, an increase of
6%
, primarily due to an increase in finance and insurance gross profit, as well as an increase in retail new vehicle gross profit. In the first quarter of 2011, gross profit was favorably impacted by $4.6 million, or $82 on a per new vehicle retailed basis, related to additional incentives on premium luxury vehicles previously sold.
Mike Jackson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, AutoNation delivered record EPS from continuing operations in the
first
quarter of
2012
, as we drove increased profitability in each of our business sectors.
Mr. Jackson added, The renaissance in auto retail is well underway, reflected in a seasonally adjusted U.S. industry annual selling rate of 14.5 million units for the
first
quarter of
2012
. The American consumer has more choices than ever with improved fuel efficiency, better technology, and accelerated product offerings. We have increased our 2012 U.S. industry new vehicle sales forecast to mid-14 million units, as we see continued momentum in U.S. auto sales.
During the
first
quarter of
2012
, AutoNation repurchased
11.7 million
shares of common stock, or 9% of the shares outstanding as of December 31, 2011, for an aggregate purchase price of
$405.4 million
, and, from April 1 through

, AutoNation repurchased
2.1 million
shares for an aggregate purchase price of

shares outstanding.

AutoNation to Acquire Six Stores in Texas Representing Approximately $575 Million
in Annual Revenue
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla., December 4, 2012 -
AutoNation, Inc. (NYSE: AN), America's largest automotive retailer, announced today that it has signed agreements to acquire Audi, Porsche and three Volkswagen stores in the Dallas, Texas market from Boardwalk Auto Group and Spring Chrysler Jeep Dodge Ram in the Houston, Texas market. The transactions are subject to customary terms and conditions, including manufacturer approval.
Together, the stores are expected to sell over 14,000 new and used retail units in 2012 with approximately $575 million of revenue. Upon completion of the transactions, AutoNation will own and operate 50 franchises in the state of Texas.
Boardwalk Audi, Porsche and Volkswagen Acquisition
Boardwalk Audi and Boardwalk Porsche are located in Plano, Texas. Boardwalk Audi, which received the prestigious 2011 Audi Magna Society Award, is in the top 20 in the United States for Audi new vehicle volume year-to-date. Boardwalk Porsche, which received the coveted Porsche Premier Dealership Award for 2012, is in the top ten in the United States for Porsche new vehicle volume year-to-date.
The Boardwalk Volkswagen stores include Park Cities Volkswagen on Lemmon Avenue in Dallas, Boardwalk Volkswagen in Richardson, and McKinney Volkswagen, which was opened in late 2009 as a new franchise in the growing McKinney market.
The Boardwalk Auto Group was founded by Scott K. Ginsburg, the principal owner of the business and a successful entrepreneur in the radio, digital media and automotive retail businesses.
Upon completion of the Boardwalk acquisition, AutoNation will own and operate 19 franchises in the Dallas-Fort Worth market. Mike Jackson, AutoNations Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, We will be pleased to add the Boardwalk Audi, Porsche and Volkswagen stores to our high-performing Dallas-Fort Worth platform. The franchises are in attractive automotive retail locations, and the acquisition will enhance our brand mix in the Dallas-Fort Worth market. The product cycles from Audi, Porsche and Volkswagen are some of the most exciting in the industry. We also look forward to welcoming the Boardwalk customers and 350 associates into the AutoNation family and expanding our representation of the Audi, Porsche and Volkswagen brands.
Mr. Ginsburg stated,
I am extremely pleased to put this transaction together with AutoNation, the largest automotive retailer in the United States. It was important for me to secure the future of these automotive dealerships -- Porsche, Audi and Volkswagen -- and I am also excited for our associates, who have been a key part of our success in building a premier automotive retail business in the Dallas market, as they will have outstanding career opportunities with AutoNation going forward. The stores will continue to be led by Ken Ambrose who will be joining AutoNation's operations. At the conclusion of this transaction, Boardwalk Auto Group will continue to own and operate Boardwalk Ferrari, Boardwalk Maserati, Lamborghini of Dallas, Ferrari of San Francisco and Maserati of San Francisco.
Spring Chrysler Jeep Dodge Ram Acquisition
Spring Chrysler Jeep Dodge Ram (Spring CJDR) is located in Houston, Texas. Spring CJDR is the highest new vehicle volume Chrysler Jeep Dodge Ram dealer in the Texas market and is number four in the United States. Spring CJDR is currently owned by Alfred Flores and Bruce Glascock, both formerly with the McCombs Auto Group. Upon completion of the Spring CJDR acquisition, AutoNation will own and operate 17 franchises in the Houston, Texas market.
Mr. Jackson stated, Spring CJDR will be an excellent addition to our brand mix in the Houston market, another high- performing market for AutoNation. This will enable us to serve a broader customer base in Houston and will expand AutoNation's representation of Chrysler products. We look forward to welcoming the Spring customers and approximately 160 associates into the AutoNation family.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
As previously announced on a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) on January 29, 2009 (the January 2009 8-K) by AutoNation, Inc. (the Company), the Board of Directors of the Company approved a letter agreement with Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. (Toyota, and such agreement, as extended and amended, the Toyota Agreement) in order to, among other things, eliminate any potential adverse consequences under Toyota's framework agreement with the Company in the event that ESL Investments, Inc. and certain investment affiliates of ESL Investments, Inc. (together, ESL) acquired more than fifty percent (50%) of the Company's common stock. The Toyota Agreement also contains governance-related and other provisions as described in the January 2009 8-K. Based on a Schedule 13D/A filed by ESL with the SEC on November 28, 2012, ESL beneficially owns approximately forty-four percent (44%) of the Company's common stock.
Under the Toyota Agreement, Toyota's consent (the Consent) to ESL acquiring more than fifty percent (50%) of the Company's common stock would have terminated on December 31, 2012, solely with respect to ESL purchases of the Company's common stock after such date, unless it was extended by Toyota.
At ESL's request, Toyota has granted a one-year extension of its Consent under the Toyota Agreement (such extension, the "Fourth Extension Agreement"), and the Company signed an acknowledgment to the Fourth Extension Agreement, which is dated December 12, 2012. Toyota's Consent under the Toyota Agreement will now terminate on December 31, 2013 (unless it is terminated earlier as provided in the Toyota Agreement) with respect to purchases of the Company's common stock by ESL after such date, provided that ESL may continue to seek successive annual one-year extensions of Toyota's Consent and Toyota may not unreasonably withhold or delay its consent thereto, except that if ESL has owned fifty percent (50%) or less of the Company's outstanding common stock for two years preceding the date that ESL seeks an extension, then Toyota may withhold such consent in its sole discretion.
The foregoing summaries of the Toyota Agreement and the Fourth Extension Agreement are qualified in their entirety by reference to such agreements. The Toyota Agreement, together with all amendments thereto, including the Fourth Extension Agreement, are filed as exhibits hereto, and each is incorporated herein by reference.

Since my arrival we have laid a foundation for this transition by investing more than $3.7 billion in facilities, developing best practices in our stores and Shared Service Center and completing strategic acquisitions across the country while focusing on the customer as our number one priority.
Commenting on the quarterly results, Mr. Jackson said, We are very pleased with our strong year-over-year growth across all areas of our business. We have delivered two consecutive years of over 30% growth in earnings per share, and this quarter we set another record for the highest ever annual and quarterly adjusted EPS from continuing operations. Mr. Jackson added, We are looking forward to a robust new vehicle selling environment in 2013, as consumers enjoy an unprecedented array of attractive product options and continued access to affordable credit.

The annual Board retainer and any additional committee retainers will be pro-rated based on the number of months served during the year and will be paid in cash. Mr. Mikan will also be entitled to receive expense reimbursement in connection with meeting attendance.
In accordance with the terms of the Companys 2007 Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan, as amended (the Plan), Mr. Mikan will receive an automatic quarterly grant of an option to purchase 5,000 shares of the Companys common stock on the first trading day of each March, June, September, and December while he is serving on the Board. Options granted under the Plan will vest in 25% annual increments on each of the first four anniversaries of June 1 of the calendar year in which the options are granted, or immediately upon termination of Board membership. The options will have an exercise price equal to the closing price per share of the Companys common stock on the applicable grant date.

Item 1.02 Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement.
As previously announced on a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) on January 29, 2009 (the January 2009 8-K) by AutoNation, Inc. (the Company), the Board of Directors of the Company approved a letter agreement with Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. (Toyota, and such agreement, as amended and extended to date, the Toyota Agreement) in order to, among other things, eliminate any potential adverse consequences under Toyotas framework agreement with the Company in the event that ESL Investments, Inc. and certain investment affiliates of ESL Investments, Inc. (together, ESL) acquired more than 50% of the Companys common stock. The Toyota Agreement also contains governance-related and other provisions as described in the January 2009 8-K.
Under the terms of the Toyota Agreement, the Toyota Agreement and Toyotas consent to ESL acquiring more than 50% of the Companys outstanding common stock automatically terminate in the event that ESL no longer owns in excess of 40% of the Companys outstanding common stock. Based on a Schedule 13D/A and a Form 4 filed by ESL with the SEC on June 12, 2013, ESLs beneficial ownership percentage of the Companys outstanding common stock decreased from approximately 41% to approximately 32% on June 10, 2013, and, therefore, the Toyota Agreement and Toyotas consent thereunder terminated on June 10, 2013.
The foregoing summary of the Toyota Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to such agreement. The Toyota Agreement, as well as all amendments thereto, are filed as exhibits hereto, and each is incorporated herein by reference.
