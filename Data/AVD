EXHIBIT 99.5
NEWPORT BEACH, CA, June 11, 2002  AMVAC Chemical Corporation (AMVAC), a wholly-owned subsidiary of American Vanguard Corporation (AMEX: AVD), announced today that it has acquired the Folex cotton defoliant business conducted in the United States by Aventis CropScience USA prior to Bayer AG's acquisition of Aventis CropScience S.A.
AMVAC has acquired the U.S. EPA end-use product registration for Folex as well as the Folex trademark and product inventories. In addition, an existing supply agreement with Bayer Corporation providing for the supply of active ingredient and access to data in support of the end-use product registration has been assigned to AMVAC, allowing AMVAC to purchase the active ingredient in Folex from Bayer. Bayer markets a product under its trademark Def, which is similar to Folex, and will continue to sell Def following its acquisition of Aventis.
Folex (active ingredient: tribufos), used alone or in combination with other cotton defoliants, affords excellent defoliation of cotton; a process of removing the leaves from cotton plants prior to harvest. Defoliation is important to high crop yields and cotton quality as the leaves of a cotton plant, if not removed, can stain the white cotton fibers during the harvest process. AMVAC will begin selling Folex throughout the U.S. cotton-belt during the third quarter of 2002, and for the first time ever, in a closed-delivery system.
Glen Johnson, Senior Vice President of AMVAC, stated, "Folex rounds out our cotton product portfolio. We sell products to the American cotton farmer that can be used prior to planting, at planting, during the growing season and now, with Folex, at harvest. We are looking forward to marketing this important cotton product later this season and are pleased to see that our business strategy of growth through the acquisition of niche products continues to be rewarding for AMVAC and its customer base."
AMVAC is a manufacturer and marketer of crop protection and specialty products, whose corporate strategy focuses on acquiring branded product lines from multi-national agricultural product companies. Its products include: Fortress, Vapam, K-Pam, Bidrin, Dacthal, PCNB, Dibrom, Durham metaldehyde granules, Amid-Thin, Citrus Fix, K-Salt, Fruitone, Tre-Hold and the azadirachtin products: Ecozin, Amazin and Ornazin. American Vanguard's basic strategy is to acquire brand name, niche product lines from multi-national companies that divest mature products to focus on newly discovered molecules. In 2001, American Vanguard was named to Forbes' America's 2. To learn more about American Vanguard, please reference the Company's web site at www.american-vanguard.com.

EXHIBIT 99.6
NEWPORT BEACH, CA, July 23, 2002  AMVAC Chemical Corporation (AMVAC), a wholly-owned subsidiary of American Vanguard Corporation (AMEX: AVD), announced today that it has acquired from Syngenta Crop Protection, Inc., certain assets associated with the Ambush 25WP (wettable powder formulation) insecticide business in the United States.
AMVAC has acquired all U.S. EPA end-use product registrations and data in support of such registrations as well as a license to the Ambush trademark (chemical name: permethrin) in the United States. Syngenta will continue to own the rights and assets of the liquid formulation (Ambush 2EC) in the United States.
Ambush 25WP is a synthetic pyrethroid insecticide developed from the naturally occurring insecticide pyrethrum that is found in chrysanthemum flowers. Synthetic pyrethroids have been sold in the United States since the late 1970's and are used to control a broad spectrum of insect pests in a wide range of crops. Ambush 25WP has one of the broadest lists of crops on its label. AMVAC will market the product nationwide primarily in high value vegetable, tree and fruit crops. The Company will begin selling Ambush 25WP in time for the 2002 fall vegetable planting season.
Glen Johnson, Senior Vice President of AMVAC, stated, "Ambush 25WP signals our first entry into pyrethroid chemistry, thus allowing us to offer our customers another class of insecticides. As previously reported, American Vanguard acquired a chemical manufacturing facility from DuPont in 2001 that was designed to manufacture and formulate both organophosphate and pyrethroid insecticides. Ambush 25WP is a perfect fit and an excellent addition to our portfolio of products that we currently sell into the vegetable and fruit markets."
Rob Neill, Vice President of Marketing for Syngenta Crop Protection, Inc., added, "As we bring newer products to market, we are pleased that growers will continue to have access to Ambush. We recognize the value these products have brought to American farmers who grow specialty crops and that they would lose these important tools if they were simply removed from the marketplace."
AMVAC is a manufacturer and marketer of crop protection and specialty products, whose products include: Fortress, Vapam, K-Pam, Bidrin, Dacthal, PCNB, Dibrom, Durham metaldehyde granules, Amid-Thin W, Citrus Fix, K-Salt Fruit Fix, Fruitone N, Tre-Hold and the azadirachtin products: Ecozin, Amazin and Ornazin.

     On July 29, 2002, American Vanguard Corporation issued the press release attached hereto as Exhibit 99.7.

EXHIBIT 99.7
NEWPORT BEACH, CA, July 29, 2002  AMVAC Chemical Corporation (AMVAC), a wholly-owned subsidiary of American Vanguard Corporation (AMEX: AVD), announced today that it acquired from Flowserve US Inc. all of its assets associated with the SmartBox closed delivery system. The assets include all inventories, tooling, molds, patents and other intellectual property. The terms of the transaction were not disclosed.
SmartBox is the only EPA approved closed delivery system for dispensing granular products. The SmartBox system electronically dispenses granular crop protection products, replacing older technology that utilizes mechanically driven sprockets and chains. The state-of-the-art SmartBox technology allows farmers to apply crop protection products accurately and efficiently while avoiding contact with the product. The computer controller enables farmers to monitor and change application rates while planting and provides the farmer with a permanent record of his application.
AMVAC assumed a position in the SmartBox partnership in 2000 when it acquired the Fortress corn soil insecticide business from DuPont. That same year, AMVAC sold its Fortress 5G (5% active ingredient  chlorethoxyfos) corn soil insecticide to the American farmer in the SmartBox system. Later that year, AMVAC secured exclusive marketing rights in the U.S. to Bayer CropScience's Aztec 4.67G corn soil insecticide. By offering both products, AMVAC provides farmers a choice of two different chemistries to apply through the SmartBox system. This allows farmers to rotate products from year to year, thereby preventing insects from building resistance to any one specific product. AMVAC is currently looking at utilizing this system for other crops where the safety features of the system would provide an important benefit.
Overwhelming demand for SmartBox led to a sell out of all available systems in the spring of 2002, but AMVAC will have a new supply of equipment in time for the 2003 planting season.
AMVAC has contracted Redball, LLC to implement improvements to the SmartBox system and manufacture the SmartBox equipment. Founded in 1984, Benson, MN-based Redball develops and manufactures an innovative line of cost-effective and farmer-friendly sprayers for cotton, corn, soybean and fruit and nut growers throughout the U.S., South America, Australia and other parts of the world. Additionally, Redball has experience in developing products for multi-national AgChem companies, including specialized liquid application equipment.
Glen Johnson, Senior Vice President of AMVAC, stated, "We are looking forward to expanding the use of the SmartBox technology into new cropping practices. Interest from corn farmers in acquiring SmartBox systems exceeded our expectations this year, and those farmers that currently use SmartBox like its ease of application, accuracy and closed handling features. We are also pleased to be working with Redball, an industry leader committed to quality, safety and innovation."
 
AMVAC is a manufacturer and marketer of crop protection and specialty products, whose products include: Fortress, Vapam, K-Pam, Bidrin, Blocker, Dacthal, PCNB, Dibrom, Durham metaldehyde granules, Amid-Thin W, Citrus Fix, K-Salt, Fruit Fix, Fruitone N, Tre-Hold and the azadirachtin products: Ecozin, Amazin and Ornazin.

EXHIBIT 99.8
Newport Beach, CA  February 3, 2003  American Vanguard Corp. (AMEX:AVD) today announced that AMVAC Chemical Corporation (AMVAC), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, has signed a definitive agreement to acquire the global Pre-Harvest Crop Protection business from Pace International, LLC. The terms were not disclosed.
Pace's global Pre-Harvest Crop Protection business, which historically achieved annual sales in the $4-5 million range, encompasses five product lines:
Pace will continue to manufacture Deadline and Hinder under a multi-year supply agreement with AMVAC. Additionally, AMVAC has an option to acquire Pace's Deadline manufacturing facility located in King County, Washington. The Company expects to begin marketing the products, which are primarily sold to customers in the United States, this month.
Eric Wintemute, President and CEO of American Vanguard, stated, "We are extremely pleased to report this acquisition, which comes on the heels of last week's acquisition of Evital 5G from Syngenta. We are enthusiastic about the products we have acquired through the Pace transaction, and are especially pleased that we can now offer our customers the top performing snail and slug control products in the market. Our strategy of growth through niche product acquisitions should continue to be rewarding for the Company and our customers."
George Lobisser, President and CEO of Pace International, commented, "Since taking over the CEO position at Pace in early 2001, my goal has been to focus the Company on its strength, which is its leadership position in post-harvest. This divestiture, coupled with our prior Leffingwell marketing agreement with Phosyn, plc, allows Pace to focus 100% of its sales, marketing, and R&D efforts on post-harvest, while at the same time utilize our extensive manufacturing facilities to continue producing micro nutrients and crop protection products."

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
Newport Beach, CA  August 12, 2003  American Vanguard Corp. (AMEX:AVD) today announced record financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2003.
 
 versus fiscal 2002 second quarter
Second Quarter Financial Highlights
Net sales rose 27% to $25.9 million.
Operating income increased 31% to $2.4 million.
Net income was up 53% to $1.7 million or $.28 per diluted share.
 
 versus the first six months of 2002
Six-month Financial Highlights
Net sales increased 35% to $53.3 million.
Operating income was up 35% to $4.5 million.
Net income rose 53% to $2.9 million or $.48 per diluted share.
 
Eric Wintemute, President and CEO of American Vanguard, stated, "We are pleased to announce our 17
th
consecutive quarter of comparable growth. We saw continued strength throughout our product portfolio during the quarter, with especially strong sales from our corn soil insecticides sold in our state-of-the-art SmartBox delivery system, as well as our mosquito control products, home pest control products, and Dacthal, our vegetable herbicide. Another key driver of our results for the quarter was the product line we acquired from Pace International in the beginning of this year. Our immediate success with this complementary line of products demonstrates the effectiveness of our growth strategy."
 
Mr. Wintemute continued, "Recently, we began manufacturing a new active ingredient, Bifenthrin, at our Alabama facility. We obtained from U.S. EPA a registration to market the technical form of this pyrethroid insecticide in June, and have applied for and expect to obtain U.S. end use registrations to market the formulated product in the next 612 months. The current worldwide market for Bifenthrin is estimated at approximately $150 million. While it is too early to predict the magnitude of potential sales by American Vanguard, we feel confident that the production of Bifenthrin is an excellent fit with the capabilities of our Alabama plant."
 
Mr. Wintemute concluded, "We are pleased with the growth we realized in the first half of the year and remain optimistic about the balance of the year. We continue to pursue long-term growth by acquiring and licensing brand name niche product lines from multi-billion dollar companies. Our proven track record and distinct characteristics in manufacturing, registration and marketing bode well for our ability to capitalize further on consolidation in the industry. We expect to meet our previously stated goals of double-digit sales and net income growth for fiscal 2003, and look forward to updating you with our progress."
 
American Vanguard was recently recognized as one of 's (#94) and ' (#35).

[LOGO OF AMERICAN VANGUARD CORPORATION]
 
 
 
Newport Beach, CA  November 20, 2003  American Vanguard Corp. (AMEX:AVD) today announced that AMVAC Chemical Corporation (AMVAC), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, has signed a definitive agreement to acquire certain assets related to the active ingredient dichlorvos ("DDVP") used in the animal health business and marketed primarily under the trade name Nuvan from Novartis Animal Health, Inc., a business unit of Novartis AG (NYSE:NVS). The terms of the transaction, which is expected to close by the end of the year, were not disclosed.
 
The business sells product in over 30 countries, excluding the U.S. Amvac will continue to market Nuvan through the existing customer base established by Novartis. Nuvan is used primarily for animal health to control flies and ecto-parasites. Since 1975, AMVAC has manufactured a technical form of DDVP, used primarily in specialty markets as a broad-spectrum household and specialty insecticide. DDVP products are highly effective in controlling, in enclosed spaces, a wide variety of pests, including mosquitoes, flies, and cockroaches. These pests cause serious disease in humans and animals, and pose a threat to food supplies, such as stored grain, milk, and packaged and bagged food. The importance of DDVP products to the public is increasing with the recent emergence and reemergence of infectious diseases that are vector-borne, such as West Nile Virus, dengue fever, and malaria, among many others. AMVAC has been the primary generator of data to support the registration of DDVP products worldwide, as well as the primary data holder for DDVP since 1975.
 
The Company expects to begin selling the acquired products in the first quarter of 2004.
 
Eric Wintemute, President and CEO of American Vanguard, stated, "Since we currently sell DDVP for specialty use, this product is an excellent fit with our current portfolio. Nuvan expands both our animal health segment as well as our international sales of DDVP. We expect to generate approximately $5 million in sales of Nuvan in the first year, and anticipate building upon that figure as we develop customer relationships. This acquisition is our third transaction of 2003, and reflects our continued focus on acquiring niche product lines from larger companies in our industry."

On, January 22, 2004, American Vanguard issued a press release attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1. The release announced that AMVAC Chemical Corporation ("AMVAC"), a wholly owned subsidiary of American Vanguard Corporation, entered into an agreement with Syngenta Crop Protection to supply Force 3G corn soil insecticide for use through AMVAC's Smartbox system beginning in the 2004 season. More particularly described in Exhibit 99.1.

EXHIBIT 99.1
 
 
 
 
NEWPORT BEACH, CA  January 22, 2004  American Vanguard Corporation (AMEX:AVD) today announced that its subsidiary, AMVAC Chemical Corporation, entered into an agreement with Syngenta Crop Protection to supply Force 3G corn soil insecticide for use through AMVAC's SmartBox system beginning in the 2004 season.
 
AMVAC's SmartBox is a closed handling system that combines precision insecticide application with reduced applicator exposure. Its 50-lb. returnable containers eliminate the need to open, pour and dispose of bags, which reduces the risk of skin contact and inhalation. It features in-cab push-button insecticide control, monitoring and data record keeping capabilities. The SmartBox is a low-maintenance system that can be easily fitted on all major brands of planters.
 
Force 3G is a leading corn soil insecticide manufactured and marketed by Syngenta for the control of corn rootworm, wireworm, cutworm and white grub in corn.
 
"The availability of Force insecticide through SmartBox is great news for corn growers who want a high level of corn soil insect control," stated Ted Ramirez, director of marketing for AMVAC. "Corn growers continue to see the value the SmartBox technology offers and now have the choice of using Force and our other corn soil insecticides through the SmartBox system. Since we acquired SmartBox from Dupont in 2000, we have enjoyed increasing grower acceptance and utilization. This endorsement from Syngenta further supports our goal to position SmartBox as the delivery system of choice for granular insecticides."
 
Pat Steiner, Syngenta Force brand manager, commented, "Force and the SmartBox system are a great fit. The timing is perfect for combining the premium performance of Force with the superior SmartBox technology. With Force and the SmartBox, we are offering proven performance at a time when growers are facing tremendous pressure on yields from corn insects."

 versus 2002
2003 Financial Highlights
 
 
 
 
Eric Wintemute, President and CEO of American Vanguard, stated, "2003 was another record year for American Vanguard and a milestone in terms of surpassing $10 million in net income. The key component to our solid financial results for the fourth quarter was our corn soil insecticides, which we sell in our state-of-the-art SmartBox delivery system. We are more optimistic than ever about this area of our business, and in this regard, in January we entered into an agreement with Syngenta to supply their corn soil insecticide, Force 3G, for use in our SmartBox system beginning in the 2004 season."
 
Mr. Wintemute continued, "Additionally, in late 2003, we acquired certain assets related to an active ingredient from a business unit of Novartis. The product, used primarily for animal health, is an excellent fit with our existing portfolio. More recently, we obtained U.S. end use registrations for the pyrethroid insecticide Bifenthrin and commenced sales in the first quarter."
 
James Barry, Senior Vice President and CFO of American Vanguard, commented, "The strong performance of our corn soil insecticides was the primary reason for our higher gross margin  53.6% in the fourth quarter compared to 47.3% in the same quarter last year. The corn soil insecticides also generate greater operating expenses, which caused our operating expenses to increase as a percentage of sales. Nonetheless, our operating margin was 19.1%, up from 17.9% in the fourth quarter of last year. For the year as a whole, gross margin was 47.2%, up from 43.6% in 2002, and operating margin was 13.2%, up from 11.8% last year."
 
 
March 11, 2004
 
Mr. Wintemute concluded, "Looking back over the past five years, sales and net income have grown at an average of annual rate of 14% and 37%, respectively. We are optimistic that this long-term growth trend will continue, based on the strength of our ever-expanding product line, our track record of successful acquisitions and distinct characteristics in manufacturing, registration and marketing. Regarding 2004, we feel confident that we will achieve double-digit sales and net income growth, but we are not comfortable making more specific financial projections since we are subject to unpredictable factors including pest pressure and weather conditions. In addition to internal growth, we continue to seek additional product acquisitions and licensing opportunities and look forward to updating you on our progress."
 
Conference Call
 
Eric G. Wintemute, President & CEO, and James A. Barry, Senior Vice President & CFO, will conduct a conference call focusing on the financial results at 11:30 a.m. ET on Thursday, March 11, 2004.

First Quarter Financial Highlights
 
 
 
 
Eric Wintemute, President and CEO of American Vanguard, stated, "We are extremely pleased with the results for the quarter and are delighted to start the year with another record period. Sales were essentially strong throughout our product portfolio, led by significantly higher sales from corn soil insecticides sold in our state-of-the-art SmartBox delivery system. Due in part to the wide acceptance of SmartBox, we continue to gain market share in corn soil insecticides. Additionally, first quarter results reflect initial sales from our generic entrance into the pyrethroid Bifenthrin. This is a widely used insecticide with a market in excess of $100 million, and we are optimistic about its prospects."
 
James Barry, Senior Vice President and CFO of American Vanguard, commented, "With regard to our balance sheet, we closed the quarter with $46.1 million in working capital, total debt of $43.0 million (including current installments), and shareholders' equity of $51.8 million. We believe our financial position serves as a solid foundation to support our future growth."
 
Mr. Wintemute concluded, "Based on the continued strong performance of our existing product lines, our active pursuit of acquisition and licensing opportunities, and our available manufacturing capacity, we are enthusiastic about American Vanguard's short and long-term outlook. We are confident that we will achieve our previously announced goal of double-digit sales and net income growth in 2004, and look forward to updating you with our progress."

This credit facility consists of a $45 million revolving line of credit and a $35 million term loan. These loans bear interest at the prime rate or at an adjusted LIBOR rate plus certain margins and commitment fees (in each case dependent on our consolidated funded debt ratio). The principal payments of the term loan are payable in equal quarterly installments on or before the last business day of each February, May, August and November, commencing November 30, 2004 and in one final installment in the amount necessary to repay the remaining outstanding principal balance of the term loan in full on the maturity date. The principal payments on the revolving loan must be repaid no later than October 7, 2009. Interest accruing on prime rate loans are payable quarterly, in arrears, on the last day of each March, June, September and December, and on the maturity date of such loan in the amount of interest then accrued but unpaid. Interest accruing on the LIBOR loans are payable on the last day of the interest period, provided that, with an interest period longer than three months, interest is payable on the last day of each three-month period after the commencement of such interest period.

Newport Beach, CA  December 6, 2004  American Vanguard Corporation (AMEX: AVD), today announced that AMVAC Chemical Corporation (AMVAC), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into an exclusive agreement with Bayer CropScience LP, an affiliate of Bayer AG (NYSE:BAY) to market, sell and distribute Bolster 15G SmartBox, a soybean pesticide used to control nematodes, through AMVAC's SmartBox system in key Midwest soybean growing states beginning in the 2005 season.
 
AMVAC's SmartBox is a closed handling system that combines precision insecticide application with no applicator exposure. Its 50-lb. returnable containers eliminate the need to open, pour and dispose of bags, which reduces the risk of skin contact and inhalation. It features in-cab push-button insecticide control, monitoring and data record keeping capabilities. The SmartBox is a low-maintenance system that can be easily fitted on all major brands of planters.
 
Aldicarb, the active ingredient in Bolster, is manufactured and marketed by Bayer CropScience in over 40 crops worldwide, while Bolster is registered exclusively for use in key Midwestern states on soybeans for the control of nematodes.
 
Bill Jacobs, the new Regional Sales Manager for the Mid-West Region of AMVAC, stated, "There are approximately 70 million acres of soybean in the U.S., a significant portion of which are challenged by substantial nematode pressure. Bolster can be an important tool for soybean growers, and we believe its availability through SmartBox will make it even more attractive. SmartBox will enable soybean farmers to apply Bolster with zero exposure, and the precise computer controller will permit the treatment of hot spots' as opposed to treating whole fields, thus reducing the cost commitment."
 
Chris Kleyla, aldicarb product manager of Bayer CropScience, added, "We are very pleased that Bolster will be available in the state-of-the-art SmartBox system, and believe the two technologies make a perfect fit to combat a mounting problem. Soybean growers are facing increasing pressure on yields due to nematodes. The combination of the premium performance of Bolster with the technology of the SmartBox system offers growers precision treatment and control with variable-rate application capability."

On March 3, 2005, American Vanguard Corporation issued a press release announcing its financial results for the period ended December 31, 2004. The full text of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
The information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including the Exhibit attached hereto, is being furnished under Item 2.02 and shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.

Newport Beach, CA  March 3, 2005  American Vanguard Corporation (AMEX:AVD), today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2004.
 
 versus fiscal 2003 fourth quarter
Fourth Quarter Financial Highlights
 
 
 
 
 
 versus 2003
2004 Financial Highlights
 
 
 
 
 
Eric Wintemute, President and CEO of American Vanguard, stated, "The fourth quarter signified our 23
rd
consecutive period of comparable growth and closed another strong year for the Company. Our expanding, niche product line and talented sales force delivered solid top-line growth in both periods, and our effective operating structure enabled profits to increase at a much faster rate. I am also proud to note that our net margin was 13% for the quarter and 10% for the year as a whole."
 
Mr. Wintemute continued, "During 2004, we recorded sales from three new additions to our product portfolio. Nuvan, which we acquired from Novartis at the end of 2003, generated its first sales for the Company during the year. More recently, we leveraged this acquisition by licensing Syngenta to sell products under the Nuvan trade name in the animal health, public health and crop protection markets in India. Also during 2004, we recorded our first sales of Force 3G, the corn soil insecticide we licensed from Syngenta in early 2004. Force represents the third product to be sold in our SmartBox delivery system, which is playing an important role in the Company's growth as farmer acceptance of this state-of-the-art technology continues to spread. Additionally, we made a generic market entrance during the year and began selling Bifenthrin, a widely used pyrethroid insecticide. While generic activity is not a core component of our growth strategy, this product is a good fit with our strengths, particularly our manufacturing capabilities at our Axis, AL facility, as well as our sales reach.
 
"In the fourth quarter, we experienced further growth in our corn soil insecticides, despite the comparison to a very strong 2003 fourth quarter for these products. We see this as an indication of the value of our SmartBox, as well as the opportunities in the corn market. We also enjoyed attractive sales increases from our mosquito adulticide, our pest strips, and the new products previously mentioned."
 
 
James Barry, Senior Vice President and CFO of American Vanguard, commented, "As recently announced, we filed a $50 million shelf registration statement. While we have funds available under our $80 million credit facility, given the current market environment, we believe it is beneficial to have the flexibility to consider various capital-raising alternatives if and when an attractive business expansion opportunity presents itself."
 
Mr. Wintemute concluded, "With regard to our expectations for 2005, we feel confident that the Company will achieve double-digit growth in sales and net income. As we have stated in the past, we are not comfortable making more specific financial projections since our results are subject to unpredictable factors including pest pressure and weather conditions."

Eric Wintemute, President and CEO, and James Barry, Senior Vice President and CFO, will conduct a conference call focusing on the financial results at 12:00 noon ET on Thursday, March 3, 2005.

Newport Beach, CA  March 22, 2005  American Vanguard Corporation (AMEX: AVD), today announced that its subsidiary, AMVAC Chemical Corporation, entered into an exclusive multi-year agreement with BASF Aktiengesellschaft (NYSE: BF) to develop, register and commercialize Topramezone, a new herbicide for post-emergent use in corn in North America.
 
BASF submitted the registration data package for the product to the US and Canadian registration authorities in 2003 and the approvals are expected in 2005, although there can be no assurances. Assuming the registrations are approved along that timeline AMVAC plans to enter the market in time for the Spring 2006 season.

We have had great success selling the corn soil insecticides Aztec 4.67G and Fortress as well as Syngenta's Force 3G, licensed in early 2004. This agreement with BASF will enable us to offer another key tool to the corn farmer."
 
Ted Bonertz, Global Herbicides Marketing Director for BASF Corporation, added, "We chose AMVAC as our partner in developing this new product in North America because of the company's expertise in development and formulation, as well as its achievements with previously licensed products. We believe AMVAC will represent our innovative product well, and we look forward to a mutually beneficial relationship."

First Quarter Financial Highlights
 
 
 
 
Eric Wintemute, President and CEO of American Vanguard, stated, "We are pleased to start the year with another record period, this now marking our 24
th
consecutive quarter of comparable period top and bottom-line growth. We saw continued strength throughout our product line during the quarter, with particular contribution from products acquired or licensed in 2003 and 2004, as well as our 2004 generic market entrance into bifenthrin. Importantly, our lean operating structure enabled us to expand profits at more than twice the rate of our sales."
 
Mr. Wintemute continued, "Toward the end of the quarter, we introduced a new facet to our growth strategy  our first new active ingredient. We entered into an exclusive multi-year agreement with BASF to develop, register and commercialize Topramezone, a new herbicide for post-emergent use in corn in North America. We have had considerable success selling corn soil insecticides to date, and this agreement will allow us to offer a new key tool to the corn farmer."
 
James Barry, Senior Vice President and CFO of American Vanguard, commented, "With regard to our balance sheet, we closed the quarter with $43.0 million in working capital, total debt of $31.5 million (including current installments), and shareholders' equity of $66.2 million. We believe our financial position serves as a solid foundation to support our future growth."
 
Mr. Wintemute concluded, "We continue to feel confident that the Company will achieve double-digit growth in sales and net income in 2005, and are also optimistic about the current market environment for product acquisition and licensing opportunities. We look forward to reporting on the Company's continued development."

In October 2004, AMVAC Chemical Corporation ("AMVAC"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of American Vanguard Corporation, entered into a written Data Compensation Agreement with FMC Corporation ("FMC") pursuant to which AMVAC paid FMC for the right to proceed with its bifenthrin products based upon FMC's original bifenthrin EPA registrations. During the negotiations leading up to the signed Agreement, FMC was provided with complete copies of the labels that AMVAC intended to and is now using with its sales of bifenthrin products.
 
Subsequent to accepting payment from AMVAC under the Agreement, FMC filed copyright registrations for its bifenthrin labels and began making claims in the bifenthrin industry that all competitors (including AMVAC) are precluded from using its copyrighted labels. FMC's position has caused uncertainty in the bifenthrin market.
 
In order to protect its rights under the Agreement and eliminate uncertainty in the market regarding AMVAC's legitimate right to manufacture and sell its bifenthrin products, WISDOM TC and DISCIPLINE 2EC with its existing labels, AMVAC filed a civil action in the United States District Court for the Central District of California (Southern Division) against FMC titled [Case No. SACV 05-511 AHS (ANx)]. The civil action seeks, among other things, a declaratory judgment that AMVAC is authorized to sell its bifenthrin products with its existing labels. FMC later filed a civil action for copyright infringement in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania against AMVAC titled (Civil Action No. 05 cv 2593).

On August 23, 2005, American Vanguard Corporation issued a press release announcing that its wholly-owned subsidiary, AMVAC Chemical Corporation, received a registration from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") for Impact. The full text of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
Date: August 23, 2005
 
 
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
Newport Beach, CA  August 23, 2005  American Vanguard Corporation (AMEX:AVD) today announced that its subsidiary, AMVAC Chemical Corporation, received a registration from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for Impact, a new herbicide, for use in field corn, seed corn, sweet corn and popcorn. AMVAC expects to initiate sales of the herbicide to U.S. corn growers beginning in the spring of 2006.
 
AMVAC also anticipates receiving approval for use in Canada in time for the 2006 season.
 
The planted corn acres in the United States exceeded 81 million acres in 2004, with total crop protection input expenditures of more than $1.6 billion. It is estimated that on average, each acre of corn receives 1.4 treatments of herbicides for weed control. Impact will partake in the growing post emergent herbicide corn weed control segment whose value is increasing because of a changing weed spectrum. Comparable products to Impact were launched beginning in 2000 and today are used on more than 13 million acres.
 
Impact will be marketed in programs alongside widely used herbicides sold by major agricultural companies. AMVAC expects this exposure, combined with the excellent weed control and crop safety Impact offers, to give the product access to a large number of corn acres.
 
Eric Wintemute, President and CEO of American Vanguard, stated, "Impact represents our first launch of a newly registered active ingredient, and adds another dimension to our portfolio of products. In the corn segment, we currently market three products successfully through our patented SmartBox
closed-handling system, which provides precise application while virtually eliminating applicator exposure. We look forward to introducing Impact into the dynamic corn market."
 
Mr. Wintemute continued, "We conducted extensive field studies which showed that Impact provides exceptional crop safety on all types of corn and controls a wide spectrum of broadleaf and grass weeds that infest millions of acres in the U.S. and Canada. 2006 will be a ramp-up year for Impact, and we expect it to become a significant component of our product line in terms of sales contribution in future years."
 
AMVAC is commercializing Impact (active ingredient: topramezone) in North America under an exclusive multi-year agreement with BASF Aktiengesellschaft (NYSE: BF). Under the terms of a licensing and supply agreement, BASF will supply the active ingredient to AMVAC.

Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
 
 
 
 
 
 
AMVAC Chemical Corporation ("AMVAC"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of American Vanguard Corporation, entered into a definitive Sale and Purchase Agreement (the "Agreement") with BASF Aktiengesellschaft ("BASF") that, by the terms of the Agreement, became effective October 31, 2005. Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Agreement, BASF has agreed to sell, and AMVAC has agreed to purchase, assets constituting the global Phorate insecticide product line of BASF, which assets include the active ingredient Phorate, the trademarks Thimet
, Granutox
, Granutox 5
, and Geomet
, the manufacturing and formulation know-how, registration rights, intellectual property rights and inventories as well as an exclusive license to use BASF's patented, closed delivery system, Lock N Load, in the US, Canada and Australia for Phorate.
 
As reported in greater detail on the Company's Form 8-K filed as of March 24, 2005, AMVAC Chemical Corporation and BASF Aktiengesellschaft are currently parties to a License and Supply Agreement dated as of March 18, 2005, as amended (the "LSA"), under which BASF has licensed certain rights to certain patents, patent applications and proprietary intellectual property related to the herbicide, Topramezone.
 
 
On October 31, 2005, AMVAC completed the acquisition of assets constituting the global Phorate insecticide product line from BASF, for approximately $26.1 million in purchase price consideration, subject to a post-closing adjustment to reflect the value of inventories as of the time of closing. AMVAC financed the acquisition through borrowing under its revolving line of credit, which is described in Item 2.03 below. The assets purchased by AMVAC are described in the disclosure under Item 1.01 above, which is incorporated herein by reference. Other than the LSA, there are no material relationships between AMVAC or any of its affiliates and BASF, and the purchase price consideration was determined by arms' length negotiation between the parties.
 
 
In order to finance the acquisition of the global Phorate insecticide product line described in Items 1.01 and 2.01 above, AMVAC borrowed under its revolving line of credit on October 31, 2005. As of October 31, 2005, the aggregate outstanding principal amount of AMVAC's borrowings under the revolving line of credit was $24 million, and AMVAC had $21 million of availability under its revolving line of credit facility. At the Company's option, the amount borrowed under its revolving line of credit related to this acquisition may be converted to a term loan.
 
The revolving credit facility is documented in an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement into which AMVAC entered in October 2004 with a syndicate of commercial lenders led by AMVAC's primary bank as the administrative agent and a lender, two other banks as lenders and a fourth as a participant, for an $80,000,000 fully-secured credit facility. This credit facility replaced AMVAC's previous credit facility with its primary bank and one other bank entered into in May 2002 and amended in March 2004. The new credit facility consists of a $45,000,000 revolving line of credit and a $35,000,000 term loan. These loans bear interest at the prime rate ("Referenced Loans"), or at AMVAC's option, a fixed rate of interest offered by the Bank (such as adjusted LIBOR rate plus certain margins, in each case dependent on certain debt ratios ("Fixed Loans")). The principal payments of the term loan are payable in equal quarterly installments of $1,000,000 on or before the last business day of each February, May, August and November, commencing November 30, 2004 and in one final installment in the amount necessary to repay the remaining outstanding principal balance of the term loan in full on the maturity date. Interest accruing on the Referenced Loans are payable quarterly, in arrears, on the last day of each March, June, September and December, and on the maturity date of such loan in the amount of interest then accrued but unpaid. Interest accruing on the Fixed Loans are payable on the last day of the interest period,
provided that, with an interest period longer than three months, interest is payable on the last day of each three-month period after the commencement of such interest period. The senior secured revolving line of credit and term loan both mature on October 7, 2009 (five years from the closing date) and contain certain covenants (with which AMVAC is in compliance) as defined in the credit agreement. For a further description of this credit facility, see the Company's Form 8-K filed on October 14, 2004 and Exhibit 10.8 to the Company's Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2004 filed on March 16, 2004.
 
 
On November 1, 2005, American Vanguard Corporation issued a press release announcing that AMVAC Chemical Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, had entered into the Agreement and completed the acquisition anticipated thereunder. The full text of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
 
(c) Exhibits
 
Exhibit 99.1 Press release dated November 1, 2005 of American Vanguard Corporation.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
 
 
Newport Beach, CA - November 1, 2005 - American Vanguard Corporation (AMEX:AVD) and BASF Aktiengesellschaft, Ludwigshafen, Germany (NYSE:BF) today announced that BASF sold the global Phorate insecticide product line to AMVAC Chemical Corporation, a subsidiary of American Vanguard. The product line consists of the active ingredient Phorate, the trademarks Thimet
, Granutox
and Geomet
, the manufacturing and formulation know-how, registration rights, intellectual property rights and inventories as well as an exclusive license to use BASF's patented, closed delivery system, Lock N Load, in the US, Canada and Australia for Phorate.
 
Phorate, which generated sales of approximately 14 million in 2004, was first introduced in 1954. It is registered in more than 15 countries, with the main markets in Asia Pacific and the Americas. It is used on agricultural crops, mainly potatoes, corn, cotton, rice and sugarcane, to protect against chewing and piercing-sucking insects.
 
Eric Wintemute, President and CEO of American Vanguard, stated, "This acquisition is important for American Vanguard on several levels. It is our largest acquisition to date, and should be a significant contributor to our sales base, with sales beginning in the fourth quarter of 2005. Furthermore, Phorate is an attractive addition to our niche product portfolio, which includes many different insecticide products. Additionally, we have identified what we believe are further market opportunities for Phorate. We continue to execute on our growth strategy of acquiring and licensing niche product lines from larger companies in our industry."
 
"For BASF, the divestiture is part of the continuing process of reviewing the Agricultural Products portfolio. It is obvious that some products offer limited synergy for BASF and are a better strategic fit for other, more specialized companies. This is the case with Phorate and AMVAC," says Mike Heinz, Group Vice President and Head of Global Strategic Marketing of the BASF Agricultural Products division, who will be President of the division from December 1, 2005.
 
Glen Johnson, Senior Vice President of AMVAC, added, "In the US, Thimet is delivered via the Lock N Load
delivery system. We see an opportunity to bridge this technology with our successful SmartBox
delivery system. This acquisition comes on the heels of our licensing agreement with BASF for the new corn herbicide, Impact which we expect to launch in the spring of 2006."

The information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including the Exhibit attached hereto, is being furnished under Item 2.02 and shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.

Nine-Month Financial Highlights 
 
 
 
 
Eric Wintemute, President and CEO of American Vanguard, stated, "As anticipated, we achieved growth across the vast majority of our product line in the year-to-date. The sales increase in the third quarter is largely attributable to the high volume of corn soil insecticides. In response to the growing interest in our SmartBox delivery system, we began manufacturing product to run through the systems even earlier than last year, starting August 1 versus mid-September 04. We also generated strong sales of Bifenthrin, the generic pyrethroid we launched last year. Additionally, our legacy products continue to experience growth in the marketplace."
 
Mr. Wintemute continued, "As announced last week, we made another acquisition in line with our growth strategy of acquiring and licensing niche product lines from larger companies in our industry. We acquired the global Phorate insecticide product line from BASF. With sales of approximately 14 million in 2004, this acquisition is our largest to date and should be an important contributor to our sales growth in 2006. We expect to commence sales in the fourth quarter of 2005, and have identified what we believe are further market opportunities that we plan to pursue. This acquisition came on the heels of our licensing agreement with BASF for the new corn herbicide, Impact. We received a registration for Impact from the U.S. EPA during the third quarter, and expect to launch the product in the spring of 2006."
 
Mr. Wintemute concluded, "We are enthusiastic about American Vanguard's outlook for the fourth quarter, historically our strongest period. Furthermore, we are optimistic about the coming year based on expected growth from our core product lines as well as additions we made to the portfolio during 2005. We remain focused on further expansion via acquisition and licensing opportunities and look forward to reporting on American Vanguard's continued development."

On December 20, 2005, American Vanguard Corporation issued a press release announcing the acquisition of the cereal herbicide product line, Difenzoquat, by its wholly-owned operating subsidiary AMVAC Chemical Corporation from BASF Aktiengesellschaft. The full text of that press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference herein.
 
 
(c) Exhibits
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, American Vanguard Corporation has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
Newport Beach, CA  December 20, 2005  American Vanguard Corporation (AMEX:AVD) today announced that its wholly owned operating subsidiary, AMVAC Chemical Corporation, acquired the cereal herbicide product line, Difenzoquat from BASF Aktiengesellschaft (NYSE: BF). The product line consists of the active ingredient Difenzoquat, the trademark Avenge
, the manufacturing and formulation know-how, and registration rights and intellectual property rights in the US and Canada. Other details of the transaction were not disclosed.
 
Avenge (difenzoquat), which generated sales of approximately 1.2 million in 2004, was first introduced in 1975 as a selective, post-emergent herbicide primarily to control wild oats in barley and wheat. Wild oats are annual grass weeds that are present in many areas where wheat and barley are grown and if not controlled, can lead to serious yield losses. Since Avenge has a unique mode of action, it can be tank mixed with many popular broad leaf herbicides such as MCPA or 2,4-D to provide broadleaf weed control as well as for effectively managing herbicide resistance problems in wild oats.
 
Eric Wintemute, President and CEO of American Vanguard, stated, "We are pleased to complete our third transaction with BASF this year. This acquisition represents yet another achievement in line with our growth strategy of acquiring and licensing niche product lines from larger companies in our industry. Difenzoquat complements our herbicide portfolio, and should begin contributing to our sales starting in the spring of 2006."

On January 11, 2006, American Vanguard Corporation announced that its wholly owned subsidiary, AMVAC Chemical Corporation, entered into an exclusive multi-year licensing agreement with Dow AgroSciences, a wholly owned subsidiary of The Dow Chemical Company, to market, sell and distribute Lorsban 15G insecticide (active ingredient chlorpyrifos), through AMVAC's SmartBox delivery system in the United States. The full text of that press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference herein.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, American Vanguard Corporation has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
Newport Beach, CA  January 11, 2006 - American Vanguard Corporation (AMEX:AVD) today announced that its wholly owned subsidiary, AMVAC Chemical Corporation, entered into an exclusive multi-year licensing agreement with Dow AgroSciences, a wholly owned subsidiary of The Dow Chemical Company (NYSE:DOW), to market, sell and distribute Lorsban 15G insecticide (active ingredient chlorpyrifos), through AMVAC's SmartBox delivery system in the United States.
 
AMVAC has licensed the entire agricultural label from Dow AgroSciences and will begin selling Lorsban SmartBox in the 2006 season.
 
Glen Johnson, Senior Vice President and Director of Business Development for AMVAC, stated, "Lorsban represents the fifth product we will market through our SmartBox system and the first product we have licensed for use outside of corn and soybeans. This license will substantially broaden our reach into crops we do not currently serve with SmartBox including various vegetable crops, sugar beets, sweet potatoes, and peanuts. We see this agreement as an important opportunity to further develop the positioning of SmartBox as the delivery system of choice for granular insecticides."
 
Eric Wintemute, President and CEO of American Vanguard, stated, "While we have a long-standing relationship with Dow, this license is the first deal between our two companies. We hope that this agreement will serve as the basis for future collaborations."
 
Hank King, Lorsban product manager of Dow AgroSciences, commented, "We are very pleased that Lorsban 15G will be available to farmers in the state-of-the-art SmartBox system. The cost effective performance of Lorsban 15G combined with the superior SmartBox technology make a perfect fit, and provide farmers with additional options for pest control."
 
AMVAC's SmartBox is a closed handling system that combines precision insecticide application with reduced applicator exposure. Its 50-lb. returnable containers conveniently eliminate the need to open, pour and dispose of bags as well as reducing the risk of skin contact or inhalation exposure. It also features in-cab push-button insecticide control, monitoring and data record keeping capabilities. The SmartBox is a low-maintenance system that can be easily fitted on all major brands of planters.
 
Lorsban 15G controls a broad spectrum of insect pests such as corn rootworms, lesser cornstalk borer, cutworms, wireworms, white grubs and sugar beet root maggot. The product also inhibits the growth and development of white mold disease. Accordingly, Lorsban 15G is registered for use on alfalfa, asparagus, corn (field, sweet, and corn grown for seed), citrus grove floors, grain sorghum/milo, onions (dry bulb), peanuts, soybeans, sugar beets, sunflowers, sweet potatoes, tobacco, and various vegetable crops.

Given the recent rise in interest rates, we felt it was prudent to raise equity to reduce the debt incurred to complete our November acquisition of the Phorate insecticide business from BASF, the largest acquisition in the Company's history. Accordingly, we will bring our debt-to-equity ratio to a lower level."
 
Mr. Wintemute continued, "This transaction was completed with eight prestigious institutional investors, thus further strengthening our shareholder base. Importantly, the equity raise also provides more financial flexibility as we continue to actively pursue acquisitions in line with our growth strategy."

(d) On February 24, 2006, American Vanguard Corporation (the "Company") made application with the Securities and Exchange Commission to effect the withdrawal of the Company's common stock from listing on the American Stock Exchange. On the same day, the Company received authorization from the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") to list the Company's common stock on the NYSE.
 
On February 28, 2006, American Vanguard Corporation announced its application to withdraw its common stock from listing on the American Stock Exchange and its intention to list such shares with the New York Stock Exchange tentatively commencing March 8, 2006. The full text of that press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference herein.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, American Vanguard Corporation has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
Newport Beach, CA  February 28, 2006  American Vanguard Corporation (AMEX: AVD) today announced that it will list its common stock on the New York Stock Exchange. Accordingly, the Company has applied to withdraw its securities from listing on the American Stock Exchange. Trading on the NYSE is expected to commence on Wednesday, March 8, 2006, subject to the Company's selection of a specialist and the completion of the proper securities filings. The Company's ticker symbol will remain AVD.' Until the move, American Vanguard's common stock will continue trading on the American Stock Exchange.
Eric Wintemute, President and CEO of American Vanguard, stated, "Listing on the NYSE is a significant and exciting development for the Company. In considering the move, we were impressed with the new hybrid platform that the NYSE is currently implementing, which will permit both electronic and specialist-assisted trading. We believe the platform will appeal to a broad range of investors and should dampen intraday price volatility. The new listing should also enhance the Company's exposure and the trading liquidity of our stock. This milestone event is a product of our continued commitment to maximizing shareholder value."
Mr. Wintemute continued, "We thank the AMEX for their support and service over the past eight years. During that time, American Vanguard has achieved tremendous growth in sales, earnings and market cap, and the AMEX has played an important role. Having now surpassed $500 million in market cap, from about $16 million when we joined the AMEX, we think the time is right for a move. We look forward to establishing a balance between specialist-assisted trading, which served the Company well on the AMEX, and electronic trading, which provides increased flexibility to our shareholders."
The Company expects the move to the New York Stock Exchange to be seamless for American Vanguard shareholders. Shareholders that hold a stock certificate do not need to replace the certificate. At such time as shareholders might sell the shares represented on the certificate, the transfer agent will automatically recognize the shares as American Vanguard stock on the New York Stock Exchange.

 versus fiscal 2004 fourth quarter
Fourth Quarter Highlights
 
 
 
 versus 2004
2005 Highlights
 
 
 
Eric Wintemute, President and CEO of American Vanguard, stated, "2005 was a very successful year for American Vanguard on many accounts. We achieved strong growth in sales and earnings, added four products to our portfolio  two through acquisition and two through license  and set the stage for additional transactions, one of which closed in January."
Mr. Wintemute continued, "During the fourth quarter, we began selling Thimet
(phorate), the insecticide product line we acquired from BASF in November. With sales of approximately 14 million in 2004, Thimet represents our largest acquisition to date. This product exceeded our sales expectations in the fourth quarter, and should be an important contributor to our 2006 results. Additionally, we have begun exploring further market opportunities for Thimet. The second acquisition we completed in 2005 was the Avenge
cereal herbicide product line, which we also acquired from BASF. Avenge generated sales of approximately 1.2 million in 2004, and is complementary to our herbicide portfolio.
"With regard to our licensing agreements, during 2005 we licensed Impact, a new corn herbicide, from BASF. We initiated sales of Impact in the first quarter of 2006, representing our first launch of a newly registered active ingredient. 2006 will be a ramp-up year for Impact, but we are very optimistic about its prospects, and expect it to become a significant sales driver in future years. We also entered into a licensing agreement with Washington State University Research Foundation that will enable American Vanguard to develop, register and commercialize a highly effective potato sprout inhibitor for post-harvest use in the US and Canada. We are hopeful to launch products under this agreement in late 2008."
Recent Developments
Mr. Wintemute continued, "In January, we entered into a licensing agreement with Dow AgroSciences to market, sell and distribute Lorsban 15G insecticide through our SmartBox delivery system in the US. This represents the fifth product we are marketing through SmartBox, but the first we have licensed for use outside of corn and soybeans. This license is an important opportunity to further position SmartBox as the delivery system of choice for granular insecticides.
"Also in January, we established our Swiss subsidiary and accordingly opened an office in Basel, Switzerland. Vince Pascarelli, a 30-year industry veteran, joined our team to head the new operations, which enhance our international presence and improve our ability to capitalize on growth opportunities in European and other international markets.
"Today, the Company's shares will begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange. We were drawn to the NYSE because of the new hybrid platform currently being implemented. This platform will permit both electronic and specialist-assisted trading, which should appeal to a wide range of investors and dampen intraday price volatility. The NYSE listing is also reflective of the Company's growth and achievements, and should increase American Vanguard's exposure and trading liquidity," added Mr. Wintemute.
Outlook
Mr. Wintemute concluded, "Regarding our outlook, we are once again optimistic that the Company's diverse and growing portfolio of niche products, talented employees and effective operating structure will produce double-digit growth in sales and net income in 2006. As we have stated previously, we are not comfortable providing more specific financial guidance since our results are subject to unpredictable factors including pest pressure and weather conditions.
"The environment for license and acquisition opportunities certainly remains attractive. Our recent $23.4 million private equity placement enabled us to reduce the debt incurred for our November acquisition of Thimet, and established greater financial flexibility for us to actively pursue more additions to our product portfolio. We look forward to reporting on American Vanguard's continued development."
FAS 123R
American Vanguard will begin expensing stock options in the first quarter of 2006, in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard (FAS) 123R. The expense is expected to total approximately $500,000 for fiscal year 2006.
Conference Call
Eric Wintemute, President and CEO, and James Barry, Senior Vice President and CFO, will conduct a conference call focusing on the financial results at 12:00 noon ET on Tuesday, March 7, 2006. Interested parties may participate in the call by dialing 706-679-3155 - please call in 10 minutes before the call is scheduled to begin, and ask for the American Vanguard call (conference ID # 5665376).

ITEM: Amendments to the Registrant's Code of Ethics, or Waiver of a Provision of the Code of Ethics
ITEM: Financial Statements and Exhibits
 
Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
 
 
 
 
 
 
As of March 8, 2006, the Board of Directors of American Vanguard Corporation (the "Company") approved an amendment to the Company's Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. The amendment consists of the addition to the Code of a provision on fair dealing.
A copy of the amended Code is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.
 
(c) Exhibits.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, American Vanguard Corporation has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
At American Vanguard Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company"), our efforts are focused on achieving the business and personal ethical standards as well as compliance with the laws and regulations that are applicable to our business. Adherence to the standards contained in this Code of Conduct and Ethics (the "Code") will help to ensure decisions that reflect care for all of our stockholders. This Code is intended as general overview of the Company's guiding principles. The Company has and will publish additional specific policies and procedures (e.g. insider trading, harassment).
This Code is a statement of goals and expectations for individual and generic business conduct. It cannot and is not intended to cover every applicable law or provide answers to all questions that might arise; for that we must ultimately rely on an individual's sense of what is ethical, including a sense of when it is proper to seek guidance from others on the appropriate course of conduct.
All statements contained in this Code are intended to reflect general policies, principles, and procedures, and do not represent contractual commitments on the part of the Company and may be changed at any time without notice. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, nothing in this Code should be construed to grant any person any right under any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement.
It is the obligation of each and every director, officer and employee of the Company to become familiar with the goals and policies of the Company and integrate them into every aspect of our business. For purposes of this Code only, reference or use of the term "employee" covers the officers and other employees of the Company and, where the context appears applicable, the non-employee directors of the Company. Our ethics are ultimately determined by all of us as we do our daily jobs. Our standard has been, and will continue to be, that of high ethical conduct.
 
 
As an employee of the Company, each individual owes a duty of loyalty to the Company. Therefore, employees must use the Company's property, its business opportunities and their positions with the Company exclusively for the benefit of the Company. This means that employees must act in the best interests of the Company, not their own, and that they must always seek to advance the goals of the Company as established by the Board of Directors.
Employees must avoid any situation in which their obligations to the Company compete with their own financial interests, obligations to another company or governmental body or desire to assist relatives or friends. Employees should always refrain from competing with the Company.
Each employee is responsible for recognizing situations in which a conflict of interest is present or might arise and for taking appropriate action to eliminate or prevent such conflict, including reporting the situation to the appropriate level of management.
Where an employee believes he/she is not possible to avoid any of these situations, or to avoid any other conflict of interest, he/she must inform his/her supervisor, if applicable, and make full written disclosure (in advance whenever possible) to a member of the Audit Committee ("Audit Member") of the Company. A full and timely disclosure of the facts will help the Company and its employees avoid problems.
 
In addition to avoiding actual conflicts of interest, employees must also avoid creating any appearance that their judgment as an employee of the Company may have been influenced by personal considerations, or that they are seeking to obtain business or contracts for the Company based on improper considerations.
Under no circumstances should an employee give gifts, meals, or entertainment to any United States or foreign governmental personnel, to any persons employed by the United States or foreign political parties, to any candidates for political office, or to any intermediaries (for example, commission, agents, sales representatives, or consultants) who might pass on any gifts to these persons. Giving gratuities to such persons may violate United States and/or foreign statutes.
The Company complies with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the laws of other countries which prohibit the payment of money or anything of value to any person who is a government official, member of a political party or candidate for political office, solely for the purpose of obtaining, retaining or directing business. These laws apply to the Company, the Company's employees, consultants, business partners and other Company representatives. The Company observes strict accounting standards imposed by these laws on public corporations and their subsidiaries relating to the accuracy of books and records and internal controls.
 
All information about the Company's business and its plans that has not been disclosed to the public is a valuable asset that belongs to the Company. Employees must never (i) use any confidential information relating to the Company for any purpose other than the performance of their duties to the Company, or (ii) disclose any confidential information/trade secrets relating to the Company to anyone, including relatives, friends, or other persons or companies, without written advance authorization by an Audit Member.
Trade secrets and the proprietary information about the Company, its business activities or its customers and suppliers, and information about such customers and suppliers, should be treated as confidential.
 
An employee may not collect or maintain in the Company's files information about employees that is not directly related to their services rendered to the Company, except (i) to the Company's attorneys, (ii) as permitted by this Code or (iii) as authorized by an Audit Member. Nor may an employee disclose any information about another active employee to persons outside the Company. Refer all inquiries relating to verifying the fact of employment or providing information that must be disclosed by law to the appropriate human resource representative. If an employee is unclear about what information must be disclosed by law, he/she must consult with an Audit Member or the appropriate human resource representative.
Inappropriate access or modifications to, or unauthorized destruction of, accounting or other business records is prohibited. These prohibitions apply to all business records and data, regardless of whether such data and records are in written form or electronically stored.
 
In the performance of assigned duties, employees may develop ideas, inventions, software or create original works of authorship relating to the business of the Company (referred to herein as "Intellectual Property"). In consideration of the compensation paid to each employee by the Company, it is the understanding between the Company and each employee that the Company shall have certain rights in the Intellectual Property. Where the subject matter of such Intellectual Property (i) results from or is suggested by any activity which the employee may do for or on behalf of the Company, (ii) is created, invented or developed on the Company time or using the Company's facilities, property or information, or (iii) is otherwise related to the Company's business, the employee shall assign all rights in such Intellectual Property to the Company.
At the request of the Company, either during employment or after termination thereof, each employee shall execute or join in executing all papers or documents required for filing of patent or copyright applications in the United States and such foreign countries as the Company may elect for Intellectual Property. Each employee shall assign such patent and copyright applications to the Company or its nominee and shall provide the Company and its
agents or attorneys with all reasonable assistance in the preparation and prosecution of such applications, including drawings, specifications and the like, all at the expense of the Company. Each employee shall do all things that may be necessary to establish, protect and maintain the rights of the Company or its nominee in the Intellectual Property in accordance with the intent of this Agreement.
 
It is the Code of the Company to fully and fairly disclose the financial condition of the Company in compliance with applicable accounting principles, laws, rules and regulations. All books and records to the Company shall be kept in such a way as to fully and fairly reflect all Company transactions. Clear, open and frequent communication among all management levels and personnel on all significant financial and operating matters will substantially reduce the risk of problems in the accounting and financial reporting areas as well as help achieve operating goals. All management employees are expected to be aware of these risks and to communicate accordingly.
 
It is both illegal and a violation of this Code for any individual to profit from undisclosed information relating to the Company or any other company with which we do business. If an employee is in possession of material inside information that the Company has not yet disclosed to the public, he/she may not purchase or sell any of the securities of the Company or "tip" others to trade in our stock. Material inside information is defined as facts that have not been disclosed to the public that could influence a reasonable investor's decision to buy or sell a company's stock or other securities. Examples of inside material information include, but are not limited to, a stock split, a change in the dividend policy, potential mergers, acquisitions or other business opportunities, or financial performance different than market expectations.
If an employee has inside or unpublished knowledge about any of the Company's suppliers, customers or any other company that we do business with, he/she may not purchase or sell securities of those companies or tip others to do so.
The securities laws provide for penalties not only for those who engage in insider trading, but also for those controlling persons who fail to take appropriate actions when they either knew or should have known that those people within their control were violating these rules. Therefore, it is essential that employees be alert to those situations where others within the Company (particularly over those of whom an employee has some supervisory authority) may not be observing the rules of insider trading.
 
The United States antitrust laws prohibit agreements or actions in "restraint of trade," defined as restrictive practices that may reduce or hinder competition. These laws require that decisions be made and activities undertaken without any agreement or coordination with competitors. Among those agreements and activities constituting clear violations are agreements and understandings to fix or control prices and other terms of sale; to allocate products, territories or markets (including store locations); or to limit the production or sale of products. Accordingly, employees must take great care to avoid any communications with the Company's competitors with respect to these or other business matters.
The antitrust laws also regulate conduct with suppliers and others. Individuals involved in pricing discussions with suppliers must be knowledgeable with respect to the price discrimination rules and must consult with the Audit Member as issues arise.
Because of the complexity of the antitrust laws, it is imperative that advice be sought from the Audit Member regarding this subject.
If employees engage in personal political activity on their own time, they must take care not to imply that they are acting on behalf of the Company.
 
The Company is committed to a work environment free of any form of sexual harassment. The Company will not tolerate any conduct which constitutes sexual harassment, whether engaged in by supervisory or non-supervisory personnel. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC") defines sexual harassment as consisting of unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or physical acts of a sexual or gender based nature where:
 
 
 
One may not in his/her capacity as an employee of the Company discriminate against any individual or group on the basis of age, race, color, sex, sexual orientation, citizenship, religion, national origin, disability or any other characteristic protected by federal, state, and local laws. This Code applies to all elements of the employee or perspective employee's work life, including, but not limited to, all decisions with respect to hiring, consideration for promotion or advancement and participation in educational and training programs.
Please refer to the American Vanguard Corporation Employee Handbook for additional information.
 
The Company is committed to doing all that it can to assist in minimizing the degradation of our natural environment. Accordingly, employees should always take care in disposing of any waste materials or releasing any discharges into the air or water and comply with all applicable regulations and procedures required by law and by Company Code. If an employee is unclear about what is required, he/she must not dispose of any material or release any discharges until he/she has determined what procedures apply.
 
It is critical to the success of the Company and in the best interests of its stockholders that its employees conduct themselves honestly and ethically. In particular, each employee is required to observe the highest standards of ethical business conduct, including strict adherence to this Code. Accordingly, it is the Company's mandate that each employee comply with the following:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A copy of this Code is, or shortly after its approval by the Board of Directors of the Company will be, available on the Company's Website at www.american-vanguard.com. A hard copy of this Code is to be provided to all employees of the Company. The Company's human resources department may redistribute the Code at least once per year to serve as a renewal and will remind employees of their responsibilities under this Code.
 
All employees of the Company will be asked to certify this Code upon receipt. By certifying, the employee acknowledges that he/she has read and understands the conditions of the Code. In addition, annual certifications shall be required of employees at the level of senior management and above.
 
It is each employee's responsibility to resolve with the an Audit Member of the Company any potential conflicts with this Code. Violations of this Code, even in the first instance, may result in disciplinary action up to and including dismissal of employment from or termination of services for the Company. In addition, violations of laws applicable to the Company could result in substantial fines to the Company and individual violators and, in certain instances, imprisonment. No improper or illegal behavior will be justified by a claim that it was ordered by someone in higher authority. No one, regardless of his or her position, is authorized to direct an employee to commit a wrongful act. The Company encourages you to ask questions and seek guidance from your supervisor or anyone on your management team, the Company's human resources department, or others designated by this Code.
 
Any waivers of this Code made only by the Board of Directors and any waivers for executive officers or directors must be promptly disclosed to the Company's stockholders.
Any employee of the Company who observes or otherwise becomes aware of any violation of the Code shall report the violation to an Audit Member. If the reporting individual is not satisfied with the response that he or she receives from the Audit Member, he or she may report the matter to any other member of the Board of Directors. The Company forbids retaliation against employees who report violations of the Code in good faith.

Exhibit 99.1

On May 8, 2006, American Vanguard Corporation issued a press release announcing its financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2006. The full text of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
The information contained in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including the Exhibit attached hereto, is being furnished under Item 2.02 and shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
 
(d) Exhibits
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, American Vanguard Corporation has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
Newport Beach, CA  May 8, 2006  American Vanguard Corporation (NYSE:AVD), today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2006.
Net sales for the first quarter increased 9% to $44.7 million from $41.2 million in the first quarter of 2005. Operating income was $4.7 million compared to $5.4 million in the same period of 2005, primarily due to lower gross profit margins associated with product mix, and higher freight, delivery and warehousing costs. Additionally, American Vanguard began expensing stock options in the first quarter of 2006, resulting in $139,000 of expenses in the quarter. Earnings were impacted by higher interest expense associated with debt incurred to complete the Company's November 2005 acquisition of the Thimet
(phorate) insecticide business from BASF, the largest acquisition in American Vanguard's history. This debt has since been repaid with the proceeds of the Company's February 2006 private equity placement. The Company reported net income of $2.5 million or $0.09 per diluted share, versus $3.1 million or $0.12 per diluted share in the first quarter of the prior year.
Eric Wintemute, President and CEO of American Vanguard, stated, "Our first quarter sales growth was driven primarily by new sales of Thimet (phorate), which we launched in the fourth quarter of 05, and Impact , which we launched in the first quarter of this year. These products will be important contributors as we pursue double-digit growth in sales and earnings for the year. We also saw first quarter growth in many of our legacy products, but as expected, our corn insecticides were impacted by wider acceptance of genetically engineered seed in the U.S. corn market.
"We are focused on marketing our SmartBox delivery system as a safe and effective way to provide secondary pest control to genetic seed. Currently, many producers of genetically engineered seed are coating the seed with insecticides, but we believe SmartBox provides a number of clear advantages to producers and farmers. We remain enthusiastic about the corn market and our position in it, especially since acreage should continue to grow as demand for ethanol fuel increases."
Mr. Wintemute concluded, "Although first quarter earnings declined from last year's quarter, we are proud of our 27-quarter streak of comparable sales and earnings growth, and remain optimistic about the Company's prospects for the balance of 2006 and beyond. We expect to achieve our previously stated goal of double-digit sales and net income growth in fiscal 2006, due in part to the four products we added to our portfolio last year. We remain committed to capitalizing on additional acquisition and licensing opportunities that lie before American Vanguard. Most recently, we entered into an exclusive agreement with Bayer CropScience to market, sell and distribute Bayleton
, a fungicide, in the U.S. We have a strong presence in Bayleton's key crops and regions, have commenced sales, and are confident that our sales force and business model will maximize the potential of this product. We look forward to reporting on American Vanguard future developments."

The information contained in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including the Exhibit attached hereto, is being furnished under Item 2.02 and shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
 
(d) Exhibits
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, American Vanguard Corporation has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
Newport Beach, CA  August 7, 2006  American Vanguard Corporation (NYSE:AVD), today announced financial results for the second quarter and six months ended June 30, 2006.
For the second quarter, net sales increased 14% to $42.7 million as compared to the second quarter of 2005. Operating income rose 31% to $6.2 million, despite higher freight, delivery and warehousing costs, which increased to $3.3 million from $2.3 million in the second quarter of 2005. The Company incurred greater interest expense due to increased debt levels coupled with higher interest rates. Net income grew 21% to $3.3 million and earnings per diluted share increased to $0.12 from $0.11 in the second quarter of 2005.
For the first six months of 2006, net sales rose 11% to $87.5 million as compared to the first half of 2005. Operating income increased 7% to $10.9 million. Net income was $5.8 million compared to $5.9 million in the 2005 period, and earnings per diluted share were $0.21 versus $0.23 in the first half of 2005. Earnings were impacted by the aforementioned freight, delivery and warehousing costs and interest expense. For the six-month period, interest expense also included debt incurred to complete the November 2005 acquisition of the Thimet (phorate) insecticide business from BASF, the largest acquisition in American Vanguard's history; this debt was repaid in February 2006.
Eric Wintemute, President and CEO of American Vanguard, stated, "We are pleased with the results for the quarter, during which we realized sales from some of our newer additions to our product line, including Thimet, which we acquired from BASF in the fourth quarter of 2005, Avenge, which we acquired from BASF in December 2005, Impact, which we launched in the first quarter of this year, Bayleton, which we licensed from Bayer in April of this year, as well as an insecticide that we toll manufacture. We also achieved steady growth throughout much of our existing product line."
Mr. Wintemute continued, "We are focused on achieving our goal of double-digit growth in sales and earnings for fiscal year 2006. There are four key variables that can influence this objective; two that may challenge our goal, and two that may enhance our results. 1) The acceptance of genetically modified corn appears to be growing, and this will have a bearing on our traditional corn soil insecticide market. In order to counter this effect, we are positioning our SmartBox insecticides as the products of choice for treating the refuge acres' (that portion of a corn field that is not allowed to be planted with a genetic variety). 2) Bidrin, our cotton insecticide, performed ahead of last year's pace in the early to mid-season, but in the late season, which occurs in the third quarter, insect pressure is running behind historic levels.
"On the upside: 1) Use of Dibrom, our crop protection insecticide and mosquito adulticide, is currently tracking ahead of last year's level, and if forecasts of rainfall in key areas come to fruition, Dibrom should achieve record volumes. 2) Impact, our new corn herbicide launched earlier this year, is exceeding our expectations
in terms of its performance in the field. It is premature to ascertain what that performance will translate into for the upcoming selling season (Q4'06 and Q1'07), but our early estimates indicate that Impact could become one of our top five products in fiscal 2007."
Mr. Wintemute concluded, "We are actively working on additional product acquisitions and licenses and look forward to providing additional information as it is appropriate."

Eric Wintemute, President and CEO, and James Barry, Senior Vice President and CFO, will conduct a conference call focusing on the financial results at 11:00 a.m. ET on Monday, August 7, 2006.

As a result, we anticipate net income to be 8-15% lower than last year's level of $19.0 million.
"Nevertheless, our business model certainly remains sound, and we are very optimistic about achieving substantially stronger results in 2007. We anticipate the primary drivers of growth next year to be:

On November 6, 2006, American Vanguard Corporation issued a press release announcing its financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2006. The full text of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
The information contained in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including the Exhibit attached hereto, is being furnished under Item 2.02 and shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
 
(d) Exhibits
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, American Vanguard Corporation has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
Newport Beach, CA  November 6, 2006  American Vanguard Corporation (NYSE:AVD), today announced financial results for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2006.
For the third quarter, net sales increased 3% to $51.2 million as compared to the third quarter of 2005. Operating income was $7.6 million, compared to $8.9 million, primarily due to product mix and the associated margins, as well as higher freight, delivery and warehousing costs, which increased to $4.7 million from $3.3 million in the third quarter of 2005. The Company incurred greater interest expense due to increased debt levels coupled with higher interest rates. Net income was $4.2 million or $0.16 per diluted share, compared to $5.3 million or $0.20 in the third quarter of 2005.
For the first nine months of 2006, net sales rose 8% to $138.7 million as compared to the same period of 2005. Operating income was $18.5 million versus $19.1 million. Net income was $10.0 million compared to $11.2 million in the first nine months of last year, and earnings per diluted share were $0.37 versus $0.43 in the first nine months of 2005. Earnings were impacted by the aforementioned product mix, freight, delivery and warehousing costs and interest expense.
Eric Wintemute, President and CEO of American Vanguard, stated, "The results for the quarter are in line with our expectations. Our comparatively modest sales growth reflects the adverse impact of the pest and weather related factors on two of our products, which we discussed in our September 28, 2006 news release. In this regard, Bidrin, our cotton insecticide, incurred a 70% sales decrease during the quarter, and Dibrom, our crop protection insecticide and mosquito adulticide, had a 21% reduction. With regard to our corn soil insecticides, we are making progress with our programs to generate additional SmartBox
sales by positioning SmartBox insecticides as the products of choice for treating the refuge acres' (that portion of a corn field that is not allowed to be planted with a genetic variety). While corn soil insecticide sales rose 18% during the quarter, we are expecting lower sales in the fourth quarter. During the quarter, our slight increase in overall sales was more than offset by greater operating expenses, primarily energy and transportation costs, coupled with higher interest and tax rates. Thus far, the competitive market environment has prevented us from recovering these costs through price increases."
Mr. Wintemute concluded, "For fiscal year 2006, we continue to expect net sales to be 4-7% higher than the 2005 level of $190 million and net income to be 8-15% lower than last year's level of $19 million. Looking further ahead, we remain optimistic about the Company's long-term prospects and fully expect to achieve substantially stronger results in 2007. The primary drivers of this expected growth include Impact
, our new corn herbicide that continues to achieve extraordinary performance in the field, as well as a return to historic sales levels of Bidrin and Dibrom, based on normal pest pressure and rainfall. We are also actively working on several potential additions to our product line, which should be significant contributors to our results next year."

Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
 
 
 
 
 
AMVAC Chemical Corporation ("AMVAC"), one of our subsidiaries, entered into a definitive Sale and Purchase Agreement (the "Agreement") with BASF Aktiengesellschaft ("BASF") that, by the terms of the Agreement, became effective November 27, 2006. Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Agreement, BASF has agreed to sell, and AMVAC has agreed to purchase, assets constituting the global Terbufos insecticide product line of BASF and the Lock N Load
closed delivery system. The assets to be acquired include the active ingredient Terbufos, the trademarks Counter
and Lock N Load
, the manufacturing and formulation know-how, registration rights, intellectual property rights and inventories.
Registrant and its affiliates have no material relationship with BASF except as follows: as reported in greater detail on the Company's Form 8-K filed as of November 4, 2005, AMVAC completed the acquisition of assets constituting the global Phorate product line from BASF for approximately $26.1 million; and, as reported in greater detail on the Company's Form 8-K filed as of March 24, 2005, AMVAC and BASF are currently parties to a License and Supply Agreement dated as of March 18, 2005, as amended (the "LSA"), under which BASF has licensed to AMVAC certain rights to certain patents, patent applications and proprietary intellectual property related to the herbicide, Topramezone.
On November 27, 2006, AMVAC, as borrower, and its affiliates, as guarantors, entered into a Fifth Amendment to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the "Fifth Amendment") with a syndicate of commercial lenders led by AMVAC's primary bank as administrative agent and lender. Under the terms of the Fifth Amendment, the borrowing availability of the term loans was increased by $20 million which amount is to be used solely for the purpose of acquiring the Terbufos product line described in this Item 1.01. The terms of the Fifth Amendment are more fully described in Item 2.03 below which section is incorporated by reference herein.
 
On November 27, 2006, AMVAC completed the acquisition of assets constituting the global Terbufos insecticide product line from BASF, for approximately $42.1 million in purchase price consideration, subject to a post-closing adjustment to reflect the value of inventories as of the time of closing. AMVAC financed the acquisition through borrowing approximately $22.1 million under its revolving credit facility and a $20 million term loan, as more fully described in Item 2.03 below. The assets purchased by AMVAC are described in the disclosure under Item 1.01 above, which is incorporated herein by reference. Other than the Phorate product line acquisition and the LSA, there are no material relationships between AMVAC or any of its affiliates and BASF, and the purchase price consideration was determined by arm's length negotiation between the parties.
 
In order to finance the acquisition of the Terbufos insecticide product line described in Items 1.01 and 2.01 above, on November 27, 2006, AMVAC borrowed approximately $22.1 million under its revolving credit facility and a $20 million term loan pursuant to the Fifth Amendment to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The revolving credit facility and term loans are documented in the Fifth Amendment to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement into which AMVAC entered on November 27, 2006 with a syndicate of commercial lenders led by AMVAC's primary bank as the administrative agent and a lender, two other banks as lenders and a fourth as a participant, for a $97,000,000 fully-secured credit facility. The credit facility as currently amended consists of a $65,000,000 revolving line of credit and $32,000,000 in term loans (consisting of $12 million in an Initial Term Loan and $20 million in a Delayed Draw Loan, collectively, the "Term Loans"). These loans bear interest at the prime rate ("Referenced Loans"), or at AMVAC's option, a fixed rate of interest offered by the Bank (such as adjusted LIBOR rate plus certain margins, in each case dependent on certain debt ratios ("Fixed Loans")).
The principal payments of the Initial Term Loan are payable in equal quarterly installments of $1,000,000 on or before the last business day of each February, May, August and November, and in one final installment in the amount necessary to repay the remaining outstanding principal balance of the Initial Term Loan in full on the maturity date. The principal amount of the Delayed Draw Loan is payable in full on January 31, 2007. Interest accruing on the Referenced Loans is payable quarterly, in arrears, on the last day of each March, June, September and December, and on the maturity date of such loan in the amount of interest then accrued but unpaid. Interest accruing on the Fixed Loans is payable on the last day of the interest period, provided that, with an interest period longer than three months, interest is payable on the last day of each three-month period after the commencement of such interest period. The senior secured revolving line of credit and Initial Term Loan both mature on October 7, 2009 (five years from the closing date of the original credit agreement) and contain certain covenants (with which AMVAC is in compliance) as defined in the credit agreement.
For a further description of this credit facility, see the Company's Form 8-K filed on October 14, 2004 and Exhibit 10.8 to the Company's Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2004 filed on March 16, 2005.
 
On November 28, 2006, we issued a press release announcing that we entered into the Agreement and completed the acquisition anticipated thereunder. The full text of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
(d) Exhibits
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, American Vanguard Corporation has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
Newport Beach, CA  November 28, 2006  American Vanguard Corporation (NYSE: AVD) and BASF Aktiengesellschaft, Ludwigshafen, Germany (NYSE:BF) today announced that BASF sold the global Counter insecticide product line and the Lock n Load closed delivery system to AMVAC Chemical Corporation, a subsidiary of American Vanguard. The Counter product line consists of the active ingredient Terbufos, the trademark Counter, the manufacturing and formulation know-how, registration rights, intellectual property rights and inventories.
Counter generated sales of approximately $25 million in 2005. First introduced in 1974, it is a systemic insecticide-nematicide registered in more than 20 countries, with the main markets in North and Latin America. It is used on agricultural crops, mainly corn, bananas sugar beets and coffee to protect against various insect pests.
Lock n Load is a patented, closed delivery system for granular products that was first marketed in the late eighties. Currently Counter and Phorate, a product AMVAC acquired from BASF in 2005, are marketed in Lock n Load. Bayer CropScience LLP has licensed this technology and is marketing their Aldicarb and Ethoprop products in Lock n Load in the USA.
Eric Wintemute, President and CEO of American Vanguard, stated, "This acquisition is our largest to date, and brings a complementary product line and delivery system to American Vanguard. Counter strongly complements the Thimet (Phorate) insecticide business we acquired from BASF in November of last year. We have been very pleased with Thimet's performance over the last year and are enthusiastic about the prospects for Counter, which we will begin selling immediately. This acquisition reflects the continued execution of our growth strategy to acquire and license niche product lines from larger companies in our industry. Additionally, the Lock n Load closed delivery system offers terrific synergies with our SmartBox
delivery system, and we are quickly emerging as a leading owner and provider of safe granular delivery technology."
Mike Heinz, President of the BASF Agricultural Products division, stated, "This divestiture reflects our ongoing review of BASF's Agricultural Products portfolio. Like Thimet, Counter offers limited synergy for BASF, and is a better strategic fit for AMVAC. This is also the case with the Lock n Load system, which pairs well with AMVAC's SmartBox."
Glen Johnson, Senior Vice President of AMVAC, added, "Counter brings to the market a product with unique features such as systemic activity, along with the ability to control nematodes in high value crops such as bananas, sugarbeets and coffee. The addition of Counter to our product line will be a significant contributor to our international business. This product will allow us to strengthen our network with distributors in specialty crops in Latin America, Africa and Asia Pacific where we have recently experienced significant growth with our other products. We are extremely excited about this acquisition and we see advantages in marketing Counter not only in Lock n Load but also in our SmartBox equipment."

On December 19, 2006, American Vanguard Corporation's wholly owned subsidiary, AMVAC Chemical Corporation, completed the acquisition of certain assets comprising the product line Permethrin (a synthetic pyrethroid insecticide) from Syngenta Crop Protection, Inc. In connection with the transaction, AMVAC acquired both crop and non-crop uses of the product line in the U.S., Mexico and Canada. Acquired assets include registration rights, manufacturing and formulation know-how, inventories, customer lists and the trademarks Ambush and Prelude in the aforementioned territories.
In July 2002, AMVAC acquired from Syngenta certain assets associated with the Ambush 25WP (wettable powder formulation) insecticide business in the U.S., and now owns the complete Permethrin product line. This product line sells into an estimated $40 million market and can be used on essentially all fruit and vegetable crops to control a broad spectrum of insect pests.
AMVAC will begin selling the Permethrin products immediately. The Company will be re-launching the liquid formulation of Ambush, which has one of the broadest lists of crops on its label, in the U.S. and Canada, as Syngenta has not sold it into those marketplaces for the past four years. In Mexico, AMVAC will distribute Ambush through national distributors. Sales of Prelude, which is sold for general pest control in or around the home, have been ongoing in both the U.S. and Canada and will continue with existing distributors.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, American Vanguard Corporation has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.

On December 19, 2006, AMVAC Chemical Corporation ("AMVAC"), one of our subsidiaries, as borrower, and its affiliates (including registrant), as guarantors, entered into a Credit Agreement (the "New Credit Agreement") with a syndicate of commercial lenders led by Bank of the West (AMVAC's primary bank) as arranger, syndication agent, swing line lender and L/C issuer. The New Credit Agreement supersedes the Fifth Amendment (the "Fifth Amendment") to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of November 27, 2006 and more fully described in the Company's Form 8-K filed on November 29, 2006. The New Credit Agreement is a $165 million senior secured lending facility consisting of a revolving line of credit of $75 million and term loan commitments of $60 million plus a $30 million accordion feature. AMVAC has had a banking relationship with its primary bank for over 20 years.
 
On December 19, 2006, AMVAC, as borrower, and its affiliates, as guarantors, terminated the Fifth Amendment concurrent with entry into the New Credit Agreement (as more fully described in Item 1.01, which is incorporated by reference herein). In connection with that termination, AMVAC paid the entire outstanding balance of the term loans and revolving line of credit plus accrued interest of the Fifth Amendment, using proceeds from the New Credit Facility as more fully described in Item 2.03 below, which is incorporated by reference herein.
 
In connection with retiring the entire outstanding balance of the term loans and revolving credit facility (plus accrued interest) of the Fifth Amendment upon termination thereof, on December 19, 2006, AMVAC borrowed approximately $87 million under the New Credit Facility consisting of approximately $60 million in term loans and approximately $27 million from the revolving line of credit. These loans bear interest at the prime rate plus an applicable rate, if any, dependent on certain debt ratios ("Prime Rate Loan"), or at AMVAC's option, a fixed rate of interest offered by the bank, based on the Eurodollar rate plus an applicable rate dependent on certain debt ratios ("Eurodollar Rate Loan"). The principal payments of the term loans are payable (a) in equal quarterly installments on or before the last business day of each March, June, September and December (beginning March 31, 2007) in the amount of (i) $1 million, through the period ending December 31, 2009, and (ii) $2 million, through the period January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2013, and (b) in one final installment in the amount necessary to repay the remaining outstanding principal balance of the term loans in full on the maturity date. Interest accruing on the Prime Rate Loans is payable monthly, in arrears, on the last day of each month, and on the maturity date of such loan in the amount of interest then accrued but unpaid. Interest accruing on the Eurodollar Rate Loans is payable on the last day of the interest period, provided that, with an interest period longer than three months, interest is payable on the last day of each three-month period after the commencement of such interest period. The senior secured revolving line of credit matures on December 19, 2011, and the term loans mature on December 19, 2013 and contain certain covenants (with which AMVAC is in compliance) as defined in the New Credit Agreement.
 
On December 22, 2006, we issued a press release announcing that we entered into the New Credit Agreement and terminated the Fifth Amendment. The full text of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

The revolving line of credit matures on December 19, 2011, while the term loans mature on December 19, 2013.

The information contained in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including the Exhibit attached hereto, is being furnished under Item 2.02 and shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.

Exhibit 99.1
Newport Beach, CA  May 8, 2007  American Vanguard Corporation (NYSE: AVD), today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2007.
Net sales were $40.9 million compared to $44.7 million in the first quarter of 2006. Operating income increased to $5.4 million from $4.7 million, due to higher margins associated with product mix, and lower operating expenses. The Company incurred greater interest expense due to increased debt levels coupled with higher interest rates, and reported net income of $2.1 million or $0.08 per diluted share, compared to $2.5 million or $0.09 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2006.
Eric Wintemute, President and CEO of American Vanguard, stated, "Counter, the global insecticide product line we acquired in November of last year from BASF, was a key contributor during the quarter, and should continue to generate strong sales in the remainder of the year. Our corn soil insecticide sales were essentially even with last year's first quarter, but we are seeing positive indicators for growth in the fourth quarter. Sales of our cotton insecticide Bidrin were down due to customer inventory carryover from last year, as well as customers' caution regarding the potential lower demand for Bidrin in the 2007 season in light of the decrease in cotton acreage stemming from the growing corn acreage."
Mr. Wintemute concluded, "As previously stated, while we expect to achieve improved results this year as compared to 2006, we believe much of this growth will occur mid- to late this year. In the balance of the year, we are working toward and anticipate: (1) growing usage of Impact, which is participating in a $200 million marketplace; (2) a strong year for Counter; (3) a return to historic sales levels of Dibrom, our crop protection insecticide and mosquito adulticide, based on normal pest pressure and rainfall; (4) better penetration of the corn refuge market, driven by a concerted effort for stewardship by the seed companies; and (5) a greater opportunity to sell our corn soil insecticides as a yield maximization tool for genetically enhanced corn, due to the rising price and demand levels for corn."
Conference Call
Eric Wintemute, President and CEO, and James Barry, Senior Vice President and CFO, will conduct a conference call focusing on the financial results at 12:00 noon ET on Tuesday, May 8, 2007.

On August 9, 2007, American Vanguard Corporation issued a press release announcing its financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2007. The full text of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
The information contained in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including the Exhibit attached hereto, is being furnished under Item 2.02 and shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
 
(d) Exhibits
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, American Vanguard Corporation has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
Newport Beach, CA  August 9, 2007  American Vanguard Corporation (NYSE:AVD), today announced financial results for the second quarter and six months ended June 30, 2007.
Net sales increased 17% to $50.0 million from $42.7 million in the second quarter of 2006. Operating income grew 24% to $7.8 million from $6.2 million. Net income was $3.6 million, up 8% from $3.3 million in the second quarter of 2006. The Company incurred greater interest expense in the current quarter due to increased debt levels coupled with higher interest rates. Earnings per diluted share were $0.13, up from $0.12 in the comparable period.
For the first half of 2007, net sales increased 4% to $90.9 million from $87.5 million in the first six months of 2006. Operating income rose 21% to $13.2 million from $10.9 million. Net income was $5.7 million or $0.21 per diluted share, even with the first half of 2006.
Eric Wintemute, President and CEO of American Vanguard, stated, "We are pleased with the increases in sales and operating profit for the quarter. Impact sales were up substantially from the comparable quarter, and sequentially, as our marketing efforts and industry partnerships for this extremely effective corn herbicide are paying off and we are gaining share in the $200 million market. Counter, the global insecticide product line we acquired in November of last year, was also a key contributor during the quarter and remains on-track for a strong year. Sales of Bidrin, our cotton insecticide, were down during the second quarter as farmers finished prior period inventories and shifted acreage from cotton to corn. Our corn soil insecticide sales were essentially even with the second quarter of last year, but we continue to see positive indicators for growth in the fourth quarter of this year."
Mr. Wintemute continued, "We anticipate continued growth in the second half of 2007, stemming from: (1) growing usage of Impact; (2) expanded sales of Counter; (3) more normal applications of Dibrom as a mosquito adulticide; and (4) better penetration of the corn soil insecticide market, both as a safeguard from soil borne insects in the refuge acreage segment and as a yield maximization tool against secondary insects for genetically enhanced corn. The exceptional demand for U.S. corn production should drive strong improvement in our wide range of corn-related products."
Mr. Wintemute concluded, "Longer-term, we remain very optimistic about the Company's position in a changing crop protection market. We are enthusiastic about (1) our management team's proven ability to acquire, license and build upon niche product lines; (2) the synergies that exist between our many products and the controlled delivery systems that provide for their optimal use; (3) our ability to capitalize on the many needs of an expanding corn market; (4) our low-cost domestic manufacturing capabilities; (5) our involvement in many stable segments of the agricultural market; and (6) our potential for international growth in coming years."

(d) Exhibits
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, American Vanguard Corporation has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
Newport Beach, CA  October 29, 2007  American Vanguard Corp. (NYSE:AVD) today announced that it has exercised an option to acquire one plant at BASF Corporation's Hannibal, MO site that manufactures two of American Vanguard's most important and promising insecticide products. This pertains to only one of the five plants at BASF's Hannibal site.
The Company anticipates growing sales of Phorate (acquired in 2005) and Counter (acquired in 2006) in coming years, and exercising the asset purchase option associated with those prior product acquisitions ensures the continuing supply of these high-quality insecticide products for use in a wide variety of agricultural applications. This acquisition, which is expected to close in late December 2007, will significantly increase American Vanguard's organophosphate manufacturing capacity.
Eric Wintemute, CEO of American Vanguard, commented, "We are pleased to be taking ownership of these extremely valuable production assets. The Midwest location will provide us with significant operational and logistical benefits as we continue to expand our participation in the U.S. corn market.
"Our operation will continue to utilize the substantial infrastructure provided at this plant site, including its comprehensive waste treatment capabilities. BASF's regimented regulatory compliance and environmental stewardship was a prime factor in our decision to purchase these assets."
Wintemute continued, "This purchase, along with our 2002 purchase of a DuPont facility in Alabama, demonstrates American Vanguard's commitment to expanding our world-class domestic manufacturing capabilities. We believe that such North American production units provide a level of quality assurance, expedited delivery and overall cost effectiveness that is superior to those offered by many offshore producers. We intend to use this competence to better serve our existing customers and to facilitate increased future output as we expand our sales channels in international markets."

Eric Wintemute, President and CEO of American Vanguard, stated, "We are pleased to report continued sales and earnings growth for the third quarter. Impact sales again grew substantially, as this extremely effective corn herbicide continues to gain share based on its superior performance and value. Counter, our newest systemic insecticide / nematicide, and Thimet, our branded phorate insecticide, both contributed significantly to quarterly results and each remains on-track for a strong finish in 2007. Sales of Bidrin, our cotton insecticide, were up during the third quarter as pest pressure increased, however, year-to-date sales remain down due to the acreage shift this season from cotton to corn. Sales of Dibrom, our mosquito adulticide, suffered during the quarter, as drought in the southeast U.S. resulted in significantly reduced demand."
Mr. Wintemute concluded, "We anticipate further top and bottom-line growth during the balance of 2007, driven by sales of our corn soil insecticide and fumigant products. Additionally, we continue to be very optimistic about American Vanguard's long-term position in the dynamic crop protection market. Among the many reasons:

Exhibit 99.1
Newport Beach, CA  March 5, 2008  American Vanguard Corporation (NYSE: AVD), today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2007.
Fourth Quarter Financial Highlights  versus fiscal 2006 fourth quarter
 
 
 
 
Full Year Financial Highlights  versus the fiscal 2006 full year period
 
 
 
 
Eric Wintemute, President and CEO of American Vanguard, stated, "We are pleased to report continued sales and earnings growth for the fourth quarter and full year 2007. We are gaining traction on a number of key initiatives discussed during 2007, and the benefits of those successes will be increasingly evident in calendar 2008."
Among the major performance highlights:
 
 
 
 
 
Mr. Wintemute concluded, "We are very optimistic about American Vanguard's position in the dynamic crop protection market. Our management team continues to demonstrate its ability to acquire, license and build upon niche product lines. The benefits to be gained by utilizing our portfolio of granular corn soil insecticide products and our proprietary application equipment are becoming self-evident with the release of university-validated yield enhancement performance data. We are optimistic that corn growers will increasingly choose to embrace a "dual" insect management approach by using our solution in concert with their genetically modified seed. We anticipate continued growth in our herbicide franchise, as Impact receives expanded label endorsement from glyphosate suppliers for its ability to eliminate "tough-to-control" weeds. Importantly, we will continue to leverage our low-cost, high-quality U.S. manufacturing capabilities and will pursue international expansion with a variety of independent and collaborative efforts. We believe that we hold an enviable position in a number of important growth segments of the dynamically changing and rapidly growing agricultural industry."

Exhibit 99.2
Newport Beach, CA  March 5, 2008  American Vanguard Corporation (NYSE: AVD) today announced that it has acquired an established production facility in Marsing, Idaho from Bayer CropScience LP.
This self-contained production facility has the capability to formulate and package a number of active ingredients into finished "flowable" products that are used in a wide variety of crop protection applications. Formerly owned by Gustafson and Crompton Corporation, this operation has a lengthy history of manufacturing many important ingredients that are employed in various seed treatment formulations.
Eric Wintemute, President & CEO of American Vanguard commented, "This production capability will allow AMVAC to expand the range of its offering to customers interested in "on-seed" coating protection. When combined with our extensive line of soil treatment and plant protection products, our customers will now be able to choose from a wider portfolio of pest defense measures, manufactured in AMVAC's highly reliable, domestic production facilities."
The purchase agreement calls for American Vanguard to supply Bayer CropScience for several years with some of the Bayer products currently formulated at the site, facilitating both a seamless transfer of the site's operations to American Vanguard and the transition of that production by Bayer to its own operations. Other specific terms of the transaction were not disclosed.

On April 1, 2008 American Vanguard Corporation issued a press release announcing, among other things, that adverse weather conditions in the midwest would likely affect its financial performance for the quarter ended March 30, 2008. The full text of that press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
The information contained in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including the Exhibits attached hereto, is being furnished under Item 2.02 and shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
 
(d) Exhibits
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, American Vanguard Corporation has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
Newport Beach, CA  April 1, 2008  American Vanguard Corporation (NYSE: AVD), today announced that adverse mid-west weather conditions will likely cause first quarter 2008 performance to be below that of the prior year first quarter. While sales are expected to approach prior year levels, earnings will likely be impacted by higher incremental costs associated with several important new growth initiatives.
Eric Wintemute, President and CEO of American Vanguard, stated, "As has been widely reported, over-abundant rainfall and continued cold temperatures have significantly affected preparation for and implementation of crop planting in large sections of the mid-west Corn Belt. This delay in planting has deferred the drawdown of existing chemical inventories staged in distribution channels and also postponed typical replenishment orders that generally occur during the later weeks of the first quarter. We are confident that as corn planting occurs throughout the Spring, much of our granular corn soil insecticide sales will be recognized in the second quarter of 2008."
Mr. Wintemute added, "As we have highlighted in recent conference calls and on our corporate website, our programs for insect resistance management and corn yield enhancement are both expected to be very significant contributors to our future growth. As corn growers increasingly recognize the critical importance of "refuge acre" compliance (required by the EPA and endorsed by the producers of genetically modified corn seed) and come to appreciate the highly-profitable yield enhancement of using our granular insecticide treatments in conjunction with their genetically modified seeds, American Vanguard is ideally positioned to capitalize on both of these developing trends."
"Additionally, American Vanguard offers an exceptional corn herbicide Impact to complement the traditional widespread use of glyphosate-based weed treatments. This year's inclement weather may result in lighter-than-normal use of pre-emergent herbicides and accentuate the use of post-emergent products such as Impact. Also, an apparent industry-wide (worldwide) shortage of glyphosate may further necessitate the use of alternative herbicides, making Impact a likely beneficiary."
Mr. Wintemute, concluded, "It is important to note that, the non-corn portions of our business are experiencing solid performance in the first quarter and we expect that this year's demand requirements in potatoes, vegetables, fruits, and turf and ornamental should offset the potential for continued softness in the cotton market caused by diminished acreage. We will have further information on first quarter business and financial performance during our quarterly earnings conference call scheduled for May 8, 2008."

2008 First Quarter Financial Highlights  versus  2007 First Quarter
 
 
 
Eric Wintemute, President and CEO of American Vanguard, stated: "As indicated in our business performance update issued on April 1
st
, our first quarter sales were affected by weather related delays in the planting of the 2008 Midwest corn crop. In addition, our earnings have been influenced by escalating raw material and fuel costs as well as expenditures related to several important growth initiatives. We are taking steps to address recent cost increases through pricing and efficiency improvements and are moving ahead with our growth-oriented programs. The benefits of these efforts should be increasingly evident later this year, in calendar 2009 and beyond."
Important first quarter highlights:
 
 
 
 
 
Mr. Wintemute concluded, "Despite weather related delays in first quarter sales, we remain focused on maximizing American Vanguard's financial performance for 2008. Over the next several quarters, increased sales of Impact herbicide, incremental business in PCNB fungicide and Orthene insecticide and our continued international expansion should all be positive contributors. We believe the significant benefits that our products provide for enhancing productivity, improving crop quality, and impeding resistance development bode well for the Company's long-term performance."

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On July 24, 2009 American Vanguard Corporation issued a press release announcing preliminary financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2009. The full text of that press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
The information contained in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including the Exhibit attached hereto, is being furnished under Items 2.02 and 9.01 and shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.
(d) Exhibits
Exhibit 99.1    Press release dated July 24, 2009 of American Vanguard Corporation.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, American Vanguard Corporation has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
Newport Beach, CA  July 24, 2009  American Vanguard Corporation (NYSE:AVD) announced today that its second quarter operating and financial performance has been negatively impacted by recent adverse agricultural industry trends. Delayed and reduced order placement from growers has caused many retail and distributor channels to embrace strict inventory control and adopt a "buy-only-as-needed" purchasing practice. This shrinkage of demand in the distribution inventory pipeline has been the most significant factor influencing American Vanguard's second quarter sales volumes.
The Company's sales were also affected by the second consecutive year of poor Midwest corn planting weather. Quarterly earnings were adversely impacted by both the start-up costs of a new manufacturing process and a production scale-back done for the purpose of inventory management which resulted in a lower absorption of overhead costs. As a result of these factors, American Vanguard's sales for the second quarter will be below those for the second quarter of 2008, and initial analysis indicates an earnings level near "break-even".
While the Company is not providing guidance for the balance of 2009, it should be noted that the product mix of its business changes in the second half of the year to an emphasis on soil fumigants, foliar insecticides and non-agricultural uses such as mosquito control. American Vanguard is a well-positioned market leader in these applications and will continue to pursue important initiatives in corn yield enhancement, professional pest management and international expansion.
American Vanguard expects to release its quarterly results on Thursday, August 6, 2009. Eric Wintemute, President and CEO, Trevor Thorley, EVP & COO and David T. Johnson, CFO, will be conducting a conference call that day to elaborate on the details of the Company's performance. At that time the Company will discuss its cost reduction programs, a continuing Sales & Marketing reorganization, current product development pursuits, and new manufacturing efficiency improvements.

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On August 6, 2009 American Vanguard Corporation issued a press release announcing financial results for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2009. The full text of that press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
The information contained in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including the Exhibit attached hereto, is being furnished under Items 2.02 and 9.01 and shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.

Exhibit 99.1
Newport Beach, CA  August 6, 2009  American Vanguard Corporation (NYSE:AVD), today announced financial results for the second quarter and six month period ended June 30, 2009.
Fiscal 2009 Second Quarter Financial Highlights  versus Fiscal 2008 Second Quarter:
 
 
 
Fiscal 2009 First Half Financial Highlights  versus Fiscal 2008 First Half
 
 
 
Eric Wintemute, President and CEO of American Vanguard, stated: "As previously announced, our financial performance for the second quarter has been severely affected by a very challenging business environment this spring. Growers have delayed and reduced purchases as a result of poor Midwest weather, credit availability concerns, acreage reductions and reduced pest pressure. Such soft demand has led distributors and retailers to invoke strict inventory control procedures and this industry-wide, "buy-only-as-needed", restocking reluctance has contributed to the performance declines of many suppliers of crop protection chemicals. The current shrinkage of the distribution inventory pipeline is the primary contributing factor to our year-over-year quarterly revenue decline and accounts for approximately 2/3 of our year-over-year quarterly decline in net earnings."
"Operationally, we reacted to this reduction in market demand by scaling back our production output in order to refrain from building inventories. While we successfully accomplished our goal, we inevitably experienced the burden of fixed cost absorption associated with these reduced operating rates. This overhead absorption, along with some one-time waste disposal expenses, accounted for approximately 1/3 of our year-over-year quarterly decline in net earnings."
Mr. Wintemute continued: "We feel that our performance this year is unacceptable and we have already begun to undertake corrective actions. These include:
 
 
Mr. Wintemute concluded: "Our organization is focusing its full attention on improving our performance for the balance of 2009 and into the 2010 North American spring planting season. During the second half of the year, we historically capitalize on our leadership strength in soil fumigants, foliar insecticides and mosquito control. We will also be positioning our herbicide and insecticide offerings in corn to gain market share in 2010 with additional university yield enhancement data and other focused promotional initiatives. We will continue our drive for international expansion and introduce additional products in our non-crop segment for professional pest management. We will implement process improvements to better exploit our North American manufacturing capability; we will maintain strict discipline over all spending; and we will continue our focus on strengthening American Vanguard's balance sheet."

Fiscal 2009 Third Quarter Financial Highlights  versus Fiscal 2008 Third Quarter:
 
 
 
Fiscal 2009 Nine Month Financial Highlights  versus Fiscal 2008 Nine Month Results:
 
 
 
Eric Wintemute, President and CEO of American Vanguard, stated: "Amidst challenging conditions in the Ag Chemical marketplace presently, we delivered quarterly sales revenues roughly equal to the same period last year. While some of our product portfolio outperformed the prior year period, we were negatively impacted by diminished sales of two very important seasonal contributors. Reduced demand for our Dibrom mosquito adulticide resulted from less hurricane related precipitation in the Gulf Coast region. Relative to a very strong season in 2008, sales of this highly profitable mosquito eradicator were off by about 70% this year. Additionally, quarterly global sales of our leading fungicide product were about 35% below the prior year, as a result of reduced demand in international markets.
"As we previously reported, we have reacted to recent softness in domestic market demand by scaling back the production output of our manufacturing facilities in order to refrain from building excess inventories. Running factories at reduced operating rates has made it necessary to expense unabsorbed overheads resulting in lower gross profit margins. Indeed, the combination of lower sales of high margin products like Dibrom and the expensing of unabsorbed manufacturing costs has resulted in diminished profitability in the current quarter."
Mr. Wintemute continued: "We have made significant progress toward the balance sheet objectives that we established in our last quarterly report to shareholders. During the current quarter, we reduced inventory levels by over 10%, maintained our diligence in receivables collection and generated sufficient cash to reduce the outstanding balance on our revolving credit line by over 35%."
Mr. Wintemute concluded, "Our organization is focusing its full attention on improving our operating performance, achieving better financial results and strengthening our corporate balance sheet."

The information contained in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including the Exhibit attached hereto, is being furnished under Items 2.02 and 9.01 and shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, American Vanguard Corporation has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
Newport Beach, CA  February 22, 2010  American Vanguard Corporation (NYSE:AVD), today announced that it will report financial results for the 2009 fourth quarter and full year on Monday, March 8, 2010 before the stock market opens. The Company also expects to file its 10-K with the Securities & Exchange Commission not later than March 12, 2010.
Eric Wintemute, President and CEO of American Vanguard, stated: "Challenging industry-wide conditions in the agricultural chemical marketplace during mid & late 2009 resulted in a revenue decline for American Vanguard in the fourth quarter and for the full year. Soft grower demand caused reduced inventory stocking by distributors, which compelled us to curtail our own manufacturing production to deal with this temporary market reality."
"The combination of sluggish sales demand and the impact of unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs have resulted in financial performance well below our expectations during the fourth quarter. We have responded by intensifying our sales & marketing initiatives, reducing costs throughout the Company and accelerating our efforts to develop and introduce new products."
Mr. Wintemute continued: "We are making significant progress on our stated balance sheet objectives. During the final quarter of 2009, we reduced our inventory level by 13% (excluding the write downs and adjustments referenced below), maintained our diligence in receivables collection and generated enough cash to pay down our bank revolver credit facility by over 90%. Additionally, during the year-end assessment of our inventory, we determined that it was appropriate to write down the value of certain items by way of a one time, non-cash charge in the range of $12 million to $15 million. This charge arises primarily from the effect of unabsorbed manufacturing overhead activity, net realizable value assessments of slow-moving and obsolete inventory, and finally, other annual adjustments to ensure that our standard costs continue to closely reflect actual manufacturing cost. This charge is expected to have an after-tax impact of $7 million to $9 million and lead to a quarterly loss of between $.25 and $.33 per share."
Mr. Wintemute concluded, "Our management team is concentrating its full attention on improving our operating performance through organizational upgrades, streamlined manufacturing processes, administrative cost constraint and an enhanced emphasis on the introduction of new products. These important initiatives will be discussed during our March 8
th
conference call. We are positioning ourselves to capitalize on improvements in the marketplace while maintaining our focus on balance sheet strength."

Exhibit 99.1
Newport Beach, CA  March 8, 2010  American Vanguard Corporation (NYSE:AVD), today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2009.
Fiscal 2009 Fourth Quarter Financial Highlights  versus Fiscal 2008 Fourth Quarter:
 
Fiscal 2009 Financial Highlights  versus Fiscal 2008 Results:
 
Net Income and Earnings per share results for the Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2009 reflect the inclusion of a one-time, non-cash charge of $13.5 million taken to adjust the inventories of American Vanguard at December 31, 2009.
*
Eric Wintemute, President and CEO of American Vanguard, stated: "Challenging industry-wide conditions in the agricultural chemical marketplace during mid & late 2009 resulted in our revenue declines of 29% in the fourth quarter and 12% for the full year. Like many of our peers, we were negatively impacted in the quarter and the full year by unfavorable weather and by the continued reluctance of distributor channels to stock inventory for the upcoming 2010 spring planting season."
"This drop in end-use demand and our determination not to over-accumulate our own inventories compelled us to run our factories at reduced operating rates, which invariably translated into higher unit costs and lower gross profit margins. The combination of sluggish sales demand and the impact of unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs have resulted in financial performance well below our expectations. We have responded by intensifying our sales & marketing initiatives, reducing costs throughout the Company and accelerating our efforts to develop and introduce new products."
"Additionally, during the year-end assessment of our inventory, we determined that it was appropriate to write down the value of certain items by way of a one time, non-cash charge of $13.5 million. This charge arises primarily from the effect of unabsorbed manufacturing overhead activity, net realizable value assessments of slow-moving and obsolete inventory, and finally, other annual adjustments to ensure that our standard costs continue to closely reflect actual manufacturing cost."
Mr. Wintemute concluded: "Throughout this difficult period, we have made significant progress toward improving our balance sheet by reducing inventory levels, generating cash and paying down our bank revolver debt. In addition, we have secured an amendment to our senior credit facility which includes adjusted covenants that should serve to provide the necessary flexibility in meeting our working capital needs over the course of 2010. We are well positioned to benefit from improving market conditions and our organization is well-focused and highly motivated to improve our operating performance, achieve better financial results and maintain our corporate balance sheet strength."
Conference Call
Eric Wintemute, President & CEO, Trevor Thorley, EVP & COO and David T. Johnson, VP & CFO, will conduct a conference call focusing on the financial results at 12:00 pm ET / 9:00 am PT on Monday, March 8, 2010.

On May 6, 2010 American Vanguard Corporation issued a press release announcing financial results for the three month period ended March 31, 2010. The full text of that press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
The information contained in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including the Exhibit attached hereto, is being furnished under Items 2.02 and 9.01 and shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.

Exhibit 99.1
Newport Beach, CA  May 6, 2010  American Vanguard Corporation (NYSE:AVD), today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2010.
Fiscal 2010 First Quarter Financial Highlights  versus Fiscal 2009 First Quarter
 
 
 
Eric Wintemute, President and CEO of American Vanguard, stated: "Our first quarter year-over-year sales growth reflects improved conditions in the U.S. agricultural sector and the intense focus of our sales and marketing team. The farm credit difficulties and distributor inventory retrenchment of 2009 have moderated and improved weather conditions have resulted in more normal planting patterns. Additionally, the 2010 resurgence in cotton and peanut acreage represents a very positive development for us given the strong product offering that we have for those crops."
"Our Company maintained the focused financial discipline on inventory and receivables that we have exercised effectively since the second half of 2009. Our inventory levels ended at $74.3 million, $38.2 million lower as compared to $112.5 million last year. Our receivables were $10.5 million lower, at $53.3 million, as compared to $63.8 million last year, even with increased sales. Overall, these key drivers have resulted in a decrease in debt, which is down $44.9 million at $70.8 million, from $115.7 million this time last year. It is our intention to continue this focus on balance sheet strength throughout 2010."
Mr. Wintemute concluded, "As we mentioned in our final 2009 performance report, we continue to seek products that can strengthen our portfolio both through acquisition / licensing and via our in-house product development program. We are making good progress on a number of these projects and our future growth potential will be enhanced by these efforts. We expect that the combination of more favorable market conditions, increased demand in several key crops, higher utilization rates in our manufacturing facilities, improved organizational capabilities and judicious financial control will allow American Vanguard to achieve better performance in 2010."

Exhibit 99.1
Newport Beach, CaJuly 21, 2010American Vanguard Corporation (NYSE:AVD) today announced that it has acquired the cotton defoliant product Tribufos (sold under the trade name Def) from Bayer CropScience. The acquisition of Def complements Amvac's existing cotton defoliant product Folex, which it has marketed since 2002.
Def and Folex are fast and effective cotton defoliants that facilitate the removal of leaves surrounding the cotton boll and in combination with other products function as a harvest aid. They enable cotton growers to utilize highly productive mechanical harvesting methods and to optimize their yield regardless of variable weather conditions.
Jim Lehman, National Sales Manager for Amvac commented: "This acquisition strengthens Amvac's broad product offering for cotton growers, which includes our leading cotton insecticides Bidrin, Discipline and Orthene and allows us to capitalize on the 2010 expansion of cotton acreage in the United States. Further, our southern regional sales force, under the leadership of regional manager Scott Hendrix, is well-positioned to promote this new addition to Amvac's product line."

On August 5, 2010 American Vanguard Corporation issued a press release announcing financial results for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2010. The full text of that press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
The information contained in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including the Exhibit attached hereto, is being furnished under Items 2.02 and 9.01 and shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.

Exhibit 99.1
Newport Beach, CA  August 5, 2010  American Vanguard Corporation (NYSE:AVD), today announced financial results for the second quarter and six month period ended June 30, 2010.
Fiscal 2010 Second Quarter Financial Highlights  versus Fiscal 2009 Second Quarter:
 
 
 
Fiscal 2010 First Half Financial Highlights  versus Fiscal 2009 First Half
 
 
 
Note: Complete details are available in the financial schedules attached to this press release
Eric Wintemute, President and CEO of American Vanguard, stated: "We are pleased to report performance for the second quarter and the first half of 2010 that reflects improved market conditions and our own focus on continued financial discipline. Better farm credit availability, more favorable weather during Midwest planting, increased cotton and peanut acres and the replenishment of depleted distributor inventories have fueled improved demand for our products. To satisfy this demand, we have increased output at our domestic production facilities, and the resulting higher utilization rates have allowed us to more fully absorb the fixed overhead costs of these sites during the second quarter. While increased manufacturing activity has had a positive effect on gross margins, this effect has been offset somewhat by heavy pricing pressure on our three generic product lines."
Mr. Wintemute continued: "In keeping with our promise to strengthen and maintain a healthy balance sheet, we have controlled our inventories very judiciouslywith only a slight $2 million expansion during the spring season when inventory increases are traditionally much more significant. Our management of working capital and continuing cash generation have allowed us to steadily pay down our debt. Additionally, during the quarter, we added Wells Fargo bank to our lending syndicate (led by Bank of the West) which continues to support and encourage the growth of our business."
Mr. Wintemute concluded: "We will continue to pursue the acquisition of appropriately-priced, branded products, similar to our recent purchase of the cotton defoliant Def from Bayer CropScience, as we assemble a broader product offering in key crops. In the first half of next year, we expect to commercialize a superior potato sprout inhibitor, called SmartBlock, which will emerge from our new product development program. We believe that adding high-value/high-margin products to our portfolio, focusing our sales and marketing organization on customer needs, and maintaining financial discipline, will continue to be important elements of our success."
Conference Call
Eric Wintemute, President & CEO and David T. Johnson, VP & CFO, will conduct a conference call focusing on the financial results at 12:00 pm EDT / 9:00 am PDT on Thursday, August 5, 2010.

On August 27, 2010, American Vanguard Corporation issued a press release announcing that it had filed an action with the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against the United States Environmental Protection Agency for relief from a stop sale order (issued by that agency) relating to the company's fungicide product line. The full text of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
The information contained in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including the Exhibit attached hereto, is being furnished under Items 8.01 and 9.01 and shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, American Vanguard Corporation has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
Newport Beach, CA  August 27, 2010  American Vanguard Corporation (NYSE:AVD) today announced it has filed an action against the United States Environmental Protection Agency ("USEPA") in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia seeking emergency and injunctive relief from a Stop Sale, Use or Removal Order that USEPA recently issued relating to the company's USEPA-registered pentachloronitrobenzene (PCNB) product line. The company's wholly-owned subsidiary, Amvac Chemical Corporation, manufactures, distributes and sells PCNB as a fungicide for use primarily on turf with the bulk of sales occurring in September and October.
The agency issued the stop sale order on the ground that it thought the company did not identify trace impurities in the product in a submission to the agency called a confidential statement of formula ("CSF"). The company believes that the stop sale order is without merit and that, in fact, the agency has known about these impurities for nearly 20 years and has never made a determination that these impurities (which the agency now claims could be of toxicological significance) had to be identified on the CSF. The order does not allege that the presence of these impurities creates any risk to human health or the environment. The company hopes to successfully work through these technical issues with the agency, as it has on other issues in the past, but does not believe the law allows the agency to stop sales of this approved product before due process has been afforded the company.
Eric Wintemute, President & Chief Executive Officer of the company, said, "We were surprised and disappointed to have received this order without advance warning just as our main selling season is starting. We believe that the order has no defensible legal basis and have been working without success with the agency to try to effect an informal resolution. However, at this point, we have no choice but to take legal action in order to protect our business." Mr. Wintemute added, "We appreciate our customers' continued support as we work through this issue with the agency." The company expects to receive a ruling from the court on its motion for a temporary restraining order within the week and will report on that ruling when received.

Exhibit 99.1
Newport Beach, CA  September 3, 2010  American Vanguard Corporation (NYSE:AVD) today announced that the United States District Court for the District of Columbia has denied the Company's motion for emergency and injunctive relief from a Stop Sale, Use or Removal Order that had been issued by the United States Environmental Protection Agency relating to the Company's USEPA-registered pentachloronitrobenzene (PCNB) product line. The Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, Amvac Chemical Corporation, manufactures, distributes and sells PCNB as a fungicide for use primarily on turf with the bulk of sales occurring in September and October.
The agency issued the stop sale order without warning on the ground that the company did not identify trace impurities in the product in a submission to the agency called a confidential statement of formula ("CSF"), despite the fact that the agency was otherwise made aware of these impurities nearly 20 years ago and that, in the Company's view, the agency never determined that the impurity had to be listed on the CSF. In its motion for relief and in oral argument, the Company argued that the law does not permit the agency to stop sales of an approved product before giving the registrant due process. Although temporary relief was denied, the Company remains free to seek a preliminary injunction against USEPA.
Eric Wintemute, President & Chief Executive Officer of the company, said, "We are very disappointed with the court's ruling. Not only does it put our domestic PCNB business at a standstill, but it lends credence to the issuance of a stop sale order that is inconsistent with USEPA's own policies on transparency, amounts to a denial of due process, and creates a bad precedent with responsible registrants. We will, of course, continue to work expeditiously with USEPA to get the stop sale order lifted as soon as possible. At the same time, we intend to seek relief from the court by way of a preliminary injunction." Mr. Wintemute added, "Given that the situation with USEPA remains fluid, we are still assessing what effect the stop sale might have on our financial performance for the balance of the year. We will report on those effects as we obtain greater clarity on the issue."

Fiscal 2010 Nine Month Financial Highlights  versus Fiscal 2009 Nine Month Results:
 
 
 
Eric Wintemute, President and CEO of American Vanguard, stated: "We are pleased to report continuing improvement in our 2010 performance as stronger end-use demand and rising commodity prices have created a more attractive market this year. American Vanguard has already benefited from increased acreage in domestic cotton, where our strong market position in insecticides and harvest defoliants, have contributed significantly to our third quarter results. Similarly, we are poised to take advantage of a bullish corn market with our many soil insecticides and Impact herbicide over the next few quarters."
Mr. Wintemute continued: "During the current period, we have continued our emphasis on operational and financial discipline by restraining inventory level and maintaining a strong focus on control of overall debt levels which are more than $27 million lower than the same time one year ago. More importantly, we recorded improved financial performance despite the stop sale order that has halted domestic sales of our leading fungicide PCNB. Obviously, we would have had even stronger results in the quarter had the stop sale order been removed. We continue to do everything in our power to obtain relief so that we can resume domestic sales of what we continue to believe is a safe, economical and effective specialty product."
Mr. Wintemute concluded: "Our entire organization is focused on market penetration, product profitability, operating efficiency, cost/expense management and maintaining balance sheet strength. Following on the heals of our acquisition of the cotton defoliant Def from Bayer CropScience and the distribution agreement that we secured for the soil fumigant Basamid, our Business Development team continues to pursue several product acquisition opportunities that could add significantly to our portfolio offering in future periods. We believe that we are well positioned to capitalize on improving market conditions."

AMVAC Chemical Corporation ("AMVAC"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of American Vanguard Corporation, entered into two definitive Sale and Purchase Agreements (the "Agreements") dated December 7, 2010 with Bayer CropScience Aktiengesellschaft ("Bayer"). Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Agreements, Bayer agreed to sell, and AMVAC agreed to purchase, assets constituting the insect product lines Mocap (globally) and Nemcur (globally except for Europe and Argentina); these assets include the active ingredient ethoprophos and fenamiphos, the trademarks Mocap, Nemacur, and Ultima, registrations and registration data, certain rights relating to manufacturing and formulation know-how, intellectual property rights and inventories as well as assets relating to Bayer's Ultima closed delivery system.
The information contained in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including the Exhibit attached hereto, is being furnished under Items 1.01, 2.01, 8.01 and 9.01 and shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
 
On December 7, 2010, AMVAC completed the acquisition of certain assets constituting the Mocap and Nemacur insecticide product lines from Bayer. The assets purchased by AMVAC are described in the disclosure under Item 1.01 above, which is incorporated herein by reference. The purchase price consideration (which was not disclosed) was determined by arms' length negotiation between the parties. The parties have been involved in several commercial transactions over the past 10 years, the most recent of which was AMVAC's acquisition of the tribufos product line from Bayer on July 21, 2010, as reported in the Company's Form 8-K filed as of July 26, 2010.
 
On December 13, 2010, American Vanguard Corporation issued a press release announcing that AMVAC had entered into the Agreements and completed the acquisition of the Mocap and Nemacur product lines as more fully described above. The full text of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
(d) Exhibits
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, American Vanguard Corporation has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
Newport Beach, California  December 13, 2010 - American Vanguard Corporation (NYSE:AVD), today announced that its wholly-owned subsidiary, Amvac Chemical Corporation, has completed the acquisition of two insecticide product lines from Bayer CropScience, LLC. The first includes the global product line relating to the active ingredient Ethoprophos (sold under the trade name Mocap) and the second includes the global (except for Europe and Argentina) product line Fenamiphos (sold under the trade name Nemacur). Both product lines include registrations and data rights, rights relating to manufacturing and formulation know-how, inventories, the Ultima packaging system and the trademarks Mocap, Nemacur and Ultima. Other terms of the transaction were not released.
Mocap is a leading soil insecticide that is registered in 50 countries where it is used to combat many nematode species in a wide range of crops. Nemacur is a leading soil insecticide that is registered in 30 countries for use primarily as a nematicide with additional efficacy against above-ground sucking insects.
Mocap and Nemacur are well-positioned in many high-valued fruit and vegetable crops, allowing them to achieve very attractive profitability. They can help professional crop protection users replace less desirable soil fumigants (such as methyl bromide), and are a powerful tool against resistance development in numerous soil insect species. Each of these products has a well-recognized global brand identity and well-established worldwide distribution channels.
Eric Wintemute, President and CEO of American Vanguard, stated: "We are very pleased to be able to add Mocap and Nemacur to our already extensive insecticide product portfolio. As the "products of choice" in many specialized crop applications, Mocap and Nemacur have enjoyed an attractive competitive position and excellent profitability for many years. We feel that our considerable expertise with insecticidal products will allow us to expand on the success that has been achieved under the excellent stewardship of Bayer CropScience."
Mr. Wintemute continued: "In light of the fact that the majority of Mocap and Nemacur sales occur outside the United States, these products help American Vanguard to further our strategic goal of international expansion." He concluded: "These transactions and others that we are pursuing underscore the importance that we attribute to product portfolio enhancement and effective operational arrangements. Interacting with our industry peers to expand our product offering, achieve manufacturing efficiencies and distribute products effectively to a global marketplace is an important objective of American Vanguard. We look forward to consummating additional value-adding transactions in the near future."

On December 20, 2010, the Company issued a press release announcing that its wholly-owned subsidiary, AMVAC Chemical Corporation, had completed the acquisition of the Aztec insecticide product line from Bayer CropScience AG. A complete copy of that press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
 
 
Exhibit 99.1 Press release dated December 20, 2010 of American Vanguard Corporation.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, American Vanguard Corporation has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
Newport Beach, California  December 20, 2010American Vanguard Corporation (NYSE:AVD), today announced that its wholly-owned subsidiary, Amvac Chemical Corporation, has completed the acquisition of a global product line relating to the active ingredient Tebupirimfos (sold in the United States under the trade name Aztec) from Bayer CropScience AG. The acquisition includes registrations and data rights, rights relating to manufacturing and formulation know-how, inventories, and the trademarks Aztec, Azteca and Capinda. Other terms of the transaction were not released.
Aztec is a leading soil insecticide that is registered in the United States and Mexico where it is used to combat rootworm, cutworm, wireworm, seedcorn maggots & beetles and white grub in a variety of corn crops. Additionally, it is also registered in South Korea (and sold under the trade name Capinda) for use primarily in vegetable crops such as Chinese cabbage and ginseng. Aztec has a well-recognized brand identity and a proven track record of providing consistent and dependable control of a broad spectrum of yield robbing soil insects.
Eric Wintemute, President and CEO of American Vanguard, stated: "We are very pleased to be able to add the Bayer CropScience portion of global Aztec sales to our already extensive corn soil insecticide product offering. We are very familiar and experienced with this product since we have been marketing the concentrated 4.67G granular form of Aztec through our SmartBox closed delivery system for the last 10 years. With its effective combination of two active ingredients, Aztec has demonstrated excellent product performance and has earned considerable brand loyalty while gaining a significant market share with corn growers in the US."
Mr. Glen Johnson, Senior VP & Director of Business Development added: "This product has also been shown to be beneficial to growers in high pest pressure areas who are planting genetically modified corn seed hybrids designed to defend against the corn rootworm. Several hundred grower trials produced results which show that using Aztec in conjunction with GMO corn seed can increase yields by an average of 7 bushels per acre. Given the modest cost of this protective input, the economic benefit of this yield enhancement is very attractive to corn growers, particularly as corn commodity prices rise."
Mr. Wintemute continued: "With this addition, Amvac will be positioned to provide the most comprehensive array of products and delivery systems for combating soil insects in corn. With our Counter for nematode control, our SmartChoice dual active ingredient insecticide and now our offering of the full Aztec product line, along with the sophistication of the computer controlled SmartBox application equipment, Amvac is the clear leader in this market segment. As possible rootworm resistance develops to genetic defenses and secondary insects continue to pose a larger threat, this franchise will be the method-of-choice for growers who want to achieve the highest possible yields."
Mr. Wintemute concluded: "It is clear from our recent addition of 4 significant new products (cotton defoliant Def; nematicides Mocap & Nemacur; soil insecticide Aztec) that the market for such acquisitions has once again become much more attractive. When chosen wisely, these new additions can solidify niche market leadership, extend our international platform and increase Amvac manufacturing utilization rates to fully absorb fixed costs. These branded products mesh well with our existing product offering, have attractive profitability and have been acquired for a very reasonable investment. It is encouraging that we see significant additional opportunities on the horizon and American Vanguard is well positioned to capitalize on them."

As of January 10, 2011, AMVAC Chemical Corporation ("AMVAC"), one of our subsidiaries, as borrower, and affiliates (including registrant), as guarantors, entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the "New Credit Agreement") with a group of commercial lenders led by Bank of the West (AMVAC's primary bank) as agent, swing line lender and L/C issuer. The New Credit Agreement supersedes the First Amendment to Credit Agreement ("First Amendment") dated as of March 5, 2010 and more fully described in the Company's Form 8-K filed on March 8, 2010. The New Credit Agreement is a $137 million senior secured lending facility consisting of a revolving line of credit of $75 million and term loan commitments of $62 million. Also included in the facility is an accordion feature for up to $50 million. AMVAC has had a banking relationship with its primary bank for over 30 years.
 
On January 10, 2011, AMVAC, as borrower, and its affiliates, as guarantors, terminated the First Amendment concurrent with entry into the New Credit Agreement (as more fully described in Item 1.01, which is incorporated by reference herein). In connection with that termination, AMVAC paid the entire outstanding balance of the term loans and revolving line of credit plus accrued interest of the First Amendment, using proceeds from the New Credit Facility as more fully described in Item 2.03 below, which is incorporated by reference herein.
 
In connection with retiring the entire outstanding balance of the term loans and revolving credit facility (plus accrued interest) of the First Amendment upon termination thereof, on January 10, 2011, AMVAC borrowed approximately $62 million under the New Credit Facility consisting of approximately $62 million in term loans and $0 from the revolving line of credit. These loans bear interest at a variable rate of interest based on LIBOR and the Eurodollar Reserve of the Federal Reserve ("Eurodollar Rate Loan"), or, at Amvac's option, a variable rate of interest based upon the prime rate, the Federal Funds rate, and LIBOR ("Alternative Base Rate Loan"). The principal payments of the term loans are payable (a) in equal quarterly installments on or before the last business day of each March, June, September and December (i) through 2012 in the amount of $2 million, and (ii) thereafter through December 2015 in the amount of $2.5 million, and (b) the remainder, if any, not later than January 10, 2016. Interest accruing on the Eurodollar Rate Loans is payable on the last day of the interest period, which may be one, three or six months, as per borrower's election. Interest accruing on the Alternate Base Rate Loans is payable monthly, in arrears, on the last day of the month and on the maturity date of any such loan in the amount of interest then accrued but unpaid. Both the senior secured revolving line of credit and the term loans mature on January 10, 2016 and contain certain covenants (with which AMVAC is in compliance) as defined in the New Credit Agreement.
The information contained in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including the Exhibits attached hereto, is being furnished under Items 1.01, 1.02, 2.03, 8.01 and 9.01 and shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.

2.12 Payments Generally; Agent's Clawback.
General
 
(b) (i) . Unless Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Loans (or, in the case of any Borrowing of Alternate Base Rate Loans, prior to 12:00 noon on the date of such Borrowing) that such Lender will not make available to Agent such Lender's share of such Borrowing, Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with (or, in the case of a Borrowing of Alternate Base Rate Loans, that such Lender has made such share available in accordance with and at the time required by ) and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to Agent, then the applicable Lender and Borrower agrees to pay to Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by Agent in connection with the foregoing and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Alternate Base Rate Loans.

If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in such Borrowing. Any payment by Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to Agent.
Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Agent

Section 2.02
(ii) . Unless Agent shall have received notice from Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to Agent for the account of the Lenders or the L/C Issuer hereunder that Borrower will not make such payment, Agent may assume that Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to Lenders or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of Lenders or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.

2.13 Sharing of Payments
 
the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the applicable Loans and subparticipations in L/C Obligations or Swing Line Loans of the other Lenders, as the case may be, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the applicable Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans and other amounts owing them; that:
provided
(i) if any such participations or subparticipations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations or subparticipations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and
(ii) the provisions of this Section shall not be construed to apply to (x) any payment made by Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or (y) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or subparticipations in L/C Obligations to any assignee or participant, other than to Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof (as to which the provisions of this Section shall apply).

No more than three such requests may be made. At the time of sending such notice, Borrower (in consultation with Agent) shall specify the time period within which each Lender is requested to respond (which shall in no event be less than ten Business Days from the date of delivery of such notice to the Lenders).
Requests for Increase
Incremental Term Commitments
(b) . Each Lender shall notify Agent within such time period whether or not it agrees to increase its Term Commitment and/or Revolving commitment and, if so, the maximum amount by which it is willing to make an Incremental Term Commitment and/or an additional Revolving Commitment. Any Lender not responding within such time period shall be deemed to have declined to make an Incremental Term Commitment and to increase Revolving Commitment. Agent shall notify Borrower and each Lender of the Lenders' responses to each request made hereunder. To achieve the full amount of a requested increase and subject to the approval of Agent (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld), Borrower may also invite additional Eligible Assignees to become Lenders pursuant to a joinder agreement in form and substance satisfactory to Agent and its counsel. If Incremental Term Commitments are made or Revolving Commitments are increased in accordance with this , Agent and Borrower shall determine the effective date (the "") and the final allocation of such increase.

A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to Borrower by a Lender or the L/C Issuer (with a copy to Agent), or by Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or the L/C Issuer, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
Indemnification by Loan Parties
(d) . As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by any Loan Party to a Governmental Authority, such Loan Party shall deliver to Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to Agent.

Article III
Each Guarantor hereby absolutely and unconditionally guarantees to the Guaranteed and Secured Parties the prompt payment and performance when due (whether at its maturity, by lapse of time, by acceleration or otherwise) of the Guaranteed Obligations. This is a guaranty of payment, not of collection. If Borrower defaults in the payment when due of the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof, such Guarantor shall in lawful money of the United States pay on demand, all sums due and owing on such Guaranteed Obligations, including all interest, charges, fees and other sums, costs and expenses.
4.01 Guaranty.
Each Guarantor expressly agrees that until the Guaranteed Obligations are paid and performed in full and each and every term, covenant and condition of this Guaranty is fully performed, such Guarantor shall not be released by or because of: (a) any act or event which might otherwise discharge, reduce, limit or modify such Guarantor's obligations under this Guaranty; (b) any waiver, extension, modification, forbearance, delay or other act or omission of Agent or any Lender or their failure to proceed promptly or otherwise as against Borrower, any Guarantor or any security; (c) any action, omission or circumstance which might increase the likelihood that such Guarantor may be called upon to perform under this Guaranty or which might affect the rights or remedies of such Guarantor as against Borrower; or (d) any dealings occurring at any time between Borrower and any Lender, whether relating to the Guaranteed Obligations or otherwise. Each Guarantor hereby expressly waives and surrenders any defense to its liability under this Guaranty based upon any of the foregoing acts, omissions, agreements, waivers or matters. It is the purpose and intent of this Guaranty that the obligations of each Guarantor under it shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances.
4.02
Guaranty to be Absolute.
 
Each Guarantor authorizes the Guaranteed and Secured Parties to perform any or all of the following acts at any time in their sole discretion, all without notice to such Guarantor and without affecting such Guarantor's obligations under this Guaranty: (a) alter any terms of the Guaranteed Obligations or any part of them, including renewing, compromising, extending or accelerating, or otherwise changing the time for payment of, or increasing or decreasing the rate of interest on, the Guaranteed Obligations or any part of them; (b) take and hold security for the Guaranteed Obligations or this Guaranty, accept additional or substituted security for either, and subordinate, exchange, enforce, waive, release, compromise, fail to perfect and sell or otherwise dispose of any such security; (c) direct the order and manner of any sale of all or any part of any security now or later to be held for the Guaranteed Obligations or this Guaranty, and also bid at any such sale; (d) apply any payments or recoveries from Borrower, any other Guarantor or any other source, and any proceeds of any security, to Borrower's obligations under the Credit Agreement in accordance with the Credit Agreement or, if not so provided therein, in such manner, order and priority as Agent and the Lenders may elect, whether or not those obligations are guaranteed by this Guaranty or secured at the time of the application; (e) release Borrower of its liability for any obligations comprising the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof; (f) substitute, add or release any one or more guarantors or endorsers; and (g) in addition to the extensions of credit accommodations under the Credit Agreement, any Lender may extend other credit to Borrower, and may take and hold security for the credit so extended, all without affecting such Guarantor's liability under this Guaranty.
4.03
Authorized Action.
Each Guarantor waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law: (a) all statutes of limitations as a defense to any action or proceeding brought against such Guarantor by the Guaranteed and Secured Parties; (b) any right it may have to require the Guaranteed and Secured Parties to proceed against Borrower or any Guarantor, proceed against or exhaust any security held from Borrower or any Guarantor, or pursue any other remedy in the Guaranteed and Secured Parties' power to pursue; (c) any defense based on any claim that such Guarantor's obligations exceed or are more burdensome than those of Borrower or any other Guarantor; (d) any defense based on: (i) any legal disability of Borrower or any other Guarantor, (ii) any release, discharge, modification, impairment or limitation of the liability of Borrower or any Guarantor to the Guaranteed and Secured Parties from any cause, whether consented to by the Guaranteed and Secured Parties or arising by operation of law or from any Debtor Relief Laws and (iii) any rejection or disaffirmance of the Guaranteed Obligations, or any part thereof, or any security held therefor, pursuant to any such Debtor Relief Laws; (e) any defense based on any action taken or omitted by the Guaranteed and Secured Parties in any Debtor Relief Law proceeding involving Borrower or any Guarantor, including any election to have the claims of the Guaranteed and Secured Parties allowed as being secured, partially secured or unsecured, any extension of credit by the Guaranteed and Secured Parties to Borrower or any Guarantor in any such proceeding, and the taking and holding by Agent or any Lender of any security for any such extension of credit; (f) all presentments, demands for performance, notice of intention to accelerate, notice of acceleration, notices of nonperformance, protests, notices of protest, notices of dishonor, notices of acceptance of this Guaranty and of the existence, creation, or incurring of new or additional indebtedness, and demands and notices of every kind; and (g) any defense based on or arising out of any defense that Borrower or any Guarantor may have to the payment or performance of the Guaranteed Obligations or any part of them.
4.04 Guarantors' Waivers.
(a) Upon a default by Borrower, the Guaranteed and Secured Parties, in their sole discretion, without prior notice to or consent of the Guarantors, may elect to: (i) foreclose either judicially or nonjudicially against any real or personal property security it may hold for the Guaranteed Obligations, (ii) accept a transfer of any such security in lien of foreclosure, (iii) compromise or adjust the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof or make any other accommodation with Borrower or any Guarantor, or (iv) exercise any other remedy against Borrower, any Guarantor or any security. No such action by the Guaranteed and Secured Parties shall release or limit the liability of the Guarantors, who shall remain liable under this Guaranty after the action, even if the effect of the action is to deprive the Guarantors of any subrogation rights, rights of indemnity, or other rights to collect reimbursement from Borrower or any Guarantor for any sums paid to the Guaranteed and Secured Parties, whether contractual or arising by operation of law or otherwise. Each Guarantor expressly agrees that under no circumstances shall it be deemed to have any right, title, interest or claim in or to any real or personal property to be held by the Guaranteed and Secured Parties or any third party after any foreclosure or transfer in lieu of foreclosure of any security for the Guaranteed Obligations.
4.05
Waivers of Subrogation and Other Rights.
 
(b) Regardless of whether any Guarantor may have made any payments to the Guaranteed and Secured Parties, each Guarantor forever waives: (i) all rights of subrogation, all rights of indemnity, and any other rights to collect reimbursement from Borrower and any other Guarantor for any sums paid to the Guaranteed and Secured Parties, whether contractual or arising by operation of law (including the Bankruptcy Code or any successor or similar statute) or otherwise, (ii) all rights to enforce any remedy that Agent or any Lender may have against Borrower or any other Guarantor, and (iii) all rights to participate in any security now or later to be held by the Guaranteed and Secured Parties for the Guaranteed Obligations.
The Guaranteed and Secured Parties may, at their election, foreclose on any security held for the Guaranteed Obligations by one or more judicial or nonjudicial sales, or exercise any other right or remedy the Guaranteed and Secured Parties may have against Borrower, or any security, without affecting or impairing in any way the liability of the Guarantors hereunder except to the extent the Guaranteed Obligations have been paid. Each Guarantor unconditionally and irrevocably waives all rights and defenses that such Guarantor may have because the Guaranteed Obligations are or become secured by real property. This means, among other things: (a) the Guaranteed and Secured Parties may collect from the Guarantors without first foreclosing on any real or personal property collateral pledged by Borrower; (b) if the Guaranteed and Secured Parties foreclose on any real property collateral pledged by Borrower: (i) the amount of the Guaranteed Obligations may be reduced only by the price for which that collateral is sold at the foreclosure sale, even if the collateral is worth more than the sale price, and (ii) the Guaranteed and Secured Parties may collect from the Guarantors even if such foreclosure operates, pursuant to applicable law, to impair or extinguish any right of the Guarantors against Borrower or each other. Each Guarantor understands and acknowledges that if the Guaranteed and Secured Parties foreclose judicially or nonjudicially against any real property security for Borrower's obligations, such foreclosure could impair or destroy any right or ability that such Guarantor may have to seek reimbursement, contribution, or indemnification for any amounts paid by such Guarantor under this Guaranty. Each Guarantor further understands and acknowledges that in the absence of this waiver such potential impairment or destruction of such Guarantor's rights, if any, may entitle such Guarantor to assert a defense to this Guaranty based on California Code of Civil Procedure 580d as interpreted in , 265 Cal. App. 2d 40, 71 Cal. Rptr. 64 (1968), on the grounds, among others, that the Guaranteed and Secured Parties should be estopped from pursuing such Guarantor because the Guaranteed and Secured Parties' election to foreclose may have impaired or destroyed such subrogation, reimbursement, contribution, or indemnification rights of such Guarantor. By execution of this Guaranty, each Guarantor intentionally, freely, irrevocably, and unconditionally: (i) waives and relinquishes that defense and agrees that such Guarantor will be liable, on a joint and several basis, under this Guaranty even though the Guaranteed and Secured Parties had foreclosed judicially or nonjudicially against any real or personal property collateral for Borrower's obligations; (ii) agrees that such Guarantor will not assert that defense in any action or proceeding which the Guaranteed and Secured Parties may begin to enforce this Guaranty; and (iii) acknowledges and agrees that the rights and defenses waived by such Guarantor in this Guaranty include any right or defense that such Guarantor may have or be entitled to assert based on or arising out of any one or more of California Code of Civil Procedure 580a, 580b, 580d, or 726, or California Civil Code 2848. Without limiting the foregoing, each Guarantor waives all rights and defenses arising out of an election of remedies by the Guaranteed and Secured Parties, even though that election of remedies, such as nonjudicial foreclosure with respect to security for the Guaranteed Obligations, has destroyed such Guarantor's rights of subrogation and reimbursement against the principal by the operation of Section 580d of the California Code of Civil Procedure. Each Guarantor intentionally, freely, irrevocably and unconditionally waives and relinquishes all rights which may be available to it under any provision of California law or under any California judicial decision, including, without limitation, Section 580a and 726(b) of the California Code of Civil Procedure, to limit the amount of any deficiency judgment or other judgment which may be obtained
4.06 Right to Non-judicially Foreclose.
Union Bank v. Gradsky
 
against such Guarantor under this Guaranty to not more than the amount by which the unpaid Guaranteed Obligations plus all other indebtedness due from Borrower under the Credit Agreement, the other Loan Documents, the Cash Management Agreement and the Permitted Hedge Agreement exceeds the fair market value or fair value of any real or personal property securing said Guaranteed Obligations and any other indebtedness due from the Loan Parties under the Loan Documents, the Cash Management Agreements and the Permitted Hedge Agreements, including, without limitation, all rights to an appraisement of, judicial or other hearing on, or other determination of the value of said property. Each Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that, as a result of the foregoing waiver, the Guaranteed and Secured Parties may be entitled to recover from such Guarantor an amount which, when combined with the value of any real or personal property foreclosed upon by the Guaranteed and Secured Parties (or the proceeds of the sale of which have been received by the Guaranteed and Secured Parties) and any sums collected by the Guaranteed and Secured Parties from Borrower or other persons, might exceed the amount of the Guaranteed Obligations plus all other indebtedness due from Borrower under the Loan Documents, the Cash Management Agreements and the Permitted Hedge Agreements.
If the Guaranteed and Secured Parties are required to pay, return or restore to Borrower or any other Person any amounts previously paid on the Guaranteed Obligations because of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Laws, any stop notice or any other reason, the obligations of the Guarantors shall be reinstated and revived, and the rights of the Guaranteed and Secured Parties shall continue with regard to such amounts, all as though they had never been paid.
4.07 Revival and Reinstatement.
Before signing this Guaranty, each Guarantor investigated the financial condition and business operations of the Loan Parties and such other matters as such Guarantor deemed appropriate to assure itself of each Loan Party's ability to discharge its obligations under the Loan Documents, the Cash Management Agreements and the Permitted Hedge Agreements. Each Guarantor assumes full responsibility for that due diligence, as well as for keeping informed of all matters which may affect Borrower's ability to pay and perform its obligations hereunder. The Guaranteed and Secured Parties do not have any duty to disclose to the Guarantors any information which they may have or receive about Borrower's financial condition, business operations, or any other circumstances bearing on its ability to perform.
4.08 Information Regarding Borrower.
Any rights of the Guarantors, whether now existing or later arising, to receive payment on account of any Indebtedness (including interest) owed to it by Borrower or any subsequent owner of any real property collateral for the Guaranteed Obligations, or to withdraw capital invested by it in Borrower, or to receive distributions from Borrower, shall at all times be subordinate as to Lien and time of payment and in all other respects to the full and prior repayment to the Guaranteed and Secured Parties of the Guaranteed Obligations. Each Guarantor shall not be entitled to enforce or receive payment of any sums hereby subordinated until the Guaranteed Obligations have been paid and performed in full and any such sums received in violation of this Guaranty shall be received by such Guarantor in trust for the Guaranteed and Secured Parties.
4.09 Subordination.
Each Guarantor's obligations under this Guaranty are in addition to its obligations under any other existing or future guaranties, each of which shall remain in full force and effect until it is expressly modified or released in a writing signed by the beneficiary of such other guaranty or guaranties. Each Guarantor's obligations under this Guaranty are independent of those of Borrower on the Guaranteed Obligations. The Guaranteed and Secured Parties may bring a separate action, or commence a separate reference or arbitration proceeding against a Guarantor without first proceeding against Borrower, any other Person or any security that Agent or any Lender may hold, and without pursuing any other remedy. The Guaranteed and Secured Parties rights under this Guaranty shall not be exhausted by any action by the Guaranteed and Secured Parties until the Guaranteed Obligations have been paid and performed in full.

Exhibit 99.1
Newport Beach, CA  March 8, 2011  American Vanguard Corporation (NYSE:AVD), today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2010.
Fiscal 2010 Fourth Quarter Financial Highlights  versus Fiscal 2009 Fourth Quarter:
 
Fiscal 2010 Financial Highlights  versus Fiscal 2009 Results:
 
Net Income and Earnings per share results for the Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2009 reflect the inclusion of a one-time, non-cash charge of $13.5 million taken to adjust the inventories of American Vanguard at December 31, 2009.
*
Eric Wintemute, President and CEO of American Vanguard, stated: "Our 2010 performance reflects a number of improving trends in our business. After coping with the very conservative purchasing patterns of growers and distributors during 2009, we have seen demand for our products improve steadily throughout 2010. Replenishment of depleted channel inventories, expansion of cotton acreage in the U.S., and an increase in our sales & marketing effectiveness has fueled growth in most of our major product categories.
"Compared to the prior year period, sales grew 23% in the fourth quarter and 10% for the full year. Gross profit margins for the year improved to 39% as we focused our sales initiatives on a higher margin product mix and adjusted our manufacturing operations to respond more efficiently to changes in customer demand. We achieved improved overall financial performance despite lost sales and profit opportunities in our PCNB product line attributable to a stop-sale order. On this subject, as you will read in our 10-K filing, the Company continues to work with the EPA to resolve this matter."
Mr. Wintemute continued: "During the year we pursued the acquisition of several prominent branded products that have excellent market positions, solid profit margins and were available at terms that met our investment criteria. Our purchase of the cotton defoliant Def, the insecticides Mocap, Nemacur, Aztec (U.S. bag business) and the soil fumigant Basamid represents the
largest series of product acquisitions in our history. These new product lines should serve to double our international business, improve our factory utilization over the next three years, and contribute positively to our financial profitability. Integration of these new products has begun and will be one of the most important objectives of 2011.
"In 2011 we see many encouraging prospects. The rising level of cotton and corn commodity prices should encourage growers to expand acreage and purchase inputs that enhance yields, which favors American Vanguard's strong market positions in those two crops. The increasing demand for residential & commercial pest protection from numerous insects, particularly the expanding bed-bug epidemic, has stimulated strong interest in our unique Nuvan product line. Our intensified efforts to develop and introduce new products should begin to bear fruit later this year with the expected registration and commercial introduction of our SmartBlock potato sprout inhibitor."
Mr. Wintemute concluded: "American Vanguard is well positioned to benefit from improving market conditions for crop protection and pest control solutions. Our organization is evolving to take full advantage of these opportunities with the hiring of talented new employees who possess the set of skills that the Company needs to succeed. Management remains committed to the financial discipline and debt reduction that has strengthened our balance sheet and we will prudently utilize our recently secured five-year credit facility to facilitate steady, sustainable growth."

On May 4, 2011 American Vanguard Corporation issued a press release announcing its financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2011. The full text of that press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
The information contained in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including the Exhibits attached hereto, is being furnished under Items 2.02 and 9.01 and shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
 
 
Exhibit 99.1         Press release dated May 5, 2011 of American Vanguard Corporation regarding first quarter 2011 results.

Exhibit 99.1
Newport Beach, CA  May 5, 2011  American Vanguard Corporation (NYSE:AVD), today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2011.
Fiscal 2011 First Quarter Financial Highlights  versus Fiscal 2010 First Quarter
 
 
 
Eric Wintemute, President and CEO of American Vanguard, stated: "Our first quarter year-over-year sales growth reflects improved conditions in the U.S. agricultural sector with organic growth accounting for approximately 30% of the increase and incremental business resulting from our recent acquisition of several significant product lines, specifically, Mocap, Nemacur and the Aztec bag business accounting for the balance. Gross profit margins rose to 42% as a result of our sales focus on higher margin products and improved factory utilization rates in certain plants. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales declined to 28% as compared to 32% last year, despite the rising freight costs and regulatory expenses that we had predicted in earlier business reviews."
Mr. Wintemute continued, "The ongoing resurgence in domestic cotton acreage represents a very positive development for us and contributed to excellent quarterly sales of our premier cotton insecticide Bidrin. Pre-planting positioning of our corn soil insecticides Aztec and SmartChoice were also very strong in the quarter. As mentioned in our last conference call, demand for secondary insect & nematicidal control is steadily increasing both domestically and internationally which benefits our strong portfolio of such products as Counter, Mocap and Nemacur."
Mr. Wintemute concluded, "In 2011, we see more favorable conditions that should serve to enhance our performance. Increased demand for food and feed, fiber and fuel (ethanol as an additive) play to our strength in cotton, corn and a broad range of fruit & vegetable crops. Rising sales should lead to greater factory throughput, more efficient manufacturing operating rates, and a lower level of unabsorbed fixed costs. These factors, combined with improved organizational capabilities and judicious financial control, should allow American Vanguard to achieve better operating and financial performance in 2011."

Item 8.01 Other Events
On June 21, 2011, American Vanguard Corporation issued a press release announcing a crop protection collaboration with Monsanto Company. The full text of that press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
The information contained in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including the Exhibit attached hereto, is being furnished under Items 8.01 and 9.01 and shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.
(d) Exhibits
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, American Vanguard Corporation has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
Newport Beach, CA  June 21, 2011 - American Vanguard Corporation (NYSE:AVD) today announced that its wholly-owned subsidiary Amvac Chemical Corporation has entered into an agreement with Monsanto Company (NYSE: MON) to co-market its post-emergent corn herbicide Impact as part of the Roundup Ready PLUS weed management platform. Impact complements Monsanto's Roundup PowerMAX and Roundup WeatherMAX herbicides by improving the control of a number of broadleaf weeds. Under this multi-year agreement, Impact will be listed as an endorsed product in the program and promoted by both companies as the qualifying post-emergent Roundup agricultural herbicide tank-mix product supported by Monsanto's extensive Corn Incentives Program in the United States.
Monsanto's Roundup Ready PLUS platform allows farmers to fully utilize the benefits of their Roundup Ready crops by using the best practice recommendations for weed management and receiving financial incentives for using many of the products in the program. The Roundup Ready PLUS platform is designed to provide recommendations of effective, economical and sustainable weed control products for farmers.
Weed scientists recommend that farmers use multiple mechanisms of action when managing weeds on their farm. Impact's active ingredient, topramezone, is an HPPD inhibitor herbicide that provides an effective tool in weed resistance management.
Eric Wintemute, Chairman & CEO of American Vanguard stated: "We are very pleased to be partnering with the clear leader in glyphosate herbicides. This program will allow growers to preserve the moisture and nutrients in their soil that would otherwise be consumed by many of these hard-to-control / glyphosate resistant broadleaf weeds. This collaborative engagement provides Amvac with the opportunity for expanded sales of its high-performance Impact herbicide; provides Monsanto with even more effective and comprehensive herbicide control for its Roundup brand herbicides; and most importantly, provides our mutual customers, the U.S. corn grower, with the potential for maximum yield enhancement."
"We are pleased to announce the addition of Impact as a post-emergent corn herbicide to our Roundup Ready PLUS Corn Incentives Program," said Tyler Hackstadt, Monsanto's Selective Chemistry Portfolio Manager. "This agreement creates value and choice for farmers using the Roundup Ready PLUS system by offering another tool to effectively manage weeds on their farm. We believe this partnership further confirms our commitment to offer the best weed management recommendations to growers that will help them proactively use residual herbicides and multiple modes of action, and at the same time, optimize their potential for weed control and achieve maximum yield."
Under the agreement, Monsanto will license its Roundup Ready PLUS trademarks for use on Impact and co-market Amvac's post-emergent corn herbicide Impact as part of the Roundup Ready PLUS weed management program. Financial terms of the agreement were not disclosed.

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On August 4, 2011 American Vanguard Corporation issued a press release announcing its financial results for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2011. The full text of that press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
The information contained in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including the Exhibits attached hereto, is being furnished under Items 2.02 and 9.01 and shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.
(d) Exhibits
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, American Vanguard Corporation has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
Newport Beach, CA  August 4, 2011  American Vanguard Corporation (NYSE:AVD), today announced financial results for the second quarter and six month period ended June 30, 2011.
Fiscal 2011 Second Quarter Financial Highlights  versus Fiscal 2010 Second Quarter:
 
 
 
Fiscal 2011 First Half Financial Highlights  versus Fiscal 2010 First Half
 
 
 
Note: Complete details are available in the financial schedules attached to this press release
Eric Wintemute, Chairman and CEO of American Vanguard, stated: "We are pleased to report performance for the second quarter and the first half of 2011 that reflects the successful execution of our corporate strategy for product portfolio extension, geographic expansion and consistent financial discipline. Strong crop commodity prices have stimulated U.S. agricultural demand in corn, cotton, and a wide variety of other crops, fueling increased purchases of our well-positioned productivity and yield enhancing products. Additionally, we have expanded our international sales penetration driven by the Mocap and Nemacur product acquisitions that we completed in December 2010."
Mr. Wintemute continued: "In keeping with our promise to strengthen and maintain a healthy balance sheet, we have continued to control our inventory levels and carefully maintain our receivable collections performance. In fact, our management of working capital and continuing cash generation provides us with the opportunity to use our positive cash balance for possible debt reduction, dividend payments, product acquisitions or other corporate purposes in the months ahead. Also, during the quarter we were pleased to announce a significant agreement with Monsanto for the co-marketing of our post-emergent corn herbicide Impact in conjunction with their Roundup glyphosate brands. The weed management benefits of this combination of two market leading brands will be promoted by both companies and should expand the sales of Impact over the next several years."
Mr. Wintemute concluded: "We have maintained focus on our gross profit margins by consistently emphasizing profitability in our sales and marketing efforts resulting in an improvement from 37% to 40%. This year our overall manufacturing operations have experienced higher utilization rates resulting in improved coverage of facility fixed costs. We continue to seek the acquisition of appropriately-priced, branded products, similar to our 2010 purchases, as we expand our product offering in key crops. In our product development program, we expect our new potato sprout inhibitor SmartBlock to become commercial during the first half of 2012. By adding high-value/high-margin products to our portfolio, focusing our sales and marketing priorities, achieving greater manufacturing efficiencies and diligently maintaining financial discipline, we expect to continue profitably expanding our global business."

Exhibit 99.1
Newport Beach, CA  August 19, 2011  American Vanguard Corporation (NYSE:AVD) today announced that the Chief Judge for the United States District Court for the District of Columbia has granted the Company's motion for summary judgment and vacated the Stop Sale, Use or Removal Order that had been issued in August 2010 by the United States Environmental Protection Agency relating to the Company's USEPA-registered pentachloronitrobenzene (PCNB) product line. The Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, Amvac Chemical Corporation, manufactures, distributes and sells PCNB as a fungicide for use primarily on turf.
The company's motion sought relief on various grounds, including denial of due process. In reaching its decision, the court found that the agency official who signed the SSURO lacked the authority to issue such an order. Because SSURO was invalid on this ground, the court did not address AMVAC's other challenges. The court remanded the matter to the USEPA for any further proceedings as it may deem appropriate.
Eric Wintemute, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company said, "We are, of course, pleased with the court's decision. This has been a long and trying process which appears to be coming to a conclusion. We are now focused on working with the USEPA to get our amended end-use labels for PCNB products issued as quickly as possible, so that we can return to the market." Mr. Wintemute concluded, "We are also grateful to our customers for their continued support and patience throughout this ordeal and hope to be in a position to meet their needs in the very near future."

Eric Wintemute, Chairman and CEO of American Vanguard, stated, "We are pleased to declare this semi-annual dividend, which continues our 16 year history of providing such returns to our shareholders. Through this dividend, we are giving investors a share in our excellent first-half-year financial results. We appreciate our investors' continued support and confidence in the Company, despite very trying conditions in both the market and the global economy." Mr. Wintemute continued, "As an additional vote of confidence in the Company, our Board has also authorized share repurchases. As we have seen from recent history, current market conditions can cause unpredictable price fluctuations that bear little correlation to a company's true value. Through the repurchase of our common stock, we will invest excess cash in our own enterprise when we perceive that the stock is undervalued. As we continue to generate cash, we will look to fund further debt reduction, growth through acquisition, and, where circumstances warrant it, the repurchase of our shares, which we believe to be a sound investment."

Exhibit 99.1 Press release dated October 21, 2011 of American Vanguard Corporation.
Exhibit 99.2 Press release dated October 27, 2011 of American Vanguard Corporation.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, American Vanguard Corporation has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
Newport Beach, CA  October 21, 2011  American Vanguard Corporation (NYSE:AVD) today announced that its wholly owned subsidiary Amvac Chemical Corporation has acquired the international assets of the cotton defoliant product tribufos (sold under the trade name Def) from Bayer CropScience. The acquisition of this international segment completes Amvac's July 2010 purchase of Bayer's domestic tribufos product line and complements the Company's existing tribufos product Folex, which it has marketed since 2002. The acquired product is registered for use in Mexico, Argentina, Costa Rica and Colombia.
Folex is a fast and effective cotton defoliant that facilitates the removal of leaves surrounding the cotton boll and in combination with other products functions as a harvest aid. It enables cotton growers to utilize highly productive mechanical harvesting methods and to optimize their yield regardless of variable weather conditions present at harvest time.
Alfredo Pelaez, Amvac's Director of International Sales commented: "This acquisition strengthens Amvac's access to the international cotton market particularly in the Central and South American regions. We will be increasing our direct selling efforts in Mexico, expanding our distribution in Argentina, and beginning to develop our participation in the substantial cotton growing market of Brazil."
Glen Johnson, Amvac's Senior VP and Director of Business & Product Development added: "The addition of this product to our portfolio is another example of our continuing effort to broaden our product offering and expand our geographic footprint. We will also benefit from manufacturing this product in our Axis, Alabama plant, as we systematically increase the utilization of that facility with the additional production of several recently acquired products. With such acquisitions we expect to capitalize on the expansion of cotton acreage in the United States and elsewhere in the world, as global demand and rising commodity prices encourage a greater focus on cultivating this essential crop."

Exhibit 99.2
Newport Beach, Ca  October 27, 2011American Vanguard Corporation (NYSE:AVD) today announced that its wholly owned subsidiary AMVAC Chemical Corporation has licensed the rights to two recently issued U.S. patents from Summerdale Incorporated (Verona, Wisconsin, USA). This exclusive licensing agreement grants AMVAC worldwide rights to develop patented products for pre-harvest and post-harvest commercial crop protection uses as fungicides, sanitizers, desiccants and/or harvest aids. One of the lead candidates, AMV4024, has been in development for more than three years, and shows good potential as a broad-spectrum bio-fungicide. In addition, another candidate, AMV5680 is also being tested as a crop desiccant aid. Other lead compounds may be evaluated for further development as sanitizers or for other post-harvest uses.
Glen Johnson, AMVAC's Senior VP and Director of Business & Product Development commented: "Securing these valuable licensing rights allows us to develop a broad range of products in different market segments and will continue to expand AMVAC's biopesticide product line into the future. AMVAC's green portfolio began with the acquisition of exclusive marketing rights in 1999 to develop and launch azadirachtin-based products with unique formulation technology Ornazin and Ecozin Plus and continued to build with the licensing of patented potato sprout inhibitor technology from Washington State University in 2005. Since obtaining this exclusive license from WSU, AMVAC now has successfully developed and globally tested the active ingredient, 3-decen-2-one (SmartBlock coded as AMV1018), and presently awaits both U.S. and Canadian registrations. We believe that SmartBlock which is also an FDA-approved direct food additive, will enjoy considerable commercial success world-wide, based on excellent product performance and unique market needs. Pursuing such new green technology avenues together with our proven success in marketing conventional crop protection chemicals, will further broaden our portfolio and help AMVAC meet an ever-increasing global demand for food, feed, fiber and biofuels."

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On November 4, 2011 American Vanguard Corporation issued a press release announcing its financial results for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2011. The full text of that press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
The information contained in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including the Exhibits attached hereto, is being furnished under Items 2.02 and 9.01 and shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.
(d) Exhibits
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, American Vanguard Corporation has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
Newport Beach, CA  November 4, 2011  American Vanguard Corporation (NYSE:AVD), today announced financial results for the third quarter and nine month period ended September 30, 2011.
Fiscal 2011 Third Quarter Financial Highlights  versus Fiscal 2010 Third Quarter Performance
 
 
 
Fiscal 2011 Nine Month Financial Highlights  versus Fiscal 2010 Nine Month Performance
 
 
 
Note: Details are available in the financial schedules attached to this press release
Eric Wintemute, Chairman and CEO of American Vanguard, stated: "We are pleased to report another strong performance for the third quarter that reflects the excellent positioning of our product portfolio, especially our broad range of insecticides. In granular soil insecticides, we continue to expand our international sales penetration with Mocap and Nemacur, and we have successfully captured additional business with Thimet in peanuts and sugarcane replacing a competing product that has been withdrawn from the U.S. market."
Mr. Wintemute continued: "Recently, we have been seeing considerable interest in our many products for the domestic corn market. In June we announced a significant agreement with Monsanto for the co-marketing of our post-emergent corn herbicide Impact in conjunction with their Roundup Ready glyphosate program. We are also seeing corn growers show greater interest in the yield enhancement benefits of corn soil insecticides for protection of their crops in areas where pest pressure is not adequately handled by the use of genetic defenses alone. As the supplier with the most complete line of soil insecticide products as well as the closed delivery systems best equipped to dispense them, we are poised to satisfy this growing demand."
Mr. Wintemute concluded: "Our focus on profitability can be seen in the improvement of our third quarter gross profit margins, from 37% in 2010 to 42% in 2011. Overall our manufacturing operations have experienced higher utilization rates this year resulting in improved coverage of facility fixed costs. We continue to explore the acquisition of appropriately-priced, branded products and our new potato sprout inhibitor SmartBlock is
scheduled to be commercialized during the next 90 days. We are gearing up to take full advantage of the abundant opportunities emerging in domestic corn as well as in other crop markets that favor our extensive offering of granular soil insecticides. Despite the need to overcome some supply constraints in Mocap, and some regulatory constraints with our PCNB fungicide, we are confident that American Vanguard will finish 2011 with a strong financial performance."

Eric Wintemute, Chairman & CEO and David Johnson, VP & CFO, will conduct a conference call focusing on the financial results at 12:00 pm EDT / 9:00 am PDT on Friday, November 4, 2011.

On November 23, 2011 American Vanguard Corporation issued a press release announcing that the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) has approved certain registrations for the company's pentachloronitrobenzene (PCNB) product line for all major commercial uses. PCNB had been unavailable in domestic markets since the issuance of a Stop Sale, Use or Removal Order by USEPA in August 2010.

Exhibit 99.1
Newport Beach, CA  November 23, 2011  American Vanguard Corporation (NYSE:AVD) today announced that the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) has approved certain registrations for the Company's pentachloronitrobenzene (PCNB) product line for all major commercial uses. As a result, with today's action the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, Amvac Chemical Corporation (Amvac) is once again permitted to sell PCNB into the golf course turf, potato, cotton, ornamental bulb and cole crop markets domestically. Amvac continues to work with the EPA on labeling for other uses.
PCNB, a fungicide manufactured, marketed and sold by Amvac, was the subject of a Stop Sale, Use or Removal Order (SSURO) issued by USEPA in August 2010. On August 17, 2011, the Chief Judge of the U.S. District Court granted the Company's motion for summary judgment and vacated the SSURO. Since the court's order was issued, the Company has worked with the Agency to amend product registrations to ensure they continue to meet EPA requirements.
Eric Wintemute, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company commented: "Our technical, legal and customer service teams have worked tirelessly for over a year to ensure our PCNB product line meets EPA's standards to re-enter the market. We are pleased by today's actions as it restores this highly effective product to a marketplace that truly values its importance."
Mr. Wintemute concluded, "American Vanguard always has and always will place great importance on assuring product safety, quality manufacturing and responsible application stewardship for all the offerings in its portfolio. Once again, we thank our customers for their support and patience throughout this process and now are happy to announce that we are ready, willing and able to meet the needs of PCNB customers."

His extensive experience in the realm of securities, acquisitions, business combinations and corporate governance served his clients extremely well.
Eric Wintemute, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of American Vanguard commented: "It is with great sadness and profound regret that we announce the passing of our dear friend and colleague John Miles. John's contribution to the development of this Corporation during the last 17 years has been essential and his insights and guidance will be greatly missed."
Mr. Wintemute continued: "John was the embodiment of talent and commitment that every corporation seeks when selecting a board member. His involvement in our many product acquisitions was fundamental to the business model that has grown the Company six-fold. He had a passion for the hunt; a determination to succeed; and the good judgment to recognize when a deal should be declined. We have benefitted greatly from the transactions that John helped us to consummateand from those that he encouraged us to forgo."
Mr. Wintemute concluded: "John has been a wonderful counselor and coach. His considerable legal knowledge, objectivity and professionalism were everything any CEO could ever expect from an advisor. His dedication, candor and good-natured humor were everything anyone could ever expect from a friend. We cannot adequately convey our sense of loss but will honor his memory by accomplishing the business success that he so earnestly worked to help us achieve."

Exhibit 99.2
 
Newport Beach, CA  March 6, 2012  American Vanguard Corporation (NYSE:AVD), today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2011.
Fiscal 2011 Fourth Quarter versus Fiscal 2010 Fourth Quarter:
 
 
 
Fiscal Full Year 2011 versus Fiscal Full Year 2010:
 
 
 
Eric Wintemute, Chairman and CEO of American Vanguard, stated: "Our record-setting performance in 2011 resulted from strong domestic and international demand for our existing product portfolio, the successful integration of several product lines acquired in late 2010 and the continued outstanding business execution by our entire organization. Compared to the prior full-year period, sales grew by 34%, gross profit margin improved to 40%, operating expenses as a percentage of sales declined to 28%; allowing us to double our net income. We posted this record financial performance despite lost sales and profit opportunities caused by the year-long sales interruption of our PCNB product line, a supply shortage for one of our recently acquired products and a persistent drought that negatively affected our U.S. cotton insecticide business."
Mr. Wintemute continued: "In 2012, we see many encouraging prospects. Ever-increasing global demand for food, feed, fiber and bio-fuels strengthens agricultural commodity prices and is expected to encourage growers to expand acreage and purchase the crop protection inputs that American Vanguard sells. Our Impact herbicide for glyphosate tolerant weeds, our industry leading granular soil insecticides and proprietary closed delivery systems will continue to provide a superior yield enhancing solution for our customers."
Mr. Wintemute concluded: "American Vanguard is well positioned to capitalize on these trends. We anticipate steady growth in most of our domestic crop markets; we expect to expand our footprint in international markets and continue our penetration of the non-crop pest control segment. Our strong balance sheet will allow us to invest in these growth initiatives and increasing cash generation should allow us to provide enhanced near-term returns to shareholders and also consider available growth opportunities that will strengthen the long-term enterprise value of American Vanguard."

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On May 3, 2012 American Vanguard Corporation issued a press release announcing its financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2012. The full text of that press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
The information contained in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including the Exhibits attached hereto, is being furnished under Items 2.02 and 9.01 and shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.

Exhibit 99.1
 
Newport Beach, CA  May 3, 2012  American Vanguard Corporation (NYSE:AVD), today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2012.
Fiscal 2012 First Quarter Financial Highlights  versus Fiscal 2011 First Quarter
 
 
 
Eric Wintemute, Chairman and CEO of American Vanguard, stated: "Our first quarter 2012 business performance reflects positive conditions in the U.S. agricultural sector and was driven largely by the growing demand for our portfolio of granular soil insecticides. Gross profit margins rose to 43% as we achieved improved overall factory utilization rates. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales were held to 26%, despite higher regulatory expenses and freight costs that kept pace with our expanding export business. Stronger sales, improved gross margins and operating expense management enabled us to improve our bottom line significantly."
Mr. Wintemute continued, "We are seeing renewed demand for the use of granular soil insecticides in the U.S. corn market, as growers combat strong pest pressure from both primary and secondary insects. The use of our corn soil insecticides in conjunction with genetically modified seeds as part of an integrated pest management program provides the most comprehensive defense against the full range of soil insects and can enhance harvest yields. American Vanguard has the largest offering of corn soil insecticides along with the most advanced, closed delivery equipment for safely and efficiently dispensing these products."
Mr. Wintemute concluded, "Our performance during the quarter serves to validate our long-standing belief that conventional chemistry is an essential part of integrated pest management. We are, of course, pleased with these results and look forward to giving additional color during our earnings call on the period."
Conference Call
Eric Wintemute, Chairman & CEO and David Johnson, CFO, will conduct a conference call focusing on the financial results at 12:00 pm ET / 9:00 am PT on Thursday, May 3, 2012.

Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
On July 6, 2012 American Vanguard Corporation issued a press release announcing that it had appointed Ad de Jong to the position of Managing Director of its newly-formed, Netherlands-based subsidiary, AMVAC Netherlands BV ("AMVAC BV").
In conjunction with that appointment, Mr. de Jong entered into an employment agreement dated July 1, 2012 with AMVAC BV, having a three year term under which Mr. de Jong is to receive a lump-sum signing bonus of approximately 80,000 and will be paid a gross salary of 20,833 per month. In addition, subject to the terms of a restricted stock agreement, Mr. de Jong was awarded 4,000 shares of restricted stock, which vest October 1, 2012 and 10,000 shares of restricted stock which vest in equal tranches on the first, second and third anniversaries of the award; these awards are subject to forfeiture in the event that recipient is not continuously employed through the vesting date.
In his role as Managing Director of AMVAC BV, Mr. de Jong will be responsible for managing sales, marketing, finance, registration and supply chain relating to all ex-US sales of the Company's products. As such, he has been designated an executive officer by the registrant. Mr. de Jong has no family relationship with any person at the Company. Further, since the beginning of the registrant's last fiscal year, Mr. de Jong has had no transaction with any person related to registrant. Over the past year-and-a-half, Mr. de Jong worked as a consultant and managing director of Albaugh Europe, an agrochemical company. For the 23 years prior to that, he served in roles of increasing responsibility at Chemtura Corporation, culminating with the position of Vice President Crop Protection for Europe/Middle East/Africa and Asia.

Item 8.01 Other Events
On July 6, 2012 American Vanguard Corporation issued a press release announcing that it has restructured its international sales and marketing function, including the formation of a new Netherlands-based subsidiary and the appointment of Ad de Jong as Managing Director of that subsidiary. That press release is incorporated by reference herein.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.
(d) Exhibits
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, American Vanguard Corporation has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
Newport Beach, CA  July 6, 2012 -- American Vanguard Corporation (NYSE:AVD) today announced the restructuring of the International Sales & Marketing function of its principal operating subsidiary, AMVAC Chemical Corporation, effective immediately. Specifically, AMVAC has formed a new Netherlands-based subsidiary, AMVAC Netherlands BV, and appointed Ad de Jong to the newly created position of Managing Director of that subsidiary. In his new role, Mr. de Jong will be responsible for managing sales, marketing, finance, registration and supply chain relating to all ex-US sales of the Company's products. This restructuring will serve to ensure that ample resources are in place to support the international practice now managed by Alfredo Pelaez, AMVAC's Director of International Sales, who plans to retire at the end of the first quarter of 2013. Mr. Pelaez has served the Company since 2001, during which time international sales have increased ten-fold. In the near term, international operations should remain substantially unchanged. Mr. Pelaez will report to Mr. de Jong and will assist in the transition of ex-US activities over his remaining tenure at the Company.
Mr. de Jong has spent his entire career in the agricultural sector, starting in the advisory service with the Dutch Ministry of Agriculture and then holding positions of increasing responsibility over a 23 year period at Chemtura Corporation (and its predecessor companies) in sales, marketing and operations management, culminating with the position of Vice President Crop Protection for Europe/Middle East/Africa and Asia Pacific, where he was responsible for an operation having sales in excess of $200 million. Mr. de Jong also served as Chairman of Chemtura's European Business Council where he helped to develop that company's European strategy. As a seasoned executive in international business, Mr. de Jong has compiled a consistent record of new product expansion and increased sales on multiple continents.
Eric Wintemute, Chairman and CEO of American Vanguard, commented, "Ad's extensive background in agricultural chemicals, knowledge of international markets, familiarity with regulatory and logistical matters and fluency in multiple languages will greatly assist American Vanguard in improving its global organization and driving international growth. Also, having a regional office within the European Community will enable us to offer an enhanced level of customer service, gain a clearer understanding of local markets, and establish a higher level of interaction with local regulatory agencies. We welcome Ad to the team and look forward to his leadership and the continued success of our international business."
Mr. Wintemute continued, "It would be remiss of me not to acknowledge the tremendous contribution that Alfredo Pelaez has made to the Company. He has built up our international organization virtually from whole cloth. In the process, he has integrated and launched newly acquired products on multiple continents, established a reliable network of distribution and handled all manner of issues relating to registration, production and logistics. He has been a valuable resource to AMVAC and will leave behind a platform that is poised for even greater success."

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On August 2, 2012 American Vanguard Corporation issued a press release announcing its financial results for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2012. The full text of that press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
The information contained in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including the Exhibits attached hereto, is being furnished under Items 2.02 and 9.01 and shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.

Exhibit 99.1
 
Newport Beach, CA  August 2, 2012  American Vanguard Corporation (NYSE:AVD), today announced financial results for the second quarter and six month period ended June 30, 2012.
Fiscal 2012 Second Quarter Financial Highlights  versus Fiscal 2011 Second Quarter:
 
 
 
Fiscal 2012 First Half Financial Highlights  versus Fiscal 2011 First Half
 
 
 
Note: Complete details are available in the financial schedules attached to this press release
Eric Wintemute, Chairman and CEO of American Vanguard, stated: "We are pleased to report performance for the second quarter and the first half of 2012 that reflects strong demand for our products and improved profitability of this business. This is consistent with a continued interest in our conventional chemistries as part of Integrated Pest Management. Many of our products are used at the time of planting or early in the growing season and have been relatively unaffected by the persistent drought that has affected the Midwest and Southwest United States. Our successful sales, marketing and operating efforts have driven our bottom-line, net income to just over 10% of net sales (for the quarter) and boosted gross profit margins to 45% for the quarter and 44% for the first half of 2012."
Mr. Wintemute continued: "We continue to strengthen our already healthy balance sheet, by controlling inventory levels, carefully managing our receivable collections and reducing our long-term debt with scheduled quarterly payments. At mid-year we reported $48 million in cash on the balance sheet and stockholder's equity of $206 million  a 10% increase during the last 6 months. We have not borrowed against our revolving-line-of-credit for over a year and have adequate cash and credit availability for working capital and other needs."
Mr. Wintemute concluded: "We are well positioned to take advantage of favorable market conditions for the balance of the year. Factors that will affect our relative success in the third quarter include continued demand for our post-harvest Metam soil fumigants, sufficient pest pressure to support our Bidrin foliar cotton insecticide, favorable weather conditions for cotton harvest in support of our Folex harvest defoliant, and wet weather in regions where our mosquito adulticide, Dibrom, is used. Further, despite dry weather during the 2012 corn growing season, we continue to see strong demand for our products in anticipation of the 2013 season."

Exhibit 99.1
 
Newport Beach, CA  November 1, 2012  American Vanguard Corporation (NYSE:AVD), today announced financial results for the third quarter and nine month period ended September 30, 2012.
Fiscal 2012 Third Quarter Financial Highlights  versus Fiscal 2011 Third Quarter:
 
 
 
Fiscal 2012 First Nine Month Financial Highlights  versus Fiscal 2011 First Nine Month:
 
 
 
Note: Complete details are available in the financial schedules attached to this press release
Eric Wintemute, Chairman and CEO of American Vanguard, stated: "We are pleased to report record net sales and net income performance for the third quarter and the first nine months of 2012 reflecting continued strong demand for our products and excellent profitability of our business. This quarter's results were driven by our participation in cotton and seasonal sales of our soil fumigants for post-harvest applications. Our sales also included initial shipments of granular soil insecticides in response to grower demand ahead of the 2013 planting season."
Mr. Wintemute continued: "In our current results, we see the continuing trend of profitability improvement, as a higher-valued product mix, selective price increases and solid manufacturing performance all contribute to higher gross profit margins. Our finished goods inventory and accounts receivable levels have both risen, in response to the production associated with the pre-season sales build-up for the upcoming corn planting season. Notwithstanding the current strong growth the Company is experiencing, we continue to have sufficient cash and credit available for capital expenditures and/or potential product acquisitions that we may undertake in the coming quarters."
Mr. Wintemute concluded: "Our business segments continue to perform well. Looking forward, we believe that much of our growth will be driven by the continuing adoption of our Best-of-Both-Worlds approach for soil insect control and by the success of our Impact herbicide co-marketing program with Monsanto's Roundup brands. Our marketing programs will be emphasizing AMVAC's Yield Enhancement Solutions (YES) not only for U.S. corn growers but for all of our customers in all of the crop markets that we serve. As critical components of advanced Integrated Pest Management (IPM) systems, our proven crop protection portfolio should support American Vanguard's continued top-line growth, its strong profitability and the sustainable use of our products in keeping with modern agricultural practices."

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, American Vanguard Corporation has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
Newport Beach, CA  February 28, 2013  American Vanguard Corporation (NYSE:AVD), today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2012.
Fiscal 2012 Financial Highlights  versus Fiscal 2011:
 
 
 
Fiscal 2012 Fourth Quarter Financial Highlights  versus Fiscal 2011 Fourth Quarter:
 
 
 
Eric Wintemute, Chairman and CEO of American Vanguard, stated: "Our record-setting performance in 2012, capped by our first $100+ million revenue quarter, was driven by strong end-use demand and consistent business execution by our organization. Compared to the prior full-year period, 2012 sales grew by 22% gross profit margins improved from 41% to 44% and operating expenses remained steady as a percentage of sales at 28%. This operating performance allowed us to grow our net income by 67% and increase our fully diluted earnings per share to $1.28. Our year-end cash position remained very strong; stockholders equity rose for the year by 20%; and we were able to return additional value to shareholders with a special $0.10/share dividend during December."
,
,
Mr. Wintemute continued: "Strong global demand for food, feed, fiber and bio-fuels continues to encourage growers to support the Yield Enhancing Solutions - YES that American Vanguard provides. The practice of Integrated Pest Management has stimulated demand for our comprehensive offering of corn soil insecticides and proprietary closed delivery systems. In 2012, we invested in significant capital improvements at our Axis, Alabama facility to support both our growing granular soil insecticide franchise and our strong cotton defoliant business. We also established an international subsidiary in the Netherlands to focus resources on the important long-range objective of global expansion. At year-end, in a bold new initiative, we formed a majority-owned subsidiary with TyraTech, an innovative developer of natural products that will allow us to participate in the growing demand for "green technology" in commercial, consumer and agricultural pest control markets."
Mr. Wintemute concluded: "In 2013, we are well-positioned to satisfy the continuing strong demand for our many crop protection products. Attractive crop commodity prices continue to give growers the financial health and incentive to invest in our proven technologies for maximizing their harvest output. We are prepared to satisfy the increasing demand for soil insecticides in corn and other crops by maintaining full production of our market-leading products & proprietary equipment systems. We expect to meet the increased demand for our corn herbicide Impact which has been stimulated by our co-marketing agreement with Monsanto's Roundup brands. We believe that 2013 will be very promising for American Vanguard and look forward to providing additional information about those prospects during our earnings conference call."
Conference Call
Eric Wintemute, Chairman & CEO and David T. Johnson, VP & CFO, will conduct a conference call focusing on the financial results at 12:00 pm ET / 9:00 am PT on Thursday, February 28, 2013.

Fiscal 2013 First Quarter Financial Highlights  versus Fiscal 2012 First Quarter
 
 
 
Eric Wintemute, Chairman and CEO of American Vanguard, stated: "This record 2013 first quarter result demonstrates the continuing performance that we have been delivering over the last three years. Our net sales increase of 39% was driven largely by the strong demand for both our granular soil insecticides and our Impact herbicide in the U.S. corn market. Gross profit margins rose to 44% on a profitable product mix, improved pricing and continued progress on factory utilization. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales declined to 23%, despite higher selling and administrative expenses associated with our dynamic growth. Stronger sales, improved gross margins and operating expense management enabled us to improve our net income by 94%...to a very strong 14% of net sales."
Mr. Wintemute continued, "First quarter sales of granular soil insecticides for corn continued their strong fourth quarter 2012 trend. This is driven by U.S. corn growers who continue to support our proven crop protection products in conjunction with genetically modified seeds, as part of an integrated pest management system. This provides the most comprehensive defense against root damaging soil insects. American Vanguard has the largest offering of these yield enhancing insecticides along with the most advanced, closed delivery equipment for safely and efficiently dispensing these products. We also are benefitting from our co-marketing program with Monsanto, which rewards corn growers for using AMVAC's Impact post-emergent herbicide with Monsanto's widely used Roundup glyphosate herbicide brands."
Mr. Wintemute concluded, "We continue to expand our business with a number of exciting new developments. During the quarter we announced the registration of our SmartBlock potato sprout inhibitor, our investment in the natural products technology of TyraTech, Inc. and the continued staffing of our international subsidiary in the Netherlands. We look forward to giving additional details during our first quarter earnings call."

Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officer.
On June 6, 2013, the Board of Directors of American Vanguard Corporation awarded performance-based equity to certain executives, including named executive officers. Each recipient received two awards which are subject to the terms and conditions of two separate Performance-Based Stock Agreements which, generally speaking, include the following terms:
The first award ("Sales/Income Shares") will vest upon the attainment of both (i) continuous employment through the third anniversary of the award and (ii) certain net sales and net income targets for the period commencing April 1, 2013 and ending December 31, 2015. The net sales target is weighted at three-eighths, while the net income target is weighted at five-eighths. Further, the awards include a target number of shares (for the attainment of the financial goal), a minimum targeted number of shares (one half of the targeted number for reaching 80 percent of the financial goal and increasing proportionally to the targeted number for 100 percent of the financial goal) and, a maximum targeted number of shares (which is subject to a graduated scale beyond target performance and caps at 200 percent of the targeted number of shares, to the extent that the company reaches 120 percent of the financial goal).
The second award ("TSR Shares") will vest upon the attainment of both (i) continuous employment through the third anniversary of the award and (ii) targeted annualized shareholder return for fiscal years 2014 and 2015. Specifically, for the attainment of 10 percent annualized return, the targeted number of shares will vest. For the attainment of at least 8 percent annualized return, one-half of the targeted shares will vest (and will increase proportionally to equal the targeted number of shares as the annualized return approaches 10 percent). For annualized return in excess of 10 percent, the number of shares to be awarded is subject to a graduated scale that is capped at 200 percent of the targeted shares to the extent that the company reaches 12 percent annualized return.
The named executive officers and the two stock awards, expressed as targeted number of shares are as follows:
 
Awards are subject to adjustment in the Board's discretion in the event of a financial restatement (based upon executive accountability). Further, shares may be forfeited in their entirety in the event of termination with cause of, or resignation by, the executive.
The information contained in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including the Exhibit attached hereto, is being furnished under Items 5.02, 5.07, 8.01 and 9.01 and shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.

Exhibit 99.1
 
Newport Beach, CA  June 6, 2013 - American Vanguard Corporation (NYSE:AVD) today announced that its wholly-owned subsidiary AMVAC Chemical Corporation has extended an agreement with Monsanto Company to co-market its post-emergent corn herbicide Impact as part of the Roundup Ready PLUS weed management platform. Impact complements Monsanto's Roundup PowerMAX and Roundup WeatherMAX herbicides by improving the control of a number of broadleaf weeds. Under this multi-year agreement, which has been extended through August 2017, Impact will be listed as an endorsed product in the platform and promoted by both companies as the qualifying post-emergent Roundup agricultural herbicide tank-mix product supported by Monsanto's extensive Corn Incentives in the United States.
The Roundup Ready PLUS platform is designed to provide growers with recommendations of effective, economical and sustainable weed control products and also provide financial incentives for using many of the products in the platform. Weed scientists recommend that farmers use multiple modes of action when managing weeds and AMVAC's Impact is an outstanding HPPD inhibitor herbicide that contributes significantly to weed resistance management.
Eric Wintemute, Chairman & CEO of American Vanguard stated: "We are very pleased to extend this partnership with the clear leader in glyphosate herbicides. This collaborative engagement provides Amvac with the opportunity for expanded sales of its high-performance Impact herbicide; provides Monsanto with even more effective and comprehensive herbicide control for its Roundup brand herbicides; and most importantly, provides our mutual customers, the U.S. corn grower, with the potential for maximum yield enhancement."
"We are pleased to continue the use of AMVAC's Impact as a post-emergent corn herbicide in our Roundup Ready PLUS Corn Incentives," said Chris Reat, Monsanto's Roundup Ready PLUS Marketing Manager. "This agreement creates value and choice for farmers using the Roundup Ready PLUS system by offering this effective tool for managing weeds. This partnership further confirms our commitment to offer the best weed management recommendations to growers that will help them optimize weed control and achieve maximum yield."
Under the agreement, Monsanto will continue to license its Roundup Ready PLUS trademarks for use on Impact and co-market Amvac's post-emergent corn herbicide Impact as part of the Roundup Ready PLUS weed management platform. Financial terms of the agreement were not disclosed.

Exhibit 99.2
 
Newport Beach, CA  June 10, 2013  American Vanguard Corp. (NYSE:AVD) today announced that its Board of Directors has established a quarterly dividend payment policy, replacing its traditional semi-annual cash dividend payment practice. Accordingly, the Board declared a $0.05 cash dividend payment to be distributed on July 19, 2013 to shareholders of record as of July 5, 2013. Additionally, the Board of Directors voted to authorize the Company to repurchase its outstanding common shares.
Eric Wintemute, Chairman and CEO of American Vanguard, stated, "We are pleased to declare this dividend, which continues our 20-year history of providing such returns to our shareholders. This new quarterly payment approach will allow our shareholders to realize more immediate benefits from the continuing expansion and financial success of our Company. We also want to maintain a disciplined approach to our equity base. Since performance-based incentives can include restricted stock and stock option grants, we have instituted a share repurchase program with the intent of maintaining the current level of outstanding shares. This dividend policy and disciplined equity plan reflect our belief that increasing shareholder value is of prime importance to Company management and its Board of Directors. These steps also indicate the confidence that management and the Board of Directors have in the Company's future. We appreciate our investors' continued support as we pursue profitable growth in the crop protection and public health markets worldwide."
