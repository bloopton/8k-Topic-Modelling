Cash and marketable securities, net of debt, totaled $286 million at quarter-end.
 
ADTRAN Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Mark Smith stated, "Our increase in revenue over the prior year's first quarter was the result of new product sales and market share expansion of existing products.

As a result of recent tax legislation, we anticipate distributing cash dividends to our shareholders quarterly, as we remain confident of our continuing ability to generate earnings and surplus cash. We believe our Company's ensuing balances of cash and liquid assets, and anticipated continuing cash flow, will be more than adequate to fund working capital requirements, top-line growth and strategic initiatives for the future."

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On May 18, 2005, the stockholders of ADTRAN, Inc. (the "Company" or "ADTRAN") approved the ADTRAN, Inc. 2005 Directors Stock Option Plan (the "2005 Directors Plan"). The 2005 Directors Plan had been previously adopted by the Board of Directors of the Company on January 24, 2005, subject to stockholder approval. The purpose of the 2005 Directors Plan is to provide incentives to the Company's non-employee directors, encourage stock ownership by non-employee directors, and provide a means of attracting, retaining and rewarding highly qualified non-employee directors. To accomplish these objectives, the 2005 Directors Plan provides automatic grants of nonqualified stock options to newly elected non-employee directors and automatic annual grants of nonqualified stock options to each ongoing non-employee director, up to an aggregate of 400,000 shares of ADTRAN's common stock (subject to adjustment upon a stock split, recapitalization or similar event).
 
The following description of the 2005 Directors Plan is qualified in its entirety by reference to the applicable provisions of the 2005 Directors Plan, and agreements related to the 2005 Directors Plan, which are attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1.
 
The 2005 Directors Plan is currently administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, which has the authority to make all determinations necessary or advisable for the proper administration of the 2005 Directors Plan.
 
Under the terms of the 2005 Directors Plan, newly elected non-employee directors of ADTRAN will receive grants of nonqualified stock options to purchase 10,000 shares of common stock. Each December 31, continuing non-employee directors, including non-employee directors emeritus, will receive grants of nonqualified stock options to purchase 5,000 shares of common stock. Directors may not receive both a newly elected director grant and a continuing director grant in the same year.
 
Each option will be evidenced by an option agreement between ADTRAN and the optionee in the form attached to the 2005 Directors Plan. Options become exercisable (, vested) in full on the first anniversary of the grant date, or earlier if there is a change of control of ADTRAN or if the director terminates service due to death or disability. The option exercise price is 100% of the fair market value of ADTRAN's common stock on the date the option is granted, and may be paid in cash, by surrender of shares of ADTRAN common stock that the optionee has held for at least six months, or by a combination of cash and shares.

No fractional shares shall be issued or optioned in making the foregoing adjustments, and the number of shares available under the Plan or the number of shares subject to any outstanding Options shall be the next lower number of shares, rounding all fractions downward.
 
(c) If any rights or warrants to subscribe for additional shares are given to holders of outstanding shares of the class or classes of stock then set aside for the Plan, each Optionee shall be entitled to the same rights or warrants on the same basis as holders of the outstanding shares with respect to such portion of his Option as is exercised on or prior to the record date for determining shareholders entitled to receive or exercise such rights or warrants.

The grant of Options pursuant to the Plan shall not affect in any way the right or power of the Company to make adjustments, reclassifications, reorganizations or changes of its capital or business structure or to merge, consolidate or dissolve, or to liquidate, sell or transfer all or any part of its business or assets. All adjustments the Committee makes under this Article shall be conclusive.
Limits on Adjustments
 
 
8.1 . If, in the opinion of counsel to the Company, such action is necessary or desirable, no Options shall be granted to any Optionee and no Option shall be exercisable unless, at the time of grant or exercise, as applicable, such Optionee (i) represents and warrants that he will acquire the Common Stock for investment only and not for purposes of resale or distribution, and (ii) makes such further representations and warranties as are deemed necessary or desirable by counsel to the Company with regard to holding and resale of the Common Stock.

Accordingly, these shares may not be sold, hypothecated, pledged or otherwise transferred except (i) pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and any applicable securities laws or regulations of any state with respect to such shares, (ii) in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 144, or (iii) upon the issuance to the Corporation of a favorable opinion of counsel or the submission to the Corporation of such other evidence as may be satisfactory to the Corporation that such proposed sale, assignment, encumbrance or other transfer will not be in violation of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or any applicable securities laws of any state or any rules or regulations thereunder. Any attempted transfer of this certificate or the shares represented hereby which is in violation of the preceding restrictions will not be recognized by the Corporation, nor will any transferee be recognized as the owner thereof by the Corporation.

8.2 . In the event that the Company in its sole discretion shall deem it necessary or advisable to register, under the 1933 Act or any state securities laws or regulations, any shares with respect to which Options have been granted hereunder, then the Company shall take such action at its own expense before delivery of the certificates representing such shares to an Optionee. In such event, and if the shares of Common Stock of the Company shall be listed on any national securities exchange or on Nasdaq at the time of the exercise of any Option, the Company shall make prompt application at its own expense for the listing on such stock exchange or Nasdaq of the shares of Common Stock to be issued.

(NASDAQ:ADTN) reported results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2005. Sales were $149,170,000 for the quarter, up 25% compared to $118,873,000 for the second quarter of 2005, and up 29% compared to $115,251,000 for the third quarter of 2004.

Earnings per share, assuming dilution, were $0.42 for the quarter, up 56% compared to $0.27 for the second quarter of 2005, and up 83% compared to $0.23 for the third quarter of 2004. Gross margin improved to 59.9% for the quarter compared to 57.6% for the third quarter of 2004.

We believe these results reflect continuing momentum and share gains in the markets we serve." The Company also issued revised guidance for the year 2005.

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
           On January 23, 2006, the Board of Directors of ADTRAN, Inc. (the "Company") adopted the ADTRAN, Inc. Management Incentive Bonus Plan (the "Plan"), effective as of January 1, 2006, to provide annual cash incentives and to attract and retain qualified executives.  The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Committee") administers the Plan.  Officers and management employees selected by the chief executive officer or chief operating officer are eligible to participate in the Plan, as approved by the Committee.  Within 90 days of the beginning of each plan year, the Committee may determine the performance awards (which are intended to be performance-based awards under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended) by establishing the target awards, generally as a percentage of base compensation, and the performance measures against which the target awards will be measured, which are generally related to the performance of the Company but may also be based on individual performance.  In no event will a performance award to any one individual exceed the maximum performance award of $1,000,000.  As soon as possible after the end of each plan year, the Committee will certify the attainment of the performance measures and will award the performance awards, subject to its discretion to reduce the performance awards, and subject to final Board approval of the awards recommended by the Committee.  Performance awards are paid in cash as soon as possible after the Committee's certification, provided the participant is still employed when the awards are paid.  In the event of a change in control, if the performance measures have been attained, a participant will receive an immediate lump sum cash payment of the performance award.
            On January 23, 2006, the Committee established corporate financial targets based on minimum after-tax earnings per share for fiscal year 2006.  If the fiscal year 2006 earnings per share minimum is met, the Committee may award bonuses as a percentage of base compensation relative to the amount by which the earnings per share exceeded the minimum target level.  If the minimum performance measure is attained, the minimum target award is 10% of base compensation for the chief executive officer, chief operating officer and senior vice presidents (with 1% increases relative to specified earnings per share increases) and 5% of base compensation for the vice presidents (with one-half percent increases relative to specified earnings per share increases).  If the attainment of the performance measure is within a maximum range, the target award is 18% of base compensation for the chief executive officer, chief operating officer and senior vice presidents (with 2% increases relative to specified earnings per share increases) and 9% of base compensation for the vice presidents (with 1% increases relative to specified earnings per share increases).  The maximum performance award may not exceed 100% of base compensation for the chief executive officer, chief operating officer or senior vice presidents and may not exceed 50% of base compensation for any vice president.  If the minimum performance measure is not met, then no performance awards will be paid.  The Committee retains the discretion to reduce any performance award below the award established, and all awards are subject to final Board approval.

Exhibit 99.1 ADTRAN, Inc. Reports First Quarter 2006 Results and Declares Quarterly Cash Dividend HUNTSVILLE, Ala.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 17, 2006--ADTRAN, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADTN) reported results for the first quarter of 2006. Sales increased to $108,648,000 for the quarter compared to $104,577,000 for the first quarter of 2005. Non-GAAP net income increased 18% to $17,966,000 for the quarter compared to GAAP net income of $15,220,000 for the first quarter of 2005. Non-GAAP earnings per share, assuming dilution, were $0.23 for the quarter compared to GAAP earnings per share, assuming dilution, of $0.20 for the first quarter of 2005. For the quarter, GAAP net income increased to $16,255,000 and GAAP earnings per share, assuming dilution, increased to $0.21, compared to the first quarter of 2005. Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share for the first quarter exclude the effect of stock compensation expense resulting from the application of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R, Share-Based Payment ("SFAS 123R"). SFAS 123R was adopted on a prospective basis effective January 1, 2006. See the table below for reconciliation between non-GAAP and GAAP net income and earnings per share. For the quarter, gross margin increased to 59.4% compared to 57.6% for the first quarter of 2005. ADTRAN Chief Executive Officer Tom Stanton stated, "Although shipments in the first quarter of 2006 were below our original expectations, we saw strong revenue growth in our three primary growth areas: Optical Access, Broadband Access, and NetVanta(R) Routers and Switches. We anticipate this momentum will continue to increase as we progress through the year." The Company also announced that its Board of Directors declared a cash dividend for the first quarter of 2006. The quarterly cash dividend is $0.09 per common share to be paid to holders of record at the close of business on May 4, 2006. The ex-dividend date is May 2, 2006 and the payment date is May 18, 2006. The Company also confirmed that its first quarter conference call will be held Tuesday, April 18 at 9:30 a.m. Central Time.

This press release contains forward-looking statements which reflect management's best judgment based on factors currently known. However, these statements involve risks and uncertainties, including the successful development and market acceptance of new products, the degree of competition in the market for such products, the product and channel mix, component costs, manufacturing efficiencies, and other risks detailed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements included in this press release. This release includes non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP earnings per share data, and other non-GAAP line items from the Non-GAAP Information table in this release, including costs of sales, gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses, research and development expenses, profit from operations, income before provision for income taxes and provision for income taxes. These measures exclude the effect of stock compensation expense for employee stock options associated with the application of SFAS 123R, which ADTRAN adopted effective January 1, 2006. These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. ADTRAN believes that the presentation of the non-GAAP measures, when shown in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures, provides useful information to management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and results of operations. ADTRAN further believes that where adjustments used in calculating non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share are based on specific, identified charges that impact different line items in the statements of income, it is useful to investors to know how these specific line items are affected by these adjustments. In particular, as ADTRAN begins to apply SFAS 123R, it believes that it is useful to investors to understand how the expenses associated with the application of SFAS 123R are reflected in its results of operations. The presentation of these non-GAAP measures permits both investors and management to more readily compare past results, which do not include the impact of SFAS 123R, with future results, and to better understand ADTRAN's performance over the periods presented.

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On January 23, 2006, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of ADTRAN, Inc. ("ADTRAN") approved the ADTRAN, Inc. 2006 Employee Stock Incentive Plan (the "Stock Plan") to be effective as of February 14, 2006, subject to the approval of the stockholders. The stockholders of ADTRAN approved the Stock Plan at ADTRAN's Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on May 9, 2006.
The Board adopted the new Stock Plan, to further the growth and development of ADTRAN by encouraging certain employees of ADTRAN and its affiliates to obtain an ownership interest in ADTRAN. The Stock Plan will also provide employees with an added incentive to continue in the employ of ADTRAN, provide employees with an added incentive to stimulate their efforts in promoting the growth, efficiency and profitability of ADTRAN, and help to attract outstanding employees to the service of ADTRAN. The Compensation Committee of the Board (the "Committee") administers the Stock Plan. All active employees of ADTRAN are eligible to receive awards under the Stock Plan.
Thirteen million shares of ADTRAN's common stock are authorized for issuance under the Stock Plan, subject to adjustment under certain circumstances. The Stock Plan permits grants of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and restricted stock units. Each award is subject to an award agreement prepared by, or at the direction of, the Committee. Awards under the Stock Plan may also be designed to qualify as performance-based compensation, as described in Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and may be awarded based on the attainment of certain performance goals as provided under the Stock Plan.
Incentive or nonqualified stock options may be granted under the Stock Plan at an exercise price that is at least 100% of the fair market value of a share of ADTRAN common stock on the date of grant, may be paid in cash, by tendering shares of ADTRAN common stock that have been held for at least six months, by broker-assisted cashless exercise, or by any other method permitted by the Committee, and may be exercised for up to a maximum term of ten (10) years from the date of grant. Stock appreciation rights represent the right to receive payment in shares of ADTRAN common stock (or, at the Committee's discretion, in cash or a combination of shares and cash) of the increase in value of shares of ADTRAN common stock on the date of exercise over a fixed grant price. Stock appreciation rights under the Stock Plan may be freestanding, or may be granted in tandem with options. In the event of a tandem grant, the recipient may choose between exercising options and exercising stock appreciation rights. The grant price of each stock appreciation right granted under the Stock Plan will be 100% of the fair market value of a share of common stock on the date of grant. Restricted stock is a grant of shares of ADTRAN common stock subject to restrictions that generally lapse upon vesting. Restricted stock units are grants of restricted shares that will be issued in stock upon vesting.
Unless the Committee specifies otherwise, (i) awards become exercisable with respect to 25% of the award on each of the first four anniversaries of the grant date; (ii) stock options and stock appreciation rights become immediately vested upon a participant's death or disability, and upon a change of control; (iii) all restricted stock and restricted stock units that are subject to time-based vesting become immediately vested upon a participant's death or disability, and upon a change of control; and (iv) for restricted stock and restricted stock units that are subject to performance-based vesting, upon the participant's death or disability or upon a change of control, a portion of the award becomes immediately vested on a pro rata basis (based on the portion of the performance period that has elapsed), as if the performance goals had been achieved at target. Unless otherwise provided, following a termination of employment or service, exercisable options and stock appreciation rights terminate immediately upon the award recipient's termination of employment for cause, and will remain exercisable (but not beyond the award's term) for one year, if the termination is due to death, disability or retirement, for three months if
after a change of control, and for 90 days if the termination is for any other reason. Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, a recipient of a restricted stock award has full voting rights and dividend rights of a shareholder, but no voting rights attach to restricted stock units unless and until shares of common stock are actually issued. Unless the Committee specifies otherwise, holders of unvested restricted stock units will not receive dividend credits.
Upon a reorganization, the Committee may decide that awards will apply to securities of the resulting corporation, that any or all options and stock appreciation rights will be immediately exercisable, that options and stock appreciation rights will be immediately exercisable and terminate after 30 days' notice to holders, and/or that awards of restricted stock, or restricted stock units will become immediately fully vested.
The description of the Stock Plan set forth above is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Stock Plan, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements included in this press release. This release includes non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP earnings per share data, and other non-GAAP line items from the Non-GAAP Information table in this release, including costs of sales, gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses, research and development expenses, profit from operations, income before provision for income taxes and provision for income taxes. These measures exclude the effect of stock compensation expense for employee stock options associated with the application of SFAS 123R, which ADTRAN adopted effective January 1, 2006. These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. ADTRAN believes that the presentation of the non-GAAP measures, when shown in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures, provides useful information to management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and results of operations. ADTRAN further believes that where adjustments used in calculating non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share are based on specific, identified charges that impact different line items in the statements of income, it is useful to investors to know how these specific line items are affected by these adjustments. In particular, as ADTRAN begins to apply SFAS 123R, it believes that it is useful to investors to understand how the expenses associated with the application of SFAS 123R are reflected in its results of operations. The presentation of these non-GAAP measures permits both investors and management to more readily compare past results, which do not include the impact of SFAS 123R, with future results, and to better understand ADTRAN's performance over the periods presented.

Exhibit 99.1 ADTRAN, Inc. Reports Fourth Quarter 2006 Results and Declares Quarterly Cash Dividend HUNTSVILLE, Ala.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 22, 2007--ADTRAN, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADTN) reported results for the fourth quarter of 2006. Sales were $109,869,000 for the quarter compared to $140,595,000 for the fourth quarter of 2005. For the fourth quarter 2006, GAAP net income was $17,036,000 and GAAP earnings per share, assuming dilution, were $0.24. Non-GAAP net income was $18,992,000 for the quarter and non-GAAP earnings per share, assuming dilution, were $0.26 for the quarter. For the fourth quarter 2005, GAAP net income was $32,196,000 and GAAP earnings per share, assuming dilution, were $0.41. Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2006 exclude the effect of stock compensation expense resulting from the application of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R, Share-Based Payment ("SFAS 123R"). SFAS 123R was adopted on a modified prospective basis effective January 1, 2006. See the table below for reconciliation between non-GAAP and GAAP net income and earnings per share. ADTRAN Chief Executive Officer Tom Stanton stated, "The fourth quarter proved challenging for many of us in the telecom equipment sector. However, solid execution by our employees allowed us to deliver healthy profitability while continuing to strengthen our market positions in strategic areas. Product introductions and new business wins which occurred in 2006 should provide a solid base for long term growth." The Company also announced that its Board of Directors declared a cash dividend for the fourth quarter of 2006. The quarterly cash dividend is $0.09 per common share to be paid to holders of record at the close of business on February 8, 2007. The ex-dividend date is February 6, 2007 and the payment date is February 22, 2007.

This press release contains forward-looking statements which reflect management's best judgment based on factors currently known. However, these statements involve risks and uncertainties, including the successful development and market acceptance of new products, the degree of competition in the market for such products, the product and channel mix, component costs, manufacturing efficiencies, and other risks detailed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements included in this press release. This release includes non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP earnings per share data, and other non-GAAP line items from the Non-GAAP Information table in this release, including costs of sales, gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses, research and development expenses, profit from operations, income before provision for income taxes and provision for income taxes. These measures exclude the effect of stock compensation expense for employee stock options associated with the application of SFAS 123R, which ADTRAN adopted effective January 1, 2006. These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. ADTRAN believes that the presentation of the non-GAAP measures, when shown in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures, provides useful information to management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and results of operations. ADTRAN further believes that where adjustments used in calculating non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share are based on specific, identified charges that impact different line items in the statements of income, it is useful to investors to know how these specific line items are affected by these adjustments. In particular, as ADTRAN applies SFAS 123R, it believes that it is useful to investors to understand how the expenses associated with the application of SFAS 123R are reflected in its results of operations. The presentation of these non-GAAP measures permits both investors and management to more readily compare past results, which do not include the impact of SFAS 123R, with future results, and to better understand ADTRAN's performance over the periods presented.

For Release March 27, 2007
HUNTSVILLE, Ala.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--March 27, 2007 --ADTRAN, Inc. (NASDAQ: ADTN), is saddened to announce the death of founder and Chairman of the Board, Mark C. Smith. Smith passed away due to complications from pneumonia. In addition to serving as chairman of the board, and as one of ADTRAN's co-founders, Smith served as CEO from the Company's inception in January 1986 until his retirement as CEO in September 2005.
"Mark will be remembered for his role in establishing this company. His leadership and entrepreneurial vision helped grow ADTRAN into the successful company that it is today. Mark had a rich history with the Company that spanned over two decades. We are thankful that he drove each one of us to new levels of personal and professional integrity. We are grateful for the legacy that he leaves behind," according to Tom Stanton, chief executive officer and director of ADTRAN.
A native of Birmingham, Alabama, Smith began his interest in technology after winning first place in a Science Fair at Birmingham's Woodlawn High School. His prize was a handshake with Werner Von Braun, at which time Smith took the opportunity to request a job. He would later spend three Summers working at NASA in Huntsville, Alabama, and Cape Canaveral, Florida, where he met the founders of SCI. After earning a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering with honors from Georgia Institute of Technology, Smith moved to Huntsville in 1962 working as an engineering manager at Huntsville-based SCI (now Sanmina-SCI). In 1969, Smith co-founded Universal Data Systems (UDS), the first data communications company in Alabama. Following the purchase of UDS by Motorola, Inc., Smith was named president of UDS-Motorola Division in 1979.
In 1986, Smith founded ADTRAN in a 9,000 square-foot building with seven employees who had worked together at UDS. When ADTRAN moved into its 170,000 square foot facility in Cummings Research Park in 1992, it became one of the largest industrial facilities to be built in Huntsville and Madison County.  
In 1995, Smith was inducted into the State of Alabama Engineering Hall of Fame and was selected as Entrepreneur of the Year in High Technology/Electronics for the Southeastern Division. The same year, Smith received Georgia Tech's Distinguished Engineering Alumni Award. The Birmingham News also named Smith CEO of the Year in 2000, and he was commended by a Joint House Resolution of the State of Alabama Legislature. In 2004, Smith was awarded the Alabama Information Technology Association Lifetime Achievement Award.
In addition to his many accomplishments in the business community in both Huntsville and throughout the state of Alabama, he was also an active philanthropist in his local community. Smith served on the University of Alabama Foundation Board, the UAH School of Administrative Science Advisory Board, and was president of the Greater Huntsville Foundation. Smith's contribution to the community was formally recognized in 1996 when he received the Humanitarian Award from the North Alabama Chapter of the Arthritis Foundation. The award recognized Smith as a visionary, entrepreneur, philanthropist and dedicated citizen that gave back to the community ten-fold. The many organizations Smith was involved with included the Huntsville Symphony, the Rotary Club, Randolph School, Burritt Museum and the Alabama Research Institute.
Smith is survived by his wife, Linda Jones Smith of Greenville, Georgia and two children, Cyndi Smith Lewis and Clay Smith.

ITEM: Financial Statements and Exhibits
 
Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions (see General Instruction A.2 below):
 
 
 
 
 
(a) On October 13, 2007, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of ADTRAN, Inc. (the "Company") adopted amendments to Article V of the Bylaws of the Company, effective immediately. Article V of the Bylaws contains the provisions that address the capital stock of the Company. The Bylaws were amended in order to comply with recent rule changes of the Securities and Exchange Commission and The NASDAQ Stock Market that require listed companies to be eligible to issue shares in either certificated or uncertificated form and to participate in a book-entry share Direct Registration System, which allows for the electronic transfer of securities. The purpose of the amendments to the Bylaws is to incorporate into Article V the concept of uncertificated shares, as well as adding provisions relating to the administration of such shares. Previously, the Bylaws did not specifically provide for the issuance of uncertificated shares.
Set forth below is a description of the specific amendments to the Bylaws.
Section 5.1 of the Bylaws has been amended to provide that the shares of stock of the Company may be issued in the form of uncertificated shares, in addition to certificated shares, upon the adoption of a resolution of the Board authorizing the issuance of uncertificated shares. In addition, a provision was added to Section 5.1 requiring the delivery of notice of holders of uncertificated shares providing them with information that would otherwise be set forth on a stock certificate.
Section 5.3 of the Bylaws has been amended to revise the requirements specifying the information to be retained in the stock ledger to address both certificated and uncertificated shares.
Section 5.4 of the Bylaws, which provides the Board with the power, not inconsistent with law, the Company's Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws, to make such rules and regulations as it deems appropriate concerning the issuance, registration, transfer and cancellation of shares of stock, has been amended to apply this authority to both certificated and uncertificated shares.
Section 5.5 of the Bylaws, which addresses transfers of shares, has been amended to provide that upon the transfer of shares, either certificated or uncertificated, the Company can issue either certificated or uncertificated shares to the transferee, and further provides for the cancellation of the old certificate or uncertificated shares and the recording of the transaction in the Company's books.
Section 5.7 of the Bylaws has been amended to add the ability of the Company to issue uncertificated shares, in addition to certificated shares, in the event of the replacement of lost, destroyed, stolen or mutilated certificates.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

 
Exhibit 3.1
Section 1.1 . The address of the registered office of the Corporation in the State of Delaware and the name of the registered agent at such address shall be as specified in the Certificate of Incorporation or, if subsequently changed, as specified in the most recent Certificate of Change filed pursuant to law. The Corporation may also have other offices at such places within or without the State of Delaware as the Board of Directors may from time to time designate or the business of the Corporation may require.

The annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation for the election of Directors and for the transaction of such other business as may properly come before the meeting shall be held at the registered office of the Corporation, or at such other place within or without the State of Delaware as the Board of Directors may fix by resolution or as set forth in the notice of the meeting. In the event that the Board of Directors shall not otherwise fix the time, date and place of meeting, the annual meeting shall be held at the registered office of the Corporation at 10:00 a.m. on the first Wednesday in March of each year, commencing with the year 1988, but if such a date is a legal holiday, then on the next succeeding business day.
Annual Meeting
 
Section 2.2 . Special meetings of stockholders, unless otherwise prescribed by law, may be called at any time by the Chairman of the Board, by the Chief Executive Officer, by the President or by order of the Board of Directors.

Special meetings of stockholders shall be held at such time and such place, within or without the State of Delaware, as shall be designated in the notice of meeting.
Special Meetings
Section 2.3 . The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of the Corporation shall prepare and make, or cause to be prepared and made, at least ten days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list, based upon the record date for such meeting determined pursuant to Section 5.8, of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least ten days prior to the meeting, either at a place within the city where the meeting is to be held, which place shall be specified in the notice of the meeting, or, if such place shall not be so specified, at the place where the meeting is to be held. The list shall also be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present.
List of Stockholders Entitled to Vote
The stock ledger shall be the only evidence as to who are the stockholders entitled to examine the stock ledger, the list of stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting, or the books of the Corporation, or to vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of stockholders.
 
Section 2.4 . Written notice of each annual and special meeting of stockholders, other than any meeting the giving of notice of which is otherwise prescribed by law, stating the place, date and hour of the meeting, and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called, shall be delivered or mailed, in writing, at least ten but not more than sixty days before the date of such meeting, to each stockholder entitled to vote thereat. If mailed, such notice shall be deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to such stockholder at his address as the same appears on the records of the Corporation. An affidavit of the Secretary, an Assistant Secretary or the transfer agent of the Corporation that notice has been duly given shall be evidence of the facts stated therein.
Notice of Meeting
Section 2.5 . Any meeting of stockholders may be adjourned to another time or place, and the Corporation may transact at any adjourned meeting any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting. Notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken, unless (a) any adjournment or series of adjournments cause the original meeting to be adjourned for more than thirty days after the date originally fixed therefor, or (b) a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting. If notice of an adjourned meeting is given, such notice shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting in the manner prescribed in Section 2.4 for the giving of notice of meetings.
Adjourned Meetings and Notice Thereof
Section 2.6 . At any meeting of stockholders, except as otherwise expressly required by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation, the holders of record of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote or act at such meeting shall be present or represented by proxy in order to constitute a quorum for the transaction of any business, but less than a quorum shall be present. When a quorum is once present to organize a meeting, the quorum cannot be destroyed by the subsequent withdrawal or revocation of the proxy of any stockholder. Shares of capital stock owned by the Corporation or by another corporation, if a majority of the shares of such other corporation entitled to vote in the election of Directors is held by the Corporation, shall not be counted for quorum purposes or entitled to vote.
Quorum
 
Section 2.7 . At any meeting of stockholders, each stockholder holding, as of the record date, shares of stock entitled to be voted on any matter at such meeting shall have one vote on each such matter submitted to vote at such meeting for each such share of stock held by such stockholder, as of the record date, as shown by the list of stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, unless the Certificate of Incorporation provides for more or less than one vote for any share, on any matter, in which case every reference in these Bylaws to a majority or other proportion of stock shall refer to such majority or other proportion of the votes of such stock.
Voting
Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders or to express consent or dissent to corporate action in writing without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for him by proxy, provided that no proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A duly executed proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only so long as, it is coupled with an interest, whether in the stock itself or in the Corporation generally, sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power.
The Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the President, or the person presiding at a meeting of stockholders may appoint one or more persons to act as inspectors of voting at any meeting with respect to any matter to be submitted to a vote of stockholders at such meeting, with such powers and duties, not inconsistent with applicable law, as may be appropriate.
Section 2.8 . Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, whenever any action by the stockholders at a meeting thereof is required or permitted by law, the Certificate of Incorporation, or these Bylaws, such action may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of the outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted. Prompt notice of the taking of such action without a meeting and by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented in writing.

Section 3.14 . The Board of Directors may, by resolution or resolutions passed by a majority of the whole Board of Directors, designate one or more committees, each committee to consist of one or more of the Directors of the Corporation.
Committees of Directors

The Board of Directors may designate one or more Directors as alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of the committee.

Exhibit 99.1
ADTRAN, Inc. Reports First Quarter 2008 Results, Announces Additional Five Million Share Repurchase Plan and Declares Quarterly Cash Dividend
HUNTSVILLE, Ala.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--ADTRAN, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADTN) reported results for the first quarter of 2008. Sales increased 9% to a first quarter record of $119,885,000 compared to $110,312,000 for the first quarter of 2007. Operating income increased 20% for the quarter to $25,140,000 compared to $20,956,000 for the first quarter of 2007. Net income was $17,047,000 for the quarter compared to $16,928,000 for the first quarter of 2007. Earnings per share, assuming dilution, were $0.26 for the quarter compared to $0.24 for the first quarter of 2007.
ADTRAN Chief Executive Officer Tom Stanton stated, Momentum in our growth businesses overcame typical seasonality and a tepid enterprise spending environment. For the quarter, our growth businesses, which include Broadband Access, Internetworking and Optical Access, achieved record revenues, growing 44% year-over-year. Broadband Access achieved a record level with 57% year-over-year revenue growth. Internetworking also achieved record revenues for the quarter growing 34% year-over-year and Optical Access saw 30% year-over-year revenue growth for the quarter. We believe recent trends in these businesses provide early indications of the success we anticipate in these new markets.
The Company also reported that the provision for income taxes in the first quarter of 2008 was unusually high due to delays in federal legislation required to extend research tax credits for the 2008 year. For comparison purposes, the first quarter results for 2007 included benefits from life insurance proceeds and closure of prior year tax audits that increased earnings per share, assuming dilution, by approximately $0.02.

Upon completion of the current plan, the new plan will be implemented through open market or private purchases from time to time as conditions warrant. Since the beginning of 2004, the Company has repurchased a total of 18,562,000 shares of its common stock.
The Company also announced that its Board of Directors declared a cash dividend for the first quarter of 2008.

HUNTSVILLE, Ala.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--October 13, 2008--ADTRAN, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADTN) reported results for the third quarter of 2008.

Earnings per share, assuming dilution, were $0.35 for the quarter compared to $0.31 for the third quarter of 2007.
ADTRAN Chief Executive Officer Tom Stanton stated, Although economic uncertainty affected us during the latter part of the quarter, our growth businesses - Broadband Access, Optical Access and Internetworking  combined, continued to perform well for the quarter, achieving 26% revenue growth compared to third quarter 2007. Internetworking set another record level with 33% revenue growth compared to third quarter 2007, and Optical Access achieved a record level with 21% growth.

(e) On November 6, 2008, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Compensation Committee") of ADTRAN, Inc. (the "Company") approved the form of the Performance Shares Agreement under the ADTRAN, Inc. 2006 Employee Stock Incentive Plan (the "Incentive Plan"). The Performance Shares Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions of awards under the Incentive Plan of restricted stock units, referred to as "performance shares", including, but not limited to, the performance period, vesting and delivery of performance shares, and receipt of dividend credits based on the shares of common stock underlying the performance shares. A copy of the Performance Shares Agreement is attached hereto as and is incorporated herein by reference.
Exhibit 10.1
On November 6, 2008, the Compensation Committee made grants of performance shares to the named executive officers of the Company in the amounts set forth below:
 
The number of performance shares earned by the executive officers is based on the Company's relative total shareholder return against a peer group over a three-year performance period. Depending on the relative total shareholder return over the performance period, the executive officers may earn from 0% to 150% of the number of target performance shares, with the shares earned distributed at the end of the three-year performance period. A portion of the granted performance shares also vest and become deliverable upon the death or disability of a recipient or upon a change of control of the Company, as defined on the Incentive Plan. The recipients of the performance shares receive dividend credits based on the shares of common stock underlying the performance shares. The dividend credits are vested, earned and distributed in the same manner as the performance shares.
 
(d) Exhibits
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 10.1
This Performance Shares Agreement (this "Agreement") sets forth the specified terms of ADTRAN, Inc.'s grant of Restricted Stock Units ("Performance Shares") pursuant to the ADTRAN, Inc. 2006 Employee Stock Incentive Plan (the "Plan"). All capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Plan.
 
The three (3) year period beginning on the Date of Grant of the Performance Shares.
Performance Period:
The number of granted Performance Shares that are vested and earned pursuant to this Agreement will be based on the total shareholder return ("TSR") of ADTRAN, Inc. (the "Company") during the Performance Period relative to companies in the Company's peer group, which companies are listed on hereto. Granted Performance Shares will be vested and earned in accordance with the following schedule:
Vesting and Delivery of Performance Shares:
Exhibit A
 
One share of the Company's Common Stock shall be issued to the Participant for every "Earned Performance Share." The Company will issue shares of Common Stock to the Participant as soon as administratively practicable following the date the Performance Shares have been vested and earned; provided, however, if any law or regulation requires the Company to take any action (including, but not limited to, the filing of a registration statement under the 1933 Act and causing such registration statement to become effective) with respect to such shares of Common Stock before the issuance thereof, then the date of delivery of the shares shall be extended for the period necessary to take such action, to the maximum extent permitted by Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code.
In the event of (1) the Participant's death, (2) the Participant's Disability, or (3) a Change of Control of the Company, a portion of the granted Performance Shares shall become immediately vested and earned by the Participant. The number of such vested and nonforfeitable shares shall be equal to (x) the number of Performance Shares that is 25% of the total Performance Shares granted under this Agreement multiplied by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which shall equal the number of days elapsed from the Date of Grant to the date of the applicable acceleration event and the denominator of which shall equal the days in the Performance Period.
Accelerated Vesting and Delivery:
: The Participant shall receive dividend credits upon the Company's payment of cash dividends for its Common Stock during the Performance Period as follows:
Dividend Credits
(1) The Participant shall receive dividend credits on the unvested portion of the original number of Performance Shares awarded on the Date of Grant ("Original Performance Shares"), with the amount of such dividend credits credited to the Participant in the form of additional unvested Performance Shares, as calculated pursuant to the Plan.
(2) The Participant's Performance Shares attributable to any dividend credits will be vested and earned in accordance with the same schedule as the Original Performance Shares (as described above).
(3) The distribution of Performance Shares attributable to dividend credits shall be made in a cash payment on the same date as the issuance of the Common Stock for the "Earned Performance Shares."
The Participant hereby designates the following individual as the Beneficiary (as defined in the Plan) of this Agreement:
Designation of Beneficiary:
 
The Participant may modify this designation of Beneficiary only in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Plan.
The Performance Shares granted above are subject to all restrictions, terms and conditions set forth in the ADTRAN, Inc. 2006 Employee Stock Incentive Plan. In the event of any inconsistency between this Agreement and the Plan, the provisions of the Plan shall govern. The Participant has received a copy of the Plan's prospectus, including a copy of the Plan. The Participant agrees to the terms of this Performance Shares Agreement, which may be amended only upon a written agreement signed by the parties hereto.
This day of , 200.

HUNTSVILLE, Ala.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--January 20, 2009--ADTRAN, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADTN) reported results for the fourth quarter and year 2008. Sales were $112,413,000 for the quarter, compared to $118,971,000 for the fourth quarter of 2007. Sales were $500,676,000 for the year, compared to $476,778,000 for the year 2007.

Earnings per share, assuming dilution, were $0.27 for the quarter, compared to $0.27 for the fourth quarter of 2007 and $1.22 for the year, compared to $1.10 for the year 2007.
ADTRAN Chief Executive Officer Tom Stanton stated, Although the slowing economy continued to impact our business, our strong operating metrics delivered a healthy level of profitability for the fourth quarter as we continued to gain market share in our growth areas. For the year, our growth businesses - Broadband Access, Optical Access and Internetworking - all reached record revenue levels, achieving 23% combined growth. While the industry continues to face uncertainty in the near term, we believe our operating discipline combined with the long term opportunities in our growth areas place us in a solid position.
The Company also reported that during the fourth quarter of 2008, net realized investment losses of $2.3 million in its marketable equity securities portfolio were recorded as a result of declines in the equity securities markets.

The amount of research credits recognized in the quarter was $2.3 million. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company completed a review of its estimated tax deduction for the year 2008 relating to Section 199 of the Internal Revenue code. This review resulted in a $0.9 million reduction in the years tax provision which was recognized in the fourth quarter.
The Company also announced that its Board of Directors declared a cash dividend for the fourth quarter of 2008. The quarterly cash dividend is $0.09 per common share to be paid to holders of record at the close of business on February 5, 2009.

ADTRAN, Inc. Reports Results for First Quarter 2009 and Declares Quarterly Cash Dividend
HUNTSVILLE, Ala.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 14, 2009--ADTRAN, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADTN) reported results for the first quarter of 2009. Sales were $110,364,000 for the quarter, compared to $119,885,000 for the first quarter of 2008. Net income was $15,184,000 for the quarter, compared to $17,047,000 for the first quarter of 2008. Earnings per share, assuming dilution, were $0.24 for the quarter, compared to $0.26 for the first quarter of 2008.
ADTRAN Chief Executive Officer Tom Stanton stated, Our results for the quarter reflect improved operating efficiencies as gross margins achieved another record high and total operating expenses decreased. Most notable during the quarter was the acceleration of our Fiber-to-the-Node business in the U.S. Our ongoing advancements in strategic areas and improvements in operating efficiencies leave our company poised for revenue and earnings growth when conditions improve.
The Company also reported that during the first quarter of 2009 net realized investment losses of $3.2 million were recorded primarily relating to other than temporary impairments in marketable securities as a result of declines in equity securities markets that continued in the first quarter. Tax effected, this reduced diluted earnings per share by $0.03 for the quarter.
The Company also reported that stock-based compensation expense for the first quarter of 2009 reduced diluted earnings per share by $0.03 compared to $0.03 for the first quarter of 2008.
Additionally, during the first quarter of 2009, the Company completed a review of its estimated tax deductions for years 2005, 2006 and 2007 relating to Section 199 of the Internal Revenue code concerning domestic content of products the Company manufactures. This review resulted in a $1.7 million benefit being recorded in the first quarter of 2009, reducing the Companys income tax provision for the quarter.
The Company also announced that its Board of Directors declared a cash dividend for the first quarter of 2009. The quarterly cash dividend is $0.09 per common share to be paid to holders of record at the close of business on April 30, 2009. The ex-dividend date is April 28, 2009 and the payment date is May 14, 2009.

Item 8.01 Other Events.
During Adtran's presentation at the SUPERCOMM 2009 trade show in Chicago, IL, on October 21, 2009, there was a discussion of the anticipated impact of both the Broadband Initiatives and the Broadband Technology Opportunities programs created under the American Recovery and Reimbursement Act, and in particular the pace of funding under those programs.  The Company is filing this 8-K to clarify and amplify that discussion.  Under both programs, awards for the commitment of funds to identified projects must be made no later than September 30, 2010, although currently there are suggestions this deadline may move to a later date.  While completion times of projects receiving commitments for funding may vary depending on the complexity of the project, under current guidelines projects must be substantially completed within two years from the date of the award and projects must be fully completed no later than three years from the date of the award.  Although the process remains fluid and may well change, it is our current understanding that funding will occur in accordance with the terms of the award, including times for payment.

A copy of the Performance Shares Agreement is attached hereto as and is incorporated herein by reference.
Exhibit 10.1
On November 6, 2010, the Compensation Committee made grants of performance shares to the named executive officers of the Company in the amounts set forth below:
The number of performance shares earned by the executive officers is based on the Company's relative total shareholder return against all the companies in the NASDAQ Telecommunications Index over a three-year performance period. Depending on the relative total shareholder return over the performance period, the executive officers may earn from 0% to 150% of the number of target performance shares, with the shares earned distributed at the end of the three-year performance period. A portion of the granted performance shares also vest and become deliverable upon the death or disability of a recipient or upon a change of control of the Company, as defined on the Incentive Plan. The recipients of the performance shares receive dividend credits based on the shares of common stock underlying the performance shares. The dividend credits are vested, earned and distributed in the same manner as the performance shares.

HUNTSVILLE, Ala.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--January 18, 2011--ADTRAN, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADTN) reported results for the fourth quarter of 2010. Sales increased 33% to an all time record level of $165,329,000 for the quarter, compared to $124,231,000 for the fourth quarter of 2009. Operating income increased 71% to $44,857,000 for the quarter compared to $26,236,000 for the fourth quarter of 2009. Net income increased 93% to $35,960,000 for the quarter, compared to $18,615,000 for the fourth quarter of 2009. Earnings per share, assuming dilution, increased 93% to $0.56 for the quarter, compared to $0.29 for the fourth quarter of 2009.
ADTRAN Chief Executive Officer Tom Stanton stated, Our fourth quarter results highlight the demand that has been building in our business as quarterly and yearly sales both achieved new record levels. Most notably in the quarter, total sales of our three growth categories increased 50% over the fourth quarter the prior year. This performance included individual records in each of these categories. Broadband Access saw growth of 75% over the fourth quarter the prior year led by expanding deployments of our Total Access 5000 platform and related services revenue. Our Internetworking category grew 37% over the fourth quarter the prior year as we continued to see growth across all of our distribution channels. Optical Access grew 24% over the fourth quarter the prior year, indicative of the strength we saw across all of our mobility products. We believe increasing customer investments are aligned well with our strategic areas of focus and that we are positioned well for long term growth.
The Company also reported that the provision for income taxes in the fourth quarter of 2010 included a benefit of $4.5 million as a result of federal legislation extending research tax credits for the 2010 year.
The Company reported that stock-based compensation expense for the fourth quarter of 2010 reduced diluted earnings per share by $0.03 compared to a reduction of $0.03 for the fourth quarter of 2009.

The quarterly cash dividend is $0.09 per common share to be paid to holders of record at the close of business on February 3, 2011.

Purpose and Scope

Management Incentive Bonus Plan under a plan document adopted by the Board of Directors of the Company on January 23, 2006 and effective January 1, 2006 (the "Plan"), and which was approved by the Company's shareholders in May 2006.

Background

The Committee shall establish its specific Performance Measures for a Plan Year by reference to any one or more of the following: (i) earnings before all or any taxes ("EBT"); (ii) earnings before all or any of interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA"); (iii) earnings before all or any of interest expense, taxes, depreciation, amortization and rent ("EBITDAR"); (iv) earnings before all or any of interest expense and taxes ("EBIT"); (v) net earnings; (vi) net income; (vii) operating income or margin; (viii) earnings per share; (ix) growth; (x) return on shareholders' equity; (xi) capital expenditures; (xii) expenses and expense ratio management; (xiii) return on investment; (xiv) improvements in capital structure; (xv) profitability of an identifiable business unit or product; (xvi) profit margins; (xvii) stock price; (xviii) market share; (xix) revenues; (xx) costs; (xxi) cash flow; (xxii) working capital; (xxiii) return on assets; (xxiv) economic value added; (xxv) industry indices; (xxvi) peer group performance; (xxvii) regulatory ratings; (xxviii) asset quality; (xxix) gross or net profit; (xxx) net sales; (xxxi) total shareholder return; (xxxii) sales (net or gross) measured by product line, territory, customers or other category; (xxxiii) earnings from continuing operations; (xxxiv) net worth; and (xxxv) levels of expense, cost or liability by category, operating unit or any other delineation.

Determination of Amount of Performance Awards

5.1 . As soon as practicable following the end of each Plan Year, the Committee shall certify for each Participant whether the Performance Measures for that Plan Year have been met.

Section 6.
Payment of Awards
.
Performance Awards for a given Plan Year shall be paid in cash as soon as practicable following the certification by the Committee of the attainment of the Performance Measures. The Committee shall certify the attainment of the Performance Measures in a timely manner so that the Performance Awards shall be paid no later than 2 / months after the close of the applicable Plan Year. Notwithstanding the above and Section 3.1, the Board or Committee may provide, at the time it approves any Performance Award under Section 4.1, that such Performance Award will be paid in one or more installment payments, that such installment payments will be adjusted for earnings and losses to the date of payment based on a reasonable rate of interest or predetermined actual investment designated at the time of such approval, and that any installment payment is conditioned upon the Participant's continuous employment by the Company through the date of the applicable payment (excluding certain terminations if designated by the Board or Committee).

Section 8.
Change in Control.
If a Change in Control occurs, then to the extent consistent with Code Section 162(m), the Performance Measures and the Performance Award shall be automatically adjusted on a pro-rata basis (generally, based on the number of days in the Plan Year through the date of the Change in Control, divided by the number of total days in the Plan Year), and to reflect the time value of money. If the Committee, in its discretion, established minimum, target and maximum levels of Performance Measures and the related Performance Awards for such Plan Year, then the automatic adjustment described in this section shall apply to each such level. The Committee shall certify whether each Participant has attained the Performance Measures (as adjusted) as of the date of the Change in Control. Notwithstanding any later date provided by Section 6 above, each Participant who has been certified by the Committee as having attained the Performance Measures (as adjusted) shall receive, at the closing of the Change in Control, an immediate lump sum cash payment of any Performance Award (as adjusted) to which he or she is entitled under this Section.

Section 11.
Nonassignability
.

The Board may amend, modify or terminate the Plan at any time and from time to time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such amendment, modification or termination shall affect the payment of a Performance Award for a Plan Year already ended.

HUNTSVILLE, Ala.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 12, 2011--ADTRAN, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADTN) reported results for the second quarter of 2011. Sales increased 23% to an all time record level of $184,227,000 for the quarter, compared to $150,361,000 for the second quarter of 2010. Operating income increased 33% to an all time record level of $51,310,000 for the quarter compared to $38,617,000 for the second quarter of 2010.

ADTRAN Chief Executive Officer Tom Stanton stated, Our Company had an outstanding quarter reaching new highs on multiple fronts. The performance was led by our growth areas which combined grew 48% over the prior year, now representing 72% of our total company revenue. Moreover, every component of our growth areas, which include Broadband Access, Optical Access and Internetworking, individually attained new revenue highs. Broadband Access grew an impressive 71% over second quarter 2010, driven by the continued success of our Total Access 5000 and Fiber-to-the-Node platforms. Optical Access grew 36% and Internetworking grew 18%. These results allowed the company to achieve its fifth consecutive quarterly revenue record. As demonstrated by our results, we believe our highly differentiated solutions are exceptionally well positioned to take advantage of secular trends occurring in the markets we serve.
The Company reported that stock-based compensation expense for the second quarter of 2011 reduced diluted earnings per share by $0.03 compared to a reduction of $0.03 for the second quarter of 2010.

The Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the President, or the person presiding at a meeting of stockholders may appoint one or more persons to act as inspectors of voting at any meeting with respect to any matter to be submitted to a vote of stockholders at such meeting, with such powers and duties, not inconsistent with applicable law, as may be appropriate.

Exhibit 99.1
HUNTSVILLE, Ala. and ESPOO, Finland (BUSINESS WIRE)( December 12, 2011)., (NASDAQ:ADTN), a leading provider of next-generation networking solutions, announced today that it plans to acquire, through an asset sale and purchase agreement, the fixed line Broadband Access business (BBA), and associated professional services and network management solutions.

ADTRAN, Inc

As part of this planned transaction, up to approximately 400 people, including engineering, R&D, sales and professional services employees, are expected to transfer to ADTRAN globally. The agreement also includes provisions which would allow ADTRAN solutions to be incorporated by Nokia Siemens Networks into its customer propositions, broadening ADTRAN's business opportunities.
The planned transaction is expected to close by the end of April 2012 subject to the completion of a consultation process with certain employees and their representatives, finalization of transition services agreements and customary closing conditions. After close of the planned transaction ADTRAN expects the acquired business will be neutral to diluted earnings per share for the first full year and accretive thereafter.
"Nokia Siemens Networks' long standing customer relationships, combined with ADTRAN's long term focus and financial strength, make this a very favorable outcome for customers, employees and shareholders. With this planned acquisition, ADTRAN will combine its success with the strength of Nokia Siemens Networks' Broadband Access business to deliver a full portfolio of solutions to meet customer needs on a global scale," said ADTRAN CEO Tom Stanton. "Service providers around the world are seeing high bandwidth services as an integral component of their future opportunities. This strategic acquisition would position ADTRAN in key markets with an established customer base; complementary market-focused products; along with engineering, R&D, sales and professional services resources that will enable ADTRAN to take a significant step forward as one of the world's leading communications solutions providers."
"We believe that this planned divestment would provide our existing fixed broadband access customers with a continuous high-quality service from a company focused on their needs," said Marc Rouanne, head of Mobile Broadband at Nokia Siemens Networks. "The planned sale is in line with our new strategy to increase our focus on the mobile broadband and services market."

EXHIBIT 99.1
HUNTSVILLE, ALABAMAADTRAN, Inc. (NASDAQ: ADTN) announced revised revenue and earnings estimates for the first quarter ending March 31, 2012. Based upon information currently available, revenue for the quarter is expected to range from $130 million to $135 million. GAAP earnings per share for the quarter, assuming dilution, are expected to range from $0.17 to $0.20. Non-GAAP earnings per share for the quarter are expected to range from $0.22 to $0.25. Non-GAAP earnings per share exclude the effect of acquisition related expenses, amortizations and adjustments related to the acquisition of Bluesocket, Inc. and the planned acquisition of the NSN Broadband Access business, and stock compensation expense.
ADTRAN Chief Executive Officer Tom Stanton stated, "Two issues impacted us in the first quarter. The first was a slower than normal start to the seasonal buying pattern at some of our carrier customers. The second, which had a greater impact, was a delay in both the start and ramp of orders from a carrier customer due to new system implementations. Order rates for the month of March have substantially improved and we are encouraged that the prior slowdown that we experienced is behind us."
The Company reported that acquisition related expenses, amortizations and adjustments related to the acquisition of Bluesocket, Inc. and the planned acquisition of the NSN Broadband Access business is estimated to reduce diluted earnings per share by $0.02 for the first quarter 2012.
The Company also reported that stock-based compensation expense is estimated to reduce diluted earnings per share by $0.03 for the first quarter of 2012.

EXHIBIT INDEX

Exhibit 99.1
ADTRAN, Inc. Reports Results for the First Quarter 2012 and Declares Quarterly Cash Dividend
HUNTSVILLE, Ala.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 10, 2012--ADTRAN, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADTN) reported results for the first quarter 2012. For the quarter, sales were $134,735,000 compared to $165,522,000 for the first quarter of 2011. Net income was $12,960,000 for the quarter compared to $34,258,000 for the first quarter of 2011. Earnings per share, assuming dilution, were $0.20 for the quarter compared to $0.52 for the first quarter of 2011. Non-GAAP earnings per share for the quarter were $0.25 compared to $0.55 for the first quarter of 2011. Non-GAAP earnings per share exclude the effect of acquisition related expenses, amortizations and adjustments related to the acquisition of Bluesocket, Inc. and the planned acquisition of the NSN Broadband Access business, and stock compensation expense. The reconciliation between GAAP earnings per share, diluted, and non-GAAP earnings per share, diluted, is in the table provided.
ADTRAN Chief Executive Officer Tom Stanton stated, As expected, we saw an improvement late in the quarter after a slower than normal start in carrier spending. As a result of this slow start, Broadband Access revenues for the quarter were $49.5 million, in range with the same period last year. Our Internetworking category saw another strong performance with revenues of $41.0 million, an increase of 25% from the same period last year. Revenues for our core product areas in total for the quarter were $104.7 million, basically flat compared to the same period last year. Although the quarter did not meet our initial expectations, we believe the issues relate to timing, not market positioning, and that our strategic areas of focus are well aligned with global market trends and will provide long term growth for our company.
The Company also announced that its Board of Directors declared a cash dividend for the first quarter of 2012. The quarterly cash dividend is $0.09 per common share to be paid to holders of record at the close of business on April 26, 2012. The ex-dividend date is April 24, 2012 and the payment date is May 10, 2012.

Exhibit 99.1
ADTRAN, Inc. Reports Results for the Second Quarter 2012 and Declares Quarterly Cash Dividend
HUNTSVILLE, Ala.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 10, 2012--ADTRAN, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADTN) reported results for the second quarter 2012. For the quarter, sales were $183,998,000 compared to $184,227,000 for the second quarter of 2011. Net income was $21,070,000 for the quarter compared to $36,943,000 for the second quarter of 2011. Earnings per share, assuming dilution, were $0.33 for the quarter compared to $0.56 for the second quarter of 2011. Non-GAAP earnings per share for the quarter were $0.38 compared to $0.59 for the second quarter of 2011. Non-GAAP earnings per share exclude the effect of acquisition related expenses, amortizations and adjustments related to the acquisitions of the NSN Broadband Access business and Bluesocket, Inc. and stock compensation expense. The reconciliation between GAAP earnings per share, diluted, and non-GAAP earnings per share, diluted, is in the table provided.
ADTRAN Chief Executive Officer Tom Stanton stated, Our results for the second quarter reflect a tightening spending environment. Total quarterly revenues grew 37% sequentially, with organic revenues (excluding the recently acquired NSN BBA business) up 20%, representing a flat year over year performance. Our Broadband Access category grew 38% (8% organic) over the same period last year. Our Internetworking category grew 6% over the same period last year. Total core products which include Broadband Access, Optical and Internetworking, grew 17% (flat organically) over the same period last year and now represent 84% of total revenues. Decreasing visibility leaves us cautious for the near term but we are confident that our strong customer alignment and increasing global footprint will deliver long term growth for the company.
The Company also announced that its Board of Directors declared a cash dividend for the second quarter of 2012. The quarterly cash dividend is $0.09 per common share to be paid to holders of record at the close of business on July 26, 2012. The ex-dividend date is July 24, 2012 and the payment date is August 9, 2012.

Exhibit 99.1
HUNTSVILLE, ALABAMA - ADTRAN, Inc. (NASDAQ: ADTN) announced revised revenue and earnings estimates for the third quarter ending September 30, 2012. Based upon information currently available, revenue for the quarter is expected to be approximately $162 million. GAAP earnings per share for the quarter, assuming dilution, are expected to range from $0.14 to $0.15. Non-GAAP earnings per share for the quarter are expected to range from $0.18 to $0.19.
ADTRAN Chief Executive Officer Tom Stanton stated, "Our performance this quarter continued to be affected by a challenging spending environment stemming largely from macro-economic and regulatory concerns. The largest impact continues to be in the U.S. carrier market where we saw continuing delays in project rollouts exacerbated by a decrease in legacy product sales. Although timing the resolution to these macro concerns remains challenging, recent bidding activity in Tier 1 and Tier 2 carrier accounts both domestically and abroad leave us very confident about our positioning as these markets rebound."
Non-GAAP earnings per share exclude the effect of acquisition related expenses, amortizations and adjustments, and stock compensation expense.
