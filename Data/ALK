ITEM 4. Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant
On May 22, 2002, Alaska Air Group (Air Group) determined for itself and on behalf of its subsidiaries, Alaska Airlines, Inc. (Alaska) and Horizon Air Industries, Inc. (Horizon), to dismiss its independent public accountants, Arthur Andersen LLP (Andersen), and to select Deloitte & Touche LLP to serve as its new independent auditors for the year ending December 31, 2002. The change in accountants will become effective upon completion of the customary client acceptance procedures of Deloitte & Touche LLP. This determination was recommended by Air Group's Audit Committee and approved by Air Group's Board of Directors.
Andersen's reports on Air Group's, Alaska's and Horizon's financial statements for each of the years ended December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000 did not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles.
During the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 and the interim period between December 31, 2001 and the date of this Form 8-K, there were no disagreements between Air Group, Alaska or Horizon and Andersen on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure which, if not resolved to Andersen's satisfaction, would have caused them to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in connection with their report for such years; and there were no reportable events as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.
Air Group has provided Andersen with a copy of the foregoing disclosures and has requested a letter from Andersen stating whether it agrees with the disclosures contained herein. The Company expects to file this letter with the Commission within ten business days of the date of this Report.
During the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 and through the date of this Form 8-K, neither Air Group nor Alaska nor Horizon nor anyone acting on their behalf consulted Deloitte & Touche LLP with respect to the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on Air Group's or Alaska's or Horizon's financial statements, or any other matters or reportable events listed in Items 304(a)(2)(i) and (ii) of Regulation S-K.

Exhibit 99.1 Statement Under Oath of Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer Regarding Facts and Circumstances Relating to Exchange Act Filings I, John F. Kelly, state and attest that: (1) To the best of my knowledge, based upon a review of the covered reports of Alaska Air Group, Inc., and, except as set forth on Exhibit A hereto or as corrected or supplemented in a subsequent covered report: - no covered report contained an untrue statement of a material fact as of the end of the period covered by such report (or in the case of a report on Form 8-K or definitive proxy materials, as of the date on which it was filed); and - no covered report omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements in the covered report, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading as of the end of the period covered by such report (or in the case of a report on Form 8-K or definitive proxy materials, as of the date on which it was filed). (2) I have reviewed the contents of this statement with the Company's audit committee. (3) In this statement under oath, each of the following, if filed on or before the date of this statement, is a "covered report": - the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Commission on March 3, 2002 for fiscal year ended December 31, 2001 of Alaska Air Group, Inc; - all reports on Form 10-Q, all reports on Form 8-K and all definitive proxy materials of Alaska Air Group, Inc. filed with the Commission subsequent to the filing of the Form 10-K identified above; and - any amendments to any of the foregoing. /s/ John F. Kelly Subscribed and sworn to before ------------------------------ me this____ day of August, 2002. John F. Kelly Date: August 13, 2002 ---------------------- Notary Public My Commission Expires:
EXHIBIT A As previously announced, in June 2002 Alaska Air Group, Inc. (the "Company") changed its accounting policies relating to the accrual for certain lease return costs and the capitalization of software development costs. These changes, which are more fully described below, are being implemented following a consultation with the Company's new independent auditors, who were appointed in May 2002. The Company will be restating its financial statements and related filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The restatements will change the periods in which certain expenses are recognized. The effect of these changes is as shown in the Company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2002, but in summary, they result in an increase of $29.3 million of equity as of June 30, 2002 and modestly better results than those previously reported. However, for the first and second quarters of 2001, operating expenses are slightly higher than those previously reported and the operating result is slightly lower. For future periods, these changes may affect the timing and amounts of the Company's reported operating expenses. Additionally, the Company changed its accounting for aircraft purchase commitments assumed by a third party, and made a reclassification of deferred income taxes, both of which do not impact equity or earnings. Leased Aircraft Return Costs The Company leases many of its aircraft under relatively long-term operating lease agreements. These aircraft are subject to periodic airframe and engine overhauls based on the Company's maintenance program. The Company's previous policy was to capitalize these overhauls and amortize the costs over the estimated lives of the overhauls. Separately, many of the Company's lease agreements contain provisions which require that at the end of the lease, either certain minimum times remain until the next overhaul or the Company make a cash payment to the lessor. At the inception of the lease, the Company does not know the balance between actual time remaining to the next overhaul and cash payments that will be used to satisfied its return commitments. Under the previous method, the Company accrued for the costs of returning leased aircraft, including any cash payments due to lessors and any unamortized overhauls, on a straight-line basis over the lives of the leases. Airframe and engine overhauls will now be capitalized and amortized over the remaining lease term, if shorter than the life of the overhaul. Additionally, under our new method, since the timing and amount of cash payments cannot be reasonably predicted at the inception of the lease, the Company will be accruing cash payments expected to be made to lessors over the last few years of the lease, versus over the entire lease term. Internally Developed Software The Company also revised its accounting practices for certain costs of internally developed software. These costs were previously charged to expense as they were incurred, and they will now be capitalized and amortized over the estimated lives of the software. Aircraft Purchase Commitments The Company has an aircraft purchase commitment, which may trigger a liability under certain events of default. The Company previously recognized a portion of this commitment which was funded by a third party as a liability, and related aircraft purchase deposits, on its
balance sheet. Since the executory contract for the purchase commitment is not an obligation of the Company until the aircraft is delivered, this commitment is now disclosed as a purchase commitment and not included in long-term debt or deposits for future flight equipment. The Company expects to complete the revisions to its historical financial statements and file appropriate amendments with the SEC as soon as practicable. To the extent these revisions may involve the reaudit of historical financial statements by the Company's new independent auditors, they could result in the restatement of other items not described in this Exhibit, although I have no knowledge of any such required restatements.

Exhibit 99.2 Statement Under Oath of Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer Regarding Facts and Circumstances Relating to Exchange Act Filings I, Bradley D. Tilden, state and attest that: (1) To the best of my knowledge, based upon a review of the covered reports of Alaska Air Group, Inc., and, except as set forth on Exhibit A hereto or as corrected or supplemented in a subsequent covered report: - no covered report contained an untrue statement of a material fact as of the end of the period covered by such report (or in the case of a report on Form 8-K or definitive proxy materials, as of the date on which it was filed); and - no covered report omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements in the covered report, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading as of the end of the period covered by such report (or in the case of a report on Form 8-K or definitive proxy materials, as of the date on which it was filed). (2) I have reviewed the contents of this statement with the Company's audit committee. (3) In this statement under oath, each of the following, if filed on or before the date of this statement, is a "covered report": - the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Commission on March 3, 2002 for fiscal year ended December 31, 2001 of Alaska Air Group, Inc; - all reports on Form 10-Q, all reports on Form 8-K and all definitive proxy materials of Alaska Air Group, Inc. filed with the Commission subsequent to the filing of the Form 10-K identified above; and - any amendments to any of the foregoing. /s/ Bradley D.

Third Quarter 2002 Estimates
For September 2002, Alaska Airlines experienced a 38.3% increase in traffic on a 33.5% increase in capacity over the same period in 2001. September 2001 traffic, capacity and load factors were adversely impacted by the September 11th terrorists attacks. Alaska Airlines operated approximately 76 percent of its normal flight schedule during the month of September 2001. Had Alaska Airlines operated its normal flight schedule last year, traffic and capacity would be up 5.1 percent and 1.4 percent respectively. For August 2002, RASM declined 3.0% as compared to August 2001. For July 2002, RASM declined 5.4% as compared to July 2001.

Fourth Quarter 2002 Estimates
For October 2002, Alaska experienced a 18.4% increase in traffic on a 23.4% increase in capacity.

Compared to October 2000, traffic in 2002 increased 9.8%, capacity increased 10.5% , and RASM decreased 9.7%.
For October 2002, Horizon experienced a 26.8% increase in traffic on a 36.4% increase in capacity.

In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87, "Employers' Accounting for Pensions" (SFAS 87), the Company will record a non-cash charge to equity in December 2002 relating to the defined benefit pension plans that the Company sponsors for eligible employees. The Company estimates this charge will be approximately $80 million, net of taxes. This equity charge is consistent with previously discussed expectations.
Other Events
In the third quarter of 2002, the Company discussed that it was in the process of completing the second step of its impairment test in connection with the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142. In the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company completed this impairment test and determined that all of the Company's goodwill was impaired. As a result, the Company expects to record a one-time, non-cash charge, effective January 1, 2002 of $51.4 million, net of taxes to write-off all of its goodwill. This charge is nonoperational in nature and will be reflected as a cumulative effect of accounting change in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2002.

EXHIBIT 99.1 Contact: Brad Tilden -or- Lou Cancelmi 206/433-3362 206/433-3170 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE January 30, 2003 ALASKA AIR GROUP REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS SEATTLE -- Alaska Air Group, Inc. (NYSE:ALK) today reported a fourth quarter net loss of $43.1 million, or $1.62 per share, compared with a net loss of $37.4 million, or $1.41 per share, during the corresponding quarter in 2001. The company's fourth quarter results for 2001 include pre-tax compensation of $52.3 million that was received pursuant to the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act and a $10.2 million special charge related to the retirement of Horizon's F-28 fleet. Excluding these items, the company lost $63.9 million or $2.41 per share in the fourth quarter of 2001. For the full year, Alaska Air Group lost $118.6 million or $4.47 per share in 2002. Included in the company's 2002 full year results is a $51.4 million charge related to the write off of goodwill in connection with the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142. Excluding this charge, the company lost $67.2 million or $2.53 per share versus a loss of $43.4 million or $1.64 per share in 2001. Due to the September 11 terrorist acts, year over year comparisons of both financial and operational information are significantly impacted. "As expected, it was a difficult quarter, ending yet another difficult year for both the industry and Alaska Air Group," said John F. Kelly, chairman and chief executive officer. "And yet as difficult as it was, we continued to outperform most of the industry by maintaining our focus on delivering an award-winning product, by implementing further cost management initiatives, and by strengthening our network through the re-deployment of a portion of our fleet to strategic new markets. We expect that further changes in our industry will occur, but feel that we're well positioned to deal with the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead." Operationally, Alaska Airlines' passenger traffic in the fourth quarter increased 15.6 percent on a capacity increase of 15.5 percent. Load factor increased 0.1 points to 66.5 percent. The airline's operating revenue per available seat mile (ASM) decreased 3.4 percent, while its operating cost per ASM excluding fuel decreased 8.9 percent. Alaska's pretax loss was $58.6 million compared to a pretax loss of $18.8 million a year earlier. Alaska's 2001 pretax income includes $52.9 million of U.S. government compensation.
Horizon Air's passenger traffic in the fourth quarter increased 28.7 percent on a 33.3 percent capacity increase. Load factor decreased by 2.2 points to 61.1 percent. The airline's operating revenue per ASM decreased 8.8 percent, while its operating cost per ASM excluding special charge decreased 24.6 percent. Excluding fuel and special charge, cost per ASM decreased 26.8 percent. Horizon's pretax loss was $5.8 million, compared to a pretax loss of $35.0 million a year earlier. Horizon's 2001 pretax income includes $0.6 million of U.S. government compensation. Alaska Air Group continues to have a strong cash position at December 31, 2002 with approximately $636 million in cash and marketable securities. The company's debt-to-capital ratio, assuming aircraft operating leases are capitalized at seven times annualized rent, was 77 percent. During the quarter, the company also recorded a non-cash charge to equity of $87.2 million (net of income taxes of $52.5 million) relating to the defined benefit pension plans that the company sponsors for eligible employees. This change is the result of an unfunded accrued benefit obligation resulting from lower than expected return on plan assets. A conference call regarding year-end and fourth quarter results will be simulcast via the Internet at 9:00 a.m. Pacific Standard Time. It may be accessed through the company's website at www.alaskaair.com. This report may contain forward-looking statements that are based on the best information currently available to management.

First Quarter 2003
Alaska Airlines' January traffic increased 13.0% to 1.010 billion revenue passenger miles (RPMs) from 894 million flown a year earlier. Capacity during January was 1.605 billion available seat miles (ASMs), 12.2% higher than the 1.430 billion in January 2002.

The private placement will be conducted pursuant to Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Up to an additional $25 million of notes may be sold upon the exercise of a 30-day overallotment option granted to the initial purchasers of the notes. The notes will bear cash interest at a variable rate of interest of 3-month LIBOR plus 2.50% for five years. Thereafter, the notes will cease bearing cash interest. Instead, from such date the original principal amount of each note will increase daily by the variable yield, which will equal the variable interest rate, up to a maximum rate of 5.25%, to produce the variable principal amount. The notes will be convertible, at the option of the holder, only upon the occurrence of certain events, into shares of the company's common stock (or cash, at the company's option, as described below) at a conversion price of $26.00 per share, representing a 35.4 percent premium over the $19.20 per share closing price on March 17, 2003 of the company's common shares on the NYSE. Upon conversion, the company may deliver, in lieu of common stock, cash or a combination of cash and common stock. The company may redeem all or a portion of the notes for cash at any time on or after the third anniversary of the issuance of the notes. In addition, holders may require the company to purchase all or a portion of their notes on the fifth, 10th and 15th anniversaries of the issuance of the notes. The company may choose to pay the purchase price of such notes in cash or common stock or a combination of cash and common stock. In addition, upon a change in control of the company, each holder may require the company to purchase for cash all or a portion of such holder's notes. The notes will be senior unsecured obligations and will rank equally with the Alaska Air Group's future senior unsecured indebtedness. A portion of the net proceeds from the offering will be used to purchase U.S. government securities, the proceeds of which will serve as collateral for the first 3 years of interest payments on the notes. The company intends to use the remaining net proceeds from the offering for working capital requirements and general corporate purposes. The notes and the common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold in the United States, except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.

 
Exhibit 99.1
     SEATTLE  Alaska Air Group, Inc. (NYSE:ALK) today reported a first quarter net loss of $56.3 million, or $2.12 per share, compared with a net loss of $85.1 million, or $3.21 per share, during the corresponding quarter in 2002. The first quarter results were negatively impacted by increased fuel prices and lower demand resulting from the war in Iraq and a sluggish U.S. economy. The company's first quarter results for 2002 include a $51.4 million charge related to the write-off of goodwill in connection with the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142. Excluding this charge, the company lost $33.7 million or $1.27 per share in the first quarter of 2002.
     "The combination of a flagging economy, higher fuel prices and the war in Iraq made this a difficult quarter for both Alaska Air Group and the industry," said John F. Kelly, chairman and chief executive officer. "We're finding that we can continue to grow, contrary to most of the industry, but it's clear that we'll need to continue to adjust our business model by achieving our cost management goals."
     During the quarter, Alaska successfully completed the private placement of $150 million of floating rate convertible bonds. "These proceeds strengthen an already strong liquidity position, and enhance our ability to implement our strategy and further position Alaska for success in this changing marketplace," said Kelly.
     Operationally, Alaska Airlines' passenger traffic in the first quarter increased 5.6 percent on a capacity increase of 5.4 percent. Load factor was consistent with the prior year at 66.7 percent. The airline's operating revenue per available seat mile (ASM) decreased 1.7 percent, while its operating cost per ASM excluding fuel decreased 1.3 percent. Alaska's pretax loss was $70.6 million compared to a pretax loss of $41.7 million a year earlier.
 
Exhibit 99.1
     Horizon Air's passenger traffic in the first quarter increased 8.6 percent on a 15.9 percent capacity increase. Load factor decreased by 3.9 points to 58.1 percent. The airline's operating revenue per ASM decreased 8.5 percent, while its operating cost per ASM excluding fuel decreased 7.5 percent. Horizon's pretax loss was $15.3 million, compared to a pretax loss of $10.2 million a year earlier.
     Alaska Air Group continues to have a strong cash position at March 31, 2003 with approximately $616 million in cash and marketable securities. The company's debt-to-capital ratio, assuming aircraft operating leases are capitalized at seven times annualized rent, was 79 percent.
     A conference call regarding the first quarter results will be simulcast via the Internet at 8:30 a.m. Pacific Standard Time. It may be accessed through the company's website at www.alaskaair.com.

Second Quarter 2003
Alaska Airlines' April traffic increased 4.0% to 1.123 billion revenue passenger miles (RPMs) from 1.080 billion flown a year earlier. Capacity during April was 1.636 billion available seat miles (ASMs), 3.2% higher than the 1.586 billion in April 2002.

For April 2003, revenue per available seat mile (RASM) increased by 2.1% as compared to April 2002. This increase in RASM is due principally to an increase in load factor.
Horizon Air's April traffic increased 8.0% to 120.0 million RPMs from 111.1 million flown a year earlier. Capacity for April was 204.2 million ASMs, 6.4% higher than the 191.9 million in April 2002.

Exhibit 99.1
CHAIRMAN OF ALASKA AIR GROUP RETIRES
     SEATTLE  John F. Kelly, 58, the chairman of Alaska Air Group (ALK:NYSE), officially retires today at the conclusion of the company's annual shareholders meeting.
     Kelly's successor is William S. Ayer, 48, president and chief executive officer of Alaska Air Group and president, chairman and chief executive officer of Alaska Airlines. Ayer also assumes Kelly's responsibilities as chairman of Horizon Air, Inc. Jeffrey D. Pinneo, president and chief executive officer of Horizon, will report to Ayer.
     "Over a 27-year career with this company, John has been the right man at the right place at the right time during some of the most critical periods that faced Alaska and Horizon," said Ayer. "His marketing acumen, his extraordinary leadership, his passion for the application of technology in the air and on the ground  along with his instinct for the needs of employees and customers  are recognized throughout the industry."
     Ayer will tell shareholders attending the meeting today that the company's primary goal is to rigorously adhere to ongoing efforts to reduce costs in order to remain competitive within the industry. At the same time, he said he intends to maintain the tradition of customer-focused service that are hallmarks of both Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air.
     Ayer became president of Alaska Air Group and chairman of Alaska Airlines in February of this year. Prior to that he served Alaska Airlines as president and CEO. He was elected to the board of directors of Alaska Air Group in 1999.
 
     A veteran of 20 years with both Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air, Ayer joined Alaska in 1995 as vice president of marketing and planning. In 1997 he became the carrier's senior vice president of customer service, marketing and planning. Before coming to Alaska, he was Horizon Air's senior vice president of operations and, prior to that, held several positions with the airline's marketing department, including vice president of marketing and planning.
     In other news from the meeting, Mary Jane Fate, 69, is retiring from the board of directors after nearly 25 years of service. A member of the board's compensation committee, Fate is the general manager of a family business in Fairbanks and serves as commissioner of the U.S. Arctic Research Commission under an appointment by President George W. Bush.
     Preliminary voting results indicate shareholders elected incumbent board members Bruce R. Kennedy, Jessie J. Knight, Jr., and J. Kenneth Thompson to three-year terms. Kennedy, former chairman, chief executive officer and president of Alaska Air Group, has been a member of the board for 31 years. Knight, president and chief executive officer of the San Diego Regional Chamber of Commerce, was appointed to the board at the end of 2002. Thompson, president of Pacific Rim Leadership Development in Anchorage, has been a member of the board since 1999.
     Shareholder proposals on simple-majority voting; the annual election of each director; shareholder approval of any stockholder rights plan; and expensing stock options are expected to pass, pending a final tally. Proposals on amending the certificate of incorporation; selling the company; an independent board chairman; and reporting on employee stock ownership appear to have been defeated.
     Alaska Air Group is the parent company of Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air Industries. Together, Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air serve more than 80 cities in Alaska, Mexico, Canada and the Lower 48 states.

EXHIBIT 99.1 Contact: Brad Tilden -or- Lou Cancelmi 206/392-5362 206/392-5170 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE June 24, 2003 ALASKA MEETS WITH LABOR UNIONS TO DISCUSS VISION FOR THE FUTURE SEATTLE - Alaska Airlines, Inc. (Alaska), a wholly owned subsidiary of Alaska Air Group, Inc. (NYSE:ALK), today met with leaders of its unions to begin a dialog over how the company and its labor groups can work cooperatively to better position the company for growth and success in the years ahead. Alaska, already engaged in an extensive cost management program that is reviewing every aspect of its operations, confirmed today that it is seeking to lower its cost per available seat mile (CASM), excluding fuel, to 7.25 cents by 2005. However, the company cautioned analysts and investors that this is a goal and should not, at this point, be viewed as a prediction of future performance. The company said the aim of its cost reduction efforts is to achieve a structure that enables it to offer customers the services they want at fares they're willing to pay; to earn a reasonable profit; to grow its business and take advantage of opportunities; and to secure the futures of all its employees. The company said it intends to work in collaboration with its employees to tap their creativity and their commitment to help meet the company's substantial challenges. Alaska also stated that it has already identified initiatives that it believes will lower its annual operating costs by more than $100 million. The Company intends to achieve approximately $200 million in additional savings through a combination of additional product and other cost-management initiatives, market-based wage adjustments, a common health and retirement benefits package for every work group and work rule changes focusing on greater efficiency in operations. - more -

Exhibit 99.1
     SEATTLE  Aided by $71.4 million in government assistance ($44.3 million after tax), Alaska Air Group, Inc. (NYSE:ALK) today reported second quarter net income of $45.2 million, or $1.70 per share, compared with a net loss of $2.9 million, or $0.11 per share, in the second quarter of 2002. Without the non-recurring compensation received under the Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act, the company's net income during the quarter was $0.9 million, or $0.03 per share.
     The company's net loss for the six months ended June 30, 2003 was $11.1 million, or $0.42 per share, compared to a net loss of $88.0 million, or $3.32 per share, during the same period in 2002. The 2002 net loss includes $51.4 million, or $1.94 per share, related to the write-off of goodwill in connection with the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142. Excluding the government compensation received in 2003 and the write-off of goodwill in 2002, our net loss for the six months ended 2003 was $55.4 million ($2.08 per share) versus a loss of $36.6 million ($1.38 per share) for 2002.
     "We eked out a small amount of net income for the quarter excluding the government compensation," said Bill Ayer, chairman and chief executive officer. "We are working hard to achieve our cost management objectives and this quarter's results are an encouraging sign that initiatives we have implemented to date are helping us with our plan to return to profitability on a full year basis."
     Operationally, Alaska Airlines' passenger traffic in the second quarter increased 9.1 percent on a capacity increase of 5.7 percent. Alaska's load factor increased 2.2 percentage points to 70.6 percent compared to the same period in 2002. Alaska's operating revenue per available seat mile (ASM) increased 0.9 percent, while its operating cost per ASM excluding fuel decreased 1.2 percent. Alaska's pretax income was $59.6 million, or $6.8 million excluding government compensation, compared to a pretax loss of $0.1 million in 2002.
 
     Horizon Air's passenger traffic in the second quarter increased 6.9 percent on a 4.3 percent capacity increase. Horizon's load factor increased by 1.6 points to 63.3 percent. Horizon's operating revenue per ASM increased 2.9 percent, while its operating cost per ASM excluding fuel increased 2.4 percent. Horizon's pretax income was $15.7 million, or a loss of $2.9 million excluding government compensation, compared to a pretax loss of $2.8 million in 2002.
     Alaska Air Group had cash and short-term investments at June 30, 2003 of approximately $722 million compared to $636 million at December 31, 2002. The increased balance reflects the receipt of $71.4 million of government compensation and $123.2 million net proceeds received in connection with the completion of a private placement of floating rate convertible bonds on March 21, 2003. The company's debt-to-capital ratio, assuming aircraft operating leases are capitalized at seven times annualized rent, was 79 percent at June 30, 2003 compared to 77 percent as of December 31, 2002.
     A summary of financial and statistical data for Alaska Airlines and Horizon, as well as a reconciliation of the reported non-GAAP financial measures, can be found on pages 5-7.
     A conference call regarding the first quarter results will be simulcast via the Internet at 8:30 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time. It may be accessed through our website at www.alaskaair.com.

Pursuant to new guidelines issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission, we are providing the following reconciliation of non-GAAP performance indicators to their comparable financial measures reported on a GAAP basis. Our disclosure of operating costs and cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel, provides us the ability to measure and monitor our performance both with and without the cost of aircraft fuel as both the cost and availability of fuel are subject to economic and political factors beyond our control. We also believe that disclosing net income (loss) and diluted earnings (loss) per share excluding non-recurring items is helpful to investors in evaluating our operational performance because we believe the reimbursements received from the government and the write-off of goodwill are non-recurring events. The following table reconciles operating expenses excluding fuel and operating expense per ASM excluding fuel for Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Horizon Air Industries, Inc.:
Note 1:
     The following table summarizes Alaska Air Group, Inc.'s net earnings (loss) and diluted income (loss) per share during 2002 and 2003 excluding non-recurring items and as reported in accordance with GAAP (dollars in millions):

Third Quarter 2003
Alaska's July traffic increased 15.2% to 1.506 billion revenue passenger miles (RPMs) from 1.308 billion flown a year earlier. Capacity during July was 2.0 billion available seat miles (ASMs), 10.5% higher than the 1.810 billion in July 2002.

For July 2003, RASM increased by 3.3% as compared to July 2002. This increase in RASM is primarily due to an increase in load factor, partially offset by a slight decrease in yield.
Horizon's July traffic increased 15.4% to 166.4 million RPMs from 144.3 million flown a year earlier. Capacity for July was 244.7 million ASMs, 8.6% higher than last year's 225.2 million.

Cash and Short-Term Investments
Cash and short-term investments amounted to approximately $699 million at July 31, 2003 compared to $722 million at June 30, 2003.

Exhibit 99.1
     SEATTLE  Alaska Air Group, Inc. (NYSE:ALK) today reported third quarter net income of $40.7 million, or $1.52 per share, compared to net income of $12.5 million, or $0.47 per share, in the third quarter of 2002.
     "Our results were positively affected by stronger loads at both Alaska and Horizon, continued focus on our cost management efforts, and the government's temporary waiver of security fees," said Bill Ayer, chairman and chief executive officer. "We're encouraged by these numbers, but have considerable work to do to return to profitability on a full-year basis. Our people have shown tremendous dedication and commitment to customers while working together to deal with fundamental changes in our industry."
     For the nine months ending September 30, 2003, net income was $29.6 million, or $1.11 per share, compared to a net loss of $75.5 million, or $2.84 per share, during the same period in 2002. Excluding government compensation received in 2003 and a write-off of goodwill in 2002, the company's net loss for the first nine months of 2003 was $14.7 million ($0.55 per share) versus a loss of $24.4 million ($0.92 per share) for 2002. The 2003 government assistance amounted to $71.4 million ($44.3 million after tax) under the Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act. The 2002 net loss included $51.4 million, or $1.93 per share, related to the write-off of goodwill in connection with the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142.
     Operationally, Alaska Airlines' passenger traffic in the third quarter increased 12.3 percent on a capacity increase of 9.3 percent. Alaska's load factor increased 2.0 percentage points to 72.5 percent compared to the same period in 2002. Alaska's operating revenue per available seat mile (ASM) increased 4.5 percent, while its operating cost per ASM excluding fuel decreased 3.9 percent. Alaska's pretax income was $50.1 million, compared to $13.1 million in 2002.
 
     Horizon Air's passenger traffic in the third quarter increased 9.9 percent on a 6.7 percent capacity increase. Horizon's load factor increased by 1.9 percentage points to 66.5 percent compared to the same period in 2002. Horizon's operating revenue per ASM increased 6.7 percent, while its operating cost per ASM excluding fuel decreased 5.1 percent. Horizon's pretax income was $19.5 million, compared to $5.9 million in 2002.
     Alaska Air Group had cash and short-term investments at September 30, 2003 of approximately $749 million compared to $636 million at December 31, 2002. The increased balance reflects the receipt of $71.4 million of government compensation and $123.2 million net proceeds received in connection with the completion of a private placement of floating rate convertible bonds on March 21, 2003. The company's debt-to-capital ratio, assuming aircraft operating leases are capitalized at seven times annualized rent, was 78 percent at September 30, 2003 compared to 77 percent as of December 31, 2002.
     A summary of financial and statistical data for Alaska Airlines and Horizon as well as a reconciliation of the reported non-GAAP financial measures can be found on pages 5-7.
     A conference call regarding the first quarter results will be simulcast via the Internet at 8:30 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time. It may be accessed through our website at www.alaskaair.com.
     This report may contain forward-looking statements that are based on the best information currently available to management. These forward-looking statements are intended to be subject to the safe harbor protection provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements are indicated by phrases such as "will," "should," "the company believes," "we expect" or any other language indicating a prediction of future events. There can be no assurance that actual developments will be those anticipated by the company. Actual results could differ materially from those projected as a result of a number of factors, some of which the company cannot predict or control. For a discussion of these factors, please see Item 1 of the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2002.

Note 1:
Pursuant to new guidelines issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission, we are providing the following reconciliation of non-GAAP performance indicators to their comparable financial measures reported on a GAAP basis. Our disclosure of operating costs and cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel, provides us the ability to measure and monitor our performance both with and without the cost of aircraft fuel as both the cost and availability of fuel are subject to economic and political factors beyond our control. We also believe that disclosing net income (loss) and diluted earnings (loss) per share excluding non-recurring items is helpful to investors in evaluating our operational performance because we believe the reimbursements received from the government and the write-off of goodwill are non-recurring events. The following table reconciles operating expenses excluding fuel and operating expense per ASM excluding fuel for Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Horizon Air Industries, Inc.:
The following table summarizes Alaska Air Group, Inc.'s net earnings (loss) and diluted income (loss) per share during 2002 and 2003 excluding certain non-recurring items and as reported in accordance with GAAP (dollars in millions):

EXHIBIT 99.1
Release #03-04 December 18, 2003
Alaska Airlines Pilots End Current Contract Negotiations; Begin Preparations for March 2004 Negotiations
Following nearly four weeks of negotiations, the Alaska Airlines Pilots Negotiating Team has decided to terminate the current round of "early" contract negotiations with Alaska Airlines management. The Alaska Airlines Pilots are represented by the Air Line Pilots Association, Int'l (ALPA). As a result, the original negotiating timeline stipulated by Side Letter 01-02 of the Pilots' Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) will now be triggered, with regular contract negotiations starting again in March 2004.
"We had a good opportunity through these negotiations to use the Interest Based Bargaining process and both sides worked hard to try and meet common ground on many issues,", said Master Executive Council Chairman Gary Hansen. "However, we could not reach an agreement that would ultimately meet the needs of our entire pilot group, which is our number one goal. We're looking forward to beginning our preparations for the March 2004 kick-off of our regularly scheduled negotiations."
In July, Alaska Airlines management proposed pay and work rule concessions to the pilot group. ALPA's Economic and Financial Analysis (E&FA) team found that although Alaska's cost-reduction strategies were overly ambitious, the Alaska pilot group's participation in negotiations to an appropriate extent could be positive and was recommended; the MEC agreed with E&FA's recommendations.
Beginning in November, the ALPA and Alaska Airlines teams participated in four week-long negotiating sessions using the Interest Based Bargaining (IBB) process, a joint problem-solving method of negotiating that encourages open discussion and sharing of ideas. Ms. Maggie Jacobsen, former chairwoman of the National Mediation Board, served as the IBB facilitator during the negotiating sessions.
Under the terms of their contract, Alaska pilots will now be required to begin contract negotiations in March 2004. If an agreement is reached by December 2004, it is subject to membership ratification, with an effective date of May 2005. However, if no agreement is reached by December 2004, the two parties will be required to participate in binding interest arbitration, with an arbitration board ruling on contractual issues such as wages.
Founded in 1931, ALPA is the world's oldest and largest pilot union, representing 66,000 pilots at 42 airlines in the United States and Canada, including approximately 1,500 Alaska Airlines pilots. Visit the ALPA website at www.alpa.org.

ITEM 7. Other Events
Severe weather conditions in Seattle and Portland, including snow and freezing rain, have resulted in approximately 600 Alaska and 1,050 Horizon flight cancellations through the first eight days of 2004. This number of departure cancellations due to weather is significantly higher than what we have previously experienced. During the month of January, Alaska typically cancels approximately 100-125 flights and Horizon typically cancels approximately 100 flights, on average, due to weather.
ITEM 9. Regulation FD Disclosure
Pursuant to 17 CFR Part 243 ("Regulation FD"), Alaska Air Group, Inc. is submitting this current report on Form 8-K to present information relating to its financial and operational outlook for 2003. This report includes information regarding forecasts of available seat miles (ASMs), cost per available seat mile (CASM) and fuel consumption, as well as certain actual results for revenue passenger miles (RPMs), load factor and revenue per available seat mile (RASM), for its subsidiaries Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Horizon Air. Please see the cautionary statement under "Forward-Looking Information" at the end of this report.
In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the following information shall not be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), nor shall such information be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing. This Report will not be deemed an admission as to the materiality of any information required to be disclosed solely to satisfy the requirements of Regulation FD.
References in this report on Form 8-K to "Air Group," "the Company," "we," "us," and "our" refer to Alaska Air Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise specified. Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Horizon Air Industries, Inc. are referred to as "Alaska" and "Horizon," respectively, and together as our "airlines."

Fourth Quarter 2003
Alaska's December traffic increased 8.0% to 1.301 billion revenue passenger miles (RPMs) from 1.206 billion flown a year earlier. Capacity during December was 1.785 billion available seat miles (ASMs), 8.5% higher than the 1.644 billion in December 2002.
The passenger load factor (the percentage of available seats occupied by fare paying passengers) for December 2003 was 72.9%, compared to 73.3% in December 2002. The airline carried 1,317,000 passengers compared to 1,256,500 in December 2002.
For November 2003, RASM increased by 7.8% as compared to November 2002. For October 2003, RASM increased by 8.1% as compared to October 2002.
Horizon's December traffic decreased 1.8% to 143.1 million RPMs from 145.7 million flown a year earlier. Capacity for December was 207.8 million ASMs, 4.2% lower than last year's 216.9 million. Capacity was down for the month of December because some of Horizon's aircraft were being prepared for entry into service flying under contract for Frontier Airlines.
The passenger load factor for December 2003 was 68.9%, compared to 67.2% last December. The airline carried 430,900 passengers compared to 441,100 in December 2002.
For November 2003, RASM increased by 21.4% as compared to November 2002. For October 2003, RASM increased by 18.0% as compared to October 2002.

Cash and Short-Term Investments
Cash and short-term investments amounted to approximately $810 million at December 31, 2003 compared to $816 million at November 30, 2003. The decrease of $6 million is principally due to cash used in operations. We expect our cash balance in January 2004 to decrease due principally to semi-annual aircraft lease and debt payments made for Horizon Aircraft.

Attachment A
     SEATTLE  Alaska Air Group, Inc. (NYSE:ALK) today reported a fourth quarter net loss of $20.8 million, or $0.78 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $43.1 million, or $1.62 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2002. For the full year, the company reported net income of $8.8 million, or $0.33 per share, compared to a net loss of $118.6 million, or $4.47 per share in 2002. The company's 2003 results include government assistance amounting to $71.4 million ($44.3 million after tax) received under the Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act. The 2002 net loss included $51.4 million, or $1.94 per share, related to the write-off of goodwill in connection with the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142. Excluding government compensation and the write-off of goodwill, the company's loss in 2003 was $35.5 million ($1.33 per share) versus a loss of $67.5 million ($2.54 per share) for 2002.
     "Despite the fact that our first annual profit since 1999 would have been impossible without government compensation, we're proud of the positive steps we've taken over the past 18 months to achieve our company-wide cost management goals," said Bill Ayer, chairman and chief executive officer. "There's still a lot of work ahead of us, but we're moving in the right direction."
     "In fact, record load factors confirm the preference customers have for our service, thanks in large part to our caring and dedicated employees," Ayer said. "We believe this focus on providing real value to our customers combined with the continued transformation of our business will improve our profitability and competitiveness."
     Operationally, Alaska Airlines' passenger traffic in the fourth quarter increased 14.0 percent on a capacity increase of 9.2 percent. Alaska's load factor increased 3.0 percentage points to 69.5 percent compared to the same period in 2002. Alaska's operating revenue per available seat mile (ASM) increased 5.8 percent, while its operating cost per ASM excluding fuel
Table of Contents
decreased 2.2 percent. Alaska's pretax loss for the quarter was $35.0 million, compared to $58.6 million in 2002.
     Horizon Air's passenger traffic in the fourth quarter increased 7.8 percent on a 2.1 percent capacity decrease. Horizon's load factor increased by 6.2 percentage points to 67.3 percent compared to the same period in 2002. Horizon's operating revenue per ASM increased 18.7 percent, while its operating cost per ASM excluding fuel increased 7.4 percent. Horizon's pretax income for the quarter was $5.7 million, compared to a pretax loss of $5.8 million in 2002.
     Alaska Air Group had cash and short-term investments at December 31, 2003 of approximately $812 million compared to $636 million at December 31, 2002. The increased balance primarily reflects the receipt of $71.4 million of government compensation and $123.2 million net proceeds received in connection with the sale of floating rate convertible bonds in March 2003. The company's debt-to-capital ratio, assuming aircraft operating leases are capitalized at seven times annualized rent, remained constant at 77 percent during the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002.
     A summary of financial and statistical data for Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air as well as a reconciliation of the reported non-GAAP financial measures can be found on pages 6-8.
     A conference call regarding the fourth quarter/full year 2003 results will be simulcast via the internet at 8:30 a.m. Pacific Standard Time. It may be accessed through our website at www.alaskaair.com. For those unable to listen to the live broadcast, a replay will be available after the conclusion of the call at www.alaskaair.com.

Pursuant to new guidelines issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission, we are providing the following unaudited reconciliation of non-GAAP performance indicators to their comparable financial measures reported on a GAAP basis. Our disclosure of operating costs and cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel, provides us the ability to measure and monitor our performance both with and without the cost of aircraft fuel as both the cost and availability of fuel are subject to economic and political factors beyond our control. We also believe that disclosing net income (loss) and diluted earnings (loss) per share excluding non-recurring items is helpful to investors in evaluating our operational performance because we believe the reimbursements received from the government and the write-off of goodwill are unusual events.

Subsequent to our January 28, 2004 press release summarizing our fourth quarter and full year 2003 financial results, further review of the Mileage Plan liability and related deferred revenue as of December 31, 2003 revealed that these amounts had not been fully adjusted to reflect planned deletions of certain accounts with expired miles. The consequent adjustment to reduce the total Mileage Plan liability and deferred revenue estimate from $344.4 million to $336.0 million resulted in an $8.4 million (pretax) increase in total revenues for the fourth quarter and full year. Our adjusted 2003 fourth quarter consolidated net loss is $16.1 million and our 2003 full year consolidated net income is $13.5 million.

Proposed Long-Term Incentive Equity Plan
At the upcoming annual meeting of shareholders in May 2004, Alaska Air Group, Inc. expects to submit for shareholder approval a new long-term incentive equity plan. The plan will authorize the issuance of up to 1.7 million new shares of common stock. This plan, if approved, will replace the Company's existing equity plan, which expires as of the date of the annual meeting. As with prior versions, this equity plan will enable the Company to make awards over several years of equity-based compensation, which the Company believes are an important tool to attract and retain key employees.

Pursuant to 17 CFR Part 243 ("Regulation FD"), Alaska Air Group, Inc. is submitting this current report on Form 8-K to present information relating to its financial and operational outlook for 2004. This report includes information regarding forecasts of available seat miles (ASMs), cost per available seat mile (CASM) and fuel consumption, as well as certain actual results for revenue passenger miles (RPMs), load factor and revenue per available seat mile (RASM), for its subsidiaries Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Horizon Air. Please see the cautionary statement under "Forward-Looking Information" at the end of this report.
In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the following information shall not be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), nor shall such information be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing. This Report will not be deemed an admission as to the materiality of any information required to be disclosed solely to satisfy the requirements of Regulation FD.
References in this report on Form 8-K to "Air Group," "the Company," "we," "us," and "our" refer to Alaska Air Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise specified. Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Horizon Air Industries, Inc. are referred to as "Alaska" and "Horizon," respectively, and together as our "airlines."
Table of Contents
First Quarter 2004
Alaska's February traffic increased 14.7% to 1.123 billion revenue passenger miles (RPMs) from 980 million flown a year earlier. Capacity during February was 1.659 billion available seat miles (ASMs), 14.2% higher than the 1.453 billion in February 2003.
The passenger load factor (the percentage of available seats occupied by fare paying passengers) for February 2004 was 67.7%, compared to 67.4% in February 2003. The airline carried 1,133,300 passengers compared to 1,021,400 in February 2003.
For February 2004, RASM increased by 2.2% as compared to February 2003. This increase in RASM is primarily due to increases in yield and load factor. For January 2004, RASM increased by 9.3% as compared to January 2003. Our RASM in January was favorably impacted by schedule reductions related to the severe winter storm we experienced early in the month.
Including flights operating as a regional carrier for Frontier Airlines, Horizon's February traffic increased 28.7% to 144.5 million RPMs from 112.3 million flown a year earlier. Capacity for February was 223.2 million ASMs, 17.4% higher than last year's 190.2 million.
The passenger load factor for February 2004 was 64.8%, compared to 59.1% last February. The airline carried 410,700 passengers compared to 343,400 in February 2003.
For February 2004, RASM increased by 0.8% as compared to February 2003. This increase in RASM is primarily due to an increase in load factor partially offset by a decrease in yield resulting from Horizon's regional service with Frontier Airlines. For January 2004, RASM increased 4.7% as compared to January 2003. Our RASM in January was favorably impacted by schedule reductions related to the severe winter storm we experienced early in the month.

Cash and Short-Term Investments
Cash and short-term investments amounted to approximately $735 million at February 28, 2004 compared to $812 million at December 31, 2003. The decrease of $77 million is principally due to semi-annual aircraft lease payments made for Horizon aircraft and the purchase of one 737-900, partially offset by cash generated from operations.

ITEM 12. Results of Operations And Financial Condition
Alaska Air Group, Inc. (Alaska) today issued a press release reporting financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2004. The press release is furnished as Attachment A.

Attachment A
     SEATTLE  Alaska Air Group, Inc. (NYSE:ALK) today reported a first quarter net loss of $42.7 million, or $1.59 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $56.3 million, or $2.12 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2003. First quarter results include an impairment charge of $2.4 million ($1.6 million, net of tax, or $0.06 per share), related to Horizon's F-28 aircraft and related spare engines. The first quarter results reflect higher passenger revenue at both Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air compared to the same period in 2003, partially offset by exceedingly high jet fuel costs. Higher than expected winter traffic and improved yields resulted in an increase in passenger revenue of $77.8 million ($62.3 million at Alaska Airlines and $12.0 million at Horizon Air), or 16.4 percent, as compared to the same period in 2003. Aircraft fuel costs increased $18.0 million, or 20.1 percent, versus 2003.
     "The first quarter is traditionally our weakest, and this one included the added burden of high fuel prices and a severe winter storm," said Bill Ayer, chairman and CEO of Alaska Air Group. "Despite these obstacles, we narrowed our year-over-year loss by $13.6 million, or 24.2%. But the bottom line is that we had a sizable loss, illustrating that we still have work ahead."
     "I'm encouraged, though, by the fact that we continue to move in the right direction. This marked the seventh consecutive quarter we realized year-over-year improvements in our cost structure at Alaska and the sixth of seven quarters at Horizon. One particularly gratifying aspect to the quarter was that revenues increased due largely to double-digit growth in passenger boardings at both Alaska and Horizon. That's a strong endorsement of our value proposition  outstanding service at the right price, delivered by caring employees."
     Operationally, Alaska Airlines' passenger traffic in the first quarter increased 13.9 percent on a capacity increase of 10.0 percent. Alaska's load factor increased 2.4 percentage points to 69.1 percent compared to the same period in 2003. Alaska's operating revenue per available seat mile (ASM) increased 4.6 percent, while its operating cost per ASM excluding fuel decreased 1.6

percent. Alaska's pretax loss for the quarter was $53.2 million, compared to $70.6 million in 2003.
     Horizon Air's passenger traffic in the first quarter increased 26.1 percent on a 12.3 percent capacity increase. Horizon's load factor increased by 6.9 percentage points to 65.0 percent compared to the same period in 2003. Horizon's operating revenue per ASM decreased 0.8 percent, while its operating cost per ASM excluding fuel and impairment charges decreased 8.9 percent. The decrease in Horizon's revenue per ASM and cost per ASM excluding fuel and impairment charge is largely due to the addition of Horizon's contract flying for Frontier Airlines. This flying represented 16.2 percent of Horizon's capacity during the first quarter and 7.4 percent of its passenger revenues. Horizon's pretax loss for the quarter was $10.4 million, compared to a pretax loss of $15.3 million in 2003.
     Alaska Air Group had cash and short-term investments at March 31, 2004 of approximately $830 million compared to $812 million at December 31, 2003. The increased balance primarily reflects cash generated from operations and the financing of two Alaska aircraft, partially offset by the purchase of one aircraft, capitalized overhauls and debt repayments. The company's debt-to-capital ratio, assuming aircraft operating leases are capitalized at seven times annualized rent, was 78 percent during the three months ended March 31, 2004 compared to 77 percent as of December 31, 2003.
     A summary of financial and statistical data for Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air as well as a reconciliation of the reported non-GAAP financial measures can be found on pages 6-8.

Note A:
Pursuant to Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Company is providing disclosure of the reconciliation of reported non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable financial measures reported on a GAAP basis. The non-GAAP financial measures provide management the ability to measure and monitor the Company's performance both with and without the cost of aircraft fuel and the impairment charge related to Horizon's F-28 aircraft and spare engines. Because the cost and availability of aircraft fuel are subject to many economic and political factors beyond the Company's control, it is the Company's view that the measurement and monitoring of performance without fuel is important. In addition, the Company believes the disclosure of financial performance without impairment charges is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. Finally, these non-GAAP financial measures are also more comparable to financial measures reported to the Department of Transportation by other major network airlines.
The following table reconciles operating expenses excluding fuel and operating expenses per ASM excluding fuel for both Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Horizon Air Industries, Inc.:

ITEM 9. Regulation FD Disclosure
Pursuant to 17 CFR Part 243 ("Regulation FD"), Alaska Air Group, Inc. is submitting this current report on Form 8-K to present information relating to its financial and operational outlook for 2004. This report includes information regarding forecasts of available seat miles (ASMs), cost per available seat mile (CASM) and fuel consumption, as well as certain actual results for revenue passenger miles (RPMs), load factor and revenue per available seat mile (RASM), for its subsidiaries Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Horizon Air. Please see the cautionary statement under "Forward-Looking Information" at the end of this report.
In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the following information shall not be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), nor shall such information be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.

Second Quarter 2004
Alaska Airlines' April traffic increased 13.6% to 1.276 billion revenue passenger miles (RPMs) from 1.123 billion flown a year earlier. Capacity during April was 1.785 billion available seat miles (ASMs), 9.0% higher than the 1.637 billion in April 2003.
The passenger load factor (the percentage of available seats occupied by fare paying passengers) for the month was 71.5%, compared to 68.6% in April 2003. The airline carried 1,290,600 passengers compared to 1,159,900 in April 2003.
For April 2004, RASM increased by 5.3% as compared to April 2003. This increase in RASM is due to an increase in load factor.
Horizon Air's April traffic increased 35.6% to 162.7 million RPMs from 120.0 million flown a year earlier. Capacity for April was 253.9 million ASMs, 24.3% higher the 204.2 million in April 2003.
The passenger load factor for the month was 64.2%, compared to 58.7% last April. The airline carried 448,800 passengers compared to 361,500 in April 2003.
For the second quarter of 2004, CASM excluding fuel is expected to decrease 14.8% compared to the second quarter of 2003, reflecting changes in Horizon's flying mix from the traditional native network to a mix of native network flying and contract flying with Frontier Airlines. Under the contract flying agreement with Frontier, Horizon does not incur many of the normal costs of operations such as fuel, marketing costs and station labor and rents, resulting in 60 - 70% lower CASM (excluding fuel) and RASM. At its maturity later in 2004, Horizon will operate nine 70-seat Bombardier CRJ 700 aircraft under the Frontier JetExpress brand, representing approximately 24% of total Horizon capacity and approximately 9% to 10% of total Horizon revenue.
For April 2004, RASM decreased 5.4% resulting from contract flying with Frontier, partially offset by a 10% increase in RASM in Horizon's native network due to an increase in load factor.

ITEM 9. Regulation FD Disclosure
Pursuant to 17 CFR Part 243 ("Regulation FD"), Alaska Air Group, Inc. is submitting this current report on Form 8-K to present information relating to its financial and operational outlook for 2004. This report includes information regarding forecasts of available seat miles (ASMs), cost per available seat mile (CASM) and fuel consumption, as well as certain actual results for revenue passenger miles (RPMs), load factor and revenue per available seat mile (RASM), for its subsidiaries Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Horizon Air. Please see the cautionary statement under "Forward-Looking Information" at the end of this report.
In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the following information shall not be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), nor shall such information be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing. This Report will not be deemed an admission as to the materiality of any information required to be disclosed solely to satisfy the requirements of Regulation FD.
References in this report on Form 8-K to "Air Group," "the Company," "we," "us," and "our" refer to Alaska Air Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise specified. Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Horizon Air Industries, Inc. are referred to as "Alaska" and "Horizon," respectively, and together as our "airlines."
Table of Contents
Second Quarter 2004
Alaska Airlines' May traffic increased 9.2% to 1.308 billion revenue passenger miles (RPMs) from 1.198 billion flown a year earlier. Capacity during May was 1.866 billion available seat miles (ASMs), 8.8% higher than the 1.715 billion in May 2003.
The passenger load factor (the percentage of available seats occupied by fare paying passengers) for the month was 70.1%, compared to 69.9% in May 2003. The airline carried 1,310,700 passengers compared to 1,241,500 in May 2003.
For May 2004, RASM increased by 2.4% as compared to May 2003. This increase in RASM is due to an increase in yield. For April 2004, RASM increased by 5.3% as compared to April 2003.
Horizon Air's May traffic increased 28.6% to 172.8 million RPMs from 134.4 million flown a year earlier. Capacity for May was 264.8 million ASMs, 27.6% higher the 207.5 million in May 2003.
The passenger load factor for the month was 65.3%, compared to 64.8% in May 2003. The airline carried 473,200 passengers compared to 404,000 in May 2003.
For the second quarter of 2004, CASM excluding fuel is expected to decrease 15.4% compared to the second quarter of 2003, reflecting changes in Horizon's flying mix from the traditional native network to a mix of native network flying and contract flying with Frontier Airlines. Under the contract flying agreement with Frontier, Horizon does not incur many of the normal costs of operations such as fuel, marketing costs and station labor and rents, resulting in 60-70% lower CASM (excluding fuel) and RASM. Horizon is currently operating nine 70-seat Bombardier CRJ-700 aircraft under the Frontier JetExpress brand, representing approximately 24% of total Horizon capacity and approximately 9% to 10% of total Horizon revenue.
Table of Contents
For May 2004, RASM decreased 13.9% compared to May 2003 resulting from contract flying with Frontier. For April 2004, RASM decreased 5.4% as compared to April 2003, due to an increase in load factor.
Provided below are current capacity (ASMs in millions) estimates for the full year of 2004:
Capacity Estimates for 2004
As of June 16, 2004, cash and short-term investments amounted to approximately $870 million compared to $843 million at April 30, 2004. Cash flows increased principally due to receipt of an income tax refund in the amount of $42.9 million and cash flows from operations. These inflows were offset by a payment to the Company's credit facility in the amount of $75 million in early June.
Other Financial Information
Cash and Short-Term Investments
Fuel Cost per Gallon (including realized hedging gains)
To manage economic risks associated with changes in aircraft fuel prices, we enter into swap agreements and call options for crude oil. These hedging contracts have in the past had a high correlation to changes in aircraft fuel prices, and therefore qualified as "cash flow hedges" under existing accounting rules whereby the majority of the changes in fair value were deferred in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income on the Company's Balance Sheet until these forecasted transactions were settled and recorded in earnings.
Fuel Hedging Program
Although our current fuel hedge program includes the same underlying commodities as we have used historically, because of recent commodity price fluctuations, there is a risk that our existing hedge contracts may no longer be highly correlated to changes in prices of aircraft fuel as defined in the accounting rules. If the hedge commodity and fuel prices are not highly correlated, instead of recording the
Table of Contents
effective portion of changes in fair value in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, we would be required to record changes in fair value since the end of the first quarter of 2004 in non-operating income. At March 31, 2004, the fair value of our hedge contracts totaled $36.8 million. Assuming the hedge commodity and jet fuel prices do not meet the test for "high correlation", at June 30, 2004, changes in the fair value of the Company's fuel hedge contracts during the quarter would result in a corresponding change in non-operating income (expense) of the same amount. Given the rise in fuel prices during the second quarter, we expect our hedges to have increased in value which would result in non-operating income, although the amount of any gain or loss cannot be determined until the fair market value of the contracts is determined at the end of the quarter.
Management continues to believe that its fuel hedging program is an important part of its strategy to reduce its exposure to volatile fuel prices.
Fuel hedge positions entered into by Alaska and Horizon are currently as follows:

The following table provides a fleet summary for Alaska and Horizon for actual airplanes on hand at the end of 2003 and changes in 2004 and 2005 based on our contractual obligations:
Operating Fleet Plan
In June, Horizon converted one 2005 firm order for a CRJ 700 to a Q400 to be delivered in July 2004.
Alaska has no commitments for aircraft deliveries beyond 2005. Horizon has two CRJ 700's scheduled for delivery per year from 2006 to 2009 and none thereafter.
We frequently review our fleet plan and the composition and deployment of our fleet. We may look to modify existing leases, reconfigure aircraft or enter into new purchase commitments as market conditions warrant.

Cautionary Note regarding Forward-Looking Statements
In addition to historical information, this Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements that relate to future events of our future financial performance and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements are intended to be subject to the safe harbor protection provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as "forecast," "may," "will," "could," "should," "expect," "plan," "believe," "potential", "estimate" or other similar words indicating future events or contingencies. Some of the things that could cause our actual results to differ from our expectations are: the competitive environment and other trends in our industry; economic conditions; our reliance on automated systems; actual or threatened terrorist attacks, global instability and potential U.S. military involvement; our ability to meet our cost reduction goals; labor disputes; changes in our operating costs including fuel and insurance; changes in laws and regulations; liability and other claims asserted against us; failure to expand our business; interest rates and the availability of financing; our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; changes in our business plans; our significant indebtedness; downgrades of our credit ratings; and inflation. For a discussion of these and other risk factors, review the information under the caption "Business Risks" in Item 1 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2003. All of the forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the risk factors discussed therein. Our forward-looking statements are based on the information currently available to us and speak only as of the date of this report. You should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements because the matters they describe are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other unpredictable factors, many of which are beyond our control. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, after the date of this report to conform them to actual results. Over time, our actual results, performance or achievements will likely differ from the anticipated results, performance or achievements that are expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements, and such differences might be significant and materially adverse.

ITEM 9. Regulation FD Disclosure
Pursuant to 17 CFR Part 243 ("Regulation FD"), Alaska Air Group, Inc. is submitting this current report on Form 8-K to present information relating to its financial and operational outlook for 2004. This report includes information regarding forecasts of available seat miles (ASMs), cost per available seat mile (CASM) excluding fuel and impairment charge and fuel consumption, as well as certain actual results for revenue passenger miles (RPMs), load factor and revenue per available seat mile (RASM), for its subsidiaries Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Horizon Air. Our disclosure of operating cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel and impairment charge, provides us the ability to measure and monitor our performance without these items. We believe that this measure is commonly used by other companies in our industry and is useful to investors. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is total operating expense per available seat mile. However, due to the large fluctuations in fuel prices, we are unable to predict total operating expense for any future period with any degree of certainty. Please see the cautionary statement under "Forward-Looking Information" at the end of this report.
In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the following information shall not be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), nor shall such information be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing. This Report will not be deemed an admission as to the materiality of any information required to be disclosed solely to satisfy the requirements of Regulation FD.
References in this report on Form 8-K to "Air Group," "the Company," "we," "us," and "our" refer to Alaska Air Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise specified. Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Horizon Air Industries, Inc. are referred to as "Alaska" and "Horizon," respectively, and together as our "airlines."

Second Quarter 2004
Impairment Charge
In June 2004, our Board authorized a plan to accelerate the retirement of our Boeing 737-200 fleet and remove those aircraft from service earlier than initially planned (by the end of 2007). We are currently exploring various alternatives to replace our passenger and freight capacity to, from and within Alaska. As a result of this decision, we evaluated impairment under the accounting rules and concluded that the carrying value of the 737-200 fleet is no longer recoverable when compared to the estimated remaining future cash flows. Accordingly, during the second quarter of 2004, we expect to record an impairment charge associated with the 737-200 fleet, although the actual amount has not yet been finalized.
Alaska Airlines' June traffic increased 12.1% to 1.520 billion RPMs from 1.356 billion flown a year earlier. Capacity during June was 1.983 billion ASMs, 6.8% higher than the 1.858 billion in June 2003.
The passenger load factor (the percentage of available seats occupied by fare paying passengers) for the month was 76.6%, compared to 73.0% in June 2003. The airline carried 1,514,200 passengers compared to 1,395,500 in June 2003.
For May 2004, RASM increased by 2.4% as compared to May 2003. For April 2004, RASM increased by 5.3% as compared to April 2003.
Horizon Air's June traffic increased 36.7% to 199.4 million RPMs from 145.9 million flown a year earlier. Capacity for June was 272.8 million ASMs, 23.4% higher the 221.0 million in June 2003.
The passenger load factor for the month was 73.1%, compared to 66.0% in June 2003. The airline carried 535,000 passengers compared to 441,100 in June 2003.
Table of Contents
Horizon's RPMs, passenger load factor, and passengers are reported using actual June operating data for flights operated as Horizon Air combined with estimated operating data for Horizon's regional jet service operated as Frontier JetExpress which started in 2004.
For the second quarter of 2004, CASM excluding fuel is expected to decrease 15.4% compared to the second quarter of 2003, reflecting changes in Horizon's flying mix from the traditional native network to a mix of native network flying and contract flying with Frontier Airlines. Under the contract flying agreement with Frontier, Horizon does not incur many of the normal costs of operations such as fuel, marketing costs and station labor and rents, resulting in 60-70% lower CASM (excluding fuel) and RASM. Horizon is currently operating nine 70-seat Bombardier CRJ-700 aircraft under the Frontier JetExpress brand, representing approximately 20% to 25% of total Horizon capacity and approximately 9% to 10% of total Horizon revenue.
For May 2004, RASM decreased 13.9% compared to May 2003. For April 2004, RASM decreased 5.4% as compared to April 2003.

Attachment A
      
     SEATTLE  Alaska Air Group, Inc. (NYSE:ALK) today reported a second quarter net loss of $1.7 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, compared to net income of $45.2 million, or $1.70 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2003.
     Second quarter results include impairment charges of $37.2 million ($24.7 million, net of tax, or $0.92 per share), substantially all of which was associated with a decision to accelerate the retirement of the company's Boeing 737-200C fleet. Second quarter results also include $22.3 million ($14.8 million, net of tax, or $0.55 per share) in mark-to-market hedging gains reflecting an increase in the fair value of the company's current hedge portfolio since March 31, 2004, which resulted from the loss of "hedge accounting" during the quarter. Without these items in 2004 and excluding the government compensation received in 2003, net income would have been $8.2 million, or $0.31 per share during 2004, compared to net income of $0.9 million, or $0.04 per share, in 2003.
     "These results demonstrate real progress with our plan to reduce costs," said Bill Ayer, chairman and chief executive officer. "But change in our industry has been rapid, radical and permanent, so we need to pick up the pace. As we proceed, we will consider every possible option that helps us achieve near-term cost competitiveness and, in turn, assures our company's long-term viability."
     Operationally, Alaska Airlines' passenger traffic in the second quarter increased 11.6 percent on a capacity increase of 8.2 percent. Alaska's load factor increased 2.2 percentage points to 72.8 percent compared to the same period in 2003. Alaska's operating revenue per available seat mile (ASM) increased 4.6 percent, while its operating cost per ASM excluding fuel and impairment charge decreased 4.1 percent. Alaska's pretax loss for the quarter was $2.8 million, compared to pretax income of $59.6 million in 2003. Excluding the notable items referenced above, Alaska's pretax income was $14.4 million for the quarter compared to $6.8 million in 2003.
 
Attachment A
     Horizon Air's passenger traffic in the second quarter increased 33.8 percent on a 25.1 percent capacity increase. Horizon's load factor increased by 4.2 percentage points to 67.5 percent compared to the same period in 2003. Horizon's operating revenue per ASM decreased 9.9 percent, while its operating cost per ASM excluding fuel and impairment charge decreased 17.2 percent. The decrease in Horizon's revenue per ASM and cost per ASM excluding fuel and impairment charge is largely due to the addition of Horizon's contract flying for Frontier Airlines. This flying represented 22.5 percent of Horizon's capacity during the second quarter and 9.6 percent of its passenger revenues. Horizon's pretax income for the quarter was $4.7 million, compared to a pretax income of $15.7 million in 2003. Excluding the notable items referenced above, Horizon's pretax income was $2.4 million for the quarter compared to a pretax loss of $2.9 million in 2003.
     Alaska Air Group had cash and short-term investments at June 30, 2004 of approximately $865 million compared to $812 million at December 31, 2003. The company's debt-to-capital ratio, assuming aircraft operating leases are capitalized at seven times annualized rent, was 79 percent as of June 30, 2004 compared to 77 percent as of December 31, 2003.
     A summary of financial and statistical data for Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air as well as a reconciliation of the reported non-GAAP financial measures can be found on pages 6 to 10.
     A conference call regarding the second quarter 2004 results will be simulcast via the internet at 8:30 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time. It may be accessed through the company's website at www.alaskaair.com. For those unable to listen to the live broadcast, a replay will be available after the conclusion of the call at www.alaskaair.com.

Pursuant to Item 10 of Regulation S-K, we are providing disclosure of the reconciliation of reported non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable financial measures reported on a GAAP basis. The non-GAAP financial measures provide management the ability to measure and monitor our performance both with and without the cost of aircraft fuel (including the impact of our fuel hedging program where appropriate), the impairment charge related to Alaska's 737-200 aircraft and Horizon's F-28 aircraft and spare engines, government compensation and mark-to-market hedging gains recorded during the second quarter of 2004. Because the cost and availability of aircraft fuel are subject to many economic and political factors beyond our control, it is our view that the measurement and monitoring of performance without fuel is important. In addition, we believe the disclosure of financial performance without impairment charges, government compensation and mark-to-market hedging gains is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. Finally, these non-GAAP financial measures are also more comparable to financial measures reported to the Department of Transportation by other major network airlines.

During the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 and the interim period between December 31, 2003 and the date of Deloitte's dismissal, there were no disagreements between Air Group, Alaska or Horizon and Deloitte on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure which, if not resolved to Deloitte's satisfaction, would have caused them to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in connection with their report for such years; and there were no reportable events as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K, except as follows:
Air Group believes that the reportable conditions described above have been corrected.
Air Group has authorized Deloitte to fully respond to the inquiries, if any, of Air Group's, Alaska's or Horizon's successor independent accountants concerning the matters described above.

UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION WASHINGTON, DC 20549 FORM 8-K CURRENT REPORT PURSUANT TO SECTION 13 OR 15(d) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 AUGUST 19, 2004 (Date of Report) ALASKA AIR GROUP, INC. (Exact name of registrant as specified in its charter) Commission file number 1-8957 DELAWARE 91-1292054 (State or other jurisdiction of (I.R.S. Employer incorporation or organization) Identification No.) 19300 PACIFIC HIGHWAY SOUTH, SEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98188 (Address of principal executive offices) (206) 392-5040 (Registrant's telephone number)
ITEM 9. REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE Pursuant to 17 CFR Part 243 ("Regulation FD"), Alaska Air Group, Inc. is submitting this current report on Form 8-K to present information relating to its financial and operational outlook for 2004. This report includes information regarding forecasts of available seat miles (ASMs), cost per available seat mile (CASM) excluding fuel consumption, as well as certain actual results for revenue passenger miles (RPMs), load factor and revenue per available seat mile (RASM), for its subsidiaries Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Horizon Air. Our disclosure of operating cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel provides us the ability to measure and monitor our performance without these items. We believe that this measure is commonly used by other companies in our industry and is useful to investors. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is total operating expense per available seat mile. However, due to the large fluctuations in fuel prices, we are unable to predict total operating expense for any future period with any degree of certainty. Please see the cautionary statement under "Forward-Looking Information" at the end of this report. In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the following information shall not be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), nor shall such information be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing. This Report will not be deemed an admission as to the materiality of any information required to be disclosed solely to satisfy the requirements of Regulation FD. References in this report on Form 8-K to "Air Group," "the Company," "we," "us," and "our" refer to Alaska Air Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise specified. Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Horizon Air Industries, Inc. are referred to as "Alaska" and "Horizon," respectively, and together as our "airlines." 2
THIRD QUARTER 2004 Alaska Airlines' July traffic increased 10.7% to 1.668 billion RPMs from 1.506 billion flown a year earlier. Capacity during July was 2.102 billion ASMs, 5.1% higher than the 2.000 billion in July 2003. The passenger load factor (the percentage of available seats occupied by fare-paying passengers) for the month was 79.4%, compared to 75.3% in July 2003. The airline carried 1,652,500 passengers compared to 1,551,300 in July 2003. For July 2004, RASM increased by 8.8% as compared to July 2003 due to increases in load factor and yield. Horizon Air's July traffic increased 28.3% to 213.5 million RPMs from 166.4 million flown a year earlier. Capacity for July was 284.9 million ASMs, 16.5% higher than the 244.7 million in July 2003. The passenger load factor for the month was 75.0%, compared to 68.0% in July 2003. The airline carried 567,400 passengers compared to 483,200 in July 2003. For the third quarter of 2004, CASM excluding fuel is expected to decrease 7.7% compared to the third quarter of 2003, reflecting changes in Horizon's flying mix from the traditional native network to a mix of native network flying and contract flying with Frontier Airlines. Under the contract flying agreement with Frontier, Horizon does not incur many of the normal costs of operations such as fuel, marketing costs and station labor and rents, resulting in 60-70% lower CASM (excluding fuel) and RASM. Horizon is currently operating nine 70-seat Bombardier CRJ-700 aircraft under the Frontier JetExpress brand, representing approximately 20% to 25% of total Horizon capacity and approximately 9% to 10% of total Horizon revenue. 3
For July 2004, RASM decreased by 12.4% as compared to July 2003 resulting from the contract flying with Frontier. CAPACITY ESTIMATES FOR 2004 Provided below are current capacity (ASMs in millions) estimates for the full year of 2004:
Alaska Airlines capacity 22,156 6.5% Horizon Air capacity 3,074 19.7%
OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION Cash and Short-Term Investments Cash and short-term investments amounted to approximately $837 million at July 31, 2004 compared to $865 million at June 30, 2004. The decrease of $28 million is principally due to a credit facility payment of $40 million (which was the remaining balance) , partially offset by cash flows from operations. Fuel Hedging Beginning in the second quarter of 2004, we lost the ability to defer, as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, recognition of any unrealized gain or loss on our fuel hedge contracts until the hedged fuel is consumed (also known as the ability to use "hedge accounting"). The implications of this loss going forward are as follows: - we will have more volatile earnings as we mark our entire hedge portfolio to market each period-end and report the gain or loss in other non-operating income or expense, - because we mark our portfolio to market each period, the impact of the fuel hedging program will not be included in our results in the same period as the related fuel is purchased and consumed. To help investors understand our results, we will regularly provide unaudited information about fuel price movements and the impact of our hedging program on our financial results. Management believes it is useful to compare results between periods that exclude the hedging gains/losses recorded on a GAAP basis and include the cash received or due on hedge positions settled during the period (although the related impact may have been recognized for financial reporting purposes in a prior period). We refer to this as the comparison of "raw fuel cost" to "economic fuel cost", which is presented below for July 2004. 4
Excluding all gains on hedges recorded under generally accepted accounting principles and including the cash settlement received or due for hedges settled during the period, Alaska and Horizon's pre-tax income (loss) would have been lower by approximately $23 million and $3 million, respectively. Alaska Air Group's future hedge positions are as follows: 5
OPERATING FLEET PLAN The following table provides a fleet summary for Alaska and Horizon for actual airplanes on hand at the end of 2003 and changes in 2004 and 2005 based on our contractual obligations and expected retirement plans: Alaska has no firm commitments for aircraft deliveries beyond 2005. However, we plan to acquire one B737-800 in 2005 and two B737-800s in 2006. These planned acquisitions are not included in the table above since we do not have firm orders at this time. Horizon has two CRJ 700s scheduled for delivery per year from 2006 to 2009 and none thereafter. 6

ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS
On August 20, 2004, Alaska Airlines, Inc. (Alaska), a subsidiary of Alaska Air Group, Inc. issued a press release announcing a management restructuring and voluntary severance incentive plan. This plan focuses on streamlining management of Alaska to improve execution, communication and accountability. Alaska expects this program to result in a reduction of approximately 9% and is estimated to produce an annual cost savings of between $5 million and $10 million per year. Management estimates that severance costs associated with this restructuring and voluntary severance and incentive plan to be between $8 million and $12 million, although the actual amount will not be known until it is certain how many employees will participate in the program.
The press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by this reference.

Exhibit 99.1
     SEATTLE  Alaska Airlines today began offering a voluntary severance package to management employees as a precursor to a reorganization that will eliminate about nine percent of its management positions between now and spring 2005.
     Alaska anticipates a reduction of up to 150 employees resulting in permanent annual savings ranging between $5 million and $10 million.
     "The reasons for the reorganization are to speed decision-making and to improve communication and accountability," said CEO Bill Ayer in a memo to all management employees.
     Ayer said the aim is to improve execution by eliminating some of the layers of management that served the airline well in a different era, but now must meet a tougher standard in view of the changes and challenges facing the industry.
     Ayer said an outline of the overall management restructuring has been mapped out. It will be adjusted in September prior to implementation depending upon how many management employees voluntarily choose to leave.
     "We recognize the key role that employees have played over the years and, for those who leave, we want to make the transition as smooth as possible," Ayer said. "So we've crafted a generous severance package, one that compares favorably to any offered since 9/11 triggered 100,000 layoffs at other airlines."
 
     The voluntary program is being offered to all management personnel. Acceptance of applications, as well as the timing of the departure of personnel, will be based upon the needs of the company's operations.
     Among the features: Two weeks of pay for each year of service; a bonus of between $3,000 and $15,000 depending on length of service; one year of healthcare coverage; and travel benefits for the employee and eligible dependents.
     "Since 9/11, and especially since we unveiled our broad-based Alaska 2010 repositioning plan last summer, we have looked  and will continue to look  at every possible way to strengthen this airline to compete successfully over the long-term," Ayer said.
     The management reorganization will not affect any of the airline's current routes and services.
     Alaska Airlines is the nation's ninth largest carrier. Alaska and its sister carrier, Horizon Air, together serve more than 80 cities in Alaska, the Lower 48, Canada and Mexico. For more news and information, visit the Alaska Airlines Newsroom on the Internet at http://newsroom.alaskaair.com

ITEM 2.05. Costs Associated With Exit or Disposal Activities
On September 9, 2004, Alaska Airlines, Inc. (Alaska), a subsidiary of Alaska Air Group, Inc. issued press releases announcing its commitment today to a wide ranging series of initiatives designed to streamline operations and reduce operating costs. The press releases further describe the initiatives and the facts and circumstances leading to them.
Alaska expects this program, combined with the management restructuring initiative previously announced, to result in a reduction of approximately 900 employees and collective annual operating expense savings of $30 to $35 million per year. The up-front termination costs and related accounting charges, the majority of which will be recorded in the third and fourth quarter of 2004, associated with this program are expected to be significant.
Table of Contents
The company will be offering a voluntary severance package to the most-affected work groups to reduce the need for involuntary separations. The company will also be contacting the leaders of affected unions about the terms of the program. The estimated total cost of the severance and other benefits related to these initiatives will be dependent on acceptance of the program by the union and on the longevity and pay levels of the employees who ultimately leave the company. Accordingly, it is not feasible to provide an estimate at this time of the amount of the collective or major individual costs, including expected future cash expenditures.
The press releases are attached as Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and are incorporated herein by this reference.

EXHIBIT 99.1 Contact: Lou Cancelmi -or- Sam Sperry 206-392-5170 206-392-5038 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE September 9, 2004 ALASKA AIRLINES MAKES WIDE-RANGING CHANGES TO RETURN TO STRENGTH; MUCH WORK WILL BE CONTRACTED OUT SEATTLE -- As part of an ongoing effort to improve its competitive standing in the post-9/11 airline industry, Alaska Airlines today announced a wide-ranging series of initiatives to streamline operations and enhance the carrier's long-term viability. It comes on the heels of a management reorganization that started last month. Counting the management reductions, Alaska will be trimming nearly 900 of its more than 11,000 employees. The collective savings is projected at between $30 million and $35 million per year. In many ways, Alaska is following an industry trend accelerated by the rise of low-cost carriers: contracting out some of the work that up to now has been accomplished in house. "The permanent and dramatic changes in our industry have forced us to put aside notions about how we've historically operated and to consider all alternatives to improve our competitiveness," said CEO Bill Ayer. "The goal is first to make sure that we survive, and then to emerge from the most difficult period in the history of commercial aviation as one of the highest performing airlines." "Since 9/11, we've worked hard and taken great pride in our ability to reduce costs without impacting people," Ayer added. "We've done this by implementing more than $150 million per year in non-job related savings, found largely through process improvements and technological advancements, plus opportunistic growth into new markets. Unfortunately, changes in the competitive and economic climate have continued at a rapid pace, requiring us to take even stronger measures to secure our future." - more -
-2- Here are the major changes: - - Immediately closing the Oakland heavy maintenance base, which employs 340 people, and contracting out all heavy maintenance needs to Goodrich Aviation Technical Services of Everett, Wash. and AAR Aircraft Services of Oklahoma City, Okla. - two firms the airline already uses for about 60 percent of its heavy maintenance work. Contracting for heavy maintenance is a practice employed in varying degrees by all of the nation's major airlines. "Our Oakland mechanics are highly talented and have made great strides over the past years by implementing new systems and processes," said Ayer. "They did their work very well. But the sobering reality is that large-scale maintenance providers can give us the same excellent quality at a lower cost." - - Contracting for all fleet service functions -- the cleaning of aircraft interiors between flights -- in Seattle, Anchorage, Fairbanks and Juneau. The number of people impacted is 273, the vast majority in Seattle (158) and Anchorage (93). Twelve more are in Juneau and 10 are in Fairbanks. - - Closing ground support equipment and certain facilities maintenance operations and hiring contractors to perform the work. "This is no reflection on our people or their work. It's a question of cost," Ayer said. This decision affects 60 facilities employees and auto mechanics at 10 stations (Seattle 30, Anchorage 14, Oakland two, Fairbanks two, Juneau two and one each in Portland, Ketchikan, Sitka, Nome, Kotzebue and Barrow). - - Taking advantage of the respective strengths of Alaska and sister carrier Horizon Air through greater sharing and shouldering of services where it makes sense. Some of that will be behind the scenes with increased collaboration in planning and accounting. And some of it will be more visible. All customer service work in Spokane will be taken over by Horizon and, in turn, Alaska will assume all of Horizon's ticket counter work in Portland. These changes affect 30 Alaska employees in Spokane and 21 Horizon employees in Portland. - - With just one flight per day in Tucson, Alaska will contract with a third-party to fill customer service needs there. Thirteen employees will be displaced as a result. Alaska also is making significant changes in how it operates at Prudhoe Bay, triggering five layoffs there and a cut in hours for the remaining 15 people. -more-
-3- - - Closing three city ticket offices -- in Juneau, Anchorage and Bellevue. This will displace nine customer service agents. - - Closing the four-person pilot crew scheduling office in Los Angeles and consolidating the work at a larger scheduling office in Seattle. "While the guiding principles for these decisions are to maintain high quality at a lower cost, our values of integrity and caring guide us on how we treat people leaving the company," Ayer said. For those employees impacted, Alaska has talked with union leadership about the possibility of offering one of the most generous financial and job-finding assistance packages the industry has seen since 9/11 triggered more than 100,000 layoffs at other carriers. Alaska has offered an attractive voluntary severance incentive to employees in the most-affected work groups in the hopes of minimizing involuntary departures by creating openings elsewhere in the system. Ayer said Alaska will continue to look at every possible way to improve its cost structure and competitive standing. The aim, he said, is to be an airline where jobs and retirements are secure and career advancement opportunities abound, as well as an airline that provides great value for customers and a solid return for shareholders. And all of that will only be possible if we complete our transformation and are able to weatherproof ourselves from the inevitable ups and downs of the economy."

EXHIBIT 99.2 Contact: Lou Cancelmi -or- Sam Sperry 206-392-5170 206-392-5038 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE September 9, 2004 ALASKA AIRLINES CLOSING OAKLAND MAINTENANCE BASE SEATTLE -- As part of an ongoing effort to improve its competitive standing in the post-9/11 airline industry, Alaska Airlines announced today that it will contract out all heavy maintenance work. Up to now Alaska has contracted with vendors for about 60 percent of its heavy maintenance, while the other 40 percent has been done by its staff at its Oakland hangar . Effective today, the Oakland facility will be closed and the work transferred to two vendors. Alaska employs 340 people at the base -- some 80 percent of them licensed aircraft technicians. The remainder serve in various administrative and support functions. Depending on seniority, bargaining unit employees will be laid off or given the opportunity to bid into other maintenance locations in the Alaska system. The move is part of a wide-ranging series of streamlining initiatives the airline is announcing today, and comes on the heels of a management reorganization that started last month. All told, Alaska is trimming nearly 900 of its more than 11,000 employees and either contracting out work or, with regard to management, reorganizing to achieve the same results with fewer people. The collective savings is projected at between $30 million and $35 million per year. "Our commitment to secure the future of Alaska Airlines -- to first ensure our survival and then return us to a position of strength in this permanently changed industry -- has forced us to make some very tough decisions that impact good people," said Alaska CEO Bill Ayer. "Our Oakland technicians are highly talented and have made great strides over the past years by implementing new systems and processes," added Ayer. "They did their work well, but the reality is that large-scale maintenance providers can give us the same excellent quality at a lower cost." - more -
-2- Alaska's heavy maintenance work now will be done entirely by two contractors: Goodrich Aviation Technical Services in Everett, Wash. and AAR Aircraft Services in Oklahoma City, Okla. Goodrich has performed heavy maintenance for Alaska for nearly three decades and AAR has been the exclusive heavy maintenance provider for the carrier's MD-80 fleet for more than a year. For employees impacted, Alaska has talked with union leadership about the possibility of offering one of the most generous severance packages since 9/11 triggered 100,000 layoffs at other carriers. That package would include two weeks of pay for every year of service, a lump sum bonus based on years of service, company-paid health insurance coverage for one year and extended travel benefits. To help minimize the number of involuntary departures, the airline has proposed to offer the same voluntary severance package to other maintenance and engineering employees at other locations, based on seniority and on a one-for-one basis, in the hopes of creating openings for those displaced in Oakland or via seniority bumping. Closing the maintenance base will have no impact on Alaska's staffing or flight schedules at Oakland International Airport. The employees of the Oakland maintenance base, which Alaska acquired in 1988, worked almost exclusively on the airline's fleet of 74 Boeing 737 aircraft. Alaska Airlines has provided air service at Oakland International Airport since 1983. Alaska, and its sister carrier, Horizon Air, serve more than 80 cities in Alaska, the Lower 48, Canada and Mexico.

ITEM 7.01. Regulation FD Disclosure
Pursuant to 17 CFR Part 243 ("Regulation FD"), Alaska Air Group, Inc. is submitting this current report on Form 8-K to present information relating to its financial and operational outlook for 2004. This report includes information regarding forecasts of available seat miles (ASMs), cost per available seat mile (CASM) excluding fuel consumption and the restructuring charges associated with our recently announced restructuring efforts, as well as certain actual results for revenue passenger miles (RPMs), load factor and revenue per available seat mile (RASM), for its subsidiaries Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Horizon Air. Our disclosure of operating cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel and restructuring charges provides us the ability to measure and monitor our performance without these items. In addition, we believe the disclosure of financial performance without restructuring charges and mark-to-market hedging gains is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is total operating expense per available seat mile. However, due to the large fluctuations in fuel prices, we are unable to predict total operating expense for any future period with any degree of certainty. Please see the cautionary statement under "Forward-Looking Information" at the end of this report.
In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the following information shall not be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), nor shall such information be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing. This Report will not be deemed an admission as to the materiality of any information required to be disclosed solely to satisfy the requirements of Regulation FD.
References in this report on Form 8-K to "Air Group," "the Company," "we," "us," and "our" refer to Alaska Air Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise specified. Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Horizon Air Industries, Inc. are referred to as "Alaska" and "Horizon," respectively, and together as our "airlines."
 
Third Quarter 2004
Alaska Airlines' August traffic increased 7.9% to 1.655 billion RPMs from 1.534 billion flown a year earlier. Capacity during August was 2.091 billion ASMs, 5.1% higher than the 1.988 billion in August 2003.
The passenger load factor (the percentage of available seats occupied by fare-paying passengers) for the month was 79.2%, compared to 77.1% in August 2003. The airline carried 1,655,900 passengers compared to 1,584,200 in August 2003.
For August 2004, RASM increased by 2.3% as compared to August 2003 due to an increase in load factor. For July 2004, RASM increased by 8.8% as compared to July 2003.
Forecasted cost per ASM excludes the charges that will be recorded as a result of our recently announced restructuring initiatives. Those initiatives will result in a net reduction of approximately 900 employees. The up-front termination costs and related accounting charges associated with this program, the majority of which will be recorded in the third and fourth quarter of 2004, are expected to be significant but have not yet been finalized.
Horizon Air's August traffic increased 25.2% to 211.1 million RPMs from 168.6 million flown a year earlier. Capacity for August was 284.2 million ASMs, 16.1% higher than the 244.9 million in August 2003.
The passenger load factor for the month was 74.3%, compared to 68.8% in August 2003. The airline carried 577,500 passengers compared to 490,500 in August 2003.
 
For the third quarter of 2004, CASM excluding fuel is expected to decrease 9.2% compared to the third quarter of 2003, reflecting changes in Horizon's flying mix from the traditional native network to a mix of native network flying and contract flying with Frontier Airlines. Under the contract flying agreement with Frontier, Horizon does not incur many of the normal costs of operations such as fuel, marketing costs and station labor and rents, resulting in significantly lower CASM (excluding fuel) and RASM. Horizon is currently operating nine 70-seat Bombardier CRJ-700 aircraft under the Frontier JetExpress brand, representing approximately 20% to 25% of total Horizon capacity and approximately 9% to 10% of total Horizon revenue.
For August 2004, RASM decreased by 13.7% as compared to August 2003 resulting from the contract flying with Frontier. For July 2004, RASM decreased by 12.4% as compared to July 2003.
Provided below are current capacity (ASMs in millions) estimates for the full year of 2004:
Capacity Estimates for 2004
Cash and short-term investments was approximately $871 million at August 31, 2004 compared to $837 million at July 31, 2004. The increase of $34 million is principally due to cash provided from operations.
Other Financial Information
Cash and Short-Term Investments
Beginning in the second quarter of 2004, we lost the ability to defer, as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, recognition of any unrealized gain or loss on our fuel hedge contracts until the hedged fuel is consumed (also known as the ability to use "hedge accounting"). The implications of this loss going forward are as follows:
Fuel Hedging
To help investors understand our results, we will regularly provide unaudited information about fuel price movements and the impact of our hedging program on our financial results. Management believes it is useful to compare results between periods that exclude the hedging gains/losses recorded on a GAAP basis and include the cash received or due on hedge positions settled during the period (although the related impact may have been
 
recognized for financial reporting purposes in a prior period). We refer to this as the comparison of "raw fuel cost" to "economic fuel cost", which is presented below for August 2004.
 
Excluding all gains on hedges recorded under generally accepted accounting principles and including the cash settlement received or due for hedges settled during the period, Alaska and Horizon's pre-tax income (loss) would have been higher by approximately $4.1 million and $0.6 million, respectively.
 
Alaska Air Group's future hedge positions are as follows:
The following table provides a fleet summary for Alaska and Horizon for actual airplanes on hand at the end of 2003 and changes in 2004 and 2005 based on our contractual obligations and expected retirement plans:
Operating Fleet Plan
Alaska has no firm commitments for aircraft deliveries beyond 2005. However, we plan to acquire three B737-800s in 2006. These planned acquisitions are not included in the table above since we do not have firm orders at this time. Horizon has two CRJ 700s scheduled for delivery per year from 2006 to 2009 and none thereafter.

ITEM 2.05. Costs Associated With Exit or Disposal Activities
In connection with restructuring initiatives announced on August 20 and September 9, Alaska Air Group, Inc. (Air Group or the Company) plans to incur $45 to $55 million (pretax) of costs in the form of severance and related benefits for impacted employees. We expect that substantially all severance will be recorded in 2004 and that approximately $23 to $27 million (pretax) will be recorded in each of the third and fourth quarters. The Company is also evaluating any possible asset impairment that may result from the announced initiatives. Any impairment charge would be in addition to the severance estimates above.

Third Quarter 2004
Alaska Airlines' September traffic increased 14.9% to 1.248 billion RPMs from 1.086 billion flown a year earlier. Capacity during September was 1.819 billion ASMs, 6.7% higher than the 1.705 billion in September 2003. The passenger load factor (the percentage of available seats occupied by fare-paying passengers) for the month was 68.6%, compared to 63.7% in September 2003. The airline carried 1,280,600 passengers compared to 1,144,700 in September 2003.
For August 2004, RASM increased by 2.3% as compared to August 2003. For July 2004, RASM increased by 8.8% as compared to July 2003.
Horizon Air's September traffic increased 34.6% to 176.5 million RPMs from 131.1 million flown a year earlier. Capacity for September was 261.0 million ASMs, 23.3% higher than the 211.7 million in September 2003. The passenger load factor for the month was 67.6%, compared to 61.9% in September 2003. The airline carried 499,700 passengers compared to 402,800 in September 2003.
Table of Contents
Horizon's RPMs, passenger load factor, and passengers are reported using actual September operating data for flights operated as Horizon Air combined with estimated operating data for Horizon's regional jet service operated as Frontier JetExpress which started in 2004.
For the third quarter of 2004, CASM excluding fuel is expected to decrease 10.6% compared to the third quarter of 2003, reflecting changes in Horizon's flying mix from the traditional native network to a mix of native network flying and contract flying with Frontier Airlines. Under the contract flying agreement with Frontier, Horizon does not incur many of the normal costs of operations such as fuel, marketing costs and station labor and rents, resulting in significantly lower CASM (excluding fuel) and RASM.

Fuel Hedging
Based on the significant increase in market fuel prices during the quarter, we expect to record a significant mark-to-market fuel hedging gain in the month of September and report significant mark-to-market gains in the third quarter, all of which will relate to fuel purchase contracts which will settle in future quarters.

In September 2004, Alaska received notification from the Mexican Government that payment representing reimbursement of certain disputed navigation fees paid to Mexico by Alaska during 2002 and 2003 had been approved. Given the uncertainty of the existence and timing of the payment, such reimbursement had not previously been recorded by the Company. However, since the payment was received during the first week of October, thus removing this uncertainty, the reimbursement will be recorded in the third quarter.
Third Quarter 2004
The payment received, net of costs, totaled approximately $10.9 million, of which $7.6 million and $3.3 million will be recorded in operating expense and non-operating income, respectively.
Actual results for the third quarter will be announced on October 21.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.

 
Exhibit 99.1
     SEATTLE  Alaska Air Group, Inc. (NYSE:ALK) today reported a third quarter net income of $79.2 million, or $2.94 per diluted share, compared to net income of $40.7 million, or $1.52 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2003.
     Third quarter results include restructuring charges of $27.5 million ($15.8 million, net of tax, or $0.59 per share) and a large refund of disputed navigation fees paid in prior years totaling $11.0 million ($6.3 million, net of tax, or $0.23 per share). Third quarter results also include $57.2 million ($32.8 million, net of tax, or $1.22 per share) in mark-to-market hedging gains reflecting an increase in the fair value of the company's current fuel hedge portfolio during the quarter. Without these items, net income would have been $55.9 million, or $2.08 per share during 2004.
     "Reporting a profit strengthens our belief that we are on the right track," said Bill Ayer, chairman and chief executive officer. "This relatively strong performance is a tribute to our employees who are taking good care of our customers and to our cost reduction efforts, which are gaining momentum.
     "In fact, we achieved the best year-over-year reduction in unit costs excluding fuel and unusual items since initiating cost reduction efforts following September 11, and we continue to outperform the industry in terms of revenue. Still, we are committed to the hard work that remains to transform ourselves from a company that is profitable in a seasonably strong quarter into one that is consistently profitable year in and year out."
 
Exhibit 99.1
     Operationally, Alaska Airlines' passenger traffic in the third quarter increased 10.8 percent on a capacity increase of 5.6 percent. Alaska's load factor increased 3.5 percentage points to 76.0 percent compared to the same period in 2003. Alaska's operating revenue per available seat mile (ASM) increased 3.7 percent, while its operating cost per ASM excluding fuel, navigation fee settlement and restructuring charges decreased 6.0 percent. Alaska's pretax income for the quarter was $106.3 million, compared to $50.1 million in 2003. Excluding the notable items referenced above, Alaska's pretax income was $72.5 million for the quarter.
     Horizon Air's passenger traffic in the third quarter increased 29.0 percent on an 18.4 percent capacity increase. Horizon's load factor increased by 5.9 percentage points to 72.4 percent compared to the same period in 2003. Horizon's operating revenue per ASM and operating cost per ASM excluding fuel both decreased by 11.4 percent. The decrease in Horizon's revenue per ASM and cost per ASM excluding fuel is largely due to the addition of Horizon's contract flying for Frontier Airlines. This flying represented 23.1 percent of Horizon's capacity during the third quarter and 9.2 percent of its passenger revenues. Horizon's pretax income for the quarter was $24.4 million, compared to a pretax income of $19.5 million in 2003. Excluding the notable items referenced above, Horizon's pretax income was $17.5 million for the quarter.
     Alaska Air Group had cash and short-term investments at September 30, 2004 of approximately $879 million compared to $812 million at December 31, 2003. The company's debt-to-capital ratio, assuming aircraft operating leases are capitalized at seven times annualized rent, remained constant at 77 percent as of September 30, 2004 and December 31, 2003.
     A summary of financial and statistical data for Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air as well as a reconciliation of the reported non-GAAP financial measures can be found on pages 6 to 10.
     A conference call regarding the third quarter 2004 results will be simulcast via the internet at 8:30 a.m. Pacific Time. It may be accessed through the company's website at www.alaskaair.com. For those unable to listen to the live broadcast, a replay will be available after the conclusion of the call at www.alaskaair.com.

Note A:
Pursuant to Item 10 of Regulation S-K, we are providing disclosure of the reconciliation of reported non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable financial measures reported on a GAAP basis. The non-GAAP financial measures provide management the ability to measure and monitor our performance both with and without the cost of aircraft fuel (including the gains and losses associated with out fuel hedging program where appropriate), restructuring charges, aircraft impairment charges, government compensation in 2003 and a large refund in 2004 of disputed navigation fees paid in prior years (of which $7.7 million was recorded in operating expenses and $3.3 million was recorded in non-operating income). Because the cost and availability of aircraft fuel are subject to many economic and political factors beyond our control and we record changes in the fair value of our hedge portfolio in our income statement, it is our view that the measurement and monitoring of performance without fuel is important. In addition, we believe the disclosure of financial performance without impairment and restructuring charges, government compensation and the navigation fees refunded in 2004 is useful to investors. Finally, these non-GAAP financial measures are also more comparable to financial measures reported to the Department of Transportation by other major network airlines.
The following tables reconcile our non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for both Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Horizon Air Industries, Inc.:

Forecasted Financial Measures
During our quarterly earnings conference call, we expect to discuss forward-looking forecasted unit cost information for the fourth quarter of 2004. This forecasted unit cost information includes non-GAAP unit cost estimates which are summarized in the following table together with the most directly comparable GAAP unit cost for both Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Horizon Air Industries, Inc.:
: Our forecast of fuel costs is based on anticipated gallons consumed and estimated fuel cost per gallon of $1.74 for Alaska and $1.78 for Horizon. Given the volatility of fuel prices, readers should be cautioned that actual fuel expense will likely differ from the forecast above.
Note 1
: Our forecast of restructuring costs is based on an estimated fourth quarter restructuring charge of $25 million. We expect the actual charge to be $24-$28 million.

Item 5.04 Temporary Suspension of Trading Under Registrant's Employee Benefit Plans.
On October 26, 2004, Alaska Air Group, Inc. (the "Registrant") sent a notice to its directors and executive officers informing them that a blackout period will be in effect beginning November 8, 2004 at noon Pacific Time and ending the week of Monday, November 14, 2004. The Registrant provided the notice to its directors and executive officers in accordance with Section 306 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Rule 104 of Regulation BTR. Since the Registrant administers the Plan, the notice pursuant to Section 101(i)(2)(E) of the Employment Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 has not been sent.
A copy of the notice sent to the Registrant's directors and executive officers is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits
(a)(b) Not applicable.
(c) Exhibits

Signature
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.

 
Exhibit 99.1
Pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and SEC Regulation BTR (17 CFR 245.100-104), this is to notify you that you, as a director or officer of Alaska Air Group or one of its subsidiaries, will be subject to a blackout period from trading Alaska Air Group common stock. The reason for the blackout period is that the trustee of the AlaskaSaver 401(k) Plan, Flight Attendant 401(k) Plan, Flight Attendant Retirement Plan, COPS, MRP and Dispatch 401(k) Plan and Horizon Air Savings and Investment Plan (collectively, the "Plans"), is being changed from Putnam Investments to The Vanguard Group. The transfer of record title of Alaska Air Group's stock in the Plans from Putnam to Vanguard will necessitate a blackout period during which employees participating in the Plans will not be able to transfer their Alaska Air Group common stock. In addition to exchanges involving Alaska Air Group stock, other transactions that Plan participants will be temporarily suspended from making include loans, withdrawals, distributions, fund exchanges involving funds other than Alaska Air Group stock, contribution allocation changes and payroll contribution percentage changes.
Because Plan participants will be blacked out from the transactions described above, you, as a director or officer of Alaska Air Group or one of its subsidiaries, will for the same period of time be prohibited from directly or indirectly purchasing, selling or otherwise acquiring or transferring Alaska Air Group common stock, to the extent you acquire or have acquired such common stock in connection with your service or employment as a director or executive officer. If you own Alaska Air Group common stock that you did not acquire in connection with your service or employment as a director or executive officer, please contact the Alaska Air Group General Counsel to confirm that such common stock meets the requirements of Regulation BTR before transferring any such stock.
The blackout period is expected to begin on Monday, November 8, 2004, and is expected to end during the week of November 14, 2004. During this time, you may, without charge, obtain information as to whether the blackout period has begun or ended from: Thomas G. Richards, Director, Employee Benefits, Alaska Airlines, Inc., P.O. Box 68900-SEAHB, Seattle, WA 98168, 206-392-5279 (phone), tom.richards@alaskaair.com (email).
During the blackout period and for a period of two years after the ending date of the blackout period, an Alaska Air Group security holder or other interested person may obtain, without charge, the actual beginning and ending dates of the blackout period through the contact listed above who has been designated as the person to respond to inquiries about the blackout period.

This report may contain forward-looking statements that are intended to be subject to the safe harbor protection provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

ITEM 7.01. Regulation FD Disclosure
Pursuant to 17 CFR Part 243 ("Regulation FD"), the Company is submitting information relating to its financial and operational outlook for 2004. This report includes information regarding forecasts of available seat miles (ASMs), cost per available seat mile (CASM) excluding fuel consumption and the restructuring charges associated with our recently announced restructuring efforts, as well as certain actual results for revenue passenger miles (RPMs), load factor and revenue per available seat mile (RASM), for its subsidiaries Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Horizon Air. Our disclosure of operating cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel and restructuring charges provides us the ability to measure and monitor our performance without these items. In addition, we believe the disclosure of financial performance without restructuring charges and mark-to-market hedging gains is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is total operating expense per available seat mile. However, due to the large fluctuations in fuel prices, we are unable to predict total operating expense for any future period with any degree of certainty. Please see the cautionary statement under "Forward-Looking Information."
In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the following information shall not be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), nor shall such information be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing. This Report will not be deemed an admission as to the materiality of any information required to be disclosed solely to satisfy the requirements of Regulation FD.
References in this report on Form 8-K to "Air Group," "the Company," "we," "us," and "our" refer to Alaska Air Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise specified. Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Horizon Air Industries, Inc. are referred to as "Alaska" and "Horizon," respectively, and together as our "airlines."
Table of Contents
Fourth Quarter 2004
* For Alaska, our forecast of cost per available seat mile, fuel cost per available seat mile and restructuring charge per available seat mile is based on forward-looking estimates which will likely differ significantly from actual results due to the volatility of fuel prices. Factors impacting our estimates include (but are not limited to) volatility of fuel prices and estimated severance and benefit costs associated with our restructuring activities as discussed in previous periods.
Alaska Airlines' October traffic increased 11.1% to 1.251 billion RPMs from 1.126 billion flown a year earlier. Capacity during October was 1.802 billion ASMs, 4.6% higher than the 1.722 billion in October 2003. The passenger load factor (the percentage of available seats occupied by fare-paying passengers) for the month was 69.4%, compared to 65.4% in October 2003. The airline carried 1,270,700 passengers compared to 1,183,300 in October 2003.
For October 2004, RASM increased by 0.3% as compared to October 2003 due to an increase in load factor partially offset by a decrease in yield.
Table of Contents
* For Horizon, our forecast of cost per available seat mile and fuel cost per available seat mile is based on forward-looking estimates which will likely differ significantly from actual results. Factors impacting our estimates include (but are not limited to) volatility of fuel prices.
Horizon Air's October traffic increased 29.9% to 180.6 million RPMs from 139.0 million flown a year earlier. Capacity for October was 266.6 million ASMs, 26.5% higher than the 210.8 million in October 2003. The passenger load factor for the month was 67.8%, compared to 66.0% in October 2003. The airline carried 512,300 passengers compared to 429,400 in October 2003.
For the fourth quarter of 2004, CASM excluding fuel is expected to decrease 15.1% compared to the fourth quarter of 2003, reflecting changes in Horizon's flying mix from the traditional native network to a mix of native network flying and contract flying with Frontier Airlines. Under the contract flying agreement with Frontier, Horizon does not incur many of the normal costs of operations such as fuel, marketing costs and station labor and rents, resulting in significantly lower CASM (excluding fuel) and RASM. Horizon is currently operating nine 70-seat Bombardier CRJ-700 aircraft under the Frontier JetExpress brand, representing approximately 20% to 25% of total Horizon capacity and approximately 9% to 10% of total Horizon revenue.
For October 2004, RASM decreased by 16.5% as compared to October 2003 resulting from the contract flying with Frontier.
Table of Contents
Capacity Estimates for 2004
Provided below are current capacity (ASMs in millions) estimates for the full year of 2004:
Other Financial Information
Cash and Short-Term Investments
Cash and short-term investments was approximately $921 million at October 31, 2004 compared to $879 million at September 30, 2004. The increase of $42 million is principally due to cash provided from operations as well as the receipt of the disputed Mexico navigation fees discussed in our third quarter Form 10-Q.
Fuel Hedging
Beginning in the second quarter of 2004, we lost the ability to defer, as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, recognition of any unrealized gain or loss on our fuel hedge contracts until the hedged fuel is consumed (also known as the ability to use "hedge accounting"). The implications of this loss going forward are as follows:
To help investors understand our results, we are providing unaudited information about fuel price movements and the impact of our hedging program on our financial results. Management believes it is useful to compare results between periods that exclude the hedging gains/losses recorded on a GAAP basis and include the cash received or due on hedge positions settled during the period (although the related impact may have been recognized for financial reporting purposes in a prior period). We refer to this as the comparison of "economic fuel cost", which is presented below for October 2004.
Table of Contents
*Amounts may include mark-to-market hedging gains (losses) recognized in non-operating income (expense) in previous periods.
Excluding all gains on hedges recorded under generally accepted accounting principles and including the cash settlement received or due for hedges settled during the period, Alaska and Horizon's pre-tax income (loss) would have been lower by approximately $20.7 million and $2.8 million, respectively.
Table of Contents
Alaska Air Group's future hedge positions are as follows:
Operating Fleet Plan
The following table provides a fleet summary for Alaska and Horizon for actual airplanes on hand at the end of 2003 and changes in 2004 and 2005 based on our contractual commitments and expected retirement plans:
Alaska has no firm commitments for aircraft deliveries beyond 2005. However, we plan to acquire three B737-800s in 2006. These planned acquisitions are not included in the table above since we do not have firm commitments at this time. Horizon has two CRJ 700s scheduled for delivery per year from 2006 to 2009 and none thereafter.

Exhibit 99.1     Internal release updating the status of pilot contract negotiations.
Signature
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
Date: December 16, 2004

EXHIBIT 99.1 After 10 days of around-the-clock sessions, company and ALPA bargaining unit negotiators were unable to reach an agreement on a new contract by the December 15 deadline agreed to by both parties. The negotiations followed months of preparation and nearly 10 months of earlier mid-term negotiations. The next step for both parties is to prepare for arbitration. In that process, an impartial third-party arbitrator will listen to both sides and decide on wage rates, along with up to five items submitted by each side. The arbitrator's decisions are binding and will go into effect May 1, 2005. Commenting on the negotiations, CEO Bill Ayer said he appreciated the efforts of all concerned to get a new contract collaboratively but expressed disappointment with the final result. "Due to the considerable time and effort that went into this process," said Ayer, "I can only conclude there is a lack of fundamental agreement on the magnitude of change required to ensure the future viability of Alaska Airlines. Considering the industry environment today and the fact that other carriers' labor costs keep decreasing, uncertainty is not in anyone's best interests. The arbitration will achieve resolution so we can plan for the future."

Item 4.02 Non-Reliance on Previously Issued Financial Statements or a Related Audit Report or Completed Interim Review
In December 2004, the Company discovered a clerical error in its calculation of deferred Mileage Plan revenue that existed as of September 30, 2004. Management discussed the issue with its Audit Committee and independent auditor, KPMG. To provide investors with timely information, management and the Audit Committee determined on December 20, 2004 to file a Form 10-Q/A for the quarter ended September 30, 2004 to reflect the impact of this item to the Company's third quarter and year to date reported condensed consolidated financial statements rather than record the adjustment in the fourth quarter. As described in greater detail in the Form 10-Q/A (also filed today), the revision increases total Mileage Plan liability and deferred revenue balance from $379.2 million to $387.6 million and results in an $8.4 million (pretax) decrease to other revenues for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2004.

FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION This report may contain forward-looking statements that are intended to be subject to the safe harbor protection provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements relate to future events or our future financial performance and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results or performance to be materially different from those indicated by any forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as "forecast," "may," "will," "could," "should," "expect," "plan," "believe," "potential" or other similar words indicating future events or contingencies. Some of the things that could cause our actual results to differ from our expectations are: changes in our operating costs including fuel; the competitive environment and other trends in our industry; economic conditions; our reliance on automated systems; actual or threatened terrorist attacks, global instability and potential U.S. military involvement; our ability to meet our cost reduction goals; the outcome of contract talks with the Air Line Pilots Association, whether as a result of negotiations or binding arbitration; labor disputes; changes in laws and regulations; liability and other claims asserted against us; failure to expand our business; interest rates and the availability of financing; our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; changes in our business plans; our significant indebtedness; downgrades of our credit ratings; and inflation. For a discussion of these and other risk factors, see Item 1 of the Company's Amendment No. 1 to its Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2003 on Form 10-K/A. All of the forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the risk factors discussed therein. These risk factors may not be exhaustive. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risk factors emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict such new risk factors, nor can it assess the impact, if any, of such new risk factors on our business or events described in any forward-looking statements.

ITEM 7.01. Regulation FD Disclosure
Pursuant to 17 CFR Part 243 ("Regulation FD"), the Company is submitting information relating to its financial and operational outlook for 2004. This report includes information regarding forecasts of available seat miles (ASMs), cost per available seat mile (CASM) excluding fuel consumption and the restructuring charges associated with our recently announced restructuring efforts, as well as certain actual results for revenue passenger miles (RPMs), load factor and revenue per available seat mile (RASM), for its subsidiaries Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Horizon Air. Our disclosure of operating cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel and restructuring charges provides us the ability to measure and monitor our performance without these items. In addition, we believe the disclosure of financial performance without restructuring charges and mark-to-market hedging gains is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is total operating expense per available seat mile. However, due to the large fluctuations in fuel prices, we are unable to predict total operating expense for any future period with any degree of certainty. Please see the cautionary statement under "Forward-Looking Information."
In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the following information shall not be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), nor shall such information be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing. This Report will not be deemed an admission as to the materiality of any information required to be disclosed solely to satisfy the requirements of Regulation FD.
References in this report on Form 8-K to "Air Group," "the Company," "we," "us," and "our" refer to Alaska Air Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise specified. Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Horizon Air Industries, Inc. are referred to as "Alaska" and "Horizon," respectively, and together as our "airlines."
Table of Contents
Fourth Quarter 2004
* For Alaska, our forecast of cost per available seat mile, fuel cost per available seat mile and restructuring charge per available seat mile is based on forward-looking estimates which will likely differ from actual results due to the volatility of fuel prices. Factors impacting our estimates include (but are not limited to) volatility of fuel prices and estimated severance and benefit costs associated with our restructuring activities as discussed in previous periods.
Alaska Airlines' December traffic increased 8.6% to 1.413 billion RPMs from 1.301 billion flown a year earlier. Capacity during December was 1.860 billion ASMs, 4.2% higher than the 1.785 billion in December 2003. The passenger load factor (the percentage of available seats occupied by fare-paying passengers) for the month was 76.0%, compared to 72.9% in December 2003. The airline carried 1,407,300 passengers compared to 1,317,000 in December 2003.
Alaska Airlines' November traffic increased 11.2% to 1.312 billion RPMs from 1.180 billion flown a year earlier. Capacity during November was 1.791 billion ASMs, 6.2% higher than the 1.687 billion in November 2003. The passenger load factor for the month was 73.3%, compared to 70.0% in November 2003. The airline carried 1,320,200 passengers compared to 1,211,600 in November 2003.
Based on preliminary yield information and actual load factor, we expect fourth quarter RASM to decline modestly compared to prior year.
Table of Contents
* For Horizon, our forecast of cost per available seat mile and fuel cost per available seat mile is based on forward-looking estimates which will likely differ significantly from actual results. Factors impacting our estimates include (but are not limited to) volatility of fuel prices.
Horizon Air's December traffic increased 40.5% to 201.0 million RPMs from 143.1 million flown a year earlier. Capacity for December was 270.5 million ASMs, 30.2% higher than the 207.8 million in December 2003. The passenger load factor for the month was 74.3%, compared to 68.9% in December 2003. The airline carried 548,200 passengers compared to 430,900 in December 2003.
Horizon Air's November traffic increased 39.7% to 187.6 million RPMs from 134.3 million flown a year earlier. Capacity for November was 255.9 million ASMs, 27.6% higher than the 200.6 million in November 2003. The passenger load factor for the month was 73.3%, compared to 67.0% in November 2003. The airline carried 511,000 passengers compared to 402,500 in November 2003.
For the fourth quarter of 2004, CASM excluding fuel is expected to decrease 18.3% compared to the fourth quarter of 2003, reflecting changes in Horizon's flying mix from the traditional native network to a mix of native network flying and contract flying with Frontier Airlines. Under the contract flying agreement with Frontier, Horizon does not incur many of the normal costs of operations such as fuel, marketing costs and station labor and rents, resulting in significantly lower CASM (excluding fuel) and RASM. Horizon is currently operating nine 70-seat Bombardier CRJ-700 aircraft under the Frontier JetExpress brand, representing approximately 20% to 25% of total Horizon capacity and approximately 9% to 10% of total Horizon revenue.
For the quarter, we expect RASM to decline substantially compared to prior year due to the contract flying with Frontier and yield reductions offset by higher load factors.

Other Financial Information
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash and short-term investments totaled approximately $872 million at December 31, 2004.
Alaska's $150 Million Credit Facility expired on December 23, 2004. The Company is currently negotiating a replacement facility and expects to close the new transaction during the first quarter 2005.
Beginning in the second quarter of 2004, we lost the ability to defer, as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, recognition of any unrealized gain or loss on our fuel hedge contracts until the hedged fuel is consumed (also known as the ability to use "hedge accounting"). The implications of this loss going forward are as follows:
Fuel Hedging
To help investors understand our results, we are providing unaudited information about fuel price movements and the impact of our hedging program on our financial results. Management believes it is useful to compare results between periods that exclude the hedging gains/losses recorded on a GAAP basis and include the cash received or due on hedge positions settled during the period (although the related impact may have been recognized for financial reporting purposes in a prior period). We refer to this as the comparison of "economic fuel cost", which is presented below for October and November 2004.

Calculation of Economic Fuel Cost Per Gallon
Mark-to-Market Adjustment Related to Unsettled Hedges
*Amounts may include mark-to-market hedging gains (losses) recognized in non-operating income (expense) in previous periods.
Based on fluctuations in fuel prices during the month of December, we expect to record a significant mark-to-market loss in December in non-operating income related to hedges that settle in future periods.

The following table provides a fleet summary for Alaska and Horizon for actual airplanes on hand at the end of 2003 and changes in 2004 and 2005 based on our contractual commitments and expected retirement plans:
Operating Fleet Plan
Alaska has no firm commitments for aircraft deliveries beyond 2005. However, we plan to acquire three B737-800s in 2006. These planned acquisitions are not included in the table above since we do not have firm commitments at this time. Horizon has two CRJ 700s scheduled for delivery per year from 2006 to 2009 and none thereafter.

ITEM 2.02. Results of Operations And Financial Condition
Alaska Air Group, Inc. today issued a press release reporting financial results for the year ended December 31, 2004. The press release is furnished as Attachment 99.1.
 
Signature
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.

 
Exhibit 99.1
     SEATTLE  Alaska Air Group, Inc. (NYSE:ALK) today reported a fourth quarter net loss of $44.9 million, or $1.66 per diluted share, compared to net loss of $16.1 million, or $0.60 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2003. For the full year, the company reported a net loss of $15.3 million, or $0.57 per share, compared to net income of $13.5 million, or $0.51 per diluted share in 2003.
     Fourth quarter results in 2004 include a restructuring charge of $25.9 million ($16.0 million, net of tax, or $0.59 per share) and additional impairment charges of $0.6 million ($0.4 million, net of tax, or $0.01 per share) related to Horizon's retired F-28 fleet. This quarter's results also include $23.1 million ($14.2 million, net of tax, or $0.53 per share) in mark-to-market hedging losses reflecting a decrease in the fair value of the company's fuel hedge portfolio during the quarter. Without these items, the net loss would have been $14.3 million, or $0.53 per diluted share during the fourth quarter of 2004. Excluding the full-year impact of the items discussed above, as well as the B737-200 impairment charge and the navigation fee recovery recorded earlier in the year, and government compensation recorded in 2003, the 2004 full year net income would have been $5.2 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $30.8 million, or $1.15 per diluted share, in 2003.
     "The improvement in our operating results for the year shows that we are continuing to make headway with our restructuring. Our move in early 2004 to simplify fares, coupled with our employees' ongoing focus on the customer experience, contributed to a jump in our passenger traffic and loads," said Bill Ayer, Alaska Air Group's chairman and chief executive officer. "However, we would have clearly been in the red in 2004, after adjusting for the unusual items, if not for fuel hedging gains."
 
     "As we head into 2005, we must continue to pursue cost savings initiatives that will help us become consistently profitable, and weather the onslaught of low-cost competition, restructured network airlines and very high fuel prices."
     Alaska Airlines' passenger traffic in the fourth quarter increased 10.2 percent on a capacity increase of 5.0 percent. Alaska's load factor increased 3.4 percentage points to 72.9 percent compared to the same period in 2003. Alaska's operating revenue per available seat mile (ASM) increased 0.4 percent, while its operating cost per ASM excluding fuel and restructuring charges decreased 8.6 percent. Alaska's pretax loss for the quarter was $68.9 million, compared to a pretax loss of $27.3 million in 2003. Excluding the unusual items referenced above, Alaska's pretax loss was $22.7 million for the quarter.
     Horizon Air's passenger traffic in the fourth quarter increased 36.8 percent on a 28.1 percent capacity increase. Horizon's load factor increased by 4.4 percentage points to 71.7 percent compared to the same period in 2003. Horizon's operating revenue per available seat mile (ASM) decreased 17.2 percent, while its operating cost per ASM excluding fuel and the impairment charge decreased 18.1 percent. The decrease in Horizon's revenue per ASM and cost per ASM excluding fuel is largely due to the addition of Horizon's contract flying for Frontier Airlines. This flying represented 23.1 percent of Horizon's capacity during the fourth quarter and 9.9 percent of its passenger revenues. Horizon's pretax loss for the quarter was $1.6 million, compared to a pretax income of $5.4 million in 2003. Excluding the unusual items referenced above, Horizon's pretax income was $1.8 million for the quarter.
     Alaska Air Group had cash and short-term investments at December 31, 2004 of approximately $874 million compared to $812 million at December 31, 2003. The company's debt-to-capital ratio, assuming aircraft operating leases are capitalized at seven times annualized rent, was 78 percent as of December 31, 2004, compared to 77 percent as of December 31, 2003.
     A summary of financial and statistical data for Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air as well as a reconciliation of the reported non-GAAP financial measures can be found on pages 6 through 11.
     A conference call regarding the fourth quarter 2004 results will be simulcast via the internet at 8:30 a.m. Pacific Time. It may be accessed through the company's website at . For those unable to listen to the live broadcast, a replay will be available after the conclusion of the call at .

Pursuant to Item 10 of Regulation S-K, we are providing disclosure of the reconciliation of reported non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable financial measures reported on a GAAP basis. The non-GAAP financial measures provide management the ability to measure and monitor performance both with and without the cost of aircraft fuel (including the gains and losses associated with our fuel hedging program where appropriate), restructuring charges, aircraft impairment charges, government compensation in 2003 and a large recovery in 2004 of disputed navigation fees paid in prior years (of which $7.7 million was recorded in operating expenses and $3.3 million was recorded in non-operating income). Because the cost and availability of aircraft fuel are subject to many economic and political factors beyond our control and we record changes in the fair value of our hedge portfolio in our income statement, it is our view that the measurement and monitoring of performance without fuel is important. In addition, we believe the disclosure of financial performance without impairment and restructuring charges, government compensation and the navigation fee recovery in 2004 is useful to investors. Finally, these non-GAAP financial measures are also more comparable to financial measures reported to the Department of Transportation by other major network airlines.
Note A:
The following tables reconcile our non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for both Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Horizon Air Industries, Inc.:
 
 
Air Group Net Income (Loss) and EPS Reconciliation:
The following table summarizes Alaska Air Group, Inc.'s net income and diluted earnings per share during 2003 and 2004 excluding restructuring and impairment charges, navigation fee recovery, the second, third and fourth quarter of 2004 hedging mark-to-market gains (losses) and government compensation as reported in accordance with GAAP (in millions except per share amounts):
 
During our quarterly earnings conference call, we expect to discuss forward-looking forecasted unit cost information for 2005. This forecasted unit cost information includes non-GAAP unit cost estimates which are summarized in the following table together with the most directly comparable GAAP unit cost for both Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Horizon Air Industries, Inc.:
Forecasted Financial Measures
: Our forecast of fuel costs is based on anticipated gallons consumed and estimated fuel cost per gallon for both Alaska and Horizon. The estimate also excludes the benefit from settled hedges recorded in other non-operating income as it does not impact our operating cost per available seat mile as presented on a GAAP basis. Given the volatility of fuel prices, readers should be cautioned that actual fuel expense will likely differ from the forecast above.

Alaska Airlines' January traffic increased 10.8% to 1.249 billion RPMs from 1.127 billion flown a year earlier. Capacity during January was 1.814 billion ASMs, 8.4% higher than the 1.674 billion in January 2004. The passenger load factor (the percentage of available seats occupied by fare-paying passengers) for the month was 68.8%, compared to 67.3% in January 2004. The airline carried 1,231,300 passengers compared to 1,122,200 in January 2004.
For January 2005, RASM decreased by 0.8% as compared to January 2004 due to a decrease in yield partially offset by the load factor increase.
For Alaska, our forecast of cost per available seat mile and fuel cost per available seat mile is based on forward-looking estimates which will likely differ from actual results due to the volatility of fuel prices. Factors impacting our estimates include (but are not limited to) volatility of fuel prices. As we are unable to apply hedge accounting, the majority of the benefit we realize from settled fuel hedge contracts is classified in other non-operating income on our statement of operations and is thus not reflected in fuel cost per ASM above.

Horizon Air's January traffic increased 33.6% to 171.0 million RPMs from 128.0 million flown a year earlier. Capacity for January was 259.9 million ASMs, 27.7% higher than the 203.6 million in January 2004. The passenger load factor for the month was 65.9%, compared to 62.9% in January 2004. The airline carried 473,300 passengers compared to 372,000 in January 2004.
For the first quarter of 2005, CASM excluding fuel is expected to decrease 5.0% compared to the first quarter of 2003, reflecting changes in Horizon's flying mix from the traditional native network to a mix of native network flying and contract flying with Frontier Airlines, which began in January of 2004 and built up through the first half of 2004.
For January 2005, RASM decreased by 4.9% as compared to January 2004 resulting from an increase in contract flying with Frontier, which has significantly lower RASM than our system average.
For Horizon, our forecast of cost per available seat mile and fuel cost per available seat mile is based on forward-looking estimates which will likely differ significantly from actual results. Factors impacting our estimates include (but are not limited to) volatility of fuel prices. As we are unable to apply hedge accounting, the majority of the benefit we realize from settled fuel hedge contracts is classified in other non-operating income on our statement of operations and is thus not reflected in fuel cost per ASM above.

Other Financial Information
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash and short-term investments totaled approximately $813 million at January 31, 2005 compared to $874 million at December 31, 2004. The decrease of $61 million is principally due to semi-annual aircraft lease payments made for Horizon aircraft, partially offset by cash generated from operations.
Alaska's $150 Million Credit Facility expired on December 23, 2004. The Company is currently negotiating a replacement facility and expects to close the new transaction during the first quarter 2005.
Beginning in the second quarter of 2004, we lost the ability to defer, as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, recognition of any unrealized gain or loss on our fuel hedge contracts until the hedged fuel is consumed (also known as the ability to use "hedge accounting"). The implications of this loss going forward are as follows:
Fuel Hedging
To help investors understand our results, we are providing unaudited information about fuel price movements and the impact of our hedging program on our financial results. Management believes it is useful to compare results between periods that exclude the hedging gains/losses recorded on a GAAP basis and include the cash received or due on hedge positions settled during the period (although the related impact may have been recognized for financial reporting purposes in a prior period). We refer to this as the comparison of "economic fuel cost", which is presented below for January 2005.

FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION This report may contain forward-looking statements that are intended to be subject to the safe harbor protection provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements relate to future events or our future financial performance and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results or performance to be materially different from those indicated by any forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as "forecast," "may," "will," "could," "should," "expect," "plan," "believe," "potential" or other similar words indicating future events or contingencies. Some of the things that could cause our actual results to differ from our expectations are: changes in our operating costs including fuel; our ability to meet our cost reduction goals; the competitive environment and other trends in our industry; economic conditions; actual or threatened terrorist attacks; global instability and potential U.S. military involvement; the outcome of contract talks with the Air Line Pilots Association, whether as a result of negotiations or binding arbitration; labor disputes; our reliance on automated systems; changes in laws and regulations; liability and other claims asserted against us; failure to expand our business; interest rates and the availability of financing; our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; changes in our business plans; our significant indebtedness; downgrades of our credit ratings; and inflation. For a discussion of these and other risk factors, see Item 1 of the Company's Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2004 on Form 10-K. All of the forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the risk factors discussed therein. These risk factors may not be exhaustive. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risk factors emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict such new risk factors, nor can it assess the impact, if any, of such new risk factors on our business or events described in any forward-looking statements. We disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date of this report to conform them to actual results.
Table of Contents
Pursuant to 17 CFR Part 243 ("Regulation FD"), the Company is submitting information relating to its financial and operational outlook for 2005. This report includes information regarding forecasts of available seat miles (ASMs), cost per available seat mile (CASM) excluding fuel consumption, as well as certain actual results for revenue passenger miles (RPMs), load factor and revenue per available seat mile (RASM), for its subsidiaries Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Horizon Air. Our disclosure of operating cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel provides us the ability to measure and monitor our performance without these items. In addition, we believe the disclosure of financial performance without mark-to-market hedging gains is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is total operating expense per available seat mile. However, due to the large fluctuations in fuel prices, we are unable to predict total operating expense for any future period with any degree of certainty. Please see the cautionary statement under "Forward-Looking Information."

The airline carried 449,800 passengers compared to 410,200 in February 2004. For February 2005, RASM decreased by 7.7% as compared to February 2004 resulting from an increase in contract flying with Frontier Airlines. For January 2005, RASM decreased by 4.9% as compared to January 2004.

First Quarter 2005
NM = Not Meaningful
Alaska Airlines' March traffic increased 10% to 1.464 billion RPMs from 1.330 billion flown a year earlier. Capacity during March was 1.880 billion ASMs, 1.9% higher than the 1.845 billion in March 2004. The passenger load factor (the percentage of available seats occupied by fare-paying passengers) for the month was 77.9%, compared to 72.1% in March 2004. The airline carried 1,445,200 passengers compared to 1,336,300 in March 2004.
For February 2005, RASM remained flat as compared to February 2004. For January 2005, RASM decreased by 0.8% as compared to January 2004.
* For Alaska Airlines, our forecast of cost per ASM, fuel cost per ASM and impairment charge per ASM is based on forward-looking estimates, which will likely differ from actual results due to the volatility of fuel prices and the finalization of the impairment charge as discussed below. There are several factors impacting our estimates including, but not limited to, the volatility of fuel prices. As we are unable to apply hedge accounting, the majority of the benefit we realize from settled fuel hedge contracts is classified in other non-operating income on our statement of operations and is thus not reflected in fuel cost per ASM above. See pages 6 & 7 for additional information regarding fuel costs.
In March, Alaska Airlines notified the Port of Oakland that it would be terminating its Oakland hanger lease. As a result of the decision to exit the facility, certain leasehold improvements will be impaired. Alaska Airlines will record an associated impairment charge during the first quarter ranging from $6.5 to $7.5 million. The impairment charge per ASM computed above assumes total impairment of $7 million, which is preliminary and subject to finalization.
 
Horizon Air's March traffic increased 15.4% to 204.8 million RPMs from 177.5 million flown a year earlier. Capacity for March was 280.0 million ASMs, 5.5% higher than the 265.3 million in March 2004. The passenger load factor for the month was 73.1%, compared to 66.9% in March 2004. The airline carried 550,600 passengers compared to 485,100 in March 2004.
For the first quarter of 2005, CASM excluding fuel is expected to decrease 5.7% compared to the first quarter of 2004, reflecting changes in Horizon's flying mix from the traditional native network to a mix of native network flying and contract flying with Frontier Airlines, which began in January of 2004 and built up through the first half of 2004.
For February 2005, RASM decreased by 7.7% compared to February 2004 resulting from an increase in contract flying with Frontier. For January 2005, RASM decreased by 4.9% as compared to January 2004.
* For Horizon Air, our forecast of cost per ASM and fuel cost per ASM is based on forward-looking estimates, which will likely differ significantly from actual results. There are several factors impacting our estimates including, but not limited to, the volatility of fuel prices. As we are unable to apply hedge accounting, the majority of the benefit we realize from settled fuel hedge contracts is classified in other non-operating income on our statement of operations and is thus not reflected in fuel cost per ASM above. See pages 6 & 7 for additional information regarding fuel costs.
 
Other Financial Information
Cash and short-term investments totaled approximately $761 million at March 31, 2005.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Beginning in the second quarter of 2004, we lost the ability to defer, as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, recognition of any unrealized gain or loss on our fuel hedge contracts until the hedged fuel is consumed (also known as the ability to use "hedge accounting"). The implications of this are :

Mark-to-Market Adjustment Related to Unsettled Hedges  January and February 2005 (unaudited)
*Amounts may include mark-to-market hedging gains (losses) recognized in non-operating income (expense) in previous periods.
For Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air, GAAP fuel expense per gallon for the quarter is expected to be approximately $1.54 and $1.59, respectively. The economic fuel expense per gallon for the quarter is expected to be approximately $1.34 and $1.39 for Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air, respectively. March mark-to-market gains included in non-operating income related to hedges that settle in future periods are expected to be approximately $45 million for the combined Air Group, bringing the total for the quarter to approximately $90 million.
Our forecast of GAAP and economic fuel expense per gallon for the first quarter is based on forward-looking estimates, which will likely differ from actual results. There are several factors impacting our estimates including, but not limited to, the volatility of fuel prices and consumption.

ITEM 2.02. Results of Operations And Financial Condition
Alaska Air Group, Inc. today issued a press release reporting financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2005. The press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
 
Signature
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.

 
EXHIBIT 99.1
     SEATTLE  Alaska Air Group, Inc. (NYSE:ALK) today reported a first quarter net loss of $80.5 million, or $2.39 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $42.7 million, or $1.59 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2004.
     First quarter results in 2005 include a charge of $144.7 million ($90.4 million, net of tax, or $2.73 per diluted share) resulting from the cumulative effect of a change in the way the Company accounts for airframe and engine overhauls and a $7.4 million restructuring charge ($4.6 million, net of tax, or $0.13 per diluted share), primarily associated with a decision to terminate the lease at the Company's Oakland heavy maintenance base. This quarter's results also include $90.0 million ($56.2 million, net of tax, or $1.69 per diluted share) in mark-to-market gains on fuel hedges that settle in future periods compared to $0.4 million ($0.3 million, net of tax, or $0.01 per diluted share) in 2004. Without these items, and excluding the impairment charge of $2.4 million ($1.6 million, net of tax, or $.06 per diluted share) in the first quarter of 2004, the net loss would have been $41.7 million, or $1.54 per share during the first quarter of 2005 compared to a loss of $41.4 million, or $1.54 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2004.
     "Making excuses for our results would be easy based on the current environment of extremely high fuel prices, very little pricing power and a seasonally soft first quarter," said Bill Ayer, Alaska Air Group's chairman and chief executive officer. "But these realities, along with the cost reductions achieved by others in the industry mean that we simply must have lower costs."
     Alaska Airlines' passenger traffic in the first quarter increased 8.9 percent on a capacity
 
increase of 3.7 percent. Alaska's load factor increased 3.5 percentage points to 72.6 percent compared to the same period in 2004. Alaska's operating revenue per available seat mile (ASM) increased 2.6 percent, while its operating cost per ASM excluding fuel and restructuring charges decreased 0.7 percent. Alaska's pretax income for the quarter was $15.4 million. Excluding the restructuring charges of $7.4 million and the gains on fuel hedges that settle in future periods of $77.7 million in 2005 and $0.4 million in 2004, Alaska's pretax loss was $54.9 million for the quarter, compared to a pretax loss of $53.6 million in 2004.
     Horizon Air's passenger traffic in the first quarter increased 20.0 percent on a 13.0 percent capacity increase. Horizon's load factor increased by 4.0 percentage points to 69.0 percent compared to the same period in 2004. Horizon's operating revenue per available seat mile (ASM) decreased 2.8 percent, while its operating cost per ASM excluding fuel and impairment charge decreased 4.4 percent. The decrease in Horizon's revenue per ASM and cost per ASM excluding fuel is largely due to the addition of Horizon's contract flying for Frontier Airlines, which began in January 2004. This flying represented 23.0 percent of Horizon's capacity during the first quarter and 10.1 percent of its passenger revenues compared to 16.2% of its capacity and 7.4% of its passenger revenues in the first quarter of 2004. Horizon's pretax income for the quarter was $4.6 million, compared to a pretax loss of $10.4 million in 2004. Excluding gains on fuel hedges that settle in future periods of $12.3 million and the impairment charge in 2004, Horizon's pretax loss was $7.7 million for the quarter, compared to $8.0 million in the first quarter of 2004.
     Alaska Air Group had cash and short-term investments at March 31, 2005 of approximately $764 million compared to $874 million at December 31, 2004.
     A summary of financial and statistical data for Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air as well as a reconciliation of the reported non-GAAP financial measures can be found on pages 6 through 10.

Note A:
Pursuant to Item 10 of Regulation S-K, we are providing disclosure of the reconciliation of reported non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable financial measures reported on a GAAP basis. The non-GAAP financial measures provide management the ability to measure and monitor performance both with and without the cost of aircraft fuel (including the gains and losses associated with our fuel hedging program where appropriate), restructuring charges, and aircraft impairment charges. Because the cost and availability of aircraft fuel are subject to many economic and political factors beyond our control and we record changes in the fair value of our hedge portfolio in our income statement, it is our view that the measurement and monitoring of performance without fuel is important. In addition, we believe the disclosure of financial performance without impairment and restructuring charges is useful to investors. Finally, these non-GAAP financial measures are also more comparable to financial measures reported to the Department of Transportation by other major network airlines.
The following tables reconcile our non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for both Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Horizon Air Industries, Inc.:

Forecasted Financial Measures
During our quarterly earnings conference call, we expect to discuss forward-looking forecasted unit cost information for 2005. This forecasted unit cost information includes non-GAAP unit cost estimates which are summarized in the following table together with the most directly comparable GAAP unit cost for Horizon Air Industries, Inc.:
: Our forecast of fuel costs is based on anticipated gallons consumed and estimated fuel cost per gallon for Horizon. The estimate also excludes the benefit from settled hedges recorded in other non-operating income as it does not impact our operating cost per available seat mile as presented on a GAAP basis. Given the volatility of fuel prices, readers should be cautioned that actual fuel expense will likely differ from the forecast above.

Exhibit 99.1
 
     SEATTLE  An arbitrator notified Alaska Airlines today of his decisions on the major terms of a new contract between the airline and its Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) bargaining unit.
     The decisions of the arbitrator, Richard Kasher, cover all 1,465 pilots employed by Alaska Airlines. The new contract becomes effective May 1.
     The existing contract between the airline and the union called for an arbitrator, mutually agreed upon, to resolve differences if the parties were unable to reach agreement. ALPA and Alaska Airlines began contract talks in October 2003. The arbitrator was called in to help craft a settlement when an agreement could not be reached by a December 15, 2004, deadline.
     While wage provisions go into effect tomorrow, full implementation of all provisions is expected to occur over several weeks. The contract becomes amendable in two years.
     The terms of the agreement, set by the arbitrator, were based on information presented by both the airline and ALPA. They include an approximate 26 percent reduction in pilot wages, various work rule changes resulting in productivity improvements and higher employee health care contributions. No changes were made to the pilots' pension or profit sharing plans.
     "We are grateful to the arbitrator for helping us reach a resolution," said Dennis Hamel, Alaska's vice president of employee services. "This allows us to move forward with a competitive wage and benefit package for our pilots and helps us achieve a better cost alignment with other major carriers."
     Alaska Airlines, the nation's ninth largest carrier, serves more than 50 cities in Alaska, the Lower 48, Canada and Mexico.

ITEM 8.01. Other Events
Pilot Arbitration Decision
On April 30, 2005, Alaska received a decision from an arbitrator regarding changes to its pilot pay rates and work rules that completed a process which began 22 months ago.
In May and June of 2003, Alaska met with its union leaders to discuss the need to make cost adjustments in every area of the company in order to be competitive in a changing airline industry. A cost reduction target of $307 million was established, which was based on the company's size at that time. Of that overall target, $112 million, or 36%, was identified for wage and benefit reductions and, of that amount, $82 million was sought from pilots. The original $82 million was based on the company's assessment of the market at that time  $71 million for wages ($54 million for wage rates and $17 million for work rules/productivity) and $11 million for fringe benefits. Since that target was established, Alaska's pilot costs have increased due to an across-the-board wage increase of 4% (or approximately $8 million) and the growth of the company, and the market has continued to decline.
Alaska and its pilot union initiated mid-term negotiations in October 2003. Failing to reach agreement, the company and the union then began normal Section 6 negotiations in April 2004. The existing agreement provided that if a new agreement was not reached by December 15, 2004, wages plus 10 other issues would be submitted to an arbitrator for binding interest arbitration. On April 30, 2005, the arbitrator made his decision, the majority of which was effective May 1.
The company estimates the savings from the decision are approximately $80  $90 million per year. Of that amount, approximately $60 million is due to lower wage rates, approximately $10 million is due to improved work rules; and approximately $4 million is due to changes in medical benefits and lower payroll taxes. Additionally, the lower wage rates will reduce pension costs by $5.5  $14.0 million per year, depending on the measure used.
On an annual basis these changes amount to approximately .35 to .40 cents per available seat mile. The majority of the changes will be realized immediately; however, the company does not expect to fully realize work rule changes until it grows.
The company also sought changes to the structure of its defined benefit retirement plan and certain work rules, neither of which were achieved.
In the aggregate, we believe the cost savings from the arbitrator's decision are generally in line with the company's cost savings objective.
Ramp Negotiation Update
On May 6, 2005, Alaska was notified by the International Association of Machinists that its members had voted against the Company's latest contract offer.

Exhibit 99.1
     SEATTLE  As part of a continuing cost-management initiative to secure the airline's future, Alaska Airlines has contracted with Menzies Aviation to provide ramp services at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport.
     Effective immediately, the move means the loss of 472 ramp service positions in Seattle held by company employees. Ramp services include loading and unloading baggage, and guiding aircraft to and from airport gates.
     Alaska Airlines currently contracts with outside companies to provide ramp services in 41 of the 56 cities it serves. The decision to work with a service provider in Seattle is projected to save the airline more than $13 million annually.
     "A decision of this kind, impacting people who have served this company well, is extremely difficult," Alaska's CEO Bill Ayer said. "But the ongoing turmoil in the airline industry, coupled with high fuel prices and pressure from low-cost carriers, puts us in a position where we must continue to find ways to reduce the cost of running our airline.
     "Our success working with providers in other cities gives us confidence that we can continue moving Seattle customers' bags reliably while reducing our operating costs significantly," Ayer said.
 
     The decision came after a lengthy evaluation process in which Alaska Airlines considered numerous options for saving money while improving the efficiency of the airline's ramp services. In addition to requesting proposals from outside providers, the airline conducted talks over a period of 20 months with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) to discuss contract changes focused on achieving a more market-competitive rate for delivering these services to customers. "Unfortunately, we were unable to achieve a contract approaching the savings available from service providers," said Ed White, Alaska's vice president of ground operations.
     "To ease the transition for affected employees, we are working with the IAM to offer a more lucrative severance package than that specified in the current contract," White said. In line with the severance offered to management, maintenance and fleet service employees last year, this package would include two weeks of base pay for each year of service; a cash bonus of $3,000 to $15,000 based on length of service; one year of company-paid health care coverage; and travel benefits for the employee and eligible dependents; in addition to a nine-week extension of current wages and benefits, as required by law. The airline also will provide information on outplacement assistance, career counseling, retraining resources and opportunities with other local employers.
     Employees impacted by the Seattle decision will have the option to receive full company severance while applying for jobs with the new service provider.
     Still under negotiation with the IAM is the contract covering more than 450 ramp service, air freight and supply agents in the state of Alaska; nearly 140 air freight and supply agents in Seattle; and 13 supply agents in Los Angeles, Oakland, Phoenix, Portland and San Francisco. The airline plans to participate in mediated sessions with the union this summer focused on reaching an agreement with this bargaining unit.
 
     Menzies Aviation is a global provider of ground handling services to more than 500 airline customers at some of the world's busiest airports. The company provides ramp services for Alaska Airlines in Los Angeles, Portland, San Francisco, San Jose and at all Mexican airports the airline serves.

ITEM 7.01. Regulation FD Disclosure
Pursuant to 17 CFR Part 243 ("Regulation FD"), the Company is submitting information relating to its financial and operational outlook for 2005. This report includes information regarding forecasts of available seat miles (ASMs), cost per available seat mile (CASM) excluding fuel consumption and restructuring charges, as well as certain actual results for revenue passenger miles (RPMs), load factor and revenue per available seat mile (RASM), for its subsidiaries Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Horizon Air. Our disclosure of operating cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel and restructuring charges provides us the ability to measure and monitor our performance without these items. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is total operating expense per available seat mile. However, due to the large fluctuations in fuel prices, we are unable to predict total operating expense for any future period with any degree of certainty. In addition, we believe the disclosure of financial performance without mark-to-market hedging gains is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. Please see the cautionary statement under "Forward-Looking Information."
In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the following information shall not be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), nor shall such information be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing. This Report will not be deemed an admission as to the materiality of any information required to be disclosed solely to satisfy the requirements of Regulation FD.
References in this report on Form 8-K to "Air Group," "the Company," "we," "us," and "our" refer to Alaska Air Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise specified. Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Horizon Air Industries, Inc. are referred to as "Alaska" and "Horizon," respectively, and together as our "airlines."
 
Second Quarter 2005
Alaska Airlines' April traffic increased 8.7% to 1.387 billion RPMs from 1.276 billion flown a year earlier. Capacity during April was 1.812 billion ASMs, 1.5% higher than the 1.785 billion in April 2004. The passenger load factor (the percentage of available seats occupied by fare-paying passengers) for the month was 76.5%, compared to 71.5% in April 2004. The airline carried 1,362,000 passengers compared to 1,290,600 in April 2004.
In April 2005, RASM increased 6.7% compared to April 2004 due to higher load factors.
Based on recent labor developments, our current estimates of our unit costs for the remainder of the year are as follows:
Third and Fourth Quarter 2005
 
Horizon Air's April traffic increased 14.8% to 186.7 million RPMs from 162.7 million flown a year earlier. Capacity for April was 267.6 million ASMs, 5.4% higher than the 253.9 million in April 2004. The passenger load factor for the month was 69.8%, compared to 64.1% in April 2004. The airline carried 504,500 passengers compared to 447,800 in April 2004.
For the second quarter of 2005, CASM excluding fuel is expected to decrease 3.2% compared to the second quarter of 2004, reflecting changes in Horizon's flying mix from the traditional native network to a mix of native network flying and contract flying with Frontier Airlines, which began in January of 2004 and built up through the first half of 2004.
In April 2005, RASM increased 4% compared to April 2004.
Cash and short-term investments totaled approximately $784 million at April 30, 2005 compared to 763.5 million at March 31, 2005.
Other Financial Information
Liquidity and Capital Resources
 
Fuel Hedging
We are providing unaudited information about fuel price movements and the impact of our hedging program on our financial results. Management believes it is useful to compare results between periods that exclude the mark-to-market hedging gains/losses associated with contracts that settle recorded on a GAAP basis and include the cash received or due on hedge positions settled during the period (although the related impact may have been recognized for financial reporting purposes in a prior period). We refer to this as the comparison of "economic fuel cost", which is presented below for April 2005.

Operating Fleet Plan
The following table provides a fleet summary for Alaska and Horizon for actual airplanes on hand as of the date of this report and changes during the remainder of 2005 based on our contractual commitments and expected retirement plans:
 
Alaska has commitment to acquire three B737-800 aircrafts in 2006. Horizon has two CRJ 700s scheduled for delivery per year from 2006 to 2009 and none thereafter.

ITEM 7.01.       Regulation FD Disclosure.
Recent news reports have stated that Alaska Air Group, Inc. ("Alaska") is considering making a significant investment in America West Airlines. While it is Alaska's normal practice not to comment on rumors such as this, the amount of change currently underway within our industry and at Alaska, as well as the extensive national media coverage repeating this rumor, have the potential of creating uncertainty among our employees.

ITEM 5.02. Departure of Directors or Principal Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Principal Officers
On December 1, 2004, Alaska Air Group announced the election of Patricia M. Bedient to its Board of Directors. At that time the Company had not yet determined on which committees Ms. Bedient would serve. On June 7, 2005, the Board of Directors appointed Ms. Bedient to the Audit Committee of Alaska Air Group.
ITEM 5.03. Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws
On June 7, 2005, Alaska Air Group amended its bylaws. The amendment added the words, "except in the election of directors (who shall be elected by plurality vote)" in the second paragraph of Section 5 of the bylaws. The purpose of the amendment was to resolve a potential ambiguity in the bylaws concerning the standard for election of directors. The Company has always elected directors by plurality vote, in accordance with Delaware corporation law, and the amendment clarifies that this is our practice.
The full text of the Alaska Air Group bylaws, as amended, is filed herewith as Exhibit 3(ii).

Bylaws of Alaska Air Group, Inc. As Amended and in Effect June 7, 2005 Page 9 ARTICLE VIII INDEMNIFICATION Section 1. Right to Indemnification. Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved (including, without limitation, as a witness) in any actual or threatened action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a "proceeding"), by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a Director or officer of the corporation or that, being or having been such a Director or officer or employee of the corporation, he or she is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a Director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan (hereinafter an "indemnitee"), whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a Director, officer, employee or agent or in any other capacity while serving as a Director, officer, employee or agent, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the corporation to the full extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than permitted prior thereto) or by other applicable law as then in effect, against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts to be paid in settlement) actually and reasonably incurred or suffered by such indemnitee in connection therewith and such indemnification shall continue as to an indemnitee who has ceased to be a Director, officer, employee, or agent and shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and administrators; provided, however, that except as provided in Section 2 with respect to proceedings seeking to enforce rights to indemnification, the corporation shall indemnify any such indemnitee seeking indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors of the corporation. The right to indemnification conferred in this Section shall be a contract right and shall include the right to be paid by the corporation the expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition (hereinafter an "advancement of expenses"); provided, however, that if the Delaware General Corporations Law requires, an advancement of expenses incurred by an indemnitee in his or her capacity as a Director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such indemnitee including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) shall be made only upon delivery to the corporation of an undertaking (hereinafter an "undertaking"), by or on behalf of such indemnitee to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal that such indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under this Section 1 or otherwise. Section 2. Right of Indemnitee to Bring Suit. If a claim under Section 1 is not paid in full by the corporation within sixty days after a written claim has been received by the corporation, except in the case of a claim for advancement of expenses, in which case the applicable period shall be twenty days, the indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit against the corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim. If
Bylaws of Alaska Air Group, Inc. As Amended and in Effect June 7, 2005 Page 10 successful in whole or in part in any such suit, the indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting such suit. The indemnitee shall be presumed to be entitled to indemnification under this Article upon submission of a written claim (and, in an action brought to enforce a claim for advancement of expenses, where the required undertaking, if any is required, has been tendered to the corporation), and thereafter the corporation shall have the burden of proof to overcome the presumption that the indemnitee is not so entitled. Neither the failure of the corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such suit that indemnification of the indemnitee is proper in the circumstances nor an actual determination by the corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification shall be a defense to the suit or create a presumption that the indemnitee is not so entitled. Section 3. Nonexclusivity of Rights. The right to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses conferred in this Article shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise. Notwithstanding any amendment to or repeal of this Article, any indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification in accordance with the provisions hereof and thereof with respect to any acts or omissions of such indemnitee occurring prior to such amendment or repeal. Section 4. Insurance, Contracts and Funding. The corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any Director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the Delaware General Corporation Law. The corporation may without further stockholder approval, enter into contracts with any indemnitee in furtherance of the provisions of this Article and may create a trust fund, grant a security interest or use other means (including, without limitation, a letter of credit) to ensure the payment of such amounts as may be necessary to effect indemnification as provided in this Article. Section 5. Persons Serving Other Entities. Any person who is or was a Director, officer or employee of the corporation who is or was serving as a Director or officer of another corporation of which a majority of the shares entitled to vote in the election of its directors is held by the corporation shall be deemed to be so serving at the request of the corporation and entitled to indemnification and advancement of expenses under Section 1. Section 6. Indemnification of Employees and Agents of the Corporation. The corporation may, by action of its Board of Directors, grant rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses to any employee or agent, or any group or groups of employees or
Bylaws of Alaska Air Group, Inc. As Amended and in Effect June 7, 2005 Page 11 agents, of the corporation with the same scope and effect as the provisions of this Article with respect to the indemnification and advancement of expenses of directors and officers of the corporation. ARTICLE IX CHECKS, DRAFTS, BANK ACCOUNTS, ETC. Section 1. Checks, Drafts, Etc.; Loans. All checks, drafts or other orders for the payment of money, notes or other evidences of indebtedness issued in the name of the corporation shall be signed by such officer or officers, agent or agents of the corporation and in such manner as shall, from time to time, be determined by resolution of the Board of Directors. Such authority may be general or confined to specific circumstances. Section 2. Deposits. All funds of the corporation shall be deposited, from time to time, to the credit of the corporation in such banks, trust companies or other depositories as the Board of Directors may select, or as may be selected by any officer or officers, agent or agents of the corporation to whom such power may, from time to time, be delegated by the Board of Directors; and for the purpose of such deposit, any officer or agent to whom such power may be delegated by the Board of Directors, may endorse, assign and deliver checks, drafts and other orders for the payment of money which are payable to the order of the corporation. ARTICLE X AMENDMENTS These Bylaws may be altered or repealed and new Bylaws may be made by the affirmative vote of a majority of the Board of Directors, subject to the right of the stockholders to amend or repeal Bylaws made or amended by the Board of Directors or to adopt new Bylaws, by the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding stock of the corporation entitled to vote thereon and the holders of three-fourths of the stock present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting, provided that notice of the proposed action be included in the notice of such meeting. Terms of the masculine gender used for convenience in these Bylaws should be understood in the feminine gender where appropriate. * * * * *

ITEM 7.01. Regulation FD Disclosure
Pursuant to 17 CFR Part 243 ("Regulation FD"), the Company is submitting information relating to its financial and operational outlook for 2005. This report includes information regarding forecasts of available seat miles (ASMs), cost per available seat mile (CASM) excluding fuel consumption and restructuring charges, as well as certain actual results for revenue passenger miles (RPMs), load factor and revenue per available seat mile (RASM), for its subsidiaries Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Horizon Air. Our disclosure of operating cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel and restructuring charges provides us the ability to measure and monitor our performance without these items. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is total operating expense per available seat mile. However, due to the large fluctuations in fuel prices, we are unable to predict total operating expense for any future period with any degree of certainty. In addition, we believe the disclosure of financial performance without mark-to-market hedging gains is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. Please see the cautionary statement under "Forward-Looking Information."
In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the following information shall not be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), nor shall such information be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing. This Report will not be deemed an admission as to the materiality of any information required to be disclosed solely to satisfy the requirements of Regulation FD.
References in this report on Form 8-K to "Air Group," "the Company," "we," "us," and "our" refer to Alaska Air Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise specified. Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Horizon Air Industries, Inc. are referred to as "Alaska" and "Horizon," respectively, and together as our "airlines."
Aircraft Order and Operating Fleet Plan
On June 15, 2005, Alaska Airlines announced an order for 35 Boeing 737-800 aircraft, with an option to acquire up to 15 more. The order also includes purchase rights for an additional 50 737-800s. Delivery of the new aircraft will be phased in over the next six years, with the first aircraft slated to enter Alaska's fleet in January 2006. The delivery plan gives Alaska flexibility to expand its fleet or replace older airplanes with new aircraft without increasing fleet size. The order includes three 737-800s that we already planned to acquire in 2006.
 
Firm aircraft to be delivered under the order are scheduled as follows:
The following table provides a fleet summary for Alaska and Horizon for aircraft on hand as of the date of this report and changes during the remainder of 2005 based on our contractual commitments and expected retirement plans:
Horizon has two CRJ 700s scheduled for delivery per year from 2006 to 2009 and none thereafter.
On June 10, 2005, Alaska announced a reduction in its summer flight schedule in order to improve operational reliability, reduce cancellations, and increase on-time performance by eliminating eight round trip flights per day. The reductions represent approximately 0.8% of planned capacity in the second quarter and 3.5% in the third quarter. The Company expects to reaccomodate many of the impacted passengers on other Alaska flights. However, we do expect some negative impact to revenue during the summer months, although the impact cannot be quantified at this time. This schedule reduction is included in the forecasts below for ASMs and corresponding costs per ASM during the remainder of the year.
 
Additionally, on May 27, 2005, Alaska announced a tentative agreement with the Air Line Pilots Association for a revised five year contract that would include, among other items, a 20 percent reduction in pilots wages versus the average 26 percent reduction resulting from the recent arbitrator's decision. The tentative agreement also includes work rule changes to improve productivity and allows pilots to choose between the current pension plan or a defined contribution plan. To present a conservative forecast of our projected unit costs, we have assumed that the tentative agreement is ratified and goes into effect on July 1, 2005 resulting in unit costs for the third and fourth quarter that are higher than our previous guidance. However, the timing or certainty of actual ratification is not known at this time. If a contract is effective sometime after July 1, our pilot wage costs would be lower until the contract takes effect.
Besides the capacity reductions and changes in assumed pilot costs, other factors driving the changes in the Alaska forecast of unit costs from our prior disclosure released on May 25, 2005 are an increase in our estimate for fuel expense, projected increases in maintenance expense through 2005 and start-up costs associated with the contracting out of the ramp service in Seattle.
Second Quarter 2005
Alaska Airlines' May traffic increased 6.1% to 1.387 billion RPMs from 1.308 billion flown a year earlier. Capacity during May was 1.805 billion ASMs, 3.3% lower than the 1.866 billion in May 2004. The passenger load factor (the percentage of available seats occupied by fare-paying passengers) for the month was 76.8%, compared to 70.1% in May 2004. The airline carried 1,361,100 passengers compared to 1,310,700 in May 2004.
In May 2005, RASM increased 11.4% compared to May 2004 due to higher load factors. April RASM increased 6.7% compared to April of 2004.
 
We believe that our ASMs and unit costs for the remainder of the year will be as follows:
Third and Fourth Quarter 2005
*For Alaska, our forecast of cost per ASM and fuel cost per ASM is based on forward-looking estimates which will likely differ from actual results due to the volatility of fuel prices. There are several factors impacting our estimates including, but not limited to, the volatility of fuel prices, the finalization of labor agreements and the timing and amount of restructuring charges as discussed below. As we are unable to apply "hedge accounting", the majority of the benefit we realize from settled fuel hedge contracts is classified in other non-operating income on our statement of operations and is thus not reflected in fuel cost per ASM above. See page 8 for additional information regarding fuel costs.
Our forecast of GAAP cost per ASM excludes restructuring charges associated with the severance and other costs resulting from contracting out of ramp services in Seattle. We have not yet determined the financial impact of this event pending final agreement with the International Association of Machinists. However, we believe that it is likely that we will record a substantial restructuring charge in the second or third quarter. Furthermore, we continue to be in negotiations with several other labor groups, thus our labor costs for the remainder of the year are not certain at this time.
 
Horizon Air's May traffic increased 22.0% to 210.8 million RPMs from 172.8 million flown a year earlier. Capacity for May was 291.0 million ASMs, 9.9% higher than the 264.8 million in May 2004. The passenger load factor for the month was 72.4%, compared to 65.3% in May 2004. The airline carried 555,200 passengers compared to 472,100 in May 2004.
*For Horizon, our forecast of cost per ASM and fuel cost per ASM is based on forward-looking estimates, which will likely differ significantly from actual results. There are several factors impacting our estimates including, but not limited to, the volatility of fuel prices. As we are unable to apply hedge accounting, the majority of the benefit we realize from settled fuel hedge contracts is classified in other non-operating income on our statement of operations and is thus not reflected in fuel cost per ASM above. See page 8 for additional information regarding fuel costs.
In May 2005, RASM increased 3.9% compared to May 2005. April RASM increased 4.0% compared to April 2004.
Other Financial Information
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash and short-term investments totaled approximately $788 million at May 31, 2005 compared to $784 million at April 30, 2005. In connection with the aircraft order, we made purchase deposit payments totaling approximately $100 million which, when offset by normal cash activity, has reduced our current cash balance to approximately $725 million. In addition, we expect to finance additional purchase deposits directly with Boeing or other financial institutions.
 
We are providing unaudited information about fuel price movements and the impact of our hedging program on our financial results. Management believes it is useful to compare results between periods that exclude the mark-to-market hedging gains/losses associated with contracts that settle recorded on a GAAP basis and include the cash received or due on hedge positions settled during the period (although the related impact may have been recognized for financial reporting purposes in a prior period). We refer to this as the comparison of "economic fuel cost", which is presented below for April and May 2005.

Second Quarter 2005
NM = Not Meaningful
Table of Contents
Alaska Airlines' June traffic increased 1.4% to 1.542 billion RPMs from 1.520 billion flown a year earlier. Capacity during June was 1.926 billion ASMs, 2.9% lower than the 1.983 billion in June 2004. The passenger load factor (the percentage of available seats occupied by fare-paying passengers) for the month was 80.1%, compared to 76.7% in June 2004. The airline carried 1,508,800 passengers compared to 1,514,200 in June 2004.
In May 2005, RASM increased 11.4% compared to May 2004 due to higher load factors. April RASM increased 6.7% compared to April of 2004. We expect RASM in June to increase over 2004, however at a level lower than the May increase.
We currently estimate that our ASMs and unit costs for the remainder of the year will be as follows:

On May 27, 2005, Alaska announced a tentative agreement with the Air Line Pilots Association for a revised five year contract that would include, among other items, a 20 percent reduction in pilots wages versus the average 26 percent reduction resulting from the recent arbitrator's decision. As discussed above, the tentative agreement was rejected on July 11, 2005 by the pilots. Therefore, this forecast has been revised from our June 16, 2005 estimate to reflect the 26 percent wage reduction for the remainder of 2005.
Table of Contents
Our forecast of GAAP cost per ASM for the second quarter includes a restructuring charge of approximately $16.5 million associated with the severance and other costs resulting from contracting out of ramp services in Seattle. This estimate will likely differ from the actual amount recorded. The International Association of Machinists approved the voluntary severance package for its members on June 30, 2005.
Horizon Air's June traffic increased 11.1% to 221.3 million RPMs from 199.1 million flown a year earlier. Capacity for June was 290.4 million ASMs, 6.4% higher than the 272.8 million in June 2004. The passenger load factor for the month was 76.2%, compared to 73.0% in June 2004. The airline carried 576,400 passengers compared to 533,600 in June 2004.
*For Horizon, our forecast of cost per ASM and fuel cost per ASM is based on forward-looking estimates, which will likely differ significantly from actual results. There are several factors impacting our estimates including, but not limited to, the volatility of fuel prices. As we are unable to apply hedge accounting, the majority of the benefit we realize from settled fuel hedge contracts is classified in other non-operating income on our statement of operations and is thus not reflected in fuel cost per ASM above.

In May 2005, RASM increased 3.9% compared to May 2004. April RASM increased 4% compared to April 2004.
Cash and short-term investments totaled approximately $723 million at June 30, 2005 compared to $788 million at May 31, 2005. The decline of $65 million is largely due to purchase deposit payments to Boeing of approximately $100 million in connection with the recent aircraft order, offset by cash generated from operations.

For Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air, GAAP fuel expense per gallon for the quarter is expected to be approximately $1.74 and $1.83, respectively. The economic fuel expense per gallon for the quarter is expected to be approximately $1.49 and $1.58 for Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air, respectively. June mark-to-market gains included in non-operating income related to hedges that settle in future periods are expected to be approximately $39.8 million for the combined Air Group, bringing the total gain for the quarter to approximately $3.0 million.

ITEM 2.02. Results of Operations And Financial Condition
Alaska Air Group, Inc. today issued a press release reporting financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2005. The press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
Table of Contents
Signature
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.

 
EXHIBIT 99.1
     SEATTLE  Alaska Air Group, Inc. (NYSE:ALK) today reported second quarter net income of $17.4 million, or $0.56 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $1.7 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2004.
     Second quarter results include a restructuring charge of $14.7 million ($9.2 million, net of tax, or $0.28 per diluted share) for employee severance and related costs resulting primarily from the subcontracting of the Seattle ramp service function in May 2005. Second quarter results also include $3.0 million ($1.9 million, net of tax, or $0.06 per diluted share) in mark-to-market hedging gains on fuel hedges that settle in future periods, compared to $22.3 million ($14.8 million, net of tax, or $0.55 per share) in 2004. Without these items, and excluding aircraft impairment charges of $37.2 million ($24.7 million, net of tax, or $0.92 per share) in the second quarter of 2004, net income would have been $24.7 million, or $0.74 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2005, compared to net income of $8.2 million, or $0.31 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2004.
     "Although we are seeing gains in passenger loads and ticket prices, we are facing operational problems which, if we don't correct them, will impact the long-term reputation of Alaska Airlines," said Bill Ayer, Alaska Air Group's chairman and chief executive officer. "Our primary focus is on improving our on-time performance in order to deliver on customer promises and reduce the stress on our employees."
     Alaska Airlines' passenger traffic in the second quarter increased 5.2 percent on a capacity decrease of 1.6 percent. Alaska's load factor increased 5.1 percentage points to 77.9 percent compared to the same period in 2004. Alaska's operating revenue per available seat mile (ASM) increased 8.4 percent, while its operating cost per ASM excluding fuel, restructuring and impairment charges increased 1.4 percent. Alaska's pretax income for the quarter was $22.1 million, compared to a pretax loss of $2.8 million in the same period of 2004. Excluding the notable items referenced above, Alaska's pretax income was $34.2 million for the quarter compared to $14.4 million in the second quarter of 2004.
     Horizon Air's passenger traffic in the second quarter increased 15.9 percent on a 7.2 percent capacity increase. Horizon's load factor increased by 5.5 percentage points to 73.0 percent compared to the same
 
EXHIBIT 99.1
period in 2004. Horizon's operating revenue per ASM increased 5.2 percent, while its operating cost per ASM excluding fuel and impairment charges decreased 4.9 percent. Horizon's pretax income for the quarter was $11.1 million, compared to $4.7 million in the second quarter of 2004. Excluding the notable items referenced above, Horizon's pretax income was $10.7 million for the quarter compared to $2.4 million in the same period in 2004.
     Alaska Air Group had cash and short-term investments at June 30, 2005 of approximately $726 million, compared to $874 million at December 31, 2004.
     A summary of financial and statistical data for Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air as well as a reconciliation of the reported non-GAAP financial measures can be found on pages 6 through 10.
     A conference call regarding the first quarter 2005 results will be simulcast via the internet at 8:30 a.m. Pacific Time on July 21, 2005. It may be accessed through the Company's website at .

Note A:
Pursuant to Item 10 of Regulation S-K, we are providing disclosure of the reconciliation of reported non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable financial measures reported on a GAAP basis. The non-GAAP financial measures provide management the ability to measure and monitor performance both with and without the cost of aircraft fuel (including the gains and losses associated with our fuel hedging program where appropriate), restructuring charges, and aircraft impairment charges. Because the cost and availability of aircraft fuel are subject to many economic and political factors beyond our control and we record changes in the fair value of our hedge portfolio in our income statement, it is our view that the measurement and monitoring of performance without fuel is important. In addition, we believe the disclosure of financial performance without impairment and restructuring charges is useful to investors. Finally, these non-GAAP financial measures are also more comparable to financial measures are also more comparable to financial measures reported to the Department of Transportation by other major network airlines.
The following tables reconcile our non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for both Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Horizon Air Industries, Inc.:

Forecasted Financial Measures
During our quarterly earnings conference call, we expect to discuss forward-looking forecasted unit cost information for 2005. This forecasted unit cost information includes non-GAAP unit cost estimates which are summarized in the following table together with the most directly comparable GAAP unit cost for both Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Horizon Air Industries, Inc.:
: Our forecast of fuel costs is based on anticipated gallons consumed and estimated fuel cost per gallon for both Alaska and Horizon. The estimate also excludes the benefit from settled hedges recorded in other non-operating income as it does not impact our operating cost per available seat mile as presented on a GAAP basis. Given the volatility of fuel prices, readers should be cautioned that actual fuel expense will likely differ from the forecast above.

ITEM 2.02. Results of Operations And Financial Condition
In its press release and Form 8-K dated July 21, 2005, Alaska Air Group, Inc. (Air Group) reported net income of $17.4 million, or $.56 per share, in the second quarter of 2005, compared to a net loss of $1.7 million, or $0.06 per share, in the second quarter of 2004. Both periods included several large items that impacted their comparability. Excluding those items, Air Group's adjusted earnings would have been $24.7 million, or $.78 per share, compared to $8.2 million, or $.31 per share in 2004. Although the adjusted net income of $24.7 million was accurate, the July 21 disclosure incorrectly reported that the second quarter 2005 adjusted earnings per share would have been $.74 per share.
The revision impacts the table that reconciles Net Income (Loss) and Diluted EPS (excluding restructuring and impairment changes, and mark-to-market hedging gains) to Net Income (Loss) and Diluted EPS (in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) on page 10 of the press release.
The original table and the corrected table follow:

FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION
This report may contain forward-looking statements that are intended to be subject to the safe harbor protection provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements relate to future events or our future financial performance and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results or performance to be materially different from those indicated by any forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as forecast,may,will,could,should,expect,plan,believe,potential or other similar words indicating future events or contingencies. Some of the things that could cause our actual results to differ from our expectations are: changes in our operating costs including fuel, which can be volatile; the competitive environment and other trends in our industry; our ability to meet our cost reduction goals; labor disputes; economic conditions; our reliance on automated systems; increases in government fees and taxes; actual or threatened terrorist attacks; global instability and potential U.S. military actions or activities; insurance costs; changes in laws and regulations; liability and other claims asserted against us; operational disruptions; compliance with financial covenants; our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; third-party vendors and partners; continuing operating losses; our significant indebtedness; downgrades of our credit ratings and the availability of financing. For a discussion of these and other risk factors, see Item 7 of the Companys Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2004 on Form 10-K. All of the forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the risk factors discussed therein. These risk factors may not be exhaustive. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risk factors emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict such new risk factors, nor can it assess the impact, if any, of such new risk factors on our business or events described in any forward-looking statements. We disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date of this report to conform them to actual results.
ITEM 7.01.
 
Regulation FD Disclosure
 
Pursuant to 17 CFR Part 243 (Regulation FD), the Company is submitting information relating to its financial and operational outlook for 2005. This report includes information regarding forecasts of available seat miles (ASMs), cost per available seat mile (CASM) excluding fuel consumption and restructuring charges, as well as certain actual results for revenue passenger miles (RPMs), load factor and revenue per available seat mile (RASM), for its subsidiaries Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Horizon Air. Our disclosure of operating cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel and restructuring charges provides us the ability to measure and monitor our performance without these items. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is total operating expense per available seat mile. However, due to the large fluctuations in fuel prices, we are unable to predict total operating expense for any future period with any degree of certainty. In addition, we believe the disclosure of financial performance without mark-to-market hedging gains is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. Please see the cautionary statement under Forward-Looking Information.
In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the following information shall not be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), nor shall such information be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing. This Report will not be deemed an admission as to the materiality of any information required to be disclosed solely to satisfy the requirements of Regulation FD.

References in this report on Form 8-K to Air Group,the Company,we,us, and our refer to Alaska Air Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise specified. Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Horizon Air Industries, Inc. are referred to as Alaska and Horizon, respectively, and together as our airlines.
 
Third Quarter 2005
During the second quarter of 2005, Alaska announced a reduction in its 2005 summer flight schedule in order to improve operational reliability, reduce cancellations, and increase on-time performance by eliminating eight round trip flights per day. The reductions represented approximately 3.5% of original planned capacity in the third quarter. This schedule reduction is included in the forecasts below for ASMs and corresponding costs per ASM.
 
Alaska Airlines' July traffic decreased 2.1% to 1.633 billion RPMs from 1.668 billion flown a year earlier. Capacity during July was 1.986 billion ASMs, 5.5% lower than the 2.102 billion in July 2004. The passenger load factor (the percentage of available seats occupied by fare-paying passengers) for the month was 82.2%, compared to 79.4% in July 2004. The airline carried 1,633,500 passengers compared to 1,652,500 in July 2004.
In July 2005, RASM increased 11.3% compared to July 2004 due to higher load factors (caused in part by a decrease in capacity) and an increase in yields per RPM.
*For Alaska, our forecasts of cost per ASM and fuel cost per ASM are based on forward-looking estimates which will likely differ from actual results due to the volatility of fuel prices. There are several factors impacting our estimates including, but not limited to, the volatility of fuel prices and the finalization of labor agreements. As we are unable to apply hedge accounting, the majority of the benefit we realize from settled fuel hedge contracts is classified in other non-operating income on our statement of operations and is thus not reflected in fuel cost per ASM above. See page 6 for additional information regarding fuel costs.
 
3
 
Horizon Air's July traffic increased 11.3% to 237.7 million RPMs from 213.5 million flown a year earlier. Capacity for July was 309.8 million ASMs, 8.7% higher than the 284.9 million in July 2004. The passenger load factor for the month was 76.7%, compared to 74.9% in July 2004. The airline carried 610,200 passengers compared to 565,800 in July 2004.
 
 
In July 2005, RASM increased 1.6% compared to July 2004, due to increased load factors.
*
For Horizon, our forecasts of cost per ASM and fuel cost per ASM are based on forward-looking estimates, which will likely differ significantly from actual results. There are several factors impacting our estimates including, but not limited to, the volatility of fuel prices. As we are unable to apply hedge accounting, the majority of the benefit we realize from settled fuel hedge contracts is classified in other non-operating income on our statement of operations and is thus not reflected in fuel cost per ASM above. See page 6 for additional information regarding fuel costs.
 
Other Financial Information
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash and short-term investments totaled approximately $699 million at July 31, 2005 compared to $726 million at June 30, 2005. The decrease is primarily due to the delivery payment for a B737-800 aircraft that was delivered on July 1, 2005.

Operating Fleet Plan
The following table provides a fleet summary for Alaska and Horizon for actual airplanes on hand as of the date of this report. There are no expected changes during the remainder of 2005:

Fuel Hedging
We are providing unaudited information about fuel price movements and the impact of our hedging program on our financial results. Management believes it is useful to compare results between periods that exclude the mark-to-market hedging gains/losses associated with contracts that settle recorded on a GAAP basis and include the cash received or due on hedge positions settled during the period (although the related impact may have been recognized for financial reporting purposes in a prior period). We refer to this as the comparison of economic fuel cost, which is presented below for July 2005.

Executive shall be deemed to be related to or connected with a Competitor if such Competitor is (x) a partnership in which he is a general or limited partner or employee, (y) a corporation or association of which he is a shareholder, officer, employee or director, or (z) a partnership, corporation or association of which he is a member, consultant or agent; provided, however, that nothing herein shall prevent the purchase or ownership by Executive of shares which constitute less than five percent of the outstanding equity securities of a publicly or privately held corporation, so long as Executive has no other relationship with such corporation."
 
10. . Executive acknowledges and re-affirms his obligations under Section 7.3 of the Employment Agreement, which, as quoted below, survive the execution of this Agreement:
Non-Solicitation

End of Employment Relationship
 
16. . Executive agrees that he shall be exclusively liable for the payment of all federal and state taxes which may be due as the result of the consideration received herein and hereby represents that he shall make payments on such taxes at the time and in the amount required of him.

17. . This instrument constitutes and contains the entire agreement and final understanding concerning Executive's employment, voluntary retirement from the same and the other subject matters addressed herein between the parties. It is intended by the parties as a complete and exclusive statement of the terms of their agreement. It supersedes and replaces all prior negotiations and all agreements proposed or otherwise, whether written or oral, concerning the subject matters hereof, including without limitation the Employment Agreement and each and every provision therefore (including providing for severance, retirement, or other benefits not described in this Agreement. Any representation, promise or agreement not specifically included in this Agreement shall not be binding upon or enforceable against either party. This is a fully integrated agreement.

This Agreement will become effective and enforceable seven (7) days following execution by Executive, unless it is revoked during the seven-day period.
Revocation
 
19. . If any provision of this Agreement or the application thereof is held invalid, such invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications of the Agreement which can be given effect without the invalid provisions or applications and to this end the provisions of this Agreement are declared to be severable.

By entering into this agreement to arbitrate, the parties voluntarily waive any right to have covered disputes decided by a court of law and/or jury.In the event of such arbitration, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by such party in connection therewith, including attorneys' fees. The nonprevailing party shall also be solely responsible for all costs of the arbitration, including, but not limited to, the arbitrator's fees, court reporter fees, and any and all other administrative costs of the arbitration, and promptly shall reimburse the prevailing party for any portion of such costs previously paid by the prevailing party.

If notice is mailed, such notice shall be effective upon mailing, or if notice is personally delivered or sent by telecopy or other electronic facsimile transmission, it shall be effective upon receipt.
 
24. . No waiver of any breach of any term or provision of this Agreement shall be construed to be, or shall be, a waiver of any other breach of this Agreement. No waiver shall be binding unless in writing and signed by the party waiving the breach.

Dear Bill:
 
This is to advise you that, effective January 1, 2006, I hereby voluntarily retire from my position as Executive Vice President/Operations and any other capacity with Alaska Airlines, Inc.
 
 
 
 
THIS CONSULTING AGREEMENT for independent contractor consulting services ("Consulting Agreement") is made and entered into as of September 9, 2005, by and between Alaska Airlines, Inc. (the "Company"), a corporation, and George D. Bagley (the "Contractor"), an individual.
 
IT IS AGREED:
 
1. . In accordance with the mutual intentions of the Company and the Contractor, this Consulting Agreement establishes between them an independent contractor relationship, and all of the terms and conditions of this Consulting Agreement shall be interpreted in light of that relationship. There is no intention to create by this Consulting Agreement an employer-employee relationship or for Contractor to participate in any benefits offered to active employees of the Company.
Independent Contractor Relationship

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
SEATTLE Alaska Air Group announced today that George Bagley, executive vice president of operations for Alaska Airlines, will retire at the end of 2005, after more than 16 years in operating roles at both Alaska and Horizon Air and six years as Horizon's president and chief executive officer.
 
"Since joining us in 1983, George has been instrumental in putting both Horizon and Alaska on solid operational footing and reinforcing the high standards of safety and customer service that we are known for," said Bill Ayer, chairman and chief executive officer of Alaska Air Group. "His operating experience and track record are admired across the industry, and his focus on important operational issues has laid the groundwork for us to prosper in the years ahead as we pursue opportunities for growth."
 
Bagley joined Horizon after serving as president of Transwestern Airlines, a Logan, Utah-based regional carrier acquired by Horizon in 1983. He later became vice president of flight operations at Horizon and then Alaska, returning to Horizon as president and CEO in 1995. Bagley assumed leadership of Alaska's flight operations, maintenance and ground operations in 2002.
 
"George has played a critical role at Alaska in recent years, and over the coming months, we will be looking at alternatives for filling his position," Ayer said. He noted a number of factors contributing to Bagley's decision to retire, including the approach of his 60
th
birthday, which Bagley will celebrate Friday, and his desire to spend more time with his family and pursue his interests in boating and golf.
 
Alaska and its sister carrier, Horizon Air, together serve more than 80 cities in Alaska, the Lower 48, Canada and Mexico. For reservations visit alaskaair.com. For more news and information, visit the Alaska Airlines/Horizon Air Newsroom on the Internet at http://newsroom.alaskaair.com.

FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION
 
This report may contain forward-looking statements that are intended to be subject to the safe harbor protection provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements relate to future events or our future financial performance and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results or performance to be materially different from those indicated by any forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as "forecast," "may," "will," "could," "should," "expect," "plan," "believe," "potential" or other similar words indicating future events or contingencies. Some of the things that could cause our actual results to differ from our expectations are: changes in our operating costs including fuel, which can be volatile; the competitive environment and other trends in our industry; our ability to meet our cost reduction goals; labor disputes; economic conditions; our reliance on automated systems; increases in government fees and taxes; actual or threatened terrorist attacks; global instability and potential U.S. military actions or activities; insurance costs; changes in laws and regulations; liability and other claims asserted against us; operational disruptions; compliance with financial covenants; our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; third-party vendors and partners; continuing operating losses; our significant indebtedness; downgrades of our credit ratings and the availability of financing. For a discussion of these and other risk factors, see Item 7 of the Company's Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2004 on Form 10-K. All of the forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the risk factors discussed therein. These risk factors may not be exhaustive. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risk factors emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict such new risk factors, nor can it assess the impact, if any, of such new risk factors on our business or events described in any forward-looking statements. We disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date of this report to conform them to actual results.
 
 
Pursuant to 17 CFR Part 243 ("Regulation FD"), the Company is submitting information relating to its financial and operational outlook for 2005. This report includes information regarding forecasts of available seat miles (ASMs), cost per available seat mile (CASM) excluding fuel consumption and restructuring charges, as well as certain actual results for revenue passenger miles (RPMs), load factor and revenue per available seat mile (RASM), for its subsidiaries Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Horizon Air. Our disclosure of operating cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel and restructuring charges provides us the ability to measure and monitor our performance without these items. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is total operating expense per available seat mile. However, due to the large fluctuations in fuel prices, we are unable to predict total operating expense for any future period with any degree of certainty. In addition, we believe the disclosure of financial performance without mark-to-market hedging gains is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. Please see the cautionary statement under "Forward-Looking Information."
 
In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the following information shall not be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), nor shall such information be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing. This Report will not be deemed an admission as to the materiality of any information required to be disclosed solely to satisfy the requirements of Regulation FD.
 
References in this report on Form 8-K to "Air Group," "the Company," "we," "us," and "our" refer to Alaska Air Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise specified. Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Horizon Air Industries, Inc. are referred to as "Alaska" and "Horizon," respectively, and together as our "airlines."
 
Third Quarter 2005
 
During the second quarter of 2005, Alaska announced a reduction in its 2005 summer flight schedule in order to improve operational reliability, reduce cancellations, and increase on-time performance by eliminating eight round trip flights per day. The reductions represented approximately 3.5% of original planned capacity in the third quarter. This schedule reduction is included in the forecasts below for ASMs and corresponding costs per ASM.
 
During the month of August, Alaska recorded a refund of $6.1 million from the Mexican government related to the recovery of navigation fees paid in 2004. Approximately $5.1 million of the refund was recorded as a reduction to operating expenses and is included in our CASM guidance for the third quarter. The remaining $1.0 million was recorded as interest income in non-operating income.
 
 
Alaska Airlines' August traffic decreased 0.9% to 1.640 billion RPMs from 1.655 billion flown a year earlier. Capacity during August was 2.005 billion ASMs, 4.1% lower than the 2.091 billion in August 2004. The passenger load factor (the percentage of available seats occupied by fare-paying passengers) for the month was 81.8%, compared to 79.1% in August 2004. The airline carried 1,655,300 passengers compared to 1,655,900 in August 2004.
 
In August 2005, RASM increased 11.9% compared to August 2004 due to higher load factors (caused in part by a decrease in capacity) and an increase in yields per RPM. July 2005 RASM increased 11.3% compared to July 2004 for the same reasons noted above.
 
 
 
Horizon Air's August traffic increased 11.9% to 236.3 million RPMs from 211.1 million flown a year earlier. Capacity for August was 310.0 million ASMs, 9.1% higher than the 284.2 million in August 2004. The passenger load factor for the month was 76.2%, compared to 74.3% in August 2004. The airline carried 608,500 passengers compared to 576,200 in August 2004.
 
In August 2005, RASM increased 1.2% compared to August 2004, due to increased load factors. July 2005 RASM increased 1.6% compared to July 2004.
 
 
Other Financial Information
 
Liquidity and Capital Resources

Fuel Hedging
 
We are providing unaudited information about fuel price movements and the impact of our hedging program on our financial results. We believe it is useful to compare results between periods that exclude the mark-to-market hedging gains/losses associated with contracts that settle recorded on a GAAP basis and include the cash received or due on hedge positions settled during the period (although the related impact may have been recognized for financial reporting purposes in a prior period). We refer to this as the comparison of "economic fuel cost", which is presented below for July and August 2005.

Fuel Hedging
 
We are providing unaudited information about fuel price movements and the impact of our hedging program on our financial results. Management believes it is useful to compare results between periods that exclude the mark-to-market hedging gains/losses associated with contracts that settle recorded on a GAAP basis and include the cash received or due on hedge positions settled during the period (although the related impact may have been recognized for financial reporting purposes in a prior period). We refer to this as the comparison of "economic fuel cost", which is presented below for July and August 2005.
 
Calculation of Economic Fuel Cost Per Gallon
 
 
 
For Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air, GAAP fuel expense per gallon for the quarter is expected to be approximately $1.95 and $2.01, respectively. The economic fuel expense per gallon for the quarter is expected to be approximately $1.56 and $1.63 for Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air, respectively. September mark-to-market losses included in non-operating income related to hedges that settle in future periods, net of the reclassification of previously recorded mark-to-market gains to are expected to be approximately $29 million for the combined Air Group, bringing the total gain for the quarter to approximately $23 million.
Gains on settled hedges included in non-operating income,
 
Our forecast of GAAP and economic fuel expense per gallon for the third quarter is based on forward-looking estimates, which will likely differ from actual results. There are several factors impacting our estimates including, but not limited to, the volatility of fuel prices and consumption.
 
Alaska Air Group's future hedge positions are as follows:

Aircraft Purchase Agreement
 
On October 18, 2005, Horizon Air Industries, Inc. ("Horizon") entered into a Supplement to Master Purchase Agreement (the "Agreement") with Bombardier Inc. ("Bombardier") to purchase 12 Bombardier DHC-8Q Series 400 model aircraft ("Q400 Aircraft") with deliveries beginning in December 2006 and continuing through July 2007. The base list price for each Q400 Aircraft, including selected optional equipment, is approximately $26 million and is subject to an escalation formula. The Agreement also provides that Bombardier will provide certain remarketing assistance for up to twelve DHC-8 Series 200 aircraft previously leased by Horizon. In association with the purchase of the 12 Q400 Aircraft, Horizon and Bombardier have agreed to terminate firm orders for seven CRJ700 model aircraft.
 
The Agreement also provides for an option to purchase up to an additional 20 Q400 Aircraft if Horizon provides Bombardier written notice of its intention to acquire an additional Q400 Aircraft at least 15 months prior to a respective scheduled delivery date, which scheduled delivery dates begin in November 2006 and end on May 2010.
 
The Agreement also contains warranty and performance guarantee provisions and is subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Master Purchase Agreement by and between Horizon and Bombardier on December 21, 1998.
 
Purchase Deposit Facility
 
On October 19, 2005, Alaska Airlines, Inc. finalized a $172 million variable rate revolving loan facility to provide a portion of the pre-delivery funding requirements of the Company's purchase of up to 38 new Boeing 737-800 aircraft (23 of which are firm orders) under the current aircraft purchase agreement . The facility will expire on August 31, 2009 and the interest rate is based on the one-month LIBOR plus a specified margin.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
SEATTLE  Alaska Air Group, Inc. (NYSE:ALK) today reported third quarter net income of $90.2 million, or $2.71 per diluted share, compared to $74.0 million, or $2.29 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2004.
 
Both the 2005 and 2004 results include certain significant items related to mark-to-market fuel hedge accounting adjustments, refunds of navigation fees, and restructuring activities that impact the comparability of the quarters. Excluding the impact of these items, net income would have been $71.5 million, or $2.16 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2005, compared to net income of $50.7 million, or $1.58 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2004.
 
"These numbers show that our hard work is paying off," said Bill Ayer, chairman and chief executive officer. "Our continued progress on the earnings front, combined with an improving operation, give us confidence that we are on the right track."
 
Alaska Airlines' passenger traffic in the third quarter increased 0.6 percent on a capacity decrease of 3.2 percent. Alaska's load factor increased 3.0 percentage points to 79.0 percent compared to the same period in 2004. Alaska's operating revenue per available seat mile (ASM) increased 12.4 percent and its operating cost per ASM excluding fuel, navigation fee refund, and restructuring charges increased 2.4 percent. Alaska's pretax income for the quarter was $133.0 million, compared to $97.9 million in the same period of 2004. Excluding the notable items referenced above, Alaska's pretax income was $106.0 million for the quarter compared to $64.1 million in the third quarter of 2004.
 
Horizon Air's passenger traffic in the third quarter increased 13.6 percent on a 9.8 percent capacity increase. Horizon's load factor increased by 2.6 percentage points to 75.0 percent compared to the same period in 2004. Horizon's operating revenue per ASM increased 0.5 percent and its operating cost per ASM excluding fuel increased 1.3 percent. Horizon's pretax income for the quarter was $17.3 million, compared to $24.4 million in the third quarter of 2004. Excluding the notable items referenced above, Horizon's pretax income was $14.4 million for the quarter compared to $17.5 million in the same period in 2004.
 
Alaska Air Group had cash and short-term investments at September 30, 2005 of approximately $746 million, compared to $874 million at December 31, 2004.
 
A summary of financial and statistical data for Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air as well as a reconciliation of the reported non-GAAP financial measures can be found on pages 5 through 9.
 
A conference call regarding the third quarter 2005 results will be simulcast via the internet at 9:30 a.m. Pacific Time on October 20, 2005. It may be accessed through the Company's website at .

Some of the things that could cause our actual results to differ from our expectations are: changes in our operating costs including fuel, which can be volatile; the competitive environment and other trends in our industry; our ability to meet our cost reduction goals; labor disputes; economic conditions; our reliance on automated systems; increases in government fees and taxes; actual or threatened terrorist attacks; global instability and potential U.S. military actions or activities; insurance costs; changes in laws and regulations; liability and other claims asserted against us; operational disruptions; compliance with financial covenants; our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; third-party vendors and partners; our significant indebtedness; downgrades of our credit ratings and the availability of financing. For a discussion of these and other risk factors, see Item 7 of the Company's Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2004 on Form 10-K.

Note A:
 
Pursuant to Item 10 of Regulation S-K, we are providing disclosure of the reconciliation of reported non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable financial measures reported on a GAAP basis. The non-GAAP financial measures provide management the ability to measure and monitor performance both with and without the cost of aircraft fuel (including the gains and losses associated with our fuel hedging program where appropriate), the navigation fee recovery, restructuring charges or adjustments thereto, and aircraft impairment charges. Because the cost and availability of aircraft fuel are subject to many economic and political factors beyond our control and we record changes in the fair value of our hedge portfolio in our income statement, it is our view that the measurement and monitoring of performance without fuel is important. In addition, we believe the disclosure of financial performance without impairment and restructuring charges is useful to investors. Finally, these non-GAAP financial measures are also more comparable to financial measures reported to the Department of Transportation by other major network airlines.
 
The following tables reconcile our non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for both Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Horizon Air Industries, Inc.:

This forecasted unit cost information includes non-GAAP unit cost estimates which are summarized in the following table together with the most directly comparable GAAP unit cost for both Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Horizon Air Industries, Inc.:
 
 
: Our forecast of fuel costs is based on anticipated gallons consumed and estimated fuel cost per gallon for both Alaska and Horizon. The estimate also excludes the benefit from settled hedges recorded in other non-operating income as it does not impact our operating cost per available seat mile as presented on a GAAP basis. Given the volatility of fuel prices, readers should be cautioned that actual fuel expense will likely differ from the forecast above.

FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION
 
This report may contain forward-looking statements that are intended to be subject to the safe harbor protection provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements relate to future events or our future financial performance and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results or performance to be materially different from those indicated by any forward-looking statements.

ITEM 7.01.
Regulation FD Disclosure
 
Pursuant to 17 CFR Part 243 ("Regulation FD"), the Company is submitting information relating to its financial and operational outlook for 2005. This report includes information regarding forecasts of available seat miles (ASMs), cost per available seat mile (CASM) excluding fuel consumption and restructuring charges, as well as certain actual results for revenue passenger miles (RPMs), load factor and revenue per available seat mile (RASM), for its subsidiaries Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Horizon Air. Our disclosure of operating cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel, and restructuring charges provides us the ability to measure and monitor our performance without these items. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is total operating expense per available seat mile. However, due to the large fluctuations in fuel prices, we are unable to predict total operating expense for any future period with any degree of certainty. In addition, we believe the disclosure of financial performance without mark-to-market hedging gains is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. Please see the cautionary statement under "Forward-Looking Information."
 
In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the following information shall not be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), nor shall such information be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing. This Report will not be deemed an admission as to the materiality of any information required to be disclosed solely to satisfy the requirements of Regulation FD.
 
References in this report on Form 8-K to "Air Group," "the Company," "we," "us," and "our" refer to Alaska Air Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise specified. Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Horizon Air Industries, Inc. are referred to as "Alaska" and "Horizon," respectively, and together as our "airlines."
 
Fourth Quarter 2005
 
In October, Alaska's mechanics ratified a new contract that resulted in a wage increase and a signing bonus. We expect that the agreement will result in an average increase of approximately $6.3 million per year over the four year term. The increased wages, plus a $0.7 million signing bonus, will increase our wages and benefits by roughly $2.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2005.
 
 
Our estimate of unit cost per ASM excluding fuel is 7.75 cents in the fourth quarter. In our Form 10-Q for the second quarter of 2005, we estimated that our fourth quarter unit cost excluding fuel was going to be 7.4 cents per ASM. The increase from 7.4 cents per ASM to 7.75 cents per ASM can be attributed to the following:
 
Alaska Airlines' September traffic increased 6.2% to 1.325 billion RPMs from 1.248 billion flown a year earlier. Capacity during September was 1.831 billion ASMs, 0.7% higher than the 1.819 billion in September 2004. The passenger load factor (the percentage of available seats occupied by fare-paying passengers) for the month was 72.4%, compared to 68.6% in September 2004. The airline carried 1,343,400 passengers compared to 1,280,600 in September 2004.
 
In September 2005, RASM increased over 14% compared to September 2004 due to higher load factors and an increase in yields per RPM. August and July 2005 RASM increased by 11.9% and 11.3%, respectively compared to the prior periods for the same reasons noted above.
 
*For Alaska, our forecasts of cost per ASM and fuel cost per ASM are based on forward-looking estimates which will likely differ from actual results due to the volatility of fuel prices. There are several factors impacting our estimates including, but not limited to, the volatility of fuel prices and the finalization of labor agreements. As we are unable to apply "hedge accounting", the majority of the benefit we realize from settled fuel hedge contracts is classified in other non-operating income
 
on our statement of operations and is thus not reflected in fuel cost per ASM above. See page 5 for additional information regarding fuel costs.
 
 
Horizon Air's September traffic increased 18.5% to 209.0 million RPMs from 176.4 million flown a year earlier. Capacity for September was 290.6 million ASMs, 11.3% higher than the 261.0 million in September 2004. The passenger load factor for the month was 71.9%, compared to 67.6% in September 2004. The airline carried 536,000 passengers compared to 499,100 in September 2004.
 
In September 2005, RASM increased 1.8% compared to September 2004, due to increased ASMs, partially offset by a decline in yields per RPM. August and July 2005 RASM increased 1.2% and 1.6%, respectively compared to prior periods.
 
*For Horizon, our forecasts of cost per ASM and fuel cost per ASM are based on forward-looking estimates, which will likely differ significantly from actual results. There are several factors impacting our estimates including, but not limited to, the volatility of fuel prices. As we are unable to apply hedge accounting, the majority of the benefit we realize from settled fuel hedge contracts is classified in other non-operating income on our statement of operations and is thus not reflected in fuel cost per ASM above. See page 5 for additional information regarding fuel costs.
 
Other Financial Information
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash and short-term investments totaled approximately $746 million at September 30, 2005 compared to $741 million at August 31, 2005.
 
Fuel Hedging
We are providing unaudited information about fuel price movements and the impact of our hedging program on our financial results. Management believes it is useful to compare results between periods that exclude the mark-to-market hedging gains/losses recorded on a GAAP basis and include the cash received or due on hedge positions settled during the period (although the related impact may have been recognized for financial reporting purposes in a
 
prior period). We refer to this as the comparison of "economic fuel cost", which is presented below for the third quarter of 2005.
 
Calculation of Economic Fuel Cost Per Gallon
*Amounts may include mark-to-market hedging gains (losses) recognized in non-operating income (expense) in previous periods.

Operating Fleet Plan
The following table provides a fleet summary for Alaska and Horizon for actual airplanes on hand as of the date of this report. There are no expected changes during the remainder of 2005:
 
 
On October 20, 2005, Horizon announced an agreement to purchase 12 Bombardier Q400 model aircraft with deliveries beginning in December 2006 and continuing through 2007. This agreement represents a conversion of 7 previously ordered CRJ 700 aircraft to Q400s plus 5 additional aircraft.

The Company expects to use the net proceeds from the sale of the common stock for general corporate purposes, including working capital, the acquisition of aircraft and other capital expenditures. Accordingly, management will have broad discretion as to the application of the offering proceeds. Pending their ultimate use, the Company expects to invest the net proceeds in interest bearing, investment grade securities.
 
Some of the underwriters and their affiliates have engaged in, and may in the future engage in, investment banking, commercial bank lending and other commercial dealings in the ordinary course of business with the Company.

Indemnification of Underwriters
Affiliate
 
(i) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), including the Rule 430B Information, or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any preliminary prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, provided that this clause (i) shall not require the Company to indemnify or hold harmless for amounts paid to the Underwriters pursuant to clause (ii) below;
 
(ii) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or
 
threatened, or of any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission; provided that (subject to Section 6(d) below) any such settlement is effected with the written consent of the Company; and
 
(iii) against any and all expense whatsoever, as incurred (including the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by Citigroup), in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, to the extent that any such expense is not paid under (i) or (ii) above;
 
, , that this indemnity agreement shall not apply to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense to the extent arising out of any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of the Underwriters expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), any preliminary prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto).
provided
however
 
(b) . Each Underwriter severally agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained in subsection (a) of this Section, as incurred, but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), any preliminary prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter expressly for use therein.
Indemnification of Company
 
(c) . Each indemnified party shall give written notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability hereunder to the extent it is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. In the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(a) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Underwriters, and, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(b) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Company.

In no event shall an indemnifying party be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action, or separate but similar or related actions, in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances.No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to
Actions against Parties; Notification
 
the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 6 or Section 7 hereof (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
 
(d) . If at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, such indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 6(a)(ii) effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 30 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed such indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement.
Settlement without Consent if Failure to Reimburse
 
SECTION 7. . If the indemnification to which an indemnified party is entitled under Section 6 hereof is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient although applicable in accordance with its terms to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above, but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
Contribution
 
The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discount received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the cover of the Prospectus bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of the Securities as set forth on the cover of the Prospectus.
 
The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact, or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact, relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
 
The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 7. The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 7 shall be deemed to include any out-of-pocket legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
 
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
 
No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

SECTION 8. . All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement or in certificates of officers of the Company submitted pursuant hereto shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of (i) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or its Affiliates or selling agents, any person controlling any Underwriter, its officers or directors or any person controlling the Company, and (ii) delivery of and payment for the Securities.

FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION
 
This report contains forward-looking statements subject to the safe harbor protection provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements relate to future events and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual outcomes to be materially different from that indicated by any forward-looking statements. Some of the things that could cause our actual results to differ from our expectations are: the competitive environment and other trends in our industry; changes in our operating costs including fuel, which can be volatile; our ability to meet our cost reduction goals; our inability to achieve or maintain profitability and fluctuations in our quarterly results; our significant indebtedness; our inability to secure new aircraft financing; the implementation of our growth strategy; possible accelerated retirement of our MD-80 fleet; compliance with our financial covenants; potential downgrades of our credit ratings and the availability of financing; the concentration of our revenue from a few key markets; general economic conditions, as well as economic conditions in the geographic regions we serve; actual or threatened terrorist attacks; global instability and potential U.S. military actions or activities; insurance costs; labor disputes; our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; an aircraft accident or incident; liability and other claims asserted against us; operational disruptions; increases in government fees and taxes; changes in laws and regulations; our reliance on automated systems; and our reliance on third-party vendors and partners. For a discussion of these and other risk factors, see Item 7 of the Company's Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2004 on Form 10-K. All of the forward- looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the risk factors discussed therein. These risk factors may not be exhaustive. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risk factors emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict such new risk factors, nor can it assess the impact, if any, of such new risk factors on our business or events described in any forward-looking statements. We disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date of this press release to conform them to actual results.
 
 
Pursuant to 17 CFR Part 243 ("Regulation FD"), the Company is submitting information relating to its financial and operational outlook for 2005. This report includes information regarding forecasts of available seat miles (ASMs), cost per available seat mile (CASM) excluding fuel consumption and restructuring charges, as well as certain actual results for revenue passenger miles (RPMs), load factor and revenue per available seat mile (RASM), for its subsidiaries Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Horizon Air. Our disclosure of operating cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel, and restructuring charges provides us the ability to measure and monitor our performance without these items. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is total operating expense per available seat mile. However, due to the large fluctuations in fuel prices, we are unable to predict total operating expense for any future period with any degree of certainty. In addition, we believe the disclosure of financial performance without mark-to-market hedging gains is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. Please see the cautionary statement under "Forward-Looking Information."
 
In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the following information shall not be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), nor shall such information be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing. This Report will not be deemed an admission as to the materiality of any information required to be disclosed solely to satisfy the requirements of Regulation FD.
 
References in this report on Form 8-K to "Air Group," "the Company," "we," "us," and "our" refer to Alaska Air Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise specified. Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Horizon Air Industries, Inc. are referred to as "Alaska" and "Horizon," respectively, and together as our "airlines."
 
Fourth Quarter 2005
 
 
Alaska Airlines' November traffic increased 4.1% to 1.366 billion RPMs from 1.312 billion flown a year earlier. Capacity during November was 1.816 billion ASMs, 1.4% higher than the 1.791 billion in November 2004. The passenger load factor (the percentage of available seats occupied by fare-paying passengers) for the month was 75.2%, compared to 73.3% in November 2004. The airline carried 1,345,000 passengers compared to 1,320,200 in November 2004.
 
In November 2005, RASM increased 7.2% compared to November 2004 due to higher load factors and increase in yields per RPM. October RASM increased 8.4% compared to October 2004.
 
 
 
Horizon Air's November traffic increased 10.0% to 206.2 million RPMs from 187.5 million flown a year earlier. Capacity for November was 279.2 million ASMs, 9.1% higher than the 255.9 million in November 2004. The passenger load factor for the month was 73.9%, compared to
 
73.3% in November 2004. The airline carried 523,500 passengers compared to 510,000 in November 2004.
 
November 2005 RASM decreased 0.5% as compared to the prior year. October RASM increased 4.1% compared to October 2004.
 
 
Other Financial Information
 
Equity Offering
 
On December 12, 2005, the Company announced an offering to sell 5.7 million newly issued shares of common stock. The net proceeds from the offering were approximately $200 million. The company intends to use this for general corporate purposes, including working capital, acquisition of aircraft and other capital expenditures.
 
Liquidity and Capital Resources
 
Cash and short-term investments totaled approximately $792 million at November 30, 2005 compared to $770 million at October 31, 2005. However, as of date of this report, cash and short-term investments total approximately $1 billion as a result of the equity offering.
 
Fuel Hedging
 
We are providing unaudited information about fuel price movements and the impact of our hedging program on our financial results. Management believes it is useful to compare results between periods that exclude the mark-to-market hedging gains/losses recorded on a GAAP basis and include the cash received or due on hedge positions settled during the period (although the related impact may have been recognized for financial reporting purposes in a prior period). We refer to this as the comparison of "economic fuel cost", which is presented below for October and November 2005.

On January 12, 2006, Alaska Airlines, Inc. ("Alaska") announced that Kevin Finan has been appointed Executive Vice President of Operations for Alaska. The appointment was made on January 12, 2006 and is not for a fixed term.
 
Mr. Finan, who is 58 years old, was previously Vice President of Flight Operations for Alaska and served in that position since July 2000. Prior to that, Mr. Finan was a flight operations base manager and captain for Alaska and a former chief pilot for Jet America Airlines. Mr. Finan also served as a commanding officer of a U.S. Navy Reserve F-14 fighter squadron and while in the military flew 90 combat missions over Vietnam, earning four air medals and two Navy commendation medals. In 1998, Mr. Finan was named an Alaska Airlines "Legend," the highest honor an Alaska employee can receive. Mr. Finan graduated cum laude from Gettysburg College, holds a master's degree from the University of Southern California and has attended the Aviation Safety School at the U.S. Navy Postgraduate School in Monterey, California.
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
SEATTLEAlaska Airlines today announced the election of Kevin Finan as executive vice president of operations and Glenn Johnson as senior vice president of customer service for airports.
 
Both promotions are part of a succession plan following the Dec. 31 retirement of George Bagley as executive vice president of operations for the airline.
 
"These promotions recognize the talent and contributions of two outstanding individuals," said Alaska's CEO Bill Ayer. "Together they bring more than 50 years of aviation experience to their new roles of leading the day-to-day operations of Alaska Airlines."
 
Alaska also announced today that Dave Prewitt, Alaska's vice president of safety, will leave the airline next month to become vice president of safety for Connecticut-based Sikorsky Aircraft Corp.
 
"In six years with Alaska Airlines, Dave has led a safety division dedicated to upholding the highest standards in the industry," Ayer said. "Under his leadership, in 2004 Alaska became the first major airline in the nation to be named a Shield Carrier, the highest award given by the Medallion Foundation, an aviation safety organization backed by the Federal Aviation Administration. Later that same year, our safety division achieved the distinction of being one of only a handful in the nation to be ISO 9000 certified."
 
ISO 9000 certification is an internationally recognized mark of a quality safety management system.
 
Prewitt cited a desire to move closer to his family as a major factor in his decision to depart Alaska Airlines. "From day one, I've been impressed with the strong commitment of Alaska Airlines employees to the goal of being No. 1 in safety," Prewitt said. "Sikorsky has offered me an opportunity to work with a team equally committed to that goal, while also allowing me to meet the needs of my family."
 
Ayer has asked the Safety Committee of Alaska Air Group's board of directors to guide the search for a new vice president of safety.
 
"This is a critically important position for our company," Ayer said. "Having our board Safety Committee involved in the recruitment process will add essential expertise to the search for Dave's successor."
 
Alaska Air Group Director and Safety Committee Chairman Richard Wien said, "Safety continues to be the top priority of Alaska Airlines. The board's goal will be to maintain this focus by selecting another proven aviation industry leader to oversee this critical area."
 
Formerly vice president of flight operations, Finan, 58, will be responsible for the day-to-day operation of the airline. This includes ground operations, flight operations, maintenance and engineering, and real estate.
 
Finan, who reports directly to Ayer, has more than 30 years and 9,000 flight hours of aviation experience. A former flight operations base manager and captain for Alaska Airlines and a former chief pilot for Jet America Airlines, Finan also served as a commanding officer of a U.S. Navy Reserve F-14
fighter squadron. While in the military, he flew 90 combat missions over Vietnam, and was awarded four air medals and two Navy commendation medals.
 
A cum laude graduate of Gettysburg College, he also holds a master's degree from the University of Southern California. In addition, he has attended the Aviation Safety School at the U.S. Navy Postgraduate School in Monterey, Calif.
 
In 1998, Finan was named an Alaska Airlines "Legend," the highest honor an Alaska Airlines employee can receive. The program recognizes those who personify Alaska Airlines' core values of integrity, caring, spirit, resourcefulness and professionalism.
 
Johnson, 48, brings more than 23 years of airline experience to the position of senior vice president of customer service for airports at Alaska Airlines. He is a former senior vice president of customer service for Horizon Air, where he was responsible for station operations at 40 airports in the United States and Canada.
 
A graduate of the University of Washington, Johnson joined Alaska Airlines in 1982 as a staff auditor and was later promoted to director of revenue accounting. In 1991 Johnson left Alaska to become vice president and treasurer of Horizon Air. He returned to Alaska Airlines in 2003 as vice president of finance.
 
For the past six months, Johnson has led an operations improvement team focused on enhancing the airline's schedule reliability. Working with ground service and customer service employees, outside contractors, and others, he successfully improved the airline's on-time arrival percentage from about 50 percent in June 2005 to a high of 80 percent in October 2005. He also has led the airline's Ground Operations Division on an interim basis since October.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
SEATTLE  Alaska Air Group, Inc. (NYSE:ALK) today reported full year income of $84.5 million, or $2.65 per diluted share, before the cumulative effect of a maintenance accounting policy change, compared to a loss of $15.3 million, or $0.57 per share in 2004. Both 2005 and 2004 include certain significant items related to mark-to-market fuel hedge accounting, restructuring activities, refunds of navigation fees, and impairment charges that impact the comparability of the periods. Excluding the impact of these items, 2005 net income would have been $55.0 million, or $1.78 per diluted share, compared to $5.2 million, or $0.19 per share in 2004.
 
The Company reported a fourth quarter net loss of $33.0 million, or $1.15 per share, compared to a net loss of $44.9 million, or $1.66 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2004. Similar to the items noted for the full year, both the 2005 and 2004 quarterly results include mark-to-market fuel hedge accounting adjustments, restructuring activities and an impairment charge in 2004. Excluding the impact of these items, fourth quarter net income would have been $0.6 million, or $0.02 per diluted share in 2005, compared to a loss of $14.3 million, or $0.53 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2004.
 
"Sacrifices by our employees, strong revenue performance and the benefit of our fuel hedging program enabled us to be one of only a couple of major airlines that posted a significant adjusted profit for 2005," said Bill Ayer, chairman and chief executive officer. "Our people should be extremely proud of that. I want to thank our customers for sticking with us and our employees for their hard work. Our job now is to stay the course to secure Alaska Air Group's position as a leader in this tumultuous industry."
Alaska Airlines' passenger traffic in the fourth quarter increased 3.2 percent on a capacity increase of 1.9 percent. Alaska's load factor increased 1.0 percentage point to 73.9 percent compared to the same period in 2004. Alaska's operating revenue per available seat mile (ASM) increased 8.4 percent and its operating costs per ASM excluding fuel and restructuring charges increased 0.9 percent. Alaska's pretax loss for the quarter was $46.3 million, compared to a pretax loss of $68.9 million in 2004. Excluding the unusual items referenced above, Alaska's pretax income was $0.5 million for the quarter compared to a $22.7 million loss in the fourth quarter of 2004.
 
Horizon Air's passenger traffic in the fourth quarter increased 11.1 percent on an 8.2 percent capacity increase. Horizon's load factor increased by 2.0 percentage points to 73.7 percent compared to the same period in 2004. Horizon's operating revenue per ASM increased 1.1 percent and its operating costs per ASM excluding fuel and impairment charges increased 1.1 percent. Horizon's pretax loss for the quarter was $6.6 million, compared to a pretax loss of $1.6 million in 2004. Excluding the unusual items referenced above, Horizon's pretax income was $0.4 million for the quarter compared to $1.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2004.
 
Alaska Air Group had cash and short-term investments at December 31, 2005 of approximately $983 million compared to $874 million at December 31, 2004. The Company's debt-to-capital ratio, assuming aircraft operating leases are capitalized at seven times annualized rent, was 73 percent as of December 31, 2005, compared to 78 percent as of December 31, 2004. The Company's cash position and debt-to-capital ratio were positively impacted by Air Group's recent common stock offering which raised approximately $200 million in net proceeds.
 
A summary of financial and statistical data for Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air as well as a reconciliation of the reported non-GAAP financial measures can be found on pages 6 through 10.
 
A conference call regarding the fourth quarter and full year 2005 results will be simulcast via the internet at 8:00 a.m. Pacific Time on January 26, 2006. It may be accessed through the company's website at www.alaskaair.com.

This report contains forward-looking statements subject to the safe harbor protection provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements relate to future events and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual outcomes to be materially different from that indicated by any forward-looking statements. Some of the things that could cause our actual results to differ from our expectations are: the competitive environment and other trends in our industry; changes in our operating costs including fuel, which can be volatile; our ability to meet our cost reduction goals; our inability to achieve or maintain profitability and fluctuations in our quarterly results; our significant indebtedness; our inability to secure new aircraft financing; the implementation of our growth strategy; possible accelerated retirement of our MD-80 fleet; compliance with our financial covenants; potential downgrades of our credit ratings and the availability of financing; the concentration of our revenue from a few key markets; general economic conditions, as well as economic conditions in the geographic regions we serve; actual or threatened terrorist attacks; global instability and potential U.S. military actions or activities; insurance costs; labor disputes; our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; an aircraft accident or incident; liability and other claims asserted against us; operational disruptions; increases in government fees and taxes; changes in laws and regulations; our reliance on automated systems; and our reliance on third-party vendors and partners. For a discussion of these and other risk factors, see the Company's Form S-3 Registration Statement filed on December 12, 2005. All of the forward- looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the risk factors discussed therein. These risk factors may not be exhaustive. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risk factors emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict such new risk factors, nor can it assess the impact, if any, of such new risk factors on our business or events described in any forward-looking statements. We disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date of this press release to conform them to actual results.

Pursuant to Item 10 of Regulation S-K, we are providing disclosure of the reconciliation of reported non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable financial measures reported on a GAAP basis. The non-GAAP financial measures provide management the ability to measure and monitor performance both with and without the cost of aircraft fuel (including the gains and losses associated with our fuel hedging program where appropriate), the navigation fee refund, restructuring charges or adjustments thereto, and aircraft impairment charges. Because the cost and availability of aircraft fuel are subject to many economic and political factors beyond our control and we record changes in the fair value of our hedge portfolio in our income statement, it is our view that the measurement and monitoring of performance without fuel is important. In addition, we believe the disclosure of financial performance without impairment and restructuring charges is useful to investors. Finally, these non-GAAP financial measures are also more comparable to financial measures reported to the Department of Transportation by other major network airlines.

Forecasted Financial Measures
 
During our quarterly earnings conference call, we expect to discuss forward-looking forecasted unit cost information for 2006. This forecasted unit cost information includes non-GAAP unit cost estimates which are summarized in the following table together with the most directly comparable GAAP unit cost for both Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Horizon Air Industries, Inc.:
 
 
: Our forecast of fuel costs is based on anticipated gallons consumed and estimated fuel cost per gallon for both Alaska and Horizon. The estimate also excludes the benefit from settled hedges recorded in other non-operating income as it does not impact our operating cost per available seat mile as presented on a GAAP basis. Given the volatility of fuel prices, readers should be cautioned that actual fuel expense will likely differ from the forecast above.

FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION
 
This report contains forward-looking statements subject to the safe harbor protection provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements relate to future events and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual outcomes to be materially different from that indicated by any forward-looking statements. Some of the things that could cause our actual results to differ from our expectations are: the competitive environment and other trends in our industry; changes in our operating costs including fuel, which can be volatile; our ability to meet our cost reduction goals; our inability to achieve or maintain profitability and fluctuations in our quarterly results; our significant indebtedness; our inability to secure new aircraft financing; the implementation of our growth strategy; possible accelerated retirement of our MD-80 fleet; compliance with our financial covenants; potential downgrades of our credit ratings and the availability of financing; the concentration of our revenue from a few key markets; general economic conditions, as well as economic conditions in the geographic regions we serve; actual or threatened terrorist attacks; global instability and potential U.S. military actions or activities; insurance costs; labor disputes; our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; an aircraft accident or incident; liability and other claims asserted against us; operational disruptions; increases in government fees and taxes; changes in laws and regulations; our reliance on automated systems; and our reliance on third-party vendors and partners. For a discussion of these and other risk factors, see Item 1A of the Company's Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2005 on Form 10-K. All of the forward- looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the risk factors discussed therein. These risk factors may not be exhaustive. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risk factors emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict such new risk factors, nor can it assess the impact, if any, of such new risk factors on our business or events described in any forward-looking statements. We disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date of this press release to conform them to actual results.
 
 
Pursuant to 17 CFR Part 243 ("Regulation FD"), the Company is submitting information relating to its financial and operational outlook for 2005. This report includes information regarding forecasts of available seat miles (ASMs), cost per available seat mile (CASM) excluding fuel consumption, as well as certain actual results for revenue passenger miles (RPMs), load factor and revenue per available seat mile (RASM), for its subsidiaries Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Horizon Air. Our disclosure of operating cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel, provides us the ability to measure and monitor our performance without these items. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is total operating expense per available seat mile. However, due to the large fluctuations in fuel prices, we are unable to predict total operating expense for any future period with any degree of certainty. In addition, we believe the disclosure of financial performance without mark-to-market hedging gains is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. Please see the cautionary statement under "Forward-Looking Information."
 
In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the following information shall not be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), nor shall such information be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing. This Report will not be deemed an admission as to the materiality of any information required to be disclosed solely to satisfy the requirements of Regulation FD.
 
References in this report on Form 8-K to "Air Group," "the Company," "we," "us," and "our" refer to Alaska Air Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise specified. Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Horizon Air Industries, Inc. are referred to as "Alaska" and "Horizon," respectively, and together as our "airlines."
 
First Quarter 2006
 
 
Alaska Airlines' January traffic increased 3.7% to 1.295 billion RPMs from 1.249 billion flown a year earlier. Capacity during January was 1.878 billion ASMs, 3.5% higher than the 1.814 billion in January 2005. The passenger load factor (the percentage of available seats occupied by fare-paying passengers) for the month was 69.0%, compared to 68.9% in January 2005. The airline carried 1,238,300 passengers compared to 1,231,400 in January 2005.
 
In January 2006, RASM increased 7.0% compared to January 2005 due primarily to an increase in yields per RPM.
 
 
 
Horizon Air's January traffic increased 11.6% to 190.8 million RPMs from 171.0 million flown a year earlier. Capacity for January was 294.6 million ASMs, 13.4% higher than the 259.9 million
 
in January 2005. The passenger load factor for the month was 64.8%, compared to 65.8% in January 2005. The airline carried 493,500 passengers compared to 473,300 in January 2005.
 
In January 2006, RASM increased 4.3% compared to January 2005 due primarily to an increase in yields per RPM, offset by the decrease in load factor.
 
 
Other Financial Information
 
Liquidity and Capital Resources
 
Cash and short-term investments decreased as of January 31, 2006 to approximately $901 million compared to $983 million at December 31, 2005.
 
Fuel Hedging
 
We are providing unaudited information about fuel price movements and the impact of our hedging program on our financial results. Management believes it is useful to compare results between periods that exclude the mark-to-market hedging gains/losses recorded on a GAAP basis and include the cash received or due on hedge positions settled during the period (although the related impact may have been recognized for financial reporting purposes in a prior period). We refer to this as the comparison of "economic fuel cost", which is presented below for January 2006.

On March 9, 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a plan to accelerate the retirement of our Boeing MD-80 fleet and remove these aircraft from service by December 2008. This decision was made to transition to a single fleet type consisting of Boeing 737 aircraft. The Company's fleet currently includes 15 owned and 11 leased MD-80 aircraft. This plan will allow the Company to reduce annual operating costs as newer replacement aircraft have lower maintenance and fuel costs, as well as other cost savings resulting from a single fleet type. As a result of this decision, we evaluated impairment of the 15 owned MD-80s under the existing accounting rules and concluded that the carrying value of these aircraft is no longer recoverable when compared to the estimated remaining future cash flows. Consequently, during the first quarter of 2006, we expect to record a non-cash impairment charge associated with the owned MD-80 fleet. Although the actual amount has not yet been finalized, we expect the impairment charge to be between $130 million and $150 million, before tax (between $80 million and $95 million, after tax). No portion of the impairment charge will result in future cash expenditures.
In addition, the Company plans to return substantially all of its leased MD-80 aircraft to lessors before the end of the contractual lease terms. Early return of leased aircraft generally involves termination payments to lessors. While the actual cost of termination payments will not be known until the timing of each aircraft's return is finalized, we expect those cash payments to be between $150 and $170 million, based on early return provisions of the leases. However, actual payments could be lower if we are able to negotiate more favorable terms with lessors, or if we are able to sublease the aircraft. We expect these exit costs to also result in charges to the income statement of between $130 million and $150 million before tax ($80 million to $95 million, after tax). These costs will be recorded in future periods as plans are finalized.
In total, we expect the impairment charge and exit costs to result in a reduction to shareholders' equity of between $160 million and $190 million once the transition is complete.
 
Giving consideration to the fleet transition plan discussed in Item 2.06 above, the following table displays the anticipated fleet count for Alaska Airlines, Inc. as of December 31:

On March 9, 2006, Alaska Air Group, Inc. (the "Company") amended its Bylaws to provide for amendments by a majority vote of the stockholders. Previously, the Bylaws provided that amendments by stockholders required a vote of the holders of three-fourths of the stock present in person or represented by proxy at a meeting. Article X of the Company's Bylaws has been amended to read as follows:
These Bylaws may be altered or repealed and new Bylaws may be made by the affirmative vote of a majority of the Board of Directors, subject to the right of the stockholders to amend or repeal Bylaws including Bylaws made or amended by the Board of Directors or to adopt new Bylaws, by the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding stock of the corporation entitled to vote thereon, provided that notice of the proposed action be included in the notice of such meeting.
On March 9, 2006, the Company amended its Bylaws to adopt a majority vote standard for the election of directors in uncontested elections. Previously, the Bylaws provided that directors, irrespective of an election contest, be elected by a plurality vote, in accordance with Delaware corporation law. Article II, Section 5 of the Company's Bylaws has been amended to read as follows:
Section 5. Quorum
At any meeting of the stockholders, the holders of record of a majority of the total number of shares of outstanding stock of the corporation entitled to vote, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for all purposes.
If a quorum is present at any meeting of stockholders, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the subject matter shall be the act of the stockholders, except as otherwise expressly provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, these Bylaws or applicable law. Each director shall be elected by the vote of the majority of the votes cast with respect to the director at any meeting of stockholders for the election of directors at which a quorum is present, provided that if the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected, the directors shall be elected by the vote of a plurality of the shares represented in person or by proxy at any such meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors. For purposes of clarity, it is
stated that the provisions of the foregoing sentence do not apply to vacancies and newly created directorships filled by a vote of the Board of Directors under Article III, Section 2 of these Bylaws. For purposes of this section, a majority of the votes cast means that the number of shares voted for' a director must exceed 50% of the votes cast with respect to that director. If a nominee who already serves as a director is not elected, the director shall offer to tender his or her resignation to the Board of Directors.

Section 1. Right to Indemnification
Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved (including, without limitation, as a witness) in any actual or threatened action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a "proceeding"), by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a Director or officer of the corporation or that, being or having been such a Director or officer or employee of the corporation, he or she is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a Director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan (hereinafter an "indemnitee"), whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a Director, officer, employee or agent or in any other capacity while serving as a Director, officer, employee or agent, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the corporation to the full extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than permitted prior thereto) or by other applicable law as then in effect, against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts to be paid in settlement) actually and reasonably incurred or suffered by such indemnitee in connection therewith and such indemnification shall continue as to an indemnitee who has ceased to be a Director, officer, employee, or agent and shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and administrators; provided, however, that except as provided in Section 2 with respect to proceedings seeking to enforce rights to indemnification, the corporation shall indemnify any such indemnitee seeking indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors of the corporation. The right to indemnification conferred in this Section shall be a contract right and shall include the right to be paid by the corporation the expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition (hereinafter an "advancement of expenses"); provided, however, that if the Delaware General Corporations Law requires, an advancement of expenses incurred by an indemnitee in his or her capacity as a Director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such indemnitee including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) shall be made only upon delivery to the corporation of an undertaking (hereinafter an "undertaking"), by or on behalf of such indemnitee to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal that such indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under this Section 1 or otherwise.
Section 2. Right of Indemnitee to Bring Suit.
If a claim under Section 1 is not paid in full by the corporation within sixty days after a written claim has been received by the corporation, except in the case of a claim for advancement of expenses, in which case the applicable period shall be twenty days, the indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit against the corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim. If
Bylaws of Alaska Air Group, Inc.
As Amended and in Effect March 9, 2006
Page 11
 
successful in whole or in part in any such suit, the indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting such suit. The indemnitee shall be presumed to be entitled to indemnification under this Article upon submission of a written claim (and, in an action brought to enforce a claim for advancement of expenses, where the required undertaking, if any is required, has been tendered to the corporation), and thereafter the corporation shall have the burden of proof to overcome the presumption that the indemnitee is not so entitled. Neither the failure of the corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such suit that indemnification of the indemnitee is proper in the circumstances nor an actual determination by the corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification shall be a defense to the suit or create a presumption that the indemnitee is not so entitled.
.
Section 3. Nonexclusivity of Rights
The right to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses conferred in this Article shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise. Notwithstanding any amendment to or repeal of this Article, any indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification in accordance with the provisions hereof and thereof with respect to any acts or omissions of such indemnitee occurring prior to such amendment or repeal.
.
Section 4. Insurance, Contracts and Funding
The corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any Director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the Delaware General Corporation Law. The corporation may without further stockholder approval, enter into contracts with any indemnitee in furtherance of the provisions of this Article and may create a trust fund, grant a security interest or use other means (including, without limitation, a letter of credit) to ensure the payment of such amounts as may be necessary to effect indemnification as provided in this Article.
.
Section 5. Persons Serving Other Entities
Any person who is or was a Director, officer or employee of the corporation who is or was serving as a Director or officer of another corporation of which a majority of the shares entitled to vote in the election of its directors is held by the corporation shall be deemed to be so serving at the request of the corporation and entitled to indemnification and advancement of expenses under Section 1.
.
Section 6. Indemnification of Employees and Agents of the Corporation
The corporation may, by action of its Board of Directors, grant rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses to any employee or agent, or any group or groups of employees or
Bylaws of Alaska Air Group, Inc.
As Amended and in Effect March 9, 2006
Page 12
 
agents, of the corporation with the same scope and effect as the provisions of this Article with respect to the indemnification and advancement of expenses of directors and officers of the corporation.
.
Section 1. Checks, Drafts, Etc.; Loans
All checks, drafts or other orders for the payment of money, notes or other evidences of indebtedness issued in the name of the corporation shall be signed by such officer or officers, agent or agents of the corporation and in such manner as shall, from time to time, be determined by resolution of the Board of Directors. Such authority may be general or confined to specific circumstances.
.
Section 2. Deposits
All funds of the corporation shall be deposited, from time to time, to the credit of the corporation in such banks, trust companies or other depositories as the Board of Directors may select, or as may be selected by any officer or officers, agent or agents of the corporation to whom such power may, from time to time, be delegated by the Board of Directors; and for the purpose of such deposit, any officer or agent to whom such power may be delegated by the Board of Directors, may endorse, assign and deliver checks, drafts and other orders for the payment of money which are payable to the order of the corporation.
These Bylaws may be altered or repealed and new Bylaws may be made by the affirmative vote of a majority of the Board of Directors, subject to the right of the stockholders to amend or repeal Bylaws, including Bylaws made or amended by the Board of Directors or to adopt new Bylaws, by the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding stock of the corporation entitled to vote thereon, provided that notice of the proposed action be included in the notice of such meeting.
Terms of the masculine gender used for convenience in these Bylaws should be understood in the feminine gender where appropriate.

FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION
This report contains forward-looking statements subject to the safe harbor protection provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements relate to future events and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual outcomes to be materially different from those indicated by any forward-looking statements. Some of the things that could cause our actual results to differ from our expectations are: the competitive environment and other trends in our industry; changes in our operating costs including fuel, which can be volatile; our ability to meet our cost reduction goals; our inability to achieve or maintain profitability and fluctuations in our quarterly results; our significant indebtedness; our inability to secure new aircraft financing; the implementation of our growth strategy; the timing of the MD-80 fleet disposal, the market value of MD-80 aicraft, and the amounts of potential lease termination payments with lessors and sublease payments from sublessees; compliance with our financial covenants; potential downgrades of our credit ratings and the availability of financing; the concentration of our revenue from a few key markets; general economic conditions, as well as economic conditions in the geographic regions we serve; actual or threatened terrorist attacks; global instability and potential U.S. military actions or activities; insurance costs; labor disputes; our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; an aircraft accident or incident; liability and other claims asserted against us; operational disruptions; increases in government fees and taxes; changes in laws and regulations; our reliance on automated systems; and our reliance on third-party vendors and partners. For a discussion of these and other risk factors, see Item 1A of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005. All of the forward- looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the risk factors discussed therein. These risk factors may not be exhaustive. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risk factors emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict such new risk factors, nor can it assess the impact, if any, of such new risk factors on our business or events described in any forward-looking statements. We disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date of this press release to conform them to actual results.
 
Pursuant to 17 CFR Part 243 ("Regulation FD"), the Company is submitting information relating to its financial and operational outlook for 2005. This report includes information regarding forecasts of available seat miles (ASMs), cost per available seat mile (CASM) excluding fuel costs and other noted items, as well as certain actual results for revenue passenger miles (RPMs), load factor and revenue per available seat mile (RASM), for its subsidiaries Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Horizon Air. Our disclosure of operating cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel and other noted items, provides us the ability to measure and monitor our performance without these items. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is total operating expense per available seat mile. However, due to the large fluctuations in fuel prices, we are unable to predict total operating expense for any future period with any degree of certainty.

First Quarter 2006
On March 13, 2006, the Company announced its plan to transition to a single fleet type, the Boeing 737, by the end of 2008, which includes an acceleration of the retirement of its MD-80 fleet. The Company's fleet currently includes 15 owned and 11 leased MD-80 aircraft. As a result of this decision, during the first quarter of 2006, we will record a non-cash impairment charge associated with the owned MD-80 fleet. Although the actual amount has not yet been finalized, we expect the impairment charge to be between $130 million and $150 million, before tax (between $80 million and $95 million, after tax). For purposes of the first quarter forecast, Alaska assumed a $140 million pre-tax charge. The actual charge could differ materially from this forecast.

Alaska Airlines' February traffic increased 6.4% to 1.260 billion RPMs from 1.184 billion flown a year earlier. Capacity during February was 1.711 billion ASMs, 2.1 % higher than the 1.676 billion in February 2005. The passenger load factor (the percentage of available seats occupied by fare-paying passengers) for the month was 73.7%, compared to 70.7% in February 2005. The airline carried 1,209,400 passengers compared to 1,174,800 in February 2005.
In February 2006, RASM increased 11% compared to February 2005 due primarily to an increase in yields per RPM.
 
 
Horizon Air's February traffic increased 19.7% to 195.3 million RPMs from 163.2 million flown a year earlier. Capacity during February was 273.2 million ASMs, 12.8% higher than the 242.2 million in February 2005. The passenger load factor for the month was 71.5%, compared to 67.4% in February 2005. The airline carried 502,300 passengers compared to 449,800 in February 2005.
In February 2006, RASM increased 10.3% compared to February 2005 due primarily to an increase in yields per RPM, offset by the decrease in load factor.
 
Other Financial Information
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash and short-term investments increased as of February 28, 2006 to approximately $961 million compared to $927 million at January 31, 2005.
Fuel Hedging
We are providing unaudited information about fuel price movements and the impact of our hedging program on our financial results. Management believes it is useful to compare results between periods that exclude the mark-to-market hedging gains/losses recorded on a GAAP basis and include the cash received or due on hedge positions settled during the period (although the related impact may have been recognized for financial reporting purposes in a prior period). We refer to this as the comparison of "economic fuel cost", which is presented below for January and February 2006.
 
Calculation of Economic Fuel Cost Per Gallon
 
 
For Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air, GAAP fuel expense per gallon for the quarter is expected to be approximately $1.97 and $2.05, respectively. The economic fuel expense per gallon for the quarter is expected to be approximately $1.67 and $1.73 for Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air, respectively.
 
Alaska Air Group's future hedge positions are as follows:
 
Operating Fleet Plan
The following table provides a fleet summary for Alaska and Horizon for actual airplanes on hand as of the date of this report. One CRJ700 was delivered in January, two B737-800s were delivered in February, and two Q400s were delivered in March.
 
 
 
The following table summarizes firm aircraft commitments for Alaska (B737-800) and Horizon (Q400) by year, excluding aircraft that have already been delivered in 2006:
 
In addition to the firm orders noted above, Alaska has options to acquire 32 additional B737-800s and purchase rights for 27 more. Alaska has also entered into operating lease agreements for two B737-800 aircraft to be delivered in 2006. Horizon has options to acquire 20 Q400s and 15 CRJ700s.
As noted above, on March 13, 2006, the Company announced its plan to transition to a single fleet type, the Boeing 737, by the end of 2008, which includes an acceleration of the retirement of its MD-80 fleet. As a result, the Company expects to exercise additional options and purchase rights on its Boeing 737-800 order in the future.
Giving consideration to the fleet transition plan discussed above, the following table displays the anticipated fleet count for Alaska Airlines, Inc. as of December 31:

FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION
This report contains forward-looking statements subject to the safe harbor protection provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements relate to future events and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual outcomes to be materially different from those indicated by any forward-looking statements. Some of the things that could cause our actual results to differ from our expectations are: the competitive environment and other trends in our industry; changes in our operating costs including fuel, which can be volatile; our ability to meet our cost reduction goals; our inability to achieve or maintain profitability and fluctuations in our quarterly results; our significant indebtedness; our inability to secure new aircraft financing; the implementation of our growth strategy; the timing of the MD-80 fleet disposal, the market value of MD-80 aicraft, and the amounts of potential lease termination payments with lessors and sublease payments from sublessees; compliance with our financial covenants; potential downgrades of our credit ratings and the availability of financing; the concentration of our revenue from a few key markets; general economic conditions, as well as economic conditions in the geographic regions we serve; actual or threatened terrorist attacks; global instability and potential U.S. military actions or activities; insurance costs; labor disputes; our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; an aircraft accident or incident; liability and other claims asserted against us; operational disruptions; increases in government fees and taxes; changes in laws and regulations; our reliance on automated systems; and our reliance on third-party vendors and partners. For a discussion of these and other risk factors, see Item 1A of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005. All of the forward- looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the risk factors discussed therein. These risk factors may not be exhaustive. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risk factors emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict such new risk factors, nor can it assess the impact, if any, of such new risk factors on our business or events described in any forward-looking statements. We disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date of this press release to conform them to actual results.
 
Pursuant to 17 CFR Part 243 ("Regulation FD"), the Company is submitting information relating to its financial and operational outlook for 2005. This report includes information regarding forecasts of available seat miles (ASMs), cost per available seat mile (CASM) excluding fuel and other noted items, as well as certain actual results for revenue passenger miles (RPMs), load factor and revenue per available seat mile (RASM), for its subsidiaries Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Horizon Air. Our disclosure of operating cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel and other noted items, provides us the ability to measure and monitor our performance without these items. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is total operating expense per available seat mile. However, due to the large fluctuations in fuel prices, we are unable to predict total operating expense for any future period with any degree of certainty. In addition, we believe the disclosure of financial performance without mark-to-market hedging gains is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. Please see the cautionary statement under "Forward-Looking Information."
In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the following information shall not be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), nor shall such information be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing. This Report will not be deemed an admission as to the materiality of any information required to be disclosed solely to satisfy the requirements of Regulation FD.

Fourth Quarter 2005
On March 13, 2006, the Company announced its plan to transition to a single fleet type, the Boeing 737, by the end of 2008, which includes an acceleration of the retirement of its MD-80 fleet. The Company's fleet currently includes 15 owned and 11 leased MD-80 aircraft. As a result of this decision, during the first quarter of 2006, we will record a non-cash impairment charge associated with the owned MD-80 fleet. We expect the impairment charge to be between $130 million and $140 million, before tax (between $80 million and $90 million, after tax). For purposes of the first quarter forecast, Alaska assumed a $135 million pre-tax charge. The actual charge could differ materially from this forecast.
 
NM = Not meaningful
The forecast of cost per ASM (excluding fuel and impairment charge) has declined from our previous estimate, primarily due to a shift in the timing of maintenance events.
Alaska's March traffic increased 4.2% to 1.525 billion RPMs from 1.464 billion flown a year earlier. Capacity during March was 1.950 billion ASMs, 3.7% higher than the 1.880 billion in March 2005. The passenger load factor (the percentage of available seats occupied by fare-paying passengers) for the month was 78.2%, compared to 77.9% in March 2005. The airline carried 1,456,800 passengers compared to 1,445,200 in March 2005.
In February 2006, RASM increased 11.7% compared to February 2005 due primarily to an increase in yields per RPM. In January 2006, RASM increased 7.0% compared to January 2005 due primarily to an increase in yields per RPM.
 
 
Horizon's March traffic increased 14.1% to 234.3 million RPMs from 205.4 million flown a year earlier. Capacity for March was 309.6 million ASMs, 10.6% higher than the 280.0 million in March 2005. The passenger load factor for the month was 75.7%, compared to 73.4% in March 2005. The airline carried 598,600 passengers compared to 551,800 in March 2005.
In February 2006, RASM increased 10.3% compared to February 2005 due primarily to an increase in yields per RPM and load factor. In January 2006, RASM increased 4.3% compared to January 2005 due primarily to an increase in yields per RPM, offset by the decrease in load factor.
 
Other Financial Information
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash and short-term investments increased as of March 31, 2006 to approximately $1 billion compared to $961 million at February 28, 2006, primarily as a result of new financing arrangements closed in March on two of the aircraft delivered in February and cash flow from operations, partially offset by aircraft purchase deposit payments.
Fuel Hedging
We are providing unaudited information about fuel price movements and the impact of our hedging program on our financial results. Management believes it is useful to compare results between periods that exclude the mark-to-market hedging gains/losses recorded on a GAAP basis and include the cash received or due on hedge positions settled during the period (although the related impact may have been recognized for financial reporting purposes in a prior period). We refer to this as the comparison of "economic fuel cost", which is presented below for January and February 2006.
 
Calculation of Economic Fuel Cost Per Gallon
 
 
For Alaska and Horizon, GAAP fuel expense per gallon for the quarter is expected to be approximately $1.99 and $2.02, respectively. The economic fuel expense per gallon for the quarter is expected to be approximately $1.69 and $1.71 for Alaska and Horizon, respectively. March mark-to-market gains included in nonoperating income (expense) related to hedges that settle in future periods are expected to be approximately $5.8 million for the combined Air Group, bringing the total loss for the quarter to approximately $0.1 million.
 
Alaska Air Group's future hedge positions are as follows:
 
Operating Fleet Plan
The following table provides a fleet summary for Alaska and Horizon for aircraft on hand as of the date of this report. One CRJ700 was delivered in January, two B737-800s were delivered in February, two Q400s and one B737-800 were delivered in March.
 
 
 
The following table summarizes firm aircraft commitments for Alaska (B737-800) and Horizon (Q400) by year, excluding aircraft that have already been delivered in 2006:
 
In addition to the firm orders noted above, Alaska has options to acquire 32 additional B737-800s and purchase rights for 27 more. Horizon has options to acquire 20 Q400s and 15 CRJ700s.
As noted above, on March 13, 2006, the Company announced its plan to transition to a single fleet type, the Boeing 737, by the end of 2008, which includes an acceleration of the retirement of its MD-80 fleet. As a result, the Company expects to exercise additional options and purchase rights on its Boeing 737-800 order in the future.
Giving consideration to the fleet transition plan discussed above, the following table displays the currently anticipated fleet count for Alaska as of December 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008:

Alaska Air Group, Inc. today issued a press release reporting financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2006. The press release is filed as Exhibit 99.1.
 
Election of Directors
On April 19, 2006, the Board of Directors of Alaska Air Group elected R. Marc Langland as Lead Director of the Board and Chair of the Board's Governance and Nominating Committee. Mr. Langland succeeds Bruce Kennedy, who acted as Lead Director and Chair of the Board's Governance and Nominating Committee from 2002 through 2006.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
SEATTLE  Alaska Air Group, Inc. (NYSE:ALK) today reported a first quarter net loss of $79.1 million, or $2.36 per share, compared to a net loss of $80.5 million, or $2.39 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2005. The 2006 results include an impairment charge on the company's MD-80 fleet of $131.1 million ($81.9 million, after tax, or $2.44 per share) resulting from the decision to transition to an all -Boeing 737 aircraft fleet type. Both periods include mark-to-market fuel hedge accounting gains and losses and the first quarter of 2005 includes a charge related to the cumulative effect of a maintenance accounting policy change and restructuring charges that also impact the comparability of the periods. Excluding the impact of the items noted above, the company would have reported net income in the first quarter of 2006 of $2.8 million, or $0.08 per share, compared to a net loss of $41.7 million, or $1.54 per share, in the first quarter of 2005.
"We're very pleased to report an adjusted net profit for what is seasonally our weakest quarter," said Bill Ayer, chairman and chief executive officer. "Our people are working hard to provide excellent value for our customers and improve efficiency. Add to that a fare environment that allows us to recover a greater portion of our high fuel costs, and we've got a great start to the year."
Last month, Alaska announced that it was investing $750 million to replace its MD-80s and move to a single fleet type by the end of 2008. As a result of this strategic decision, the company wrote down the value of its owned MD-80 fleet to estimated market value, recording a non-cash charge of $131.1 million. Separately, the company expects to make cash payments totaling $130 million to $150 million to terminate MD-80 leases before the end of the lease term. These costs will be recorded in future periods. "While this investment is substantial, it represents an important step toward ensuring our long-term competitiveness," said Ayer.
Alaska Airlines' passenger traffic in the first quarter increased 4.7 percent on a capacity increase of 3.1 percent. Alaska's load factor increased 1.1 percentage points to 73.7 percent, compared to the same period in 2005. Alaska's operating revenue per available seat mile (ASM) increased 9.3 percent, while its operating cost per ASM excluding fuel, impairment of aircraft and restructuring charges and adjustments decreased 6.8 percent. Alaska's pretax loss for the quarter was $124.7 million, compared to income before taxes and the accounting change of $15.4 million in
2005. Excluding the items noted above, Alaska would have reported pretax income of $7.6 million for the quarter, compared to a pretax loss of $54.9 million in the first quarter of 2005.
Horizon Air's passenger traffic in the first quarter increased 14.8 percent on a 12.1 percent capacity increase. Horizon's load factor increased by 1.7 percentage points to 70.7 percent, compared to the same period in 2005. Horizon's operating revenue per ASM increased 7.6 percent, and its operating cost per ASM excluding fuel decreased 0.1 percent. Horizon's pretax loss for the quarter was $0.4 million, compared to income before taxes and the accounting change of $4.6 million in 2005. Excluding the mark-to-market fuel hedge adjustments, Horizon's pretax loss was $1.6 million for the quarter, compared to $7.7 million in the first quarter of 2005.
Alaska Air Group had cash and short-term investments at March 31, 2006, of approximately $1.0 billion compared to $983 million at December 31, 2005. The company's debt-to-capital ratio, assuming aircraft operating leases are capitalized at seven times annualized rent, was 76 percent as of March 31, 2006, compared to 73 percent as of December 31, 2005.
A summary of financial and statistical data for Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air, as well as a reconciliation of the reported non-GAAP financial measures, can be found on pages 6 through 10.
A conference call regarding the first quarter 2006 results will be simulcast via the Internet at 9:30 a.m. Pacific Time on April 20, 2006. It may be accessed through the company's website at alaskaair.com. For those unable to listen to the live broadcast, a replay will be available after the conclusion of the call at alaskaair.com.
This report contains forward-looking statements that are intended to be subject to the safe harbor protection provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Note A:
Pursuant to Item 10 of Regulation S-K, we are providing disclosure of the reconciliation of reported non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable financial measures reported on a GAAP basis. The non-GAAP financial measures provide management the ability to measure and monitor performance both with and without the cost of aircraft fuel (including the gains and losses associated with our fuel hedging program where appropriate), aircraft impairment charges, and restructuring charges and adjustments. Because the cost and availability of aircraft fuel are subject to many economic and political factors beyond our control and we record changes in the fair value of our hedge portfolio in our income statement, it is our view that the measurement and monitoring of performance without fuel is important. In addition, we believe the disclosure of financial performance without impairment and restructuring charges is useful to investors. Finally, these non-GAAP financial measures are also more comparable to financial measures reported to the Department of Transportation by other major network airlines.
The following tables reconcile our non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for both Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Horizon Air Industries, Inc.:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Air Group Net Income (Loss) and EPS Reconciliation:
The following table summarizes Alaska Air Group, Inc.'s net income (loss) and earnings per share during 2006 and 2005 excluding the cumulative effect of the accounting change, mark-to-market hedging gains net of related reclassifications, impairment of aircraft, and restructuring charges and adjustments, as reported in accordance with GAAP (in millions except per share amounts):
 
 
In order to reconcile the diluted loss per share to the GAAP loss per share, the table above includes $0.32, which represents the impact of the additional shares that were used in the GAAP loss per share as well as $1.2 million of interest, net of tax, on the contingently convertible senior notes added back to earnings in order to derive the loss per share in accordance with GAAP.
The per share impact of the change in accounting, mark-to-market gain on fuel hedges, restructuring and impairment charges have been presented in the table above assuming 33.2 million fully diluted shares outstanding.
The following table summarizes Alaska Air Group, Inc.'s basic and diluted per share calculations for earnings before the accounting change and net loss (in millions except per share amounts):
 
 
Forecasted Financial Measures
During our quarterly earnings conference call, we expect to discuss forward-looking forecasted unit cost information for 2006. This forecasted unit cost information includes non-GAAP unit cost estimates which are summarized in the following table together with the most directly comparable GAAP unit cost for both Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Horizon Air Industries, Inc.:
 
: Our forecast of fuel costs is based on anticipated gallons consumed and estimated fuel cost per gallon. The estimate also includes the expected benefit from settled hedges. Given the volatility of fuel prices and the mark-to-market adjustments on our fuel hedge portfolio, readers should be cautioned that actual fuel expense will likely differ from the forecast above.

Basic terms reached on COPS and RSSA contracts
Alaska and IAM negotiation teams still working on final language, open issues
Alaska Airlines and the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) negotiation committees have reached agreements in principle on basic terms for both the clerical, office and passenger service (COPS) and ramp service and stores agents (RSSA) contracts following talks in early May. Open issues still remain, and the local negotiation teams are continuing to work on contract language related to the agreed terms and the open issues.
The COPS contract, which became amendable in October 2004, covers about 3,000 Alaska customer service, reservation sales and operations agents, and accounting specialists. Nearly 650 ramp service and stores agents are covered by the RSSA contract, which became amendable in January 2004.

FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION
This report contains forward-looking statements subject to the safe harbor protection provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements relate to future events and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual outcomes to be materially different from those indicated by any forward-looking statements. Some of the things that could cause our actual results to differ from our expectations are: the competitive environment and other trends in our industry; changes in our operating costs including fuel, which can be volatile; our ability to meet our cost reduction goals; our inability to achieve or maintain profitability and fluctuations in our quarterly results; our significant indebtedness; our inability to secure new aircraft financing; the implementation of our growth strategy; the timing of the MD-80 fleet disposal, the market value of MD-80 aircraft, and the amounts of potential lease termination payments with lessors and sublease payments from sublessees; compliance with our financial covenants; potential downgrades of our credit ratings and the availability of financing; the concentration of our revenue from a few key markets; general economic conditions, as well as economic conditions in the geographic regions we serve; actual or threatened terrorist attacks; global instability and potential U.S. military actions or activities; insurance costs; labor disputes; our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; an aircraft accident or incident; liability and other claims asserted against us; operational disruptions; increases in government fees and taxes; changes in laws and regulations; our reliance on automated systems; and our reliance on third-party vendors and partners. For a discussion of these and other risk factors, see Item 1A of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005. All of the forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the risk factors discussed therein. These risk factors may not be exhaustive. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risk factors emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict such new risk factors, nor can it assess the impact, if any, of such new risk factors on our business or events described in any forward-looking statements. We disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date of this report to conform them to actual results. Over time, our actual results, performance or achievements will likely differ from the anticipated results, performance or achievements that are expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements, and such differences might be significant and materially adverse.
 
Pursuant to 17 CFR Part 243 ("Regulation FD"), the Company is submitting information relating to its financial and operational outlook for 2006. This report includes information regarding forecasts of available seat miles (ASMs), cost per available seat mile (CASM) excluding fuel consumption, as well as certain actual results for revenue passenger miles (RPMs), load factor and revenue per available seat mile (RASM), for its subsidiaries Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Horizon Air. Our disclosure of operating cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel and other noted items, provides us the ability to measure and monitor our performance without these items. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is total operating expense per available seat mile. However, due to the large fluctuations in fuel prices, we are unable to predict total operating expense for any future period with any degree of certainty. In addition, we believe the disclosure of financial performance without mark-to-market hedging gains and losses is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. Please see the cautionary statement under "Forward-Looking Information."
In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the following information shall not be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), nor shall such information be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing. This Report will not be deemed an admission as to the materiality of any information required to be disclosed solely to satisfy the requirements of Regulation FD.
References in this report on Form 8-K to "Air Group," "Company," "we," "us," and "our" refer to Alaska Air Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise specified. Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Horizon Air Industries, Inc. are referred to as "Alaska" and "Horizon," respectively, and together as our "airlines."
 
Second Quarter 2006
Alaska and the Association of Flight Attendants reached an agreement on a new four-year contract for the airline's approximately 2,500 flight attendants. The new contract was ratified on April 26, 2006. The new agreement includes an immediate 3% pay increase and a signing bonus in aggregate of approximately $2.7 million. Additionally, Alaska will offer a voluntary severance package to a number of flight attendants that includes, among other things, a lump-sum payment of $2,000 per year of service up to a maximum of 25 years and continuing travel benefits. Based on initial responses, we expect the lump-sum payment to be approximately $5 million to $7 million in the second quarter. For purposes of the forecast, we assume the charge will be $6 million. The effect of each of these items is included in the forecast below.
 
NM = Not meaningful
Alaska Airlines' April traffic increased 7.1% to 1.486 billion RPMs from 1.387 billion flown a year earlier. Capacity during April was 1.890 billion ASMs, 4.3% higher than the 1.812 billion in April 2005. The passenger load factor (the percentage of available seats occupied by fare-paying passengers) for the month was 78.6%, compared to 76.6% in April 2005. The airline carried 1,420,300 passengers compared to 1,362,000 in April 2005.
In April 2006, RASM increased 8.8% compared to April 2005 primarily due to increased yields and higher load factor.
 
 
Horizon Air's April traffic increased 18.4% to 221.8 million RPMs from 187.3 million flown a year earlier. Capacity during April was 294.5 million ASMs, 10.1% higher than the 267.6 million in April 2005. The passenger load factor for the month was 75.3%, compared to 70.0% in April 2005. The airline carried 554,600 passengers compared to 505,500 in April 2005.
In April 2006, RASM increased by 6.5% compared to April 2005 due primarily to higher load factor.
 
Other Financial Information
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash and short-term investments increased as of April 30, 2006 to approximately $1.04 billion compared to $1.01 billion at March 31, 2006.
Fuel Hedging
We are providing unaudited information about fuel price movements and the impact of our hedging program on our financial results. Management believes it is useful to compare results between periods that exclude the mark-to-market hedging gains/losses recorded on a GAAP basis and include the cash received or due on hedge positions settled during the period (although the related impact may have been recognized for financial reporting purposes in a prior period). We refer to this as the comparison of "economic fuel cost", which is presented below for April 2006.
 
Calculation of Economic Fuel Cost Per Gallon
 
 
For Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air, GAAP fuel expense per gallon for the quarter is expected to be approximately $1.67 and $1.82, respectively. The economic fuel expense per gallon for the quarter is expected to be approximately $1.83 and $1.99 for Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air, respectively.
Alaska Air Group's future hedge positions are as follows:
 
 
Operating Fleet Plan
The following table provides a fleet summary for Alaska and Horizon for actual airplanes on hand as of the date of this report.
 
 
The following table summarizes firm aircraft commitments for Alaska (B737-800) and Horizon (Q400) by year, excluding aircraft that have already been delivered in 2006:
 
 
In addition to the firm orders noted above, Alaska has options to acquire 31 additional B737-800s and purchase rights for 27 more. Horizon has options to acquire 20 Q400s and 15 CRJ700s.
On March 13, 2006, the Company announced its plan to transition to a single fleet type, the Boeing 737, by the end of 2008, which includes an acceleration of the retirement of its MD-80 fleet. As a result, the Company expects to exercise additional options and purchase rights on its Boeing 737-800 order in the future.
 
Giving consideration to the fleet transition plan discussed above, the following table displays the currently anticipated fleet count for Alaska as of December 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008:

Second Quarter 2006
Alaska and the Association of Flight Attendants reached an agreement on a new four-year contract for the airline's approximately 2,500 flight attendants. The new contract was ratified on April 26, 2006. Based on this agreement, the Company paid a signing bonus of approximately $2.7 million in May which will be included in wages and benefits in our Statement of Operations. The new agreement also included an immediate 3% pay increase. Additionally, Alaska will offer a voluntary severance package to a number of flight attendants that includes, among other things, a lump-sum payment of $2,000 per year of service up to a maximum of 25 years and continuing travel benefits. We expect this restructuring charge to be approximately $5 million in the second quarter. The effect of this charge is included in the forecast below.
 
NM = Not meaningful
Alaska Airlines' May traffic increased 7.9% to 1.496 billion RPMs from 1.387 billion flown a year earlier. Capacity during May was 1.931 billion ASMs, 6.9% higher than the 1.806 billion in May 2005. The passenger load factor (the percentage of available seats occupied by fare-paying passengers) for the month was 77.5%, compared to 76.8% in May 2005. The airline carried 1,444,200 passengers compared to 1,361,100 in May 2005.
In May 2006, RASM increased 8.6% compared to May 2005 primarily due to increased yields. April 2006 RASM was up 8.8% compared to April 2005 due to increased yields and higher load factor.
 
 
Horizon Air's May traffic increased 10.2% to 232.7 million RPMs from 211.2 million flown a year earlier. Capacity during May was 308.8 million ASMs, 6.1% higher than the 291.0 million in May 2005. The passenger load factor for the month was 75.4%, compared to 72.6% in May 2005. The airline carried 585,000 passengers compared to 555,900 in May 2005.
In May 2006, overall RASM increased by 8.5% compared to May 2005 due primarily to a nearly 12% increase in RASM for native network flying resulting from higher load factors and increasing yields. RASM for the Frontier contract flying decreased by 1.5% from May 2005 due primarily to large increases in utilization and capacity that slightly outpaced revenue gains. The allocation of Horizon's ASMs is summarized as follows:

Alaska's June traffic increased 6.5% to 1.642 billion RPMs from 1.542 billion flown a year earlier. Capacity during June was 2.014 billion ASMs, 4.6% higher than the 1.926 billion in June 2005. The passenger load factor (the percentage of available seats occupied by fare-paying passengers) for the month was 81.5%, compared to 80.1% in June 2005. The airline carried 1,579,100 passengers compared to 1,508,800 in June 2005.
In May 2006, RASM increased 8.6% compared to May 2005 primarily due to increased yields. April 2006 RASM was up 8.8% compared to April 2005 due to increased yields and higher load factor.
 
 
Horizon's June traffic increased 8.0% to 239.3 million RPMs from 221.5 million flown a year earlier. Capacity for June was 301.8 million ASMs, 3.9% higher than the 290.4 million in June 2005.

In May 2006, overall RASM increased by 8.5% compared to May 2005 due primarily to a nearly 12% increase in RASM for native network flying resulting from higher load factors and increasing yields. RASM for the Frontier contract flying decreased by 1.5% from May 2005 due primarily to large increases in utilization and capacity that slightly outpaced revenue gains.

On July 10, 2006, Alaska Air Group, Inc. (the "Company") amended its Articles of Incorporation to conform with the vote of the shareholders at its annual meeting on May 16, 2006.

FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION
This report contains forward-looking statements subject to the safe harbor protection provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements relate to future events and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual outcomes to be materially different from those indicated by any forward-looking statements. Some of the things that could cause our actual results to differ from our expectations are: the competitive environment and other trends in our industry; changes in our operating costs including fuel, which can be volatile; our ability to meet our cost reduction goals; our inability to achieve or maintain profitability and fluctuations in our quarterly results; our significant indebtedness; the implementation of our growth strategy; the timing of the MD-80 fleet disposaland the amounts of potential lease termination payments with lessors and sublease payments from sublessees; compliance with our financial covenants; potential downgrades of our credit ratings and the availability of financing; the concentration of our revenue from a few key markets; general economic conditions, as well as economic conditions in the geographic regions we serve; actual or threatened terrorist attacks; global instability and potential U.S. military actions or activities; insurance costs; labor disputes; our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; an aircraft accident or incident; liability and other claims asserted against us; operational disruptions; increases in government fees and taxes; changes in laws and regulations; our reliance on automated systems; and our reliance on third-party vendors and partners. For a discussion of these and other risk factors, see Item 1A of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005. All of the forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the risk factors discussed therein. These risk factors may not be exhaustive. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risk factors emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict such new risk factors, nor can it assess the impact, if any, of such new risk factors on our business or events described in any forward-looking statements. We disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date of this report to conform them to actual results. Over time, our actual results, performance or achievements will likely differ from the anticipated results, performance or achievements that are expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements, and such differences might be significant and materially adverse.
References in this report on Form 8-K to "Air Group," "Company," "we," "us," and "our" refer to Alaska Air Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise specified. Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Horizon Air Industries, Inc. are referred to as "Alaska" and "Horizon," respectively, and together as our "airlines."
 
Results of Operations And Financial Condition
Alaska Air Group, Inc. today issued a press release reporting financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2006. The press release is filed as Exhibit 99.1.
 
Other Events
New Labor Contracts
On July 17, 2006, two new four-year contracts covering more than 3,700 Alaska Airlines employees represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) were ratified. One ratified contract covers Alaska's clerical, office and passenger service (COPS) employees, including approximately 3,100 customer service and reservations sales agents, as well as a number of accounting clerical employees. The second ratified contract covers the airline's ramp service and stores agents (RSSA), including more than 600 aircraft ground-handling employees.
Both contracts contain a voluntary severance package for employees at the top four tiers of the pay scale that includes cash payments based on years of service, one year of medical coverage after the severance date and continued travel benefits for a period of time. The company expects to record a material charge for the voluntary severance program in the third quarter of 2006, which will be classified as Restructuring Charges in the Statement of Operations. The amount of the charge will not be known until the number of employees accepting the severance package is known, which is expected to be in August 2006. However, for illustrative purposes only, if one quarter of the eligible employees accept the offer (an estimate we believe to be reasonable), the charge would be approximately $20 million.
Both contracts also include signing bonuses and immediate wage increases of 2%. The agreements also include higher employee health care contributions and a provision whereby new employees will only participate in a defined contribution retirement plan. The signing bonus of $500 per affected employee, or approximately $1.9 million in the aggregate, will be included in Wages and Benefits in the Company's third quarter Statement of Operations.
Fleet Transition Costs
In connection with its previously announced retirement of the MD-80 fleet, the Company expects to buy-out five of its nine long-term MD-80 leases in the next 60 days. The buyout (including the repayment of debt under a leveraged lease) is expected to result in a combination of debt and cash payments of approximately $80 million and a pre-tax charge recorded in the Company's third quarter as Fleet Transition Costs in its Statement of Operations of approximately $65 million. Upon completion of the buyout transactions, the Company expects to own these 5 aircraft and is actively working to find a buyer for them in the near term.
Horizon Tentative Sublease Agreement
On July 14, 2006, Horizon Air reached a tentative agreement with CommutAir to sublease up to 16 Q200s to the New York-based regional airline beginning in January 2007. Terms of the deal are still subject to final negotiations and the signing of a sublease agreement. Horizon has previously announced commitments to acquire two Q400s in 2006 and ten in 2007, respectively.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
SEATTLE  Alaska Air Group, Inc. (NYSE:ALK) today reported second quarter net income of $55.5 million, or $1.38 per diluted share, compared to $17.4 million, or $0.56 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2005. The 2006 results include a restructuring charge of $3.8 million ($2.4 million, after tax, or $0.06 per share) resulting from an offer of voluntary severance to Alaska's flight attendants as part of the recently ratified contract. Both periods include mark-to-market fuel hedge accounting gains and losses, and the second quarter of 2005 includes restructuring charges that also impact the comparability of the periods. Excluding the impact of the items noted above, the company would have reported net income in the second quarter of 2006 of $60.3 million, or $1.50 per diluted share, compared to $24.7 million, or $0.78 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2005.
"We are extremely pleased with the quarter's results, which were the result of a combination of revenue gains and cost improvements," said Bill Ayer, chairman and chief executive officer. "It's gratifying to see everyone's hard work pay off, and I would like to thank and congratulate our employees on an outstanding quarter."
Alaska Airlines' passenger traffic in the second quarter increased 7.2 percent on a capacity increase of 5.2 percent. Alaska's load factor increased 1.4 percentage points to 79.3 percent, compared to the same period in 2005. Alaska's operating revenue per available seat mile (ASM) increased 9.5 percent, while its operating cost per ASM excluding fuel, and restructuring charges and adjustments decreased 2.1 percent. Alaska's pretax income for the quarter was $72.5 million, compared to $22.1 million in 2005. Excluding the items noted above, Alaska would have reported pretax income of $79.6 million for the quarter, compared to $34.2 million in the second quarter of 2005.
Horizon Air's passenger traffic in the second quarter increased 11.3 percent on a 6.1 percent capacity increase. Horizon's load factor increased by 3.6 percentage points to 76.6 percent, compared to the same period in 2005. Horizon's operating revenue per ASM increased 9.0 percent,
and its operating cost per ASM excluding fuel increased 9.8 percent. Horizon's pretax income for the quarter was $9.7 million, compared to $11.1 million in 2005. Excluding the mark-to-market fuel hedge adjustments, Horizon's pretax income would have been $10.2 million for the quarter, compared to $10.7 million in the second quarter of 2005.
Alaska Air Group had cash and short-term investments at June 30, 2006, of approximately $1.1 billion compared to $983 million at December 31, 2005. The company's debt-to-capital ratio, assuming aircraft operating leases are capitalized at seven times annualized rent, was 69 percent as of June 30, 2006, compared to 73 percent as of December 31, 2005. The decrease from December 31, 2005 is primarily due to the conversion to equity of our senior convertible notes in April 2006, partially offset by the $23.6 million net loss for the six months, coupled with an increase in our outstanding debt resulting from new aircraft-secured debt arrangements in the first six months of 2006.
A summary of financial and statistical data for Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air, as well as a reconciliation of the reported non-GAAP financial measures, can be found on pages 6 through 10.
A conference call regarding the second quarter 2006 results will be simulcast via the Internet at 8:30 a.m. Pacific Time on July 25, 2006. It may be accessed through the company's website at alaskaair.com. For those unable to listen to the live broadcast, a replay will be available after the conclusion of the call at alaskaair.com.
This report contains forward-looking statements that are intended to be subject to the safe harbor protection provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Note A:
Pursuant to Item 10 of Regulation S-K, we are providing disclosure of the reconciliation of reported non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable financial measures reported on a GAAP basis. The non-GAAP financial measures provide management the ability to measure and monitor performance both with and without the cost of aircraft fuel (including the gains and losses associated with our fuel hedging program where appropriate), aircraft impairment charges, and restructuring charges and adjustments. Because the cost and availability of aircraft fuel are subject to many economic and political factors beyond our control and we record changes in the fair value of our hedge portfolio in our income statement, it is our view that the measurement and monitoring of performance without fuel is important. In addition, we believe the disclosure of financial performance without impairment and restructuring charges is useful to investors. Finally, these non-GAAP financial measures are also more comparable to financial measures reported to the Department of Transportation by other major network airlines.
The following tables reconcile our non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for both Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Horizon Air Industries, Inc.:

Air Group Net Income (Loss) and EPS Reconciliation:
The following table summarizes Alaska Air Group, Inc.'s net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share during 2006 and 2005 excluding the cumulative effect of the accounting change, mark-to-market hedging gains (losses) net of related reclassifications, impairment of aircraft, and restructuring charges and adjustments, as reported in accordance with GAAP (in millions except per share amounts):
 
 
In order to reconcile the diluted loss per share to the GAAP loss per share for the six months ended June 30, 2005, the table above includes $0.19 per share, which represents the impact of the additional shares that were used in the GAAP loss per share as well as $2.5 million of interest, net of tax, on the contingently convertible senior notes, that were outstanding at the time, added back to earnings in order to derive the loss per share in accordance with GAAP.
The per share impact of the change in accounting, mark-to-market gain on fuel hedges, restructuring and impairment charges have been presented in the table above assuming 33.3 million fully diluted shares outstanding.
 
The following table summarizes Alaska Air Group, Inc.'s basic and diluted per share calculations for income (loss) before the accounting change and net income (loss) (in millions except per share amounts):
 
 
Forecasted Financial Measures
During our quarterly earnings conference call, we expect to discuss forward-looking forecasted unit cost information for the remainder of 2006. This forecasted unit cost information includes non-GAAP unit cost estimates which are summarized in the following table together with the most directly comparable GAAP unit cost for both Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Horizon Air Industries, Inc.:
 
: Our forecast of fuel costs is based on anticipated gallons consumed and estimated fuel cost per gallon. The estimate also includes the expected benefit from settled hedges. Given the volatility of fuel prices and the mark-to-market adjustments on our fuel hedge portfolio, readers should be cautioned that actual fuel expense will likely differ from the forecast above.
Note 1
: The Company has excluded from the forecast of GAAP operating cost per available seat mile any impact resulting from the possible buyout of five MD-80 aircraft leases and the restructuring charges that will result from the severance package offered as part of the recently ratified contract with Alaska employees represented by the IAM. These items are further discussed in the 8-K filed today.

FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION
This report contains forward-looking statements subject to the safe harbor protection provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements relate to future events and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual outcomes to be materially different from those indicated by any forward-looking statements. Some of the things that could cause our actual results to differ from our expectations are: the competitive environment and other trends in our industry; changes in our operating costs including fuel, which can be volatile; our ability to meet our cost reduction goals; our inability to achieve or maintain profitability and fluctuations in our quarterly results; our significant indebtedness; our inability to secure new aircraft financing; the implementation of our growth strategy; the timing of the MD-80 fleet disposal, the market value of MD-80 aircraft, and the amounts of potential lease termination payments with lessors and sublease payments from sublessees; compliance with our financial covenants; potential downgrades of our credit ratings and the availability of financing; the concentration of our revenue from a few key markets; general economic conditions, as well as economic conditions in the geographic regions we serve; actual or threatened terrorist attacks; global instability and potential U.S. military actions or activities; insurance costs; labor disputes; our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; an aircraft accident or incident; liability and other claims asserted against us; operational disruptions; increases in government fees and taxes; changes in laws and regulations; our reliance on automated systems; and our reliance on third-party vendors and partners. For a discussion of these and other risk factors, see Item 1A of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005. All of the forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the risk factors discussed therein. These risk factors may not be exhaustive. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risk factors emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict such new risk factors, nor can it assess the impact, if any, of such new risk factors on our business or events described in any forward-looking statements. We disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date of this report to conform them to actual results. Over time, our actual results, performance or achievements will likely differ from the anticipated results; performance or achievements that are expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements, and such differences might be significant and materially adverse.
 
Pursuant to 17 CFR Part 243 ("Regulation FD"), the Company is submitting information relating to its financial and operational outlook for 2006. This report includes information regarding forecasts of available seat miles (ASMs), cost per available seat mile (CASM) excluding fuel consumption, as well as certain actual results for revenue passenger miles (RPMs), load factor and revenue per available seat mile (RASM), for its subsidiaries Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Horizon Air. Our disclosure of operating cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel and other noted items, provides us the ability to measure and monitor our performance without these items. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is total operating expense per available seat mile. However, due to the large fluctuations in fuel prices, we are unable to predict total operating expense for any future period with any degree of certainty. In addition, we believe the disclosure of financial performance without mark-to-market hedging gains and losses is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. Please see the cautionary statement under "Forward-Looking Information."
In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the following information shall not be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), nor shall such information be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing. This Report will not be deemed an admission as to the materiality of any information required to be disclosed solely to satisfy the requirements of Regulation FD.
References in this report on Form 8-K to "Air Group," "Company," "we," "us," and "our" refer to Alaska Air Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise specified. Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Horizon Air Industries, Inc. are referred to as "Alaska" and "Horizon," respectively, and together as our "airlines."
 
Third Quarter 2006
In July 2006, Alaska entered into purchase and sale agreements to buyout five of its nine long-term MD-80 aircraft leases as a part of its fleet transition plan. These agreements are expected to close during the third quarter of 2006. As a result, the Company is expecting to record a charge of approximately $65 million in the third quarter, although the actual charge is not yet known with certainty and could differ from this forecast.
Alaska recently reached a new four-year agreement with the approximately 3,700 clerical, office and passenger service employees and the ramp service agents and stock clerks, all represented by the International Association of Machinists. Based on this agreement, Alaska offered a voluntary severance package to employees in the top four wage-scale steps that includes cash payments based on years of service, one year of medical coverage after the severance date, and continued travel benefits for a period of time. The number of employees accepting the severance package will not be known until September 2006. However, for purposes of the forecast we assumed if one quarter of the approximately 1,400 eligible employees accept the offer, the charge would be approximately $20 million.
The unit cost impact of the above charges is summarized in the forecast below.
 
NM = Not meaningful
Our forecast of ASM growth for the fourth quarter of 2006 has been lowered from 6% to 4% to reflect certain changes to our schedule expected late in the year.
Alaska's July traffic increased 7.3% to 1.752 billion RPMs from 1.633 billion flown a year earlier. Capacity during July was 2.116 billion ASMs, 6.6% higher than the 1.986 billion in July 2005. The passenger load factor (the percentage of available seats occupied by fare-paying passengers) for the month was 82.8%, compared to 82.2% in July 2005. The airline carried 1,674,300 passengers compared to 1,633,500 in July 2005.
In July 2006, RASM increased 6.6% compared to July 2005 primarily due to increased yields.
 
 
Horizon's July traffic increased 4.8% to 249.0 million RPMs from 237.7 million flown a year earlier. Capacity for June was 318.8 million ASMs, 2.9% higher than the 309.8 million in July 2005. The passenger load factor for the month was 78.1%, compared to 76.7% in July 2005. The airline carried 627,300 passengers compared to 610,200 in July 2005.
In July 2006, overall RASM increased by 10.5% compared to July 2005 due primarily to a nearly 12% increase in RASM for native network flying resulting from higher load factors and increasing yields. RASM for the Frontier contract flying decreased by 2.6% from July 2005 due primarily to increases in utilization and capacity that slightly outpaced revenue gains. The allocation of Horizon's ASMs is summarized as follows:
 
 
 
Other Financial Information
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash and short-term investments totaled approximately $1.1 billion as of July 31, 2006.
Fuel Hedging
We are providing unaudited information about fuel price movements and the impact of our hedging program on our financial results. Management believes it is useful to compare results between periods that exclude the mark-to-market hedging gains/losses recorded on a GAAP basis and include the cash received or due on hedge positions settled during the period (although the related impact may have been recognized for financial reporting purposes in a prior period). We refer to this as the comparison of "economic fuel cost", which is presented below for July 2006.
Calculation of Economic Fuel Cost Per Gallon
 
 
 
Alaska Air Group's future hedge positions are as follows:
 
Operating Fleet Plan
The following table provides a fleet summary for Alaska and Horizon for actual airplanes on hand as of the date of this report.
 
 
The following table summarizes firm aircraft commitments for Alaska (B737-800) and Horizon (Q400) by year, excluding aircraft that have already been delivered in 2006:
 
 
In addition to the firm orders noted above, Alaska has options to acquire 28 additional B737-800s and purchase rights for 27 more. The company expects to exercise additional options and purchase rights on B737-800 order in the future as a result of acceleration of the retirement of its MD-80 fleet. Horizon has options to acquire 19 Q400s and 15 CRJ700s.
Giving consideration to the fleet transition plan discussed above, the following table displays the currently anticipated fleet count for Alaska as of December 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008:

On September 14, 2006, the Alaska Air Group Board of Directors voted to amend the Company's Performance Based Pay Plan to allow for payouts under the plan to be denominated in shares of the Company's Common Stock and in performance shares. Such payouts will be made at the discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Alaska Air Group Board of Directors. A copy of the amended Performance Based Pay plan is attached as Exhibit 10.1.
Earlier, on September 13, 2006, the Compensation Committee voted, subject to approval by the Alaska Air Group Board of Directors, to denominate any payout earned by Mr. William Ayer pursuant to the 2006 Performance Based Pay plan in Common Stock of Alaska Air Group.
 
 
 
Signatures
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 10.1
The Board of Directors (the "Board") of Alaska Air Group, Inc. (the "Company") has adopted a plan to reward employees of Alaska Airlines, Inc. ("Alaska") and Horizon Air Industries, Inc. ("Horizon"). The plan, formerly known as the Management Incentive Plan, has been renamed as the Performance Based Pay Plan ("Plan"). This memorandum is provided to explain the key elements of how the Plan will operate. The Performance Based Pay award ("Award") of each eligible Participant will depend upon the degree to which the Company achieves the performance goals set by the Compensation Committee of the Board for each calendar year (a "Plan Year") and the discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Board and Chief Executive Officer explained below. This Plan is effective beginning with the 2003 Plan Year and each year thereafter until amended, restated or terminated, pursuant to paragraph 8.
 
Eligibility to participate in the Plan during a Plan Year is limited to officers and other employees of Alaska and Horizon who (a) are designated by the Compensation Committee, and (b) are full-time employees of Alaska or Horizon as of the first day of January immediately following the end of the Plan Year, or (c) were full-time employees during the Plan Year and do not meet the requirement of (b) because their employment ended due to retirement at age 52 or older, disability or death (each a "Participant," or collectively "Participants"). Individuals may become Participants during the Plan Year if they are newly hired or promoted during the year and meet the requirements of the preceding sentence. Participants who are on temporary medical leave, military leave, or otherwise not working either full-time or part-time for Alaska or Horizon for reasons approved by the Board, but who remain employed, also retain eligibility as Participants. Participation in the Plan does not guarantee that any Award will be paid if applicable performance goals specified for the Plan Year are not achieved for the year. Unless otherwise provided for in a separate Award agreement, an individual whose employment with Alaska or Horizon ends for any reason not described in (c) above, such as resignation or termination, forfeits eligibility upon such end of employment.
 
A Participant's Basis for a Plan Year is used to determine the dollar amount or initial target value of the Participant's Award for that year. The "Basis" is the actual Basic Salary of the Participant earned during the Plan Year multiplied by the percentage selected for that Participant by the Board. "Basic Salary" means the compensation earned by the Participant for services performed for Alaska or Horizon, amounts that the Participant could have received in cash had the Participant not elected to contribute the amount to an employee benefit plan maintained by Alaska, Horizon or the Company and any other voluntary payment the Participant makes which reduces his/her compensation (such as the Participant's voluntary contribution to an Internal Revenue Code ("Code") Section 401(k) Plan, Code Section 125 medical account, dependent day care spending account, or charitable gift), but commissions, all awards (including any Award under this Plan), and all other forms of incentive or other supplemental pay, employee benefits paid by the employer (such as employer contributions to a Code Section 401(k) Plan), cash and non-cash fringe benefits and perquisites (such as auto allowance and travel reimbursement). Awards may be paid in cash or by act of the Compensation Committee of the
including
excluding
Board, the Company's Common Stock. Alternatively, Awards may, by act of the Compensation Committee of the Board, be denominated in shares of the Company's Common Stock that are subject to conditions and restrictions established by the Compensation Committee and based on the achievement of performance goals as provided for in a Performance Share Award Agreement (such shares of Common Stock are referred to as "Performance Shares").
 
The size of the Award earned for a Plan Year will depend upon the extent to which the performance goals of the Company have been achieved during that Plan Year and the discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Board. Separate performance weighting has been established for each performance goal. The Award will equal either (i) in the case of cash-based Awards, the dollar amount achieved by multiplying the Participant's Basis by the sum of the weighted percentage achievement factors, or (ii) in the case of Common Stock Based Awards, the number of shares which is equal to the cash award under the preceding clause (i) divided by the closing price of the Company's Stock on the NYSE on the date of such Award, or (iii) in the case of Awards denominated in Performance Shares, the actual number of shares of Common Stock earned by the Participant will be determined based on the achievement of performance goals as described in the applicable Performance Share Award Agreement, in each case, as such amounts may be adjusted in the Compensation Committee's discretion pursuant to paragraph 6 or pursuant to the terms of an applicable Performance Share Award Agreement. All calculations will be performed by the Employee Services Department of Alaska and will be subject to approval solely by the Board. Once approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board, such calculations shall be conclusively presumed to be accurate.
 
In order to achieve any Award for a particular performance goal, a "Threshold" must be achieved. A full entitlement is achieved when the "Target" is reached, and a double entitlement is possible if the "Maximum" is achieved. This weighting applies to each goal individually. Once the Threshold is achieved, the percentage of the difference between the Threshold and Target achieved is multiplied by the weighting factor as specified in the attachment for the applicable Plan Year. If the Target is exceeded, the percentage of the difference between the Target and the Maximum achieved is multiplied by the weighting factor as specified in the attachment for the applicable Plan Year. Since the difference between the Threshold and Target is, in most cases, arithmetically different from the difference between the Target and the Maximum, calculations will be performed utilizing either the Threshold-Target range, or Target-Maximum range, as applicable, to locate the percentage of the Target, or the percentage of the Maximum, as applicable, that has been achieved. Additional performance weighting criteria and the methodology for determining the number of shares issued to a Participant pursuant to an Award of Performance Shares may be set forth or described in an applicable Performance Share Award Agreement.
 
The Compensation Committee of the Board will establish the performance goals for each Plan Year during the life of this Plan, and will provide an annex to this Plan that outlines goals and the weighting factors. Each such attachment will be labeled "Performance Based Pay Plan Goals and Measures for (year)" and distributed to Eligible Participants.
 
In the case of a Participant described in paragraph 1(c) who retired due to age, terminated employment due to disability, or died during the year, or a Participant who took a leave of absence or worked a reduced schedule during any portion of the year, the Compensation Committee of the Board retains absolute discretionary authority to adjust the Award to such Participant based upon the Compensation Committee's determination of such Participant's contribution to the Company.
 
After approval of the Audit Committee of the Board, it is the intent of the Board to distribute the Award, or actual shares of the Company's Common Stock for Awards denominated in Performance Shares, for a Plan Year no later than March 15 of the following year for each Plan Year that Participants have become entitled to an Award. The terms and conditions of an Award denominated in Performance Shares will be set forth in a Performance Share Award Agreement with a Participant. A deceased Participant's Award will be paid, or shares of the Company's Common Stock underlying an Award denominated in Performance Shares will be distributed, to the beneficiary designated by the Participant for purposes of the Company's group term life insurance plan covering the deceased Participant, and in the absence of any designation, will be paid or distributed to the Participant's estate.
 
The Board, acting through the Compensation Committee, retains the right to modify the Plan at any time in any manner that it deems appropriate, provided that (a) no amendment that adversely affects the rights of Participants or their beneficiaries shall be effective for a Plan Year that ended prior to the Plan Year in which the amendment was adopted, and (b) it will not terminate the Plan for any Plan Year during that Plan Year unless it is clear that Participants will not receive an Award for that Plan Year. It is understood that the Compensation Committee of the Board will review the Plan yearly and may make changes to the Plan for the next Plan Year.

FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION
This report contains forward-looking statements subject to the safe harbor protection provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements relate to future events and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual outcomes to be materially different from those indicated by any forward-looking statements. Some of the things that could cause our actual results to differ from our expectations are: the competitive environment and other trends in our industry; changes in our operating costs including fuel, which can be volatile; our ability to meet our cost reduction goals; our inability to achieve or maintain profitability and fluctuations in our quarterly results; our significant indebtedness; our inability to secure new aircraft financing; the implementation of our growth strategy; the timing of the MD-80 fleet disposal, the market value of MD-80 aircraft, and the amounts of potential lease termination payments with lessors and sublease payments from sublessees; compliance with our financial covenants; potential downgrades of our credit ratings and the availability of financing; the concentration of our revenue from a few key markets; general economic conditions, as well as economic conditions in the geographic regions we serve; actual or threatened terrorist attacks; global instability and potential U.S. military actions or activities; insurance costs; labor disputes; our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; an aircraft accident or incident; liability and other claims asserted against us; operational disruptions; increases in government fees and taxes; changes in laws and regulations; our reliance on automated systems; and our reliance on third-party vendors and partners. For a discussion of these and other risk factors, see Item 1A of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005. All of the forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the risk factors discussed therein. These risk factors may not be exhaustive. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risk factors emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict such new risk factors, nor can it assess the impact, if any, of such new risk factors on our business or events described in any forward-looking statements. We disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date of this report to conform them to actual results. Over time, our actual results, performance or achievements will likely differ from the anticipated results; performance or achievements that are expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements, and such differences might be significant and materially adverse.
ITEM 7.01. Regulation FD Disclosure
Pursuant to 17 CFR Part 243 ("Regulation FD"), the Company is submitting information relating to its financial and operational outlook for 2006. This report includes information regarding forecasts of available seat miles (ASMs), cost per available seat mile (CASM) excluding fuel consumption, as well as certain actual results for revenue passenger miles (RPMs), load factor and revenue per available seat mile (RASM), for its subsidiaries Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Horizon Air. Our disclosure of operating cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel and other noted items, provides us the ability to measure and monitor our performance without these items. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is total operating expense per available seat mile. However, due to the large fluctuations in fuel prices, we are unable to predict total operating expense for any future period with any degree of certainty. In addition, we believe the disclosure of financial performance without mark-to-market hedging gains and losses is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. Please see the cautionary statement under "Forward-Looking Information."
In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the following information shall not be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), nor shall such information be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing. This Report will not be deemed an admission as to the materiality of any information required to be disclosed solely to satisfy the requirements of Regulation FD.
References in this report on Form 8-K to "Air Group," "Company," "we," "us," and "our" refer to Alaska Air Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise specified. Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Horizon Air Industries, Inc. are referred to as "Alaska" and "Horizon," respectively, and together as our "airlines."
 
Third Quarter 2006
Alaska Airlines
The Company recently purchased five of its previously leased MD-80 aircraft as a part of its fleet transaction plan. As a result of these transactions, we expect to record a pretax charge of approximately $55-60 million in the third quarter, slightly lower than the forecast of $65 million reported in previous filings.
Also, in connection with the fleet transition plan, the Company signed a letter of intent with a third party to purchase 20 MD-80 aircraft from the Company. The majority of these transactions are expected to close during the fourth quarter of 2006.
In addition, the Company expects to record a charge related to a voluntary severance package contained in the recently ratified four-year agreement with clerical, office and passenger service employees (COPS), and the ramp service and store agents (RSSA), all represented by the International Association of Machinists (IAM). Based on the most recently available information, we expect roughly 475 employees to participate in the program resulting in a pretax charge of approximately $20 million, consistent with the amount previously reported.
The unit-cost impact of the above charges is summarized in the forecast below.
 
NM = Not meaningful
Alaska's August traffic increased 4.8% to 1.719 billion RPMs from 1.640 billion flown a year earlier. Capacity during August was 2.127 billion ASMs, 6.1% higher than the 2.005 billion in August 2005. The passenger load factor (the percentage of available seats occupied by fare-paying passengers) for the month was 80.8%, compared to 81.8% in August 2005. The airline carried 1,669,800 passengers compared to 1,655,300 in August 2005.
 
In August 2006, Passenger RASM increased 5.6% compared August 2005. However, total RASM increased 3.5% because of lower Mileage Plan revenues.
In July 2006, RASM increased 6.6% compared to July 2005 primarily due to increased yields.
 
Horizon Air
 
Horizon's August traffic increased 7.7% to 254.6 million RPMs from 236.3 million flown a year earlier. Capacity for August was 330.6 million ASMs, 6.6% higher than the 310.0 million in August 2005. The passenger load factor for the month was 77.0%, compared to 76.2% in August 2005. The airline carried 638,400 passengers compared to 608,500 in August 2005.
In August 2006, overall RASM increased by 10.2% compared to August 2005 due to significant increase in RASM for native network flying resulting from higher load factors and increasing yields. RASM for the Frontier contract flying increased by 4.2% from August 2005 due to revenue gains tied to contractual rate increases. The allocation of Horizon's ASMs is summarized as follows:
 
In July 2006, overall RASM increased by 10.5% compared to July 2005.
 
 
Other Financial Information
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash and short-term investments totaled approximately $1.06 billion as of August 31, 2006.
Fuel Hedging
We are providing unaudited information about fuel price movements and the impact of our hedging program on our financial results. Management believes it is useful to compare results between periods that exclude the mark-to-market hedging gains/losses recorded on a GAAP basis and include the cash received or due on hedge positions settled during the period (although the related impact may have been recognized for financial reporting purposes in a prior period). We refer to this as the comparison of "economic fuel cost", which is presented below for July and August 2006.
Calculation of Economic Fuel Cost Per Gallon
 
 
 
The Company resumed its fuel hedging activity in the third quarter. The majority of the Company's hedge instruments, including recent additions, are call options, which allow the Company to benefit if fuel prices decline. Alaska Air Group's future hedge positions are as follows:
 
Operating Fleet Plan
The following table provides a fleet summary for Alaska and Horizon for actual airplanes on hand as of the date of this report.
 
 
The following table summarizes firm aircraft commitments for Alaska (B737-800) and Horizon (Q400) by year, excluding aircraft that have already been delivered in 2006:
 
 
In addition to the firm orders noted above, Alaska has options to acquire 28 additional B737-800s and purchase rights for 27 more. The company expects to exercise additional options and purchase rights on B737-800 order in the future as a result of acceleration of the retirement of its MD-80 fleet. Horizon has options to acquire 19 Q400s and 15 CRJ700s.
Giving consideration to the current fleet transition plan, the following table displays the currently anticipated fleet count for Alaska as of December 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008:
 
 
 
ITEM 8.01. Other Events
On September 20, 2006, Horizon announced plans to amend its 12-year contract with Frontier Airlines. Horizon, which has been operating nine CRJ-700 regional jets (RJs) as Frontier JetExpress since January 2004, will begin returning its 70-seat aircraft to current and new routes throughout Horizon's West Coast network as the two airlines conclude the contract. The details of the return timeline are still in negotiation as both airlines work to ensure a mutually beneficial schedule.

Third Quarter 2006
Alaska Airlines
The Company recently bought out five of its nine long-term MD-80 aircraft leases and acquired the underlying aircraft as part of its fleet transition plan. As a result of these transactions, we expect to record a pretax charge of approximately $55-60 million in the third quarter.
In addition, the Company will also record a charge related to a voluntary severance package contained in the recently ratified four-year agreement with clerical, office and passenger service employees (COPS), and the ramp service and store agents (RSSA), all represented by the International Association of Machinists (IAM). Based on the most recently available information, we expect about 485 employees to participate in the program resulting in a pretax charge of approximately $30 million. This amount is higher than the $20 million previously disclosed primarily due to more recent information about the average payout per employee determined once the final list of affected employees was tallied.
The unit-cost impact of the above charges is summarized in the forecast below.
 
NM = Not meaningful
Alaska's September traffic increased 5.9% to 1.403 billion RPMs from 1.325 billion flown a year earlier. Capacity during September was 1.907 billion ASMs, 4.2% higher than the 1.831 billion in September 2005. The passenger load factor (the percentage of available seats occupied by fare-paying passengers) for the month was 73.6%, compared to 72.4% in September 2005. The airline carried 1,365,700 passengers compared to 1,343,400 in September 2005.
In August 2006, passenger RASM increased 5.6% compared to August 2005. However, total RASM increased 3.5% because of lower Mileage Plan revenues. In July 2006, RASM increased 6.6% compared to July 2005 primarily due to increased yields.
 
 
Horizon Air
 
Horizon's forecast cost per ASM excluding fuel increased to 13.9 cents from 13.7 cents in our prior forecast due to the accrual of an unexpected tax contingency which the company plans to appeal.
Horizon's September traffic increased 4.6% to 218.6 million RPMs from 208.9 million flown a year earlier. Capacity for September was 301.6 million ASMs, 3.8% higher than the 290.6 million in September 2005. The passenger load factor for the month was 72.5%, compared to 71.9% in September 2005. The airline carried 567,400 passengers compared to 536,000 in September 2005.
In August 2006, overall RASM increased by 10.2% compared to August 2005 due to significant increase in RASM for native network flying resulting from higher load factors and increasing yields. RASM for the Frontier contract flying increased by 4.2% from August 2005 due to revenue gains tied to contractual rate increases. The allocation of Horizon's ASMs is summarized as follows:
 
In July 2006, overall RASM increased by 10.5% compared to July 2005.

We refer to this as the comparison of "economic fuel cost," which is presented below for July and August 2006.
Calculation of Economic Fuel Cost Per Gallon
 
 
For Alaska and Horizon, economic fuel expense per gallon for the quarter is expected to be approximately $2.08 and $2.05, respectively. September mark-to-market losses (as defined in the table above) are expected to be approximately $36 million for the combined Air Group, bringing the total losses for the quarter to approximately $65 million.
 
The company resumed its fuel hedging activity in the third quarter. The majority of the Company's hedge instruments, including recent additions, are call options, which allow the Company to benefit if fuel prices decline. Alaska Air Group's future hedge positions are as follows:

All of the forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the risk factors discussed therein. These risk factors may not be exhaustive. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risk factors emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict such new risk factors, nor can it assess the impact, if any, of such new risk factors on our business or events described in any forward-looking statements. We disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date of this report to conform them to actual results.

Pursuant to 17 CFR Part 243 ("Regulation FD"), the Company is submitting information relating to its financial and operational outlook for the third quarter of 2006. This report includes information regarding forecasts of available seat miles (ASMs), cost per available seat mile (CASM) excluding fuel consumption, as well as certain actual results for revenue passenger miles (RPMs), load factor and revenue per available seat mile (RASM), for its subsidiaries Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Horizon Air. Our disclosure of operating cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel and other noted items, provides us the ability to measure and monitor our performance without these items. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is total operating expense per available seat mile. However, due to the large fluctuations in fuel prices, we are unable to predict total operating expense for any future period with any degree of certainty. In addition, we believe the disclosure of financial performance without mark-to-market hedging gains and losses is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. Please see the cautionary statement under "Forward-Looking Information."
In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the following information shall not be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), nor shall such information be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing. This Report will not be deemed an admission as to the materiality of any information required to be disclosed solely to satisfy the requirements of Regulation FD.
 
Third Quarter 2006
Alaska Airlines
 
NM = Not meaningful
 
Alaska's September traffic increased 5.9% to 1.403 billion RPMs from 1.325 billion flown a year earlier. Capacity during September was 1.907 billion ASMs, 4.2% higher than the 1.831 billion in September 2005. The passenger load factor (the percentage of available seats occupied by fare-paying passengers) for the month was 73.6%, compared to 72.4% in September 2005. The airline carried 1,365,700 passengers compared to 1,343,400 in September 2005.
Alaska expects September Revenue per ASM (RASM) to increase 2.3% over the prior year. The RASM increase resulted from the 1.2 point increase in load factor noted above combined with a 1.4% increase in ticket yields. While Alaska's RASM performance represents a year-over-year increase, that increase is lower than in recent months.
 
Horizon Air
 
 
Horizon's September traffic increased 4.6% to 218.5 million RPMs from 208.9 million flown a year earlier. Capacity for September was 301.6 million ASMs, 3.8% higher than the 290.6 million in September 2005. The passenger load factor for the month was 72.4%, compared to 71.9% in September 2005. The airline carried 567,200 passengers compared to 536,000 in September 2005.
Horizon expects September RASM to be 8.8% higher than last year primarily due to higher ticket yields. Like Alaska, RASM growth for September is lower than in recent months.
 
Air Group
Our effective tax rate is highly dependent on the expected level of pretax income or loss for the year and the magnitude of any non-deductible expenses in relation to that pretax amount and may change materially from quarter to quarter. Because of the MD-80 transition costs, restructuring charges, and mark-to-market losses on our fuel hedge portfolio, we expect to report a loss under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) for both the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2006. We expect the tax benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2006 to be approximately 35%, excluding the benefit of the previously disclosed $5.5 million reduction of certain tax contingency accruals recorded in the first six months of 2006.
In addition to the results calculated in accordance with GAAP, we normally present our results excluding items such as restructuring and fleet transition costs, as well as mark-to-market adjustments to our fuel hedge portfolio in excess of settled hedge gains. For presentation purposes, those items are tax-effected at our composite tax rate of approximately 37.5%. As a result of this presentation convention, we expect the effective tax rate on earnings excluding those items to be approximately 39% to 40% for the third quarter.

ITEM 2.02. Results of Operations And Financial Condition
Alaska Air Group, Inc. today issued a press release reporting financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2006. The press release is filed as Exhibit 99.1.
ITEM 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
SEATTLE  Alaska Air Group, Inc. (NYSE:ALK) today reported a third quarter net loss of $17.4 million, or $0.44 per diluted share, compared to net income of $90.2 million, or $2.71 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2005. The 2006 results include charges related to the buyout of five MD-80 leases and a voluntary severance program in connection with a new labor contract, as well as mark-to-market fuel hedging losses related to contracts that settle in future quarters and the reclassification of previously recorded mark-to-market gains on hedges that settled during the quarter. The 2005 results included mark-to-market fuel hedging gains, a refund of Mexico navigation fees and a nominal adjustment to previously recorded restructuring charges. Excluding the impact of these items, the company would have reported net income in the third quarter of 2006 of $77.9 million, or $1.93 per diluted share, compared to $71.5 million, or $2.16 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2005.
"The quarter's adjusted net profit reflects the hard work of employees across our system and the progress we are making on our plan," said CEO Bill Ayer. "However, slower unit revenue growth toward the end of the quarter underscores the need to continue to reduce costs and improve processes in order to offer our customers a product they prefer at a price they are willing to pay."
In previous quarters, Alaska Air Group excluded from adjusted earnings its mark-to-market fuel hedging gains related to contracts that settle in future quarters. Consistent with that practice, the company excluded from the current quarter's adjusted results the mark-to-market fuel hedging losses that settle in future quarters. While the recent decline in fuel prices has caused the value of the portfolio to decline, it is still in the money. The fuel-hedging program saved the company approximately $27.4 million in economic fuel expense during the third quarter.
During the quarter, the company accrued an additional $1.7 million for Horizon Air employees and $3.3 million for Alaska Airlines employees in connection with various gain-sharing plans, for a year-to-date total accrual of approximately $24 million.
 
In addition, Alaska Airlines contributed $72 million to its defined benefit plans during 2006, and $265 million since September 11, 2001.
Alaska Airlines' passenger traffic in the third quarter increased 6.0 percent on a capacity increase of 5.6 percent. Alaska's load factor increased 0.2 percentage points to 79.2 percent, compared to the same period in 2005. Alaska's operating revenue per available seat mile (ASM) increased 4.4 percent, while its operating cost per ASM excluding fuel, and the items noted above decreased 2.7 percent. Alaska's pretax loss for the quarter was $27.9 million, compared to pretax income of $133.0 million in 2005. Again, excluding the items noted above, Alaska would have reported pretax income of $115.3 million for the quarter, compared to $106.0 million in the third quarter of 2005.
Horizon Air's passenger traffic in the third quarter increased 5.7 percent on a 4.4 percent capacity increase. Horizon's load factor increased by 0.9 percentage points to 75.9 percent, compared to the same period in 2005. Horizon's operating revenue per ASM increased 9.9 percent, and its operating cost per ASM excluding fuel increased 8.4 percent. Horizon's pretax income for the quarter was $5.9 million, compared to $17.3 million in 2005. Excluding the mark-to-market fuel hedge adjustments, Horizon's pretax income would have been $15.1 million for the quarter, compared to $14.4 million in the third quarter of 2005.
Alaska Air Group had cash and short-term investments at September 30, 2006, of approximately $1.1 billion compared to $983 million at December 31, 2005. The company's debt-to-capital ratio, assuming aircraft operating leases are capitalized at seven times annualized rent, was 69 percent as of September 30, 2006, compared to 73 percent as of December 31, 2005. The decrease from December 31, 2005 is primarily due to the conversion to equity of our senior convertible notes in April 2006, offset by the $41.0 million net loss for the nine months and an increase in our outstanding debt resulting from new aircraft financings.
A summary of financial and statistical data for Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air, as well as a reconciliation of the reported non-GAAP financial measures, can be found on pages 6 through 10.
A conference call regarding the third quarter 2006 results will be simulcast via the Internet at 8:30 a.m. Pacific Time on October 24, 2006. It can be accessed through the company's website at . For those unable to listen to the live broadcast, a replay will be available after the conclusion of the call at .

Note A:
Pursuant to Item 10 of Regulation S-K, we are providing disclosure of the reconciliation of reported non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable financial measures reported on a GAAP basis. The non-GAAP financial measures provide management the ability to measure and monitor performance both with and without the cost of aircraft fuel (including the gains and losses associated with our fuel hedging program where appropriate), fleet transition costs, and restructuring charges and adjustments. Because the cost and availability of aircraft fuel are subject to many economic and political factors beyond our control and we record changes in the fair value of our hedge portfolio in our income statement, it is our view that the measurement and monitoring of performance without fuel is important. In addition, we believe the disclosure of financial performance without fleet transition costs, restructuring charges, and the navigation fee refund is useful to investors. Finally, these non-GAAP financial measures are also more comparable to financial measures reported to the Department of Transportation by other major network airlines.
The following tables reconcile our non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for both Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Horizon Air Industries, Inc.:

Air Group Net Income (Loss) and EPS Reconciliation:
The following table summarizes Alaska Air Group, Inc.'s net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share during 2006 and 2005 excluding the cumulative effect of the accounting change, mark-to-market hedging gains (losses) and related reclassifications, fleet transition costs, the navigation refund, and restructuring charges and adjustments, as reported in accordance with GAAP (in millions except per share amounts):
 
 
In order to reconcile the diluted earnings per share on an adjusted basis to the GAAP loss per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2006, the table above includes $0.02 per share and $0.24 per share, respectively, which represents the impact of the additional shares that were used in the adjusted diluted earnings per share. Additionally, $1.6 million of interest, net of tax, on the convertible senior notes that were outstanding during the first quarter of the year was added back to earnings for the three months ended September 30, 2006 in order to derive the diluted earnings per share on an adjusted basis.
The per share impact of the mark-to-market losses on fuel hedges, fleet transition costs, and restructuring and impairment charges have been presented in the table above using the basic shares outstanding of 40.0 million and 37.2 million fully diluted shares outstanding for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2006, respectively.
 
 
The following table summarizes Alaska Air Group, Inc.'s basic and diluted per share calculations for income (loss) before the accounting change and net income (loss) (in millions except per share amounts):
 
 
Forecasted Financial Measures
During our quarterly earnings conference call, we expect to discuss forward-looking forecasted unit cost information for the remainder of 2006. This forecasted unit cost information includes non-GAAP unit cost estimates which are summarized in the following table together with the most directly comparable GAAP unit cost for both Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Horizon Air Industries, Inc.:
 
: Our forecast of fuel cost is based on anticipated gallons consumed and estimated fuel cost per gallon. The estimate also includes the expected benefit from settled hedges, net of the reclassification of previously recognized mark-to-market hedge portfolio gains and losses. Given the volatility of fuel prices and the mark-to-market adjustments on our fuel hedge portfolio, readers should be cautioned that actual fuel expense could differ significantly from the forecast above.

Our disclosure of operating cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel and other noted items, provides us the ability to measure and monitor our performance without these items. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is total operating expense per available seat mile. However, due to the large fluctuations in fuel prices, we are unable to predict total operating expense for any future period with any degree of certainty.

Fourth Quarter 2006
Alaska Airlines
During the third quarter, Alaska recorded a pretax charge of $28.6 million related to a voluntary severance package offered to clerical, office and passenger service employees (COPS), and the ramp service and store agents (RSSA), all represented by the International Association of Machinists (IAM). Our charge was based on the number of eligible individuals who had given preliminary acceptance of the severance offer. In the fourth quarter, the company will record a favorable adjustment of approximately $7.5 million as a result of the decision by approximately 125 employees to withdraw their original election to participate in the program.
The unit-cost impact of the above adjustment is as follows:
 
 
Alaska's October traffic increased 5.9% to 1.374 billion RPMs from 1.298 billion flown a year earlier. Capacity for October was 1.919 billion ASMs, 4.2% higher than the 1.842 billion in October 2005. The passenger load factor (the percentage of available seats occupied by fare-paying passengers) for the month was 71.6%, compared to 70.5% in October 2005. The airline carried 1,333,300 passengers compared to 1,299,500 in October 2005.
In October 2006, RASM increased 5.2% compared to October 2005. However, RASM increased 3.2% because of lower Mileage Plan revenues, and flat freight and mail revenues.

Horizon Air
 
Horizon's October traffic increased 9.4% to 228.5 million RPMs from 208.9 million flown a year earlier. Capacity for October was 313.0 million ASMs, 8.1% higher than the 289.5 million in October 2005. The passenger load factor for the month was 73.0%, compared to 72.2% in October 2005. The airline carried 586,500 passengers compared to 537,900 in October 2005.
In October 2006, RASM increased 3.0% compared to October 2005 primarily due to increasing yields. RASM for the Frontier contract flying decreased 11.2% from October 2005. The allocation of Horizon's ASMs is summarized as follows:

Other Financial Information
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash and short-term investments totaled approximately $1.16 billion as of October 31, 2006.
Fuel Hedging
We are providing unaudited information about fuel price movements and the impact of our hedging program on our financial results. Management believes it is useful to compare results between periods that exclude the mark-to-market hedging gains/losses recorded on a GAAP basis and include the cash received or due on hedge positions settled during the period (although the related impact may have been recognized for financial reporting purposes in a prior period). We refer to this as the comparison of "economic fuel cost", which is presented below for October 2006.
Calculation of Economic Fuel Cost Per Gallon
 
 
 
The majority of the Company's hedge instruments, including recent additions, are call options, which allow the Company to benefit if fuel prices decline. Alaska Air Group's future hedge positions are as follows:
 
Operating Fleet Plan
The following table provides a fleet summary for Alaska and Horizon for actual aircraft on hand as of the date of this report.
 
 
The following table summarizes firm aircraft commitments for Alaska (B737-800) and Horizon (Q400) by year, excluding aircraft that have already been delivered in 2006:
 
In addition to the firm orders noted above, Alaska has options to acquire 26 additional B737-800s and purchase rights for 27 more. The company expects to exercise additional options and purchase rights on B737-800 order in the future as a result of acceleration of the retirement of its MD-80 fleet. Horizon has options to acquire 19 Q400s and 15 CRJ700s.
Giving consideration to the current fleet transition plan, the following table displays the currently anticipated fleet count for Alaska as of December 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008:

ITEM 7.01.
Regulation FD Disclosure
Pursuant to 17 CFR Part 243 ("Regulation FD"), the Company is submitting information relating to its financial and operational outlook for 2006. This report includes information regarding forecasts of available seat miles (ASMs), cost per available seat mile (CASM) excluding fuel consumption, as well as certain actual results for revenue passenger miles (RPMs), load factor and revenue per available seat mile (RASM), for its subsidiaries Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Horizon Air. Our disclosure of operating cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel and other noted items, provides us the ability to measure and monitor our performance without these items. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is total operating expense per available seat mile. However, due to the large fluctuations in fuel prices, we are unable to predict total operating expense for any future period with any degree of certainty. In addition, we believe the disclosure of financial performance without mark-to-market hedging gains and losses is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. Please see the cautionary statement under "Forward-Looking Information."
In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the following information shall not be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), nor shall such information be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing. This Report will not be deemed an admission as to the materiality of any information required to be disclosed solely to satisfy the requirements of Regulation FD.
 
Alaska Airlines
In November 2006, Alaska Airlines made a voluntary contribution of $50 million in cash to four defined benefit pension plans covering 7,300 employees in its airport, dispatch, maintenance, management and pilot work groups. Combined with a $71.9 million voluntary contribution made early this year, the airline has strengthened its defined benefit pension plans by nearly $122 million in 2006.
During the third quarter, Alaska recorded a pretax charge of $28.6 million related to a voluntary severance package offered to clerical, office and passenger service employees (COPS), and the ramp service and stores agents (RSSA), all represented by the International Association of Machinists (IAM). Our charge was based on the number of eligible individuals who had given preliminary acceptance of the severance offer. In November, the Company recorded a favorable adjustment of $7.4 million pretax as a result of the decision by approximately 125 employees to withdraw their original election to participate in the program.
Our forecast for fourth quarter unit costs at Alaska, including the above adjustment, is as follows:
 
NM = Not meaningful
 
Our unit cost guidance has increased modestly because of a slight reduction in expected ASMs coupled with an increase in our estimate of maintenance costs, wages and benefits and passenger remuneration costs, largely associated with a recent wind storm in the Seattle and Portland areas.
Alaska's November traffic increased 2.5% to 1.400 billion RPMs from 1.366 billion flown a year earlier. Capacity for November was 1.879 billion ASMs, 3.5% higher than the 1.816 billion in November 2005. The passenger load factor (the percentage of available seats occupied by fare-paying passengers) for the month was 74.5%, compared to 75.2% in November 2005. The airline carried 1,360,800 passengers compared to 1,345,000 in November 2005.
 
Year-over-year RASM was up 7.1% in November 2006, reflecting a 4.9% increase in RASM coupled with an increase in Mileage Plan, freight and mail revenues compared to November 2005. The increase in RASM is mainly due to higher yields offset by a slight decline in load factor. In October 2006, RASM increased 5.2% compared to October 2005. However, RASM increased 3.2% because of lower Mileage Plan revenues, and flat freight and mail revenues.

Horizon Air
 
 
The increase in Horizon's unit cost guidance is attributable mainly to an increase in our forecast of maintenance costs.
Horizon's November traffic increased 4.4% to 215.4 million RPMs from 206.3 million flown a year earlier. Capacity for November was 291.9 million ASMs, 4.5% higher than the 279.2 million in November 2005. The passenger load factor for the month was 73.8%, compared to 73.9% in November 2005. The airline carried 548,500 passengers compared to 523,500 in November 2005.
Year-over-year RASM was up 7.4% in November. RASM from the Frontier contract flying increased 7.0% from November 2005 due to higher yields, offset by a decline in load factor. RASM from Native Network flying increased 6.0% primarily due to higher yields. The allocation of Horizon's ASMs is summarized as follows:

In October 2006, RASM increased 3.0% compared to October 2005 primarily due to increasing yields.

Fourth Quarter EPS forecast
While actual December revenue and expenses are not yet known and could vary significantly from our current expectations, we reiterate the guidance we first disclosed at an investor conference on December 7
th
that we expect our fourth quarter results, after adjusting for special items, to be approximately break-even.
Other Financial Information
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of November 30, 2006, Air Group cash and short-term investments totaled approximately $1.10 billion.
PDP Facility Payment
During November, Alaska made an additional principal payment on its pre-delivery payment facility of approximately $66 million.
Website Sales
In a press release dated December 18, 2006, we announced that alaskaair.com/horizonair.com passed $1 billion in sales for the first time in a single calendar year. This total does not include vacation sales which can also be booked through the website.
Fuel Hedging
We are providing unaudited information about fuel price movements and the impact of our hedging program on our financial results. Management believes it is useful to compare results between periods that exclude the mark-to-market hedging gains/losses recorded on a GAAP basis and include the cash received or due on hedge positions settled during the period (although the related impact may have been recognized for financial reporting purposes in a prior period). We refer to this as the comparison of "economic fuel cost," which is presented below in the aggregate for October and November 2006.
 
Calculation of Economic Fuel Cost Per Gallon
 
 
The majority of the Company's hedge instruments are call options, which allow the Company to benefit if fuel prices decline. Alaska Air Group's future hedge positions are as follows:
 
Operating Fleet Plan

Horizon Air
 
The following table summarizes firm aircraft commitments for Alaska (B737-800) and Horizon (Q400) by year. There are no more deliveries scheduled in 2006.
 
In addition to the firm orders noted above, Alaska has options to acquire 25 additional B737-800s and purchase rights for 27 more. The company expects to exercise additional options and purchase rights on B737-800 order in the future as a result of acceleration of the retirement of its MD-80 fleet. Horizon has options to acquire 19 Q400s and 15 CRJ700s.
Giving consideration to the current fleet transition plan, the following table displays the currently anticipated fleet count for Alaska as of December 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008:

The passenger load factor (the percentage of available seats occupied by fare-paying passengers) for the month was 75.1%, compared to 75.9% in December 2005. The airline carried 1,412,400 passengers compared to 1,398,900 in December 2005.
In November 2006, year-over-year RASM was up 7.1%, reflecting a 4.9% increase in RASM coupled with an increase in Mileage Plan, freight and mail revenues compared to November 2005. The increase in RASM is mainly due to higher yields offset by a slight decline in load factor.

ITEM 2.02.
Results of Operations And Financial Condition
Alaska Air Group, Inc. today issued a press release reporting financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2006. The press release is filed as Exhibit 99.1.
ITEM 9.01.
Financial Statements and Exhibits
(d) Exhibits.
Exhibit 99.1 Press Release dated January 25, 2007.
 
Signature
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
SEATTLE  Alaska Air Group, Inc. (NYSE:ALK) today reported a full-year net loss of $52.6 million, or $1.39 per share, compared to a net loss of $5.9 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, in 2005. The 2006 results include charges related to the transition to an all-Boeing 737 fleet at Alaska Airlines and for voluntary severance programs related to new labor contracts, as well as mark-to-market fuel hedging adjustments. The 2005 results similarly include mark-to-market fuel hedge adjustments, voluntary severance program charges, a refund of Mexico navigation fees, and the cumulative effect of a change in the company's maintenance accounting policy. Excluding the impact of these items, 2006 net income would have been $137.7 million, or $3.45 per diluted share, compared to $55.0 million, or $1.78 per share in 2005.
The company reported a fourth quarter net loss of $11.6 million, or $0.29 per share, compared to a net loss of $33.0 million, or $1.15 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2005. Similar to the items noted for the full year, both the 2006 and 2005 quarterly results include mark-to-market fuel hedge accounting adjustments and restructuring-related items. Excluding the impact of these items, the company would have reported a fourth quarter net loss of $3.4 million, or $0.08 per share in 2006, compared to net income of $0.6 million, or $0.02 per share in the fourth quarter of 2005.
"While unit revenue growth slowed somewhat during the fourth quarter, our full-year adjusted earnings show steady improvement over the last five years," said Bill Ayer, the company's chairman and chief executive officer. "This positive trend reflects the commitment of employees at Alaska and Horizon to achieve our customer, operational and financial goals. Alaska's transition by the end of 2008 to an all-737 fleet will further our efforts to reduce costs while delivering a compelling customer value."
Because they achieved a number of financial and operational goals, Air Group employees have earned $36.8 million of incentive pay. This is the highest incentive payout in the company's history. In addition, the marked improvement in operating cash flows allowed the company to contribute nearly $122 million to its defined benefit plans in 2006, bringing the funded percentage to nearly 80% based on the projected benefit obligation of the plans.
Alaska Airlines' passenger traffic in the fourth quarter increased 3.4 percent on a capacity increase of 3.6 percent. Alaska's load factor decreased 0.2 percentage points to 73.7 percent compared to the same period in 2005. Alaska's operating revenue per available seat mile (ASM) increased 3.9 percent and its operating costs per ASM excluding fuel and adjustments related to restructuring activities increased 2.0 percent. Alaska's pretax loss for the quarter was $12.1 million, compared to a pretax loss of $46.3 million in 2005. Excluding the restructuring adjustments and fuel hedging items referenced above, Alaska's pretax loss was $1.9 million for the quarter compared to pre-tax income of $0.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2005.
Horizon Air's passenger traffic in the fourth quarter increased 4.3 percent on a 5.2 percent capacity increase. Horizon's load factor decreased by 0.7 percentage points to 73.0 percent. Horizon's operating revenue per available seat mile (ASM) increased 7.1 percent and its operating costs per ASM excluding fuel increased 6.8 percent. Horizon's pretax loss for the quarter was $3.5 million, compared to a pretax loss of $6.6 million in 2005. Excluding the fuel-hedging adjustments referenced above, Horizon's pretax loss was $0.5 million for the quarter compared to pretax income of $0.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2005.
Alaska Air Group had cash and short-term investments at December 31, 2006, of approximately $1.0 billion compared to $983 million at December 31, 2005. The company's debt-to-capital ratio, assuming aircraft operating leases are capitalized at seven times annualized rent, improved to 72 percent as of December 31, 2006.
A summary of financial and statistical data for Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air, as well as a reconciliation of the reported non-GAAP financial measures, can be found on pages 6 through 10.
A conference call regarding the fourth quarter 2006 results will be simulcast via the Internet at 8:30 a.m. Pacific Time on January 25, 2007. It can be accessed through the company's website at . For those unable to listen to the live broadcast, a replay will be available after the conclusion of the call at .

Note A:
Pursuant to Item 10 of Regulation S-K, we are providing disclosure of the reconciliation of reported non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable financial measures reported on a GAAP basis. The non-GAAP financial measures provide management the ability to measure and monitor performance both with and without the cost of aircraft fuel (including the gains and losses associated with our fuel hedging program where appropriate), fleet transition costs, restructuring charges and adjustments, and a 2005 navigation fee refund. Because the cost and availability of aircraft fuel are subject to many economic and political factors beyond our control and we record changes in the fair value of our hedge portfolio in our income statement, it is our view that the measurement and monitoring of performance without fuel is important. In addition, we believe the disclosure of financial performance without fleet transition costs, restructuring charges, and the navigation fee refund is useful to investors. Finally, these non-GAAP financial measures are also more comparable to financial measures reported to the Department of Transportation by other major network airlines.
The following tables reconcile our non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for both Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Horizon Air Industries, Inc.:

Air Group Net Income (Loss) and EPS Reconciliation:
The following table summarizes Alaska Air Group, Inc.'s net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share during 2006 and 2005 excluding the cumulative effect of the accounting change, mark-to-market hedging gains (losses) and related reclassifications, fleet transition costs, restructuring charges and adjustments, and the 2005 navigation refund, as reported in accordance with GAAP (in millions except per share amounts):
 
 
 
In order to reconcile the diluted earnings per share on an adjusted basis to the GAAP loss per share for twelve months ended December 31, 2006, the table above includes $0.17 per share, which represents the impact of the additional shares that were used in the adjusted diluted earnings per share. Additionally, $1.6 million of interest, net of tax, on the convertible senior notes that were outstanding during the first quarter of the year was added back to earnings for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 in order to derive the diluted earnings per share on an adjusted basis.
The per share impact of the mark-to-market losses on fuel hedges, fleet transition costs, and restructuring and impairment charges have been presented in the table above using the basic shares outstanding of 40.214 million and 37.939 million for the three months and twelve months ended December 31, 2006, respectively.
 
The following table summarizes Alaska Air Group, Inc.'s basic and diluted per share calculations for income (loss) before the accounting change and net loss (in millions except per share amounts):
 
 
Forecasted Financial Measures
During our quarterly earnings conference call, we expect to discuss forward-looking forecasted unit cost information for 2007. This forecasted unit cost information includes non-GAAP unit cost estimates which are summarized in the following table together with the most directly comparable GAAP unit cost for both Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Horizon Air Industries, Inc.:
 
: Our forecast of fuel cost is based on anticipated gallons consumed and estimated fuel cost per gallon. The estimate also includes the expected benefit from settled hedges, net of the reclassification of previously recognized mark-to-market hedge portfolio gains and losses. Given the volatility of fuel prices and the mark-to-market adjustments on our fuel hedge portfolio, readers should be cautioned that actual fuel expense could differ significantly from the forecast above.

Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Principal Officers; Election of Officers; Appointment of Principal Officers
On January 31, 2007, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Committee") of Alaska Air Group, Inc. (the "Company") took a number of actions.
First, the Committee confirmed that the Company's overall compensation philosophy is to pay its non-executive employees base pay at market levels with the opportunity to earn above-market pay through incentive compensation. With respect to the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) position, the Committee confirmed that total direct compensation should be substantially below market. With respect to other senior executives, the Committee confirmed that base pay should be substantially below market, but that they will have an opportunity, through short-term and long-term incentive plans, to get to market for total direct compensation if the Company performs well. Thus, the most senior executives at the Company will have the highest proportion of their total direct compensation "at risk." The Committee believes this structure best aligns the interests of executives, employees, shareholders and customers.
Second, consistent with that philosophy, the Committee decided that Chairman and CEO Bill Ayer, and the Company's other Named Executive Officers, Alaska Air Group Executive Vice President/Finance and Chief Financial Officer Brad Tilden, Alaska Airlines, Inc. ("Alaska") Executive Vice President/Marketing & Planning Gregg Saretsky, Alaska Executive Vice President/Operations Kevin Finan, and CEO and President of Horizon Air Industries, Inc. ("Horizon") Jeff Pinneo would receive no salary increase for the 2007 year. At $360,000 per year, Mr. Ayer's base salary is approximately 40% below market (based on information provided by the Committee's independent compensation consultant). Similarly, the base pay of the other Named Executive Officers is at least 20% below market.
Third, the Committee approved participation rates for fiscal 2007 under the Company's short-term incentive plan called the Performance-Based Pay plan ("PBP"), subject to further approval by the Board of Directors, as follows: Mr. Ayer, 100%, and each of the other Named Executive Officers, 75%. Participation rates are expressed as a percentage of base salary for the fiscal year assuming target performance is achieved. The actual amounts paid under the PBP plan may be higher if the performance targets are exceeded or lower (or even 0%) if the targets are not met.
Fourth, the Committee approved the performance criteria pursuant to which awards may be paid to executive officers and other employees participating in the PBP plan for fiscal 2007, as follows. PBP plan participants are eligible to receive PBP plan payments if the Company achieves certain operational and financial performance criteria over the full year. The four measures for 2007 are pre-tax profit (70%), cost per available seat mile excluding fuel (10%), safety as measured by on-the-job injury rates (10%), and employee engagement as measured by employee survey results (10%).
Fifth, the Committee approved grants of stock options, restricted stock units ("RSUs") and performance stock units under the Company's 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "2004 Plan") to each of the Named Executive Officers. The table below presents the number of shares subject to each of these awards:
 
 
Each stock option was granted with an exercise price equal to $42.85, the closing price of a share of Company common stock on January 31, 2007, and is scheduled to vest in annual installments over a four-year period. The RSUs are scheduled to vest on the third anniversary of the grant date and are payable upon vesting in shares of Company common stock on a one-for-one basis. The performance units will be eligible to vest based on the Company's average pre-tax profit margin over the three-year period commencing January 1, 2007. The percentage of the performance units that vest may range from 0% to 200%, depending on the Company's performance during that period. Vested performance units are payable in shares of Company common stock on a one-for-one basis.
In connection with these award grants, the Committee approved forms of agreements for use in evidencing stock options, restricted stock unit and performance stock unit awards granted under the 2004 Plan. These forms are attached hereto as Exhibits 10.1, 10.2 and 10.3, respectively, and incorporated herein by reference.
Finally, the Committee confirmed payouts for 2006 under the PBP Plan. The payouts are based on the Company's 2006 performance relative to safety, employee engagement, and financial performance goals established by the Committee for the year. As described in more detail below, the Committee exercised its discretion pursuant to the PBP Plan to settle certain 2006 payouts under the Plan in Company common stock (in lieu of a cash payment). The cash amounts of the 2006 payouts under the PBP Plan (before converting the cash bonuses to stock amounts) were as follows: Mr. Ayer, $538,965; Mr. Tilden, $233,531; Mr. Saretsky, $243,204; Mr. Finan, $225,846, and Mr. Pinneo, $209,995. Mr. Pinneo's payout was made in cash. Each of the other Named Executive's payout for 2006 was made in ALK common stock (in lieu of payment of the cash amount set forth above for that executive), with the number of shares deliverable to each executive determined by dividing the executive's cash payout for 2006 (after subtracting the amount of tax withholding required) by $42.85, the per-share closing price of ALK common stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange on January 31, 2007. The number of shares of ALK common stock actually delivered to each of these executives was as follows: Mr. Ayer, 9,175 shares; Mr. Tilden, 3,915 shares; Mr. Saretsky, 4,085 shares; Mr. Finan, 3,783 shares.

In consideration of Air Group's execution of this Agreement, the undersigned spouse of the Participant agrees to be bound by all of the terms and provisions hereof and of the Plan.
 
. As used herein, the term "stock unit" shall mean a non-voting unit of measurement which is deemed for bookkeeping purposes to be equivalent to one outstanding share of Air Group's Common Stock (subject to adjustment as provided in Section 6 of the Plan) solely for purposes of the Plan and this Agreement. The Stock Units shall be used solely as a device for the determination of the payment to eventually be made to the Participant if such Stock Units vest pursuant to this Agreement. The Stock Units shall not be treated as property or as a trust fund of any kind.

2.
Vesting; Change in Control
(a) . Subject to Section 7 below, the Award shall vest and become nonforfeitable based on the achievement of the performance goals established by the Committee and set forth on Exhibit A attached hereto for the Performance Period identified on the cover page of this Agreement. The number of Stock Units that vest and become payable under this Agreement shall be determined based on the level of results or achievement of targets for each of the Performance Goals as set forth in Exhibit A. Except as otherwise expressly provided in Exhibit A, any Stock Units subject to the Award that do not vest in accordance with Exhibit A shall terminate as of the last day of the Performance Period.
Performance-Based Vesting
(b) . Notwithstanding any other provision herein or in the Plan, the Award, to the extent not then vested, shall become fully vested upon a Change in Control (as defined in Exhibit B attached hereto); provided, however, that such acceleration provision shall not apply if two-thirds or more of the Incumbent Directors (as defined in Exhibit B) then in office specifically determine in advance of the Change in Control that the Award shall not accelerate and shall continue in accordance with the terms hereof.
Change in Control
. The vesting schedule requires continued employment or service through each applicable vesting date as a condition to the vesting of the applicable installment of the Award and the rights and benefits under this Agreement. Employment or service for only a portion of the vesting period, even if a substantial portion, will not entitle the Participant to any proportionate vesting or avoid or mitigate a termination of rights and benefits upon or following a termination of employment or services as provided in Section 7 below or under the Plan.
3.
Continuance of Employment
Nothing contained in this Agreement or the Plan constitutes an employment or service commitment by Air Group, affects the Participant's status as an employee at will who is subject to termination without cause, confers upon the Participant any right to remain employed by or in service to the Company, interferes in any way with the right of the Company at any time to terminate such employment or services, or affects the right of the Company to increase or decrease the Participant's other compensation or benefits. Nothing in this paragraph, however, is intended to adversely affect any independent contractual right of the Participant without his consent thereto.
. The Participant shall have no rights as a stockholder of Air Group, no dividend rights and no voting rights, with respect to the Stock Units and any shares of Common Stock underlying or issuable in respect of such Stock Units until such shares of Common Stock are actually issued to and held of record by the Participant. No adjustments will be made for dividends or other rights of a holder for which the record date is prior to the date of issuance of the stock certificate.
4.
Limitations on Rights Associated with Units
. Neither the Award, nor any interest therein or amount or shares payable in respect thereof may be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise disposed of, alienated or encumbered, either voluntarily or involuntarily. The transfer restrictions in the preceding sentence shall not apply to (a) transfers to Air Group, or (b) transfers by will or the laws of descent and distribution.
5.
Restrictions on Transfer
. On or as soon as administratively practical following the date on which any Stock Units subject to this Award vest pursuant to the terms hereof, Air Group shall deliver to the Participant a number of shares of Common Stock (either by delivering one or more certificates for such shares or by entering such shares in book entry form, as determined by Air Group in its discretion) equal to the number of Stock Units subject to this Award that vest on such date, unless such Stock Units terminate prior to such date pursuant to Section 7. Air Group's obligation to deliver shares of Common Stock or otherwise make payment with respect to vested Stock Units is subject to the condition precedent that the Participant or other person entitled under the Plan to receive any shares with respect to the vested Stock Units deliver to Air Group any representations or other documents or assurances that the Committee may deem necessary or desirable to assure compliance with all applicable legal and accounting requirements. The Participant shall have no further rights with respect to any Stock Units that are paid or that terminate pursuant to Section 7.
6.
Timing and Manner of Payment of Stock Units
The Participant's Stock Units shall terminate to the extent such units have not become vested prior to the first date the Participant is no longer employed by the Company, regardless of the reason for the termination of the Participant's employment with the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if the Participant's employment terminates as a result of the Participant's death, Total Disability or Retirement (as such terms are defined below), (i) the Participant's Stock Units shall be subject to pro-rata vesting such that the number of Stock Units subject to the Award that shall become vested as of the conclusion of the Performance Period shall equal (A) the number of Stock Units subject to the Award that would have vested as of the conclusion of the Performance Period in accordance with Section 2 above (assuming no termination of employment had occurred), multiplied by (B) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of whole months during the Performance Period the Participant was employed by or rendered services to the Company, and the denominator of which shall be the number of whole months in the Performance Period; and (ii) any Stock Units subject to the Award that do not vest in accordance with the foregoing clause (i) shall terminate as of the last day of the Performance Period. If any unvested Stock Units are terminated hereunder, such Stock Units shall automatically terminate and be cancelled as of the applicable termination date without payment of any consideration by Air Group and without any other action by the Participant, or the Participant's beneficiary or personal representative, as the case may be.
7. .
Effect of Termination of Employment
For purposes of this Agreement, "" means a "permanent and total disability" (within the meaning of Section 22(e)(3) of the Code or as otherwise determined by the Committee). For purposes of this Agreement, "" means that, as of the date of the termination of the Participant's employment with the Company, the Participant has either (i) attained age 55 with at least five (5) full years of service with the Company, or (ii) has attained age 60, or (iii) is a participant in and is entitled to commence a benefit under a Company-sponsored defined benefit plan and has at least 10 years of service with the Company.

In addition, upon the occurrence of certain events relating to Air Group's stock contemplated by Section 6 of the Plan (including, without limitation, an extraordinary cash dividend on such stock), the Committee shall make adjustments in accordance with such section in the number of Stock Units then outstanding and the number and kind of securities that may be issued in respect of the Award. No such adjustment shall be made with respect to any ordinary cash dividend paid on the Common Stock. Furthermore, the Committee shall adjust the performance measures and performance goals referenced in Section 3 hereof to the extent (if any) it determines that the adjustment is necessary or advisable to preserve the intended incentives and benefits to reflect (1) any material change in corporate capitalization, any material

corporate transaction (such as a reorganization, combination, separation, merger, acquisition, or any combination of the foregoing), or any complete or partial liquidation of the Air Group, (2) any change in accounting policies or practices, (3) the effects of any special charges to the Air Group's earnings, or (4) any other similar special circumstances.
. Subject to Section 19 of the Plan, upon any distribution of shares of Common Stock in respect of the Stock Units, Air Group shall automatically reduce the number of shares to be delivered by (or otherwise reacquire) the appropriate number of whole shares, valued at their then Fair Market Value (determined in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Plan), to satisfy any withholding obligations of the Company with respect to such distribution of shares at the minimum applicable withholding rates. In the event that Air Group cannot legally satisfy such withholding obligations by such reduction of shares, or in the event of a cash payment or any other withholding event in respect of the Stock Units, the Company shall be entitled to require a cash payment by or on behalf of the Participant and/or to deduct from other compensation payable to the Participant any sums required by federal, state or local tax law to be withheld with respect to such distribution or payment.
9.
Tax Withholding

Any notice to be given under the terms of this Agreement shall be in writing and addressed to Air Group at its principal office to the attention of the Secretary, and to the Participant at the Participant's last address reflected on Air Group's records, or at such other address as either party may hereafter designate in writing to the other. Any such notice shall be given only when received, but if the Participant is no longer an employee of the Company, shall be deemed to have been duly given by Air Group when enclosed in a properly sealed envelope addressed as aforesaid, registered or certified, and deposited (postage and registry or certification fee prepaid) in a post office or branch post office regularly maintained by the United States Government.
10.
Notices
. The Award and all rights of the Participant under this Agreement are subject to the terms and conditions of the provisions of the Plan, incorporated herein by reference. The Participant agrees to be bound by the terms of the Plan and this Agreement. The Participant acknowledges having read and understanding the Plan, the Prospectus for the Plan, and this Agreement. Unless otherwise expressly provided in other sections of this Agreement, provisions of the Plan that confer discretionary authority on the Board or the Committee do not (and shall not be deemed to) create any rights in the Participant unless such rights are expressly set forth herein or are otherwise in the sole discretion of the Board or the Committee so conferred by appropriate action of the Board or the Committee under the Plan the date hereof.

after
. This Agreement and the Plan together constitute the entire agreement and supersede all prior understandings and agreements, written or oral, of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof. The Plan and this Agreement may be amended pursuant to Section 14 of the Plan. Such amendment must be in writing and signed by Air Group. Air Group may, however, unilaterally waive any provision hereof in writing to the extent such waiver does not adversely affect the interests of the Participant hereunder, but no such waiver shall operate as or be construed to be a subsequent waiver of the same provision or a waiver of any other provision hereof.

Governing Law
. It is intended that the terms of the Award will not result in the imposition of any tax liability pursuant to Section 409A of the Code. This Agreement shall be construed and interpreted consistent with that intent.
17.
Construction
The vesting of the Award will be determined based on the three-year average of Air Group's Adjusted Pretax Profit Margin as calculated on the last day of each of the three years during the Performance Period. For Purposes of the Award, the Performance Goal for the Performance Period is the three-year average of Alaska Air Group's Adjusted Pretax Profit Margin (also referred to as "APM"). For this purpose, means the net income of Alaska Air Group, Inc. as computed under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), adjusted for Excluded Items and Alternative Accounting Treatments. means (a) income taxes, and (b) special income or expense items such as gain or loss on disposition of capital assets, impairments or other fleet or facility exit costs, expenses from voluntary or involuntary severance programs, government refunds or assistance and cumulative effect of accounting changes. " means expense or income relating to fuel hedge accounting on an "as settled" basis.

Numerical Example
Assume that the Participant was granted an Award of 10,000 Stock Units and Air Group achieved an average APM of 6.5% for the Performance Period. In that case, the number of Stock Units subject to the Award that would vest would be 7,187.5 (the vesting percentage would be 71.875% based on linear interpolation between the 6.0% and 7.0% APM levels in the table above). The remaining 2,812.5 Stock Units subject to the Award that did not vest would terminate as of the end of the Performance Period.

All of the forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the risk factors discussed therein. These risk factors may not be exhaustive. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risk factors emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict such new risk factors, nor can it assess the impact, if any, of such new risk factors on our business or events described in any forward-looking statements. We disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date of this report to conform them to actual results. Over time, our actual results, performance or achievements will likely differ from the anticipated results; performance or achievements that are expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements, and such differences might be significant and materially adverse.
 
On February 12, 2007, Alaska Air Group, Inc. (the Company) posted an "Investor White Paper" to its investor relations website at alaskaair.com describing a new capacity purchase arrangement between Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Horizon Air Industries, Inc. effective January 1, 2007. The white paper discusses the general terms of the agreement as well as its expected impact on the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries.
In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in this Form 8-K and exhibit shall not be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), nor shall such information be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.

Signature
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
References in this paper to "Air Group," "Company," "we," "us," and "our" refer to Alaska Air Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise specified. Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Horizon Air Industries, Inc. are referred to as "Alaska" and "Horizon," respectively, and together as our "airlines."
Executive Summary
Horizon Air and Alaska Airlines have entered into an agreement whereby Alaska will purchase certain capacity from Horizon at a specified rate. This new arrangement will result in Alaska recording the passenger revenue for flights operated by Horizon that are subject to the arrangement. Alaska also will include the contractual costs in its statement of operations. This document aims to clarify for investors and other interested parties the arrangement and the expected impact on the financial statements of each airline.
Background
Air Group is composed of two primary operating subsidiaries  Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air Industries. Both of these subsidiaries operate as airlines, although their business plans, competition and economic risks differ substantially. Alaska is a major airline, operating an all-jet fleet with an average passenger trip length of over 1,000 miles. Horizon is a regional airline operating both jet and turboprop aircraft with an average passenger trip length of less than 400 miles.
Since the acquisition of Horizon by Air Group in 1986, Alaska and Horizon have operated independently and continue to have strong, distinct brands. In addition to serving its own markets, Horizon also provides feed traffic to Alaska and frequency in certain low-density Alaska markets for the benefit of the overall Air Group network. Both the feed and low-density flying for Alaska are referred as "incentive markets."
Under the former arrangement between Alaska and Horizon, if the incentive markets resulted in a loss to Horizon, Alaska would make a payment to Horizon equal to the amount of the loss. Alternatively, if the incentive markets were profitable for Horizon over a specified margin, Horizon would make a payment to Alaska equal to the overage amount. Horizon was also eligible for a quarterly bonus if Alaska posted an operating profit as defined internally. The net payment or receipt was reported in "Selling expenses" in Alaska's statement of operations. Horizon reported the receipt or payment in "Passenger revenues." Alaska made incentive payments of $3.7 million in 2006, received incentive payments from Horizon of $1.7 million during 2005, and made incentive payments to Horizon of $13.8 million in 2004. These intercompany transactions were eliminated in consolidation.
New Arrangement Details
The effective date for the new capacity purchase arrangement is January 1, 2007. Under this new arrangement, Alaska will pay Horizon for specified flying based on predetermined rates plus a negotiated margin, regardless of the number of passengers on board or the revenue collected. The arrangement also includes a bonus that will be paid to Horizon if it meets certain operational performance measures. Alaska has assumed the revenue risk for the incentive markets and therefore will record all of the related passenger revenue.
Impact on Alaska's Statement of Operations
New Arrangement with Horizon
Revenue from the incentive markets will be presented by Alaska in a new line item entitled "Passenger revenue  regional affiliates." The associated costs, including an allocation of shared services costs borne by Alaska (more fully explained below), will be presented in a new operating expense line item entitled "Regional flying costs." Alaska will also begin reporting "mainline" and "regional" financial statistics including available seat miles (ASMs), revenue per ASM, and cost per ASM, among others.
Alaska provides certain services such as finance and IT support to Horizon, for which it is reimbursed. Under the new arrangement, certain of those shared services costs borne by Alaska will be allocated to the incentive markets and recorded in "Regional flying costs" rather than being billed to and reimbursed by Horizon. These costs are not expected to be material.
Arrangement with PenAir
Alaska currently has a similar capacity purchase agreement in place whereby Alaska purchases from Peninsula Airways (PenAir) certain flights between Anchorage and Dutch Harbor, AK. Alaska has historically reported the revenue from this arrangement in "Other revenue  net" and the related costs in "Contracted services" in our statement of operations. Historically, the revenue and related cost associated with this arrangement have not been material. As a result of the new presentation for the Horizon capacity purchase agreement, we will also begin reporting PenAir flying in the separate regional flying costs line. Beginning with periodic reports in 2007, prior-year financial statements will be reclassified accordingly.
A pro forma 2006 statement of operations for Alaska Airlines is presented below, reclassified for PenAir revenues and expenses. Additionally, it has been adjusted for revenues and costs related to the Horizon incentive markets. The revenue amounts presented are based on actual 2006 revenues recorded by Horizon for the incentive market flying. For purposes of this document, the Horizon incentive market costs are assumed to be equal to revenues. This is not an indication of what the future margin on this flying will be, nor is it an indication of the historical margin. It is for illustration purposes only.
Impact on Horizon's Statement of Operations
Horizon's statement of operations will not change significantly. Horizon will continue to report in its operational statistics disclosures all operational metrics from the incentive markets flying. The primary difference will be that the revenue recorded by Horizon from this flying will be the contract amount paid to Horizon by Alaska rather than the actual revenue collected from passengers.
Impact on Consolidated Statement of Operations
Air Group's consolidated statements of operations will include only the revenue and expenses associated with PenAir flying, as transactions between Alaska and Horizon are eliminated in consolidation. Other than the reclassification of PenAir revenues and expenses, our 2006 and 2005 statements of operations will remain unchanged because the new arrangement effective date is January 1, 2007.

Pursuant to 17 CFR Part 243 ("Regulation FD"), the Company is submitting information relating to its financial and operational outlook for 2007. This report includes information regarding forecasts of available seat miles (ASMs), cost per available seat mile (CASM) excluding fuel consumption, as well as certain actual results for revenue passenger miles (RPMs), load factor and revenue per available seat mile (RASM), for its subsidiaries Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Horizon Air. Our disclosure of operating cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel and other noted items, provides us the ability to measure and monitor our performance without these items. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is total operating expense per available seat mile. However, due to the large fluctuations in fuel prices, we are unable to predict total operating expense for any future period with any degree of certainty. In addition, we believe the disclosure of fuel expense on an economic basis is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. Please see the cautionary statement under "Forward-Looking Information."
In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the following information shall not be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), nor shall such information be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing. This Report will not be deemed an admission as to the materiality of any information required to be disclosed solely to satisfy the requirements of Regulation FD.
Alaska Airlines
On February 12, 2007, we furnished an 8-K describing Alaska's new capacity purchase arrangement with Horizon beginning January 1, 2007. As a result of this new agreement, Alaska will begin to report passenger revenue and associated costs related to certain flying provided by Horizon. However, the January 2007 and forward-looking information for Alaska below reflects "mainline" information, which excludes contract flying with Horizon and certain flying between Anchorage and Dutch Harbor, Alaska provided by a third party. Additionally, as described in the February 12, 2007 8-K, Alaska will be reclassifying the revenues and costs in prior periods associated with the Dutch Harbor flying. As a result of this reclassification, CASM excluding fuel and other noted items for the first quarter of 2006 was originally reported as 7.97 cents, but will now be reported as 7.90 cents. Mainline RASM was originally reported as 10.65 cents, but will now be reported as 10.57 cents.
total
In January 2007, our mainline RASM declined by 0.8%. The decrease in RASM is mainly due to a 2.5 point decline in load factor from January 2006, offset by a 2.8% increase in ticket yields. At this point, our month-to-date load factor for February is down approximately three points and our advance booked load factor for March is down approximately one point from their respective prior-year periods. Year-over-year mainline RASM was up 1.3%.
passenger

total
 
Our forecast for first quarter mainline unit costs at Alaska is as follows:
 
Alaska's January traffic decreased 0.8 % to 1.284 billion RPMs from 1.295 billion flown a year earlier. Capacity for January was 1.930 billion ASMs, 2.8% higher than the 1.878 billion in January 2006. The passenger load factor (the percentage of available seats occupied by fare-paying passengers) for the month was 66.5%, compared to 69.0% in January 2006. The airline carried 1,216,500 passengers compared to 1,238,400 in January 2006.
Horizon Air
Year-over-year RASM for Horizon was up 7.1% in January. RASM from the Frontier contract flying declined by 0.2% from January 2006 due to higher yields, offset by the 3.1 point decline in load factor. RASM from Native Network flying increased 2.7% primarily due to higher yields, offset by a 1.3 point decline in load factor. Currently, our month-to-date load factor for February is down approximately 2.5 points and our advance booked load factor for March is down approximately 1.5 points from their respective prior-year periods.
total
 
 
Horizon's cost per ASM includes the expected loss on the sublease of Q200 aircraft to a third party. We expect the loss and other related exit costs will be between $1.5 million and $2 million per aircraft, and will be recorded when the aircraft leave our operating fleet. Currently, we expect to deliver two of the Q200s to the third party during the first quarter.
Horizon's January traffic increased 0.3% to 191.3 million RPMs from 190.7 million flown a year earlier. Capacity during January was 302.2 million ASMs, 2.6% higher than the 294.6 million in January 2006. The passenger load factor for the month was 63.3%, compared to 64.7% in January 2006. The airline carried 501,700 passengers compared to 493,400 in January 2006.
Other Financial Information
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of January 31, 2007, Air Group cash and short-term investments totaled approximately $943 million.

The following table summarizes firm aircraft commitments for Alaska (B737-800) and Horizon (Q400) by year, excluding aircraft that have already been delivered in 2007.
 
In addition to the firm orders noted above, Alaska has options to acquire 24 additional B737-800s and purchase rights for 27 more. The company expects to exercise additional options and purchase rights on B737-800 order in the future as a result of acceleration of the retirement of its MD-80 fleet. Horizon has options to acquire 19 Q400s and 15 CRJ700s.
Giving consideration to the current fleet transition plan, the following table displays the currently anticipated fleet count for Alaska as of the end of each quarter in 2007 and December 31, 2008:

FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION
This report contains forward-looking statements subject to the safe harbor protection provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

For a discussion of these and other risk factors, see Item 1A of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006. All of the forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the risk factors discussed therein. These risk factors may not be exhaustive. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risk factors emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict such new risk factors, nor can it assess the impact, if any, of such new risk factors on our business or events described in any forward-looking statements. We expressly disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date of this report to conform them to actual results.

Pursuant to 17 CFR Part 243 ("Regulation FD"), the Company is submitting information relating to its financial and operational outlook for 2007. This report includes information regarding forecasts of available seat miles (ASMs), cost per available seat mile (CASM) excluding fuel consumption, as well as certain actual results for revenue passenger miles (RPMs), load factor and revenue per available seat mile (RASM), for its subsidiaries Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Horizon Air. Our disclosure of operating cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel and other noted items, provides us the ability to measure and monitor our performance without these items. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is total operating expense per available seat mile. However, due to the large fluctuations in fuel prices, we are unable to predict total operating expense for any future period with any degree of certainty. In addition, we believe the disclosure of fuel expense on an economic basis is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. Please see the cautionary statement under "Forward-Looking Information."
In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the following information shall not be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), nor shall such information be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing. This report will not be deemed an admission as to the materiality of any information required to be disclosed solely to satisfy the requirements of Regulation FD.
Capacity Purchase Arrangement
On February 12, 2007, we furnished an 8-K describing Alaska's new capacity purchase arrangement with Horizon beginning January 1, 2007. As a result of this new agreement, Alaska will begin to report passenger revenue and associated costs related to certain flying provided by Horizon. This passenger revenue will be the actual amount collected from paying passengers. Horizon will also report revenue associated with this agreement, which will reflect the negotiated payment made by Alaska to Horizon for the specified flying. The amount paid to Horizon will be eliminated in the consolidation of Air Group financial statements.
The arrangement will impact the separately reported Alaska and Horizon financial and statistical information. Currently, we expect that Alaska will report a $5 - $6 million loss from regional flying arrangements for the first quarter of 2007. However, because of the seasonal variability of revenues, we currently expect the first-quarter loss from regional flying will represent approximately half to two-thirds of the anticipated full-year loss.
Alaska Airlines
The information for Alaska below reflects "mainline" information, which excludes contract flying provided by Horizon and contract flying between Anchorage and Dutch Harbor, AK provided by a third party. Additionally, as described in the February 12, 2007 Form 8-K, Alaska will reclassify the revenues and costs for prior periods that are associated with the Dutch Harbor flying. As a result of this reclassification, CASM excluding fuel and other noted items for the first quarter of 2006 that was originally reported as 7.97 cents will now be reported as 7.90 cents. Mainline RASM that was originally reported as 10.65 cents will now be reported as 10.57 cents.
total
In January and February 2007, our mainline RASM declined by 0.8% and 1.9%, respectively. The decrease is mainly due to a 2.5-point and a 2.9-point year-over-year decline in load factors for January and February, respectively, offset by increases in ticket yields of 2.8% in January and 2.1% in February. At this point, we expect our March load factor to be down 2 to 3 points compared to the prior year. Year-over-year mainline RASM was up 1.3% in January, but down 0.8% in February.
passenger
total
 
Our forecast for first-quarter mainline unit costs at Alaska is as follows:
 
Alaska's February mainline traffic decreased 0.8% to 1.25 billion RPMs from 1.26 billion flown a year earlier. Mainline capacity for February was 1.769 billion ASMs, 3.4% higher than the 1.711 billion in February 2006. The mainline passenger load factor (the percentage of available seats occupied by fare-paying passengers) for the month was 70.7%, compared to 73.6% in February 2006. The airline carried 1,197,800 passengers compared to 1,209,400 in February 2006.
Horizon Air
Year-over-year RASM for Horizon was up 7.1% in January and 5.6% in February. The RASM improvement occurred both in the Native Network (which includes flying under the Capacity Purchase Arrangement (CPA) with Alaska) and the Frontier JetExpress flying. Native Network flying represented approximately 82% of Horizon's ASMs during the 2-month period.
total
The Native Network RASM increase was driven by higher yields, partially offset by a 1.3-point and a 2.8-point decline in load factors for January and February, respectively. The higher yields were due in large part to the impact of the CPA whereby the revenue recorded by Horizon under the agreement exceeded the actual passenger revenue recorded by Alaska (and would have been recorded by Horizon absent the Capacity Purchase Arrangement). Revenue recognized by Horizon under the Capacity Purchase Arrangement (CPA) will be eliminated on a consolidated basis.
Currently, we expect Horizon's system-wide year-over-year load factor for March to be down approximately 3 to 4 points.
 
Horizon Air
 
Horizon's cost per ASM includes the expected loss on the sublease of Q200 aircraft to a third party. We expect the loss will be approximately $1.5 million per aircraft, which will be recorded when the aircraft leave our operating fleet. Currently, we expect to deliver two of the Q200s to the third party during the first quarter.
Horizon's February traffic increased 3.5% to 202.2 million RPMs from 195.3 million flown a year earlier. Capacity during February was 293.9 million ASMs, 7.6% higher than the 273.2 million in February 2006. The passenger load factor for the month was 68.8%, compared to 71.5% in February 2006. The airline carried 513,000 passengers compared to 502,400 in February 2006.
Consolidated Air Group
Based on our unit revenue performance for the first two months of 2007 and our expectation of March results, we expect to report a net loss for the first quarter of 2007.
Other Financial Information
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of February 28, 2007, Air Group cash and short-term investments totaled approximately $957 million.

The majority of the Company's hedge instruments are call options. Call options are intended to effectively cap our pricing on the crude oil component of fuel prices. With call option contracts, we benefit from the decline in crude oil prices as there is no downward exposure other than the premiums we pay to enter into the contracts. These premiums are expensed when the contracts settle. Alaska Air Group's future hedge positions are as follows:

The following table provides a fleet summary for Alaska and Horizon for actual airplanes on hand as of the date of this report.
 
 
The following table summarizes firm aircraft commitments for Alaska (B737-800) and Horizon (Q400) by year, excluding aircraft that have already been delivered in 2007.
 
In addition to the firm orders noted above, Alaska has options to acquire 24 additional B737-800s and purchase rights for 27 more. The company expects to exercise additional options and purchase rights on B737-800 order in the future as a result of acceleration of the retirement of its MD-80 fleet. Horizon has options to acquire 19 Q400s and 15 CRJ700s.
Giving consideration to the current fleet transition plan, the following table displays the currently anticipated fleet count for Alaska and Horizon as of the end of each quarter in 2007 and as of December 31, 2008:

Our forecast for first-quarter mainline unit costs at Alaska is as follows:
 
The year-over-year decline in cost per ASM as reported on a GAAP basis is due to the 2006 first quarter including a $131 million impairment charge on our owned MD-80s following our decision to move to an all B737 fleet. Excluding the impact of the impairment charge in the first quarter of 2006, our cost per ASM as reported on a GAAP basis would increase by 2% to 3% in the first quarter of 2007.
Alaska's March mainline traffic increased 0.5% to 1.532 billion RPMs from 1.525 billion flown a year earlier. Mainline capacity for March was 1.994 billion ASMs, 2.3% higher than the 1.950 billion in March 2006. The mainline passenger load factor (the percentage of available seats occupied by fare-paying passengers) for the month was 76.8%, compared to 78.2% in March 2006. The airline carried 1,448,200 passengers compared to 1,456,800 in March 2006.
Horizon Air
Year-over-year RASM for Horizon was up 7.1% in January and 5.6% in February. The RASM improvement occurred both in the Native Network (which includes flying under the Capacity Purchase Arrangement (CPA) with Alaska) and the Frontier JetExpress flying, which is also CPA based. Native Network flying represented approximately 82% of Horizon's capacity during the two-month period.
total
The Native Network RASM increase was driven by higher yields, partially offset by a 1.3-point and a 2.8-point decline in load factors for January and February, respectively. The higher yields were due in large part to the impact of the CPA with Alaska. However, RASM in markets not subject to CPA flying (which for the period represented 60% of Native Network capacity) declined 1.7%.
Horizon Air
 
 
Horizon's cost per ASM includes the expected loss on the sublease of Q200 aircraft to a third party. We expect the loss will be approximately $1.5 million per aircraft, which will be recorded when the aircraft leave our operating fleet. We delivered two of the Q200s to the third party during the first quarter, and one additional aircraft in early April.
Horizon's March traffic decreased 0.3% to 233.6 million RPMs from 234.2 million flown a year earlier. Capacity during March was 329.0 million ASMs, 6.3% higher than the 309.6 million in March 2006. The passenger load factor for the month was 71.0%, compared to 75.6% in March 2006. The airline carried 594,300 passengers compared to 598,400 in March 2006.
Consolidated Air Group
Based on our actual Alaska mainline, Alaska regional and Horizon results during the first two months of 2007 and our anticipated March results, we expect to report a net loss for the first quarter of 2007.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
SEATTLE  The Alaska Air Group board of directors today announced changes to Alaska Airlines' senior management structure. Three senior executives have been elected to new divisional leadership roles, and the company announced the upcoming retirement of Kevin Finan, executive vice president of operations.
The realignment will foster greater collaboration between divisions, accelerate operational improvements, unify company planning efforts, and further the airline's ongoing transformation.
Gregg Saretsky, 47, formerly executive vice president of marketing and planning, has been elected executive vice president of flight and marketing. In this position, he will oversee the airline's Flight Operations, Inflight Services, Sales, Customer Experience and Brand Marketing organizations.
Glenn Johnson, 48, was promoted to executive vice president of airport services and maintenance and engineering, adding oversight of the Maintenance and Engineering Division. He was previously Alaska's senior vice president of customer service-airports.
Brad Tilden, 46, Alaska Air Group's chief financial officer and executive vice president of finance, will assume responsibility for the Planning, Revenue Management and Corporate Real Estate departments, in addition to Finance, with an expanded title of executive vice president of finance and planning.
Until his retirement at the end of 2007, Finan, 60, will serve as executive vice president of strategic projects and interim vice president of flight operations. He formerly oversaw Flight Operations, Customer Service-Airports, Maintenance and Engineering, and Corporate Real Estate.
"Kevin's desire to retire at the end of the year presented an opportunity to revisit our organizational makeup on the ground and in the air, and explore options to enable better cross-team solutions for serving our customers," said Bill Ayer, Alaska Air Group's chairman and chief executive officer.
"This restructuring aligns Alaska's maintenance, ground support and airport customer service functions under one leader, promoting increased teamwork and more streamlined operations," Ayer said. "Unifying our inflight services, flight operations and customer experience areas is designed to achieve similar cross-division collaboration and focus.
"Likewise, shifting planning, revenue management and corporate real estate to our finance organization creates further alignment with our overall strategic planning efforts," Ayer said.
As part of the realignment, Captain Ben Forrest, previously vice president of flight operations, will return to his line pilot and check airman role. Saretsky will lead the search for a new vice president of flight operations.
"Ben has made significant contributions this past year, including overseeing the operational transition from the 737-200 to the 737-400 Combi and Freighter, and expanding the use of RNP flight guidance technology," Saretsky said. "His passion for improving the operation and dedication to the company will continue to benefit Flight Operations as he returns to line flying."
Alaska Airlines and sister carrier, Horizon Air, together serve 90 cities through an expansive network throughout Alaska, the Lower 48, Canada and Mexico. For reservations visit alaskaair.com.

ITEM 7.01.
Regulation FD Disclosure
Pursuant to 17 CFR Part 243 ("Regulation FD"), the Company is submitting information relating to its financial and operational outlook for 2007. This report includes information regarding forecasts of available seat miles (ASMs), cost per available seat mile (CASM) excluding fuel consumption, as well as certain actual results for revenue passenger miles (RPMs), load factor and revenue per available seat mile (RASM), for its subsidiaries Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Horizon Air Industries, Inc. Our disclosure of operating cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel, provides us the ability to measure and monitor our performance without these items. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is total operating expense per available seat mile. However, due to the large fluctuations in fuel prices, we are unable to predict total operating expense for any future period with any degree of certainty. In addition, we believe the disclosure of fuel expense on an economic basis is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. Please see the cautionary statement under "Forward-Looking Information."
In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in this report shall not be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), nor shall such information be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing. This report will not be deemed an admission as to the materiality of any information required to be disclosed solely to satisfy the requirements of Regulation FD.
Air Group Information
Giving consideration to economic fuel costs, unit revenue trends and forecasted non-fuel unit costs, we currently expect our consolidated adjusted net income in the second quarter and full-year 2007 to be below 2006 amounts. However, actual results could differ materially from our current expectation.
Alaska MD-80 Fleet Transition
The Company has reached an agreement with a buyer for its 20 owned MD-80s. As of May 23, 2007, the Company had closed on sale transactions for 16 of these aircraft and expects to complete the remaining sales during the second quarter. The majority of these aircraft will be leased from the buyer under short-term lease arrangements. As a result, our aircraft rent expense will increase.
Alaska Airlines
The information for Alaska below reflects "mainline" information, which excludes contract flying provided by Horizon and contract flying between Anchorage and Dutch Harbor, AK, provided by a third party. Additionally, as described in previous filings, Alaska reclassified the revenues and costs for prior periods that are associated with the Dutch Harbor flying. As a result of this reclassification, CASM excluding fuel and other noted items for the second quarter of 2006 that was originally reported as 7.92 cents will now be reported as 7.85 cents. Mainline RASM that was originally reported as 12.18 cents will now be reported as 12.10 cents.
total
Our forecast for second-quarter mainline unit costs at Alaska is as follows:
 
 
Alaska Mainline Revenue and Traffic
Alaska's April mainline traffic increased 2.0% to 1.515 billion RPMs from 1.486 billion flown a year earlier. Mainline capacity for April was 1.970 billion ASMs, 4.2% higher than the 1.890 billion in April 2006. The mainline passenger load factor (the percentage of available seats occupied by fare-paying passengers) for the month was 76.9%, compared to 78.6% in April 2006. The airline carried 1,447,800 passengers compared to 1,420,300 in April 2006.
In April 2007, our passenger RASM declined by 2.8%. The decrease is mainly due to a 1.8-point year-over-year decline in load factor and a 0.7% decline in passenger yield. Year-over-year mainline RASM was down 1.5% in April.

Alaska Regional Flying
As discussed in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2007, Alaska and Horizon entered into a Capacity Purchase Agreement (CPA) effective January 1, 2007. Prior to 2007, there was a revenue sharing arrangement in place whereby Alaska made a payment to Horizon if certain "incentive markets" resulted in losses for Horizon. Alternatively, Horizon made a payment to Alaska if those incentive markets were profitable. Although the markets have changed slightly, we believe it is useful to compare the revenue trends of the markets subject to the CPA in 2007 to those covered under the prior incentive market arrangement. Actual Passenger RASM in those markets declined in April due to a 0.5-point decline in load factor and a 5.0% decline in yields. As disclosed in our March 2007 Form 10-Q, we believe Alaska's regional flying costs paid to Horizon will exceed regional flying revenues for those markets in the second quarter, but not to the extent they did in the first quarter of 2007.
Horizon Air
 
Horizon's cost per ASM includes the expected loss on the sublease of Q200 aircraft to a third party. We expect the loss will be approximately $1.5 million per aircraft, which will be recorded when the aircraft leave our operating fleet. Currently, we expect to deliver three of the Q200s to the third party during the second quarter. The increase in Horizon's cost per ASM, excluding fuel, over prior forecasts of 14.8 cents is due primarily to higher wages, higher maintenance cost as a result of the timing of certain maintenance events, and a decrease in capacity dedicated to Frontier JetExpress.
 
Horizon Revenue and Traffic
Horizon's April traffic increased 2.8% to 227.8 million RPMs from 221.6 million flown a year earlier. Capacity during April was 319.0 million ASMs, 8.3% higher than the 294.5 million in April 2006. The passenger load factor for the month was 71.4%, compared to 75.2% in April 2006. The airline carried 587,400 passengers compared to 553,200 in April 2006.
In April 2007, Horizon's RASM increased 1.6% compared to April 2006.
total
Horizon's line-of-business information is summarized as follows:
 
Horizon "brand" flying includes those routes in the Horizon system not covered by the Alaska CPA. Horizon has revenue risk in those markets. RASM for "brand" flying declined 10.2% in April 2007 as a result of a 7.7% decline in yield and a 2.4-point decline in load factor.
Revenue from the Capacity Purchase Agreement with Alaska is eliminated in consolidation. See Alaska discussion above.

Our forecast for second-quarter mainline unit costs at Alaska is as follows:
 
 
Alaska Mainline Revenue and Traffic
Alaska's May mainline traffic increased 5.7% to 1.582 billion RPMs from 1.496 billion flown a year earlier. Mainline capacity during May was 2.051 billion ASMs, 6.2% higher than the 1.931 billion in May 2006. The mainline passenger load factor (the percentage of available seats occupied by fare-paying passengers) for the month was 77.1%, compared to 77.5% in May 2006. The airline carried 1,533,200 passengers compared to 1,444,200 in May 2006.
Mainline passenger RASM for May 2007 was down 2.3% compared to the prior year as a result of a 1.8% drop in passenger yields and a 0.4-point decline in year-over-year load factor. In April 2007, mainline passenger RASM declined by 2.8%. The decrease was due to a 1.8-point year-over-year decline in load factor and a 0.7% decline in passenger yield. Year-over-year mainline total RASM was down 3.2% in May and 1.5% in April 2007 when compared to the prior year. Currently, advance bookings for June indicate a load factor that is down approximately 11.5 points compared to the prior year.
Alaska Regional Flying
As discussed in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2007, Alaska and Horizon entered into a Capacity Purchase Agreement (CPA) effective January 1, 2007. Prior to 2007, there was a revenue sharing arrangement in place whereby Alaska made a payment to Horizon if certain incentive markets resulted in losses for Horizon. Alternatively, Horizon made a payment to Alaska if those incentive markets were profitable. As disclosed previously, we believe Alaska's regional flying costs paid to Horizon will exceed regional flying revenues for those markets in the second quarter, but not to the extent they did in the first quarter of 2007.

Horizon's cost per ASM includes the expected loss on the sublease of Q200 aircraft to a third party. We expect the loss will be approximately $1.5 million per aircraft, which will be recorded when the aircraft leave our operating fleet. Currently, we expect to deliver three of the Q200s to the third party during the second quarter.
Horizon Revenue and Traffic
Horizon's May traffic increased 6.1% to 243.3 million RPMs from 229.3 million flown a year earlier. Capacity during May was 327.9 million ASMs, 7.9% higher than 304.0 million in May 2006. The passenger load factor for the month was 74.2%, compared to 75.4% in May 2006. The airline carried 646,600 passengers compared to 583,700 in May 2006.
 
In May 2007, Horizon's total RASM increased 5.6%, compared to May 2006. The increase in total RASM is affected by changes in the mix of flying among Horizon's lines of business. The year-over-year total RASM increase in April 2007 was 1.6%. Currently, advance bookings for June indicate a load factor that is down approximately 3 to 4 points from the prior year. However, for the network flying (excluding Frontier flying), we expect load factor to be up by approximately 2 points in June 2007.
Horizon's line-of-business information is summarized as follows:
 
Horizon "brand" flying includes those routes in the Horizon system not covered by the Alaska CPA. Horizon bears the revenue risk in those markets. RASM for "brand" flying declined 5.0% in May 2007 due to a 6.0% decline in yields, offset by 0.5-point increase in load factor. April RASM was down 10.2% as a result of a 7.7% decline in yield and a 2.4-point decline in load factor.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
SEATTLE Alaska Air Group, Inc., the parent company of Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air, issued the following statement about its former chairman, chief executive officer and director Bruce R. Kennedy, who was killed June 28 in a private plane crash in the north-central Washington town of Cashmere. He was 68.
"All of us at Alaska Air Group are deeply saddened by this terrible loss of a revered leader and dear friend," said Bill Ayer, Alaska Air Group's chairman and chief executive officer. "Bruce's legacy extends far beyond his storied leadership of this airline. In his 12 years as chairman and CEO, he led Alaska on a path of significant expansion and financial stability while maintaining a strong culture of resourcefulness and integrity. As chairman emeritus, he continued to provide considerable leadership and strategic vision for the company right through to current times. For all those who worked with Bruce, we remember him as a man of great vision and compassion. His impact on our airline, the Seattle community, the state of Alaska and the important causes he believed in has been immeasurable.
"We extend our deepest sympathies to Bruce's family and loved ones, and will be keeping them in our thoughts and prayers in the difficult days that lie ahead."
A company director since 1972, Kennedy served in one or more capacities as Alaska Airlines' chairman, chief executive officer and president between 1978 and 1991. He also held the same positions with Alaska Air Group from its inception in 1985 to 1991. He oversaw Alaska Air Group's acquisition of Horizon Air and Jet America, fueling the company's growth from an airline serving Seattle and 10 cities in Alaska to a combined operation today with 92 destinations in the United States, Canada and Mexico.
At the time of his death, Kennedy served as chairman of Quest Aircraft Co., which is developing a 10-seat turboprop aircraft capable of missionary, humanitarian and commercial flying to small airfields worldwide.
Kennedy was committed to Christian missionary and humanitarian efforts both during and after leaving his executive role with the airline. For eight years, he served as chairman of Mission Aviation Fellowship, which operates some 90 light aircraft in remote areas of the world. He also served on the boards of Crista Ministries, of Lynnwood, Wash., and other Christian organizations.
He was awarded honorary degrees from both Seattle Pacific University and his alma mater, University of Alaska. Last year, Seattle's Museum of Flight honored Kennedy with its prestigious Pathfinder Award in recognition of a professional life dedicated to aviation.
He is survived by his wife, Karleen Isaacson Kennedy; their two children, Kevin (wife, Kelley) and Karin (husband, Ken) Hejmanowski; two brothers, Keith and Charles; and two grandchildren, Hallie and Braden Kennedy.

EXPLANATORY NOTE
This Amendment No. 1 to Form 8-K is being submitted to correct the second quarter capacity forecast for Alaska Airlines. In the original filing on July 10, 2007, second quarter capacity was estimated to be 6.128 billion available seat miles. The correct capacity should have been 6.140 billion available seat miles. This Form 8-K/A supersedes the Form 8-K furnished on July 10 and replaces it in its entirety. All other information provided in this amendment remains unchanged from the information previously furnished.
FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION
This report contains forward-looking statements subject to the safe harbor protection provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

For a discussion of these and other risk factors, see Item 1A of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006. All of the forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the risk factors discussed therein. These risk factors may not be exhaustive. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risk factors emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict such new risk factors, nor can it assess the impact, if any, of such new risk factors on our business or events described in any forward-looking statements. We expressly disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date of this report to conform them to actual results. Over time, our actual results, performance or achievements will likely differ from the anticipated results, performance or achievements that are expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements, and such differences might be significant and materially adverse.
 
Pursuant to 17 CFR Part 243 ("Regulation FD"), the Company is submitting information relating to its financial and operational outlook for 2007. This report includes information regarding forecasts of available seat miles (ASMs), cost per available seat mile (CASM) excluding fuel consumption, as well as certain actual results for revenue passenger miles (RPMs), load factor and revenue per available seat mile (RASM), for its subsidiaries Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Horizon Air Industries, Inc. Our disclosure of operating cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel, provides us the ability to measure and monitor our performance without these items. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is total operating expense per available seat mile. However, due to the large fluctuations in fuel prices, we are unable to predict total operating expense for any future period with any degree of certainty. In addition, we believe the disclosure of fuel expense on an economic basis is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. Please see the cautionary statement under "Forward-Looking Information."
In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in this report shall not be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), nor shall such information be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing. This report will not be deemed an admission as to the materiality of any information required to be disclosed solely to satisfy the requirements of Regulation FD.
Alaska Airlines
The Alaska mainline information below excludes contract flying provided by Horizon and contract flying between Anchorage and Dutch Harbor, AK, provided by a third party. As described in previous filings, Alaska reclassified the revenues and costs for prior periods that are associated with the Dutch Harbor flying. As a result of this reclassification, second quarter 2006 mainline total RASM that was originally reported as 12.18 cents will now be reported as 12.10 cents. CASM excluding fuel and other noted items for the second quarter of 2006 that was originally reported as 7.92 cents will now be reported as 7.85 cents.
Alaska Mainline Revenue and Traffic Information
Alaska's June mainline traffic increased 4.9% to 1.723 billion RPMs from 1.642 billion flown a year earlier. Mainline capacity during June was 2.119 billion ASMs, 5.2% higher than the 2.014 billion in June 2006. The mainline passenger load factor (the percentage of available seats occupied by fare-paying passengers) for the month was 81.3%, compared to 81.5% in June 2006. The airline carried 1,645,900 passengers, compared to 1,579,100 in June 2006.
Mainline passenger RASM for May 2007 was down 2.3% compared to the prior year as a result of a 1.8% drop in passenger yields and a 0.4-point decline in year-over-year load factor. In April 2007, mainline passenger RASM declined by 2.8%. The decrease was due to a 1.8-point year-over-year decline in load factor and a 0.7% decline in passenger yield. Year-over-year mainline total RASM was down 3.2% in May 2007 and 1.5% in April 2007 when compared to the prior year.
Alaska Mainline Capacity and Unit Cost Information
 
 
Alaska Regional Flying Information
As discussed in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2007, Alaska and Horizon entered into a capacity purchase agreement (CPA) effective January 1, 2007. Prior to 2007, there was a revenue sharing arrangement in place whereby Alaska made a payment to Horizon if certain incentive markets resulted in losses for Horizon. Alternatively, Horizon made a payment to Alaska if those incentive markets were profitable. As disclosed previously, we believe Alaska's regional flying costs paid to Horizon will exceed regional flying revenues for those markets in the second quarter, but not to the extent they did in the first quarter of 2007.
Horizon Air
Horizon Total System and Line-of-Business Revenue Information
In May 2007, Horizon's total RASM increased 5.6%, compared to May 2006. The year-over-year total RASM increase in April 2007 was 1.6%. The increase in total RASM is affected by changes in the mix of flying among Horizon's three distinct lines of business: brand flying, capacity purchase agreement flying with Alaska (Alaska CPA), and capacity purchase agreement flying with Frontier Airlines (Frontier CPA).
Horizon brand flying includes those routes in the Horizon system not covered by the Alaska and Frontier CPAs. Horizon bears the revenue risk in those markets and, as a result, traffic, yield and load factor impact revenue recorded by Horizon. In both CPA arrangements, Horizon is insulated from market revenue factors and is guaranteed contractual revenue amounts based on operational capacity. Horizon's revenue from the Alaska CPA and Alaska's related costs are eliminated in consolidation.
 
Horizon's line-of-business information is summarized for April and May as follows:
 
As noted above, the increase in April and May total RASM is affected by changes in the mix of flying among Horizon's three lines of business. The Frontier CPA produces relatively low RASM because of the nature of the contract and the longer haul nature of the flying. As capacity is redeployed from the Frontier CPA to higher RASM Horizon brand and Alaska CPA flying, overall system RASM will increase. However, unit costs increase as well.
Horizon Traffic
Horizon's June total system traffic increased 8.0% to 258.2 million RPMs from 239.0 million flown a year earlier. Capacity during June was 325.9 million ASMs, 8.0% higher than the 301.8 million in June 2006. The passenger load factor for the month was 79.2%, matching the 79.2% in June 2006. The airline carried 674,700 passengers, compared to 608,200 in June 2006.
We also believe it is useful to evaluate operational information for Horizon's "network" flying (which excludes those flights operated as Frontier JetExpress) because it is indicatative of the level of activity for those aircraft with Horizon livery, regardless of the revenue arrangement. June network traffic increased 22.5% to 223.7 million RPMs from 182.6 million flown a year earlier. Network capacity for June was 278.5 million ASMs, 20.1% higher than 231.8 million June 2006. The passenger load factor for the month was a record 80.3%, compared to 78.8% in June 2006. The airline carried 610,000 passengers on network flights, compared to 516,200 in June 2006.
 
Horizon Total System Capacity and Unit Cost Information
 
Other Financial Information
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of June 30, 2007, Air Group cash and short-term investments totaled approximately $986 million.
Fuel Hedging
We are providing unaudited information about fuel price movements and the impact of our hedging program on our financial results. Management believes it is useful to compare results between periods on an "economic basis." is defined as the raw or "into-plane" fuel cost less the cash we receive from hedge counterparties for hedges that settle during the period, offset by the premium expense that we recognize. A reconciliation of to our is presented below. is defined as the raw fuel cost plus the effect of mark-to-market adjustments that we include in our income statement as the value of our fuel-hedging portfolio increases and decreases. A key difference between and is the timing of gain or loss recognition.

Calculation of Economic Fuel Cost Per Gallon
 
Economic fuel expense per gallon for the quarter is expected to be approximately $2.14 for Alaska and $2.20 for Horizon. June adjustments to reflect timing differences resulting from mark-to-market accounting are expected to be a gain of approximately $12.3 million for Air Group, bringing the total loss resulting from these adjustments to approximately $1.8 million for the quarter.
 
The majority of the Company's hedge instruments are call options. Call options are intended to effectively cap our pricing on the crude oil component of fuel prices. With call option contracts, we benefit from the decline in crude oil prices, as there is no downward exposure other than the premiums we pay to enter into the contracts. These premiums are expensed when the contracts settle. Alaska Air Group's future hedge positions are as follows:
 
Operating Fleet Plan
The following table summarizes firm aircraft commitments for Alaska (B737-800) and Horizon (Q400) by year, excluding aircraft that have already been delivered in 2007.
 
In addition to the firm orders noted above, Alaska has options to acquire 48 additional B737-800s and purchase rights for two more. Alaska expects to exercise additional options and purchase rights for B737-800s. Horizon has options to acquire 20 Q400s.
Giving consideration to the current fleet transition plan, the following table displays the currently anticipated fleet count for Alaska and Horizon as of the end of each of the remaining quarters in 2007 and as of December 31, 2006 and 2008:

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
SEATTLE  Alaska Air Group, Inc. (NYSE:ALK) today reported second quarter net income of $46.1 million, or $1.13 per diluted share, compared to net income of $55.5 million, or $1.38 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2006. The prior year results include a restructuring charge of $3.8 million ($2.4 million, after tax, or $0.06 per share) resulting from an offer of voluntary severance to Alaska's flight attendants as part of an early-out program. Both periods include adjustments to reflect timing of gain or loss recognition resulting from mark-to-market fuel hedge accounting. Excluding the impact of these items, the company would have reported net income in the second quarter of 2007 of $47.2 million, or $1.16 per diluted share, compared to net income of $60.3 million, or $1.50 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2006.
"Although our second quarter profit fell short of last year's, the results represent a solid performance in view of significantly higher fuel costs and a softer revenue environment," said Bill Ayer, the company's chairman and chief executive officer.
Alaska Airline's mainline passenger traffic in the second quarter increased 4.2 percent on a capacity increase of 5.2 percent. Load factor declined 0.8 percentage points to 78.5 percent. Alaska's mainline operating revenue per available seat mile (ASM) decreased 2.6 percent and its operating costs per ASM excluding fuel and the special charges mentioned above decreased 7.3 percent. Alaska's total pretax income for the quarter was $80.9 million, compared to a pretax income of $72.5 million in 2006. Excluding the items noted above, Alaska would have reported pretax income of $82.4 million for the quarter compared to pretax income of $79.6 million in the second quarter of 2006.
Horizon Air's combined passenger traffic in the second quarter increased 5.9 percent on an 8.0 percent capacity increase. Load factor decreased by 1.5 percentage points to 75.1 percent. Horizon's combined operating revenue per ASM increased 1.3 percent and its operating costs per ASM excluding fuel increased 7.1 percent. Horizon's total pretax loss for the quarter was $4.9 million, compared to a pretax income of $9.7 million in 2006. Excluding fuel-hedging adjustments, Horizon's pretax loss was $4.6 million for the quarter compared to pretax income of $10.2 million in the second quarter of 2006.
Alaska Air Group had cash and short-term investments at June 30, 2007 of $988 million.
A summary of financial and statistical data for Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air, as well as a reconciliation of the reported non-GAAP financial measures, can be found on pages 7 through 11.

Pursuant to Item 10 of Regulation S-K, we are providing disclosure of the reconciliation of reported non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable financial measures reported on a GAAP basis. The non-GAAP financial measures provide management the ability to measure and monitor performance both with and without the cost of aircraft fuel (including the gains and losses associated with our fuel hedging program where appropriate,) fleet transition costs, and restructuring charges and adjustments. Because the cost and availability of aircraft fuel are subject to many economic and political factors beyond our control and we record changes in the fair value of our hedge portfolio in our income statement, it is our view that the measurement and monitoring of performance without fuel is important. In addition, we believe the disclosure of financial performance without fleet transition costs and restructuring charges and adjustments is useful to investors. Finally, these non-GAAP financial measures are also more comparable to financial measures reported to the Department of Transportation by other major airlines.
The following tables reconcile our non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for both Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Horizon Air Industries, Inc.:

Our forecast of fuel costs is based on anticipated gallons consumed and estimated fuel cost per gallon. The estimate also includes the expected benefit from settled hedges. Given the volatility of fuel prices and the mark-to-market adjustments on our fuel hedge portfolio, readers should be cautioned that actual fuel expense will likely differ from the forecast above.

Mainline capacity during July was 2.191 billion ASMs, 3.5% higher than the 2.116 billion in July 2006. The mainline passenger load factor (the percentage of available seats occupied by fare-paying passengers) for the month was 83.4%, compared to 82.8% in July 2006. The airline carried 1,734,800 passengers compared to 1,674,300 in July 2006.
In July 2007, year-over-year mainline RASM was down 1.2%, compared to July 2006. Mainline passenger RASM during the month was down 1.4% compared to the prior year, primarily due to a decline in passenger yield, partially offset by the 0.6-point increase in load factor.
 
Alaska Regional Flying
As discussed in our previous filings, Alaska and Horizon entered into a Capacity Purchase Agreement (CPA) effective January 1, 2007, whereby Alaska purchases capacity on certain routes ("incentive markets") from Horizon. Under this agreement, the actual passenger revenue from the incentive markets is identified as "Passenger revenueregional flying" and the associated costs are identified as "Regional flying costs" on Alaska's statement of operations. During the first six months of 2007, regional flying expenses exceeded regional passenger revenues by $13.2 million. However, revenues in the incentive markets covered by the CPA are highly seasonal in nature and, accordingly, we expect that passenger revenue  regional flying will exceed regional flying costs in the third quarter but fall below costs in the fourth quarter, resulting in a full-year loss from regional flying in excess of the amount recorded in the first six months of 2007, but not a multiple of it.
Horizon Air
Total System Capacity and Unit Cost Forecast
 
Horizon's cost per ASM includes the expected loss on the sublease of Q200 aircraft to a third party. We expect the loss will be approximately $1.3 million per aircraft, which will be recorded when the aircraft leave our operating fleet. Currently, we expect to deliver three of the Q200s to the third party during the current quarter.
Horizon Traffic and Revenue
Horizon's combined July traffic increased 18.2% to 294.3 million RPMs from 248.9 million flown a year earlier. The airline carried 732,000 passengers compared to 627,100 in July 2006.
For Horizon's network flying (which excludes those flights operated as Frontier JetExpress), July traffic increased 31.9% to 254.4 million RPMs from 192.9 million flown a year earlier. The airline carried 662,700 passengers on the network flights, compared to 531,300 in July 2006.
 
Horizon's line-of-business information for July is summarized as follows. Horizon "brand" flying includes those routes in the Horizon system not covered by either of its Capacity Purchase Arrangements. In both CPA arrangements, Horizon is insulated from market revenue factors and is guaranteed contractual revenue amounts based on operational capacity. As a result, yield and load factor information is not presented. Horizon bears the revenue risk in its brand flying markets. Revenue from the Alaska CPA is eliminated in consolidation.

Pursuant to 17 CFR Part 243 ("Regulation FD"), the Company is submitting information relating to its financial and operational outlook for 2007. This report includes information regarding forecasts of available seat miles (ASMs), cost per available seat mile (CASM) excluding fuel consumption, as well as certain actual results for revenue passenger miles (RPMs), load factor and revenue per available seat mile (RASM), for its subsidiaries Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Horizon Air Industries, Inc. Our disclosure of operating cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel, provides us the ability to measure and monitor our performance without these items. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is total operating expense per available seat mile. However, due to the large fluctuations in fuel prices, we are unable to predict total operating expense for any future period with any degree of certainty. In addition, we believe the disclosure of fuel expense on an economic basis is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. Please see the cautionary statement under "Forward-Looking Information."
In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in this report shall not be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), nor shall such information be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.

Alaska Airlines
Alaska Airlines Mainline Capacity and Unit Cost Forecast
The information for Alaska Airlines below reflects "mainline" information, which excludes contract flying provided by Horizon and contract flying between Anchorage and Dutch Harbor, AK, provided by a third party. As described in previous filings, Alaska reclassified the revenues and costs for prior periods that are associated with the Dutch Harbor flying. As a result of this reclassification, CASM excluding fuel and other noted items for the third quarter of 2006 that was originally reported as 7.33 cents will now be reported as 7.27 cents. Mainline total RASM that was originally reported as 12.36 cents will now be reported as 12.29 cents.
 
Alaska Airlines Mainline Traffic and Revenue
Alaska's August mainline traffic increased 5.4% to 1.812 billion RPMs from 1.719 billion flown a year earlier. Mainline capacity during August was 2.175 billion ASMs, 2.3% higher than the 2.127 billion in August 2006. The mainline passenger load factor (the percentage of available seats occupied by fare-paying passengers) for the month was 83.3%, compared to 80.8% in August 2006. The airline carried 1,751,700 passengers compared to 1,669,800 in August 2006.
 
As of September 10, the advance booked load factor for Alaska mainline was down 1-2% for September and flat for October.
In August 2007, year-over-year mainline RASM was up 5.0%, compared to August 2006. Mainline passenger RASM was up 4.9% as a result of the 2.5-point increase in load factor and modestly higher yields.
In July 2007, year-over-year mainline RASM was down 1.2%, compared to July 2006. Mainline passenger RASM during the month was down 1.4% compared to the prior year, primarily due to a decline in passenger yield, partially offset by the 0.6-point increase in load factor.
Alaska Airlines Purchased Capacity Flying
As discussed in our previous filings, Alaska Airlines entered into a Capacity Purchase Agreement (CPA) with Horizon effective January 1, 2007, whereby Alaska purchases capacity on certain routes ("incentive markets") from Horizon. In addition, Alaska has a capacity purchase agreement with a third party for service between Anchorage and Dutch Harbor, AK. Under these agreements, the actual passenger revenue from the incentive markets and between Anchorage and Dutch Harbor is identified as "Passenger revenue  purchased capacity" and the associated costs are identified as "Costs of purchased capacity flying" on Alaska Airlines' statement of operations. During the first six months of 2007, expenses associated with purchased capacity exceeded the related revenues by $13.2 million. However, revenues in the incentive markets covered by the CPA with Horizon are highly seasonal in nature and, accordingly, we expect that passenger revenuepurchased capacity will exceed the related costs in the third quarter but fall below costs in the fourth quarter, resulting in a full-year loss from purchased capacity flying in excess of the amount recorded in the first six months of 2007, but not a multiple of it. This guidance is unchanged from prior disclosures.
Horizon Air
On September 12, Horizon grounded 19 of its 33 Bombardier Q400 turboprops as a precautionary move following an all-operator message from Bombardier Aerospace of Canada. On September 13, in response to a Transport Canada airworthiness directive (AD), Horizon initiated the inspection of the landing gear of all of its Q400 fleet. The AD was produced in the wake of two landing gear failure incidents involving SAS-affiliated airlines in Europe. Horizon, which has operated the Canadian-manufactured Q400 since 2001, has never experienced any issues like those SAS recently encountered.
As a result of these developments, Horizon canceled approximately 300 flights scheduled to operate on September 12 and 13, although 30 of those flights were re-scheduled with higher capacity Alaska Airlines jets. By Saturday, September 15, Horizon expects to be very close to normal operations as inspected aircraft are brought back online. Aircraft will be returned to service and Horizon flights will be reinstated as the inspections are completed successfully.
The information below the impact of the flight cancellations that have resulted from this development. It is likely that the cancellations will negatively impact passenger revenue, capacity, traffic and unit costs for the third quarter, although the amount of the impact cannot yet be quantified.

Horizon Total System Capacity and Unit Cost Forecast **
 
Horizon's cost per ASM includes the expected loss on the sublease of Q200 aircraft to a third party. We expect the loss will be approximately $1.3 million per aircraft, which will be recorded when the aircraft leave our operating fleet. Currently, we expect to deliver three of the Q200s to the third party during the current quarter.
Horizon Traffic and Revenue
Horizon's total August traffic increased 19.8% to 304.6 million RPMs from 254.3 million flown a year earlier. The airline carried 762,500 passengers compared to 638,000 in August 2006.
For Horizon's network flying (which excludes those flights operated as Frontier JetExpress), August traffic increased 29.5% to 266.7 million RPMs from 206.0 million flown a year earlier. The airline carried 695,400 passengers on the network flights, compared to 557,200 in August 2006.
Horizon's line-of-business information for August is summarized below. In both of Horizon's CPA arrangements, Horizon is insulated from market revenue factors and is guaranteed contractual revenue amounts based on operational capacity. As a result, yield and load factor information is not presented.
August 2007
 
 
As previously reported, July RASM decreased 7.2% and 4.4% for Brand and Alaska CPA flying, respectively, and increased 7.7% for Frontier CPA flying.
Horizon "brand" flying includes those routes in the Horizon system not covered by either of its capacity purchase arrangements. Horizon bears the revenue risk in its brand flying markets. Revenue from the Alaska CPA is eliminated in consolidation.

Item 8.01 Other Events
On September 14, 2007, Horizon Air issued a press release providing updated information on the progress of the landing gear inspections of its Bombardier Q400 turboprops and related flight cancellations. As reported previously, the unplanned inspections are in response to a Transport Canada airworthiness directive (AD) issued earlier this week.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
SEATTLE  Nearly half of the Bombardier Aerospace Q400 turboprops in Horizon Air's fleet  16 of 33 aircraft  have been inspected, as per Transport Canada and Bombardier specifications, and returned to service. The airline anticipates it will be able to inspect and return to service additional aircraft at the rate of two a day through Monday.
On Friday, Sept. 14, Horizon canceled 89 flights, a 42 percent improvement from the previous day. While flights will continue to be reinstated as inspections are completed, some cancellations are also expected over the weekend. Schedule adjustments will be in central reservations systems as follows, all Pacific time: Saturday flights (by 3 p.m. Friday), Sunday flights (by 6 p.m. Friday), and Monday flights (by 6 p.m. Saturday).
On Tuesday, as inspections proceed on the remaining Q400s in its fleet, Horizon intends to introduce a modified firm schedule that will provide service to all of its markets and accommodate most all of its currently booked customers. The new schedule will be in central reservations systems by 12 p.m. (Pacific time) Sunday and will be in effect at least through Monday, Sept. 24. By late next week, Horizon will determine whether it can return to its regular schedule on Tuesday, Sept. 25.
Horizon is asking its customers flying during this period to check on the status of their flights via horizonair.com or by calling the reservations center at 800-547-9308. Customers on affected Horizon flights are being offered refunds, being allowed to cancel at no charge, or are being re-accommodated without any change fee.
The aircraft inspections are in response to a Transport Canada airworthiness directive (AD) issued Wednesday afternoon. Transport Canada's AD was produced in the wake of two landing gear failure incidents involving SAS-affiliated airlines in Europe. Horizon, which has operated the Canadian-manufactured Q400 since 2001, has never experienced any issues like those SAS recently encountered.
Late Thursday, revised inspection guidance was received and acted upon. As the situation develops, Horizon will comply with any additional guidance from the manufacturer and regulatory authorities, which could result in additional schedule adjustments.
"With safety as our foremost consideration, we're working diligently to respond to directives from the manufacturers and regulatory authorities as we receive them." said Jeff Pinneo, president and CEO. "We remain focused on minimizing any inconvenience to our customers as we progress toward the restoration of our full flight schedule."
Horizon currently has a fleet of 74 aircraft, 33 of which are 74/76 seat Q400s. Horizon operates two other aircraft types in its all-Bombardier fleet, neither of which is subject to these inspections: 70-seat CRJ-700 regional jets and 37-seat Q200 turboprops
Horizon serves 48 cities throughout California, Colorado, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, and British Columbia and Alberta. Together, Horizon Air and Alaska Airlines serve 92 cities and are subsidiaries of Alaska Air Group, Inc. (NYSE:ALK).

Alaska Airlines
Alaska Airlines Mainline Capacity and Unit Cost Forecast
The information for Alaska Airlines below reflects "mainline" information, which excludes contract flying provided by Horizon and contract flying between Anchorage and Dutch Harbor, AK, provided by a third party. As described in previous filings, Alaska reclassified the revenues and costs for prior periods that are associated with the Dutch Harbor flying. As a result of this reclassification, CASM excluding fuel and other noted items for the third quarter of 2006 that was originally reported as 7.33 cents will now be reported as 7.27 cents. Mainline total RASM that was originally reported as 12.36 cents will now be reported as 12.29 cents.
 
Alaska Airlines Mainline Traffic and Revenue
Alaska's September mainline traffic increased 1.7% to 1.427 billion RPMs from 1.403 billion flown a year earlier. Mainline capacity during September was 1.988 billion ASMs, 4.2% higher than the 1.907 billion in September 2006. The mainline passenger load factor (the percentage of available seats occupied by fare-paying passengers) for the month was 71.8%, compared to 73.6% in September 2006. The airline carried 1,391,300 passengers compared to 1,365,700 in September 2006.
 
In August 2007, year-over-year mainline RASM was up 5.0%, compared to August 2006. Mainline passenger RASM was up 4.9% as a result of 2.5-point increase in load factor and modestly higher yields.
In July 2007, year-over-year mainline RASM was down 1.2% compared to July 2006. Mainline passenger RASM during the month was down 1.4% compared to the prior year, primarily due to a decline in passenger yield, partially offset by the 0.6-point increase in load factor.
Alaska Purchased Capacity Flying
As discussed in our previous filings, Alaska and Horizon entered into a Capacity Purchase Agreement (CPA) effective January 1, 2007, whereby Alaska purchases capacity on certain routes ("incentive markets") from Horizon. In addition, Alaska has a capacity purchase agreement with a third party for service between Anchorage and Dutch Harbor, AK. Under these agreements, the actual passenger revenue from the incentive markets and between Anchorage and Dutch Harbor is identified as "Passenger revenue  purchased capacity" and the associated costs are identified as "Purchased capacity costs" on Alaska Airlines statement of operations. During the first six months of 2007, expenses associated with purchased capacity exceeded the related revenues by $13.2 million. However, revenues in the incentive markets covered by the CPA with Horizon are highly seasonal in nature and, accordingly, we expect that passenger revenue  purchased capacity will exceed purchased capacity costs in the third quarter, but fall below costs in the fourth quarter, resulting in a full-year loss from purchased capacity flying in excess of the amount recorded in the first six months of 2007, but not a multiple of it. This guidance is unchanged from prior disclosures.
Horizon Air
On September 12, Horizon temporarily grounded 19 of its 33 Bombardier Q400 turboprops as a precautionary move following an all-operator message from Bombardier Aerospace of Canada. On September 13, in response to a Transport Canada airworthiness directive (AD), Horizon initiated the inspection of the landing gear on its entire Q400 fleet. The AD was produced in the wake of two landing gear failure incidents involving SAS-affiliated airlines in Europe. Horizon, which has operated the Canadian-manufactured Q400 since 2001, has never experienced any issues like those SAS encountered.
Over the 13-day inspection period, Horizon had to cancel approximately 5% of its planned capacity for the month of September, although some of the impact on customers was offset in several cases by the substitution of Alaska aircraft in certain key markets. The full schedule was back on line on Tuesday, September 25.
The information below reflects the impact of the flight cancellations that have resulted from this development.
 
 
Horizon's cost per ASM includes the expected loss on the sublease of Q200 aircraft to a third party. We expect the loss will be approximately $1.3 million per aircraft, which will be recorded when the aircraft leave our operating fleet. We delivered three of the Q200s to the third party during the current quarter.
Horizon Traffic and Revenue
Horizon's total September traffic increased 9.2% to 238.6 million RPMs from 218.5 million flown a year earlier. Capacity during September was 334.6 million ASMs, 10.9 % higher than the 301.6 million in September 2006. The airline carried 610,100 passengers compared to 567,200 in September 2006.
For Horizon's network flying (which excludes those flights operated as Frontier JetExpress), September traffic increased 16.9% to 207.9 million RPMs from 177.8 million flown a year earlier. The airline carried 554,900 passengers on the network flights, compared to 502,000 in September 2006.
Horizon's September information for line-of-business capacity mix and load factor is presented below:

Horizon "brand" flying includes those routes in the Horizon system not covered by either of its capacity purchase arrangements. Horizon bears the revenue risk in its brand flying markets. Revenue from the Alaska CPA is eliminated in consolidation.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of September 30, 2007, Air Group cash and short-term investments totaled approximately $882 million.
 
Fuel Hedging

Management believes it is useful to compare results between periods on an "economic basis." is defined as the raw or "into-plane" fuel cost less the cash we receive from hedge counterparties for hedges that settle during the period, offset by the premium expense that we recognize. A reconciliation of to our is presented below. is defined as the raw fuel cost plus the effect of mark-to-market adjustments that we include in our income statement as the value of our fuel-hedging portfolio increases and decreases. A key difference between and is the timing of gain or loss recognition. September information is not yet available.

Calculation of Economic Fuel Cost Per Gallon
 
Economic fuel expense per gallon for the quarter is expected to be approximately $2.24 for Alaska and $2.28 for Horizon. The net adjustment to reflect timing of gain or loss recognition resulting from mark-to-market accounting is expected to be a gain of approximately $4.8 million for the quarter.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
SEATTLE  Alaska Air Group, Inc. (NYSE:ALK) today reported a third quarter net income of $85.8 million, or $2.11 per diluted share, compared to net loss of $17.4 million, or $0.44 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2006. The prior year results include charges related to the buyout of five MD-80 leases and a voluntary severance program in connection with a new labor contract. Both periods include adjustments resulting from mark-to-market fuel hedge accounting. Excluding the impact of these items, the company would have reported net income in the third quarter of 2007 of $82.8 million, or $2.03 per diluted share, compared to net income of $77.9 million, or $1.93 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2006. A reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure can be found on page 6.
"Our record third quarter profit is the result of continued efforts to improve revenue, lower unit costs, and maintain solid load factors. These results reflect the hard work of employees at both Alaska and Horizon. We continue to focus on improving our operation and addressing cost pressures, not the least of which is the skyrocketing price of fuel," said Bill Ayer, the company's chairman and chief executive officer.
Alaska Airline's mainline passenger traffic in the third quarter increased 4.0 percent on a capacity increase of 3.3 percent. Load factor increased by 0.5 percentage points to 79.7 percent. Alaska's mainline operating revenue per available seat mile (ASM) increased 1.5 percent and its operating costs per ASM excluding fuel and the special items mentioned above decreased 1.1 percent from the prior year. Alaska's total pretax income for the quarter was $133.7 million, compared to a pretax loss of $27.9 million in 2006. Excluding the items noted above, Alaska would have reported pretax income of $129.7 million for the quarter compared to pretax income of $115.3 million in the third quarter of 2006.
Horizon Air's combined passenger traffic in the third quarter increased 15.9 percent on a 14.0 percent capacity increase. Load factor increased by 1.3 percentage points to 77.2 percent. Horizon's combined operating revenue per ASM decreased 2.0 percent and its operating costs per
 
ASM excluding fuel decreased 2.2 percent. Horizon's total pretax income for the quarter was $8.3 million, compared to a pretax income of $5.9 million in 2006. Excluding fuel-hedge related mark-to-market adjustments, Horizon's pretax income was $7.5 million for the quarter compared to pretax income of $15.1 million in the third quarter of 2006.
Alaska Air Group had cash and short-term investments at September 30, 2007 of $888 million. The company repurchased 210,000 shares of its common stock for $5.0 million during the third quarter pursuant to the share repurchase program of $100 million authorized by the Board of Directors in September 2007. As of yesterday, the company had repurchased 800,000 shares of its common stock for a total of $19.7 million.
A summary of financial and statistical data for Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air, as well as a reconciliation of the reported non-GAAP financial measures, can be found on pages 7 through 11.

Pursuant to 17 CFR Part 243 ("Regulation FD"), the Company is submitting information relating to its financial and operational outlook for 2007. This report includes information regarding forecasts of available seat miles (ASMs), cost per available seat mile (CASM) excluding fuel consumption, as well as certain actual results for revenue passenger miles (RPMs), load factor and revenue per available seat mile (RASM), for its subsidiaries Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Horizon Air Industries, Inc. Our disclosure of operating cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel, provides us the ability to measure and monitor our performance without these items. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is total operating expense per available seat mile. However, due to the large fluctuations in fuel prices, we are unable to predict total operating expense for any future period with any degree of certainty. In addition, we believe the disclosure of fuel expense on an economic basis is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. Please see the cautionary statement under "Forward-Looking Information."
In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in this report shall not be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), nor shall such information be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing. This report will not be deemed an admission as to the materiality of any information required to be disclosed solely to satisfy the requirements of Regulation FD.
Alaska Airlines
Alaska Airlines Mainline Capacity and Unit Cost Forecast
The information for Alaska Airlines below reflects mainline information, which excludes contract flying provided by Horizon and contract flying between Anchorage and Dutch Harbor, AK, provided by a third party. As described in previous filings, Alaska reclassified the revenues and costs for prior periods that are associated with the Dutch Harbor flying. As a result of this reclassification, CASM excluding fuel and other noted items for the fourth quarter of 2006 that was originally reported as 8.06 cents will now be reported as 8.00 cents. Mainline total RASM that was originally reported as 10.99 cents will now be reported as 10.93 cents.
 
 
Alaska Airlines Mainline Traffic and Revenue
Alaska's October mainline traffic increased 4.1% to 1.431 billion RPMs from 1.374 billion flown a year earlier. Mainline capacity during October was 1.998 billion ASMs, 4.1% higher than the 1.919 billion in October 2006. The mainline passenger load factor (the percentage of available seats occupied by fare-paying passengers) for the month was 71.6%, unchanged from October 2006. The airline carried 1,362,000 passengers compared to 1,333,300 in October 2006.
 
In October 2007, year-over-year mainline RASM was up 4.1%, compared to October 2006. Mainline passenger RASM was up 3.6% because of higher yields.
Alaska Purchased Capacity Flying
As discussed in our previous filings, Alaska and Horizon entered into a Capacity Purchase Agreement (CPA) effective January 1, 2007, whereby Alaska purchases capacity on certain routes ("incentive markets") from Horizon. In addition, Alaska has a capacity purchase agreement with a third party for service between Anchorage and Dutch Harbor, AK. Under these agreements, the actual passenger revenue from the incentive markets and between Anchorage and Dutch Harbor is identified as "Passenger revenue  purchased capacity" and the associated costs are identified as "Purchased capacity costs" on Alaska Airlines statement of operations. During the first nine months of 2007, expenses associated with purchased capacity exceeded the related revenues by $12.6 million. Revenues in the incentive markets covered by the CPA with Horizon are highly seasonal in nature and, accordingly, we expect that passenger revenue  purchased capacity will fall below costs in the fourth quarter, resulting in a full-year loss from purchased capacity flying in excess of the amount recorded in the first nine months of 2007. This guidance is unchanged from prior disclosures.
Horizon Air
 
 
Our estimated cost per ASM excluding fuel increased from our prior guidance of 14.9  15.0 cents due to higher estimated maintenance costs and wages. Horizon's CASM includes the expected loss on the sublease of Q200 aircraft to a third party. We expect the loss will be approximately $1.3 million per aircraft, which will be recorded when the aircraft leave our operating fleet. We expect to deliver three of the Q200s to the third party during the current quarter.
Horizon Traffic and Revenue
Horizon's total October traffic increased 10.5% to 252.5 million RPMs from 228.5 million flown a year earlier. Total capacity during October was 350.8 million ASMs, 12.1 % higher than the 313.0 million in October 2006. The airline carried 666,900 passengers compared to 586,400 in October 2006.
For Horizon's network flying (which excludes those flights operated as Frontier JetExpress), October traffic increased 25.4% to 223.5 million RPMs from 178.2 million flown a year earlier. The airline carried 616,500 passengers on the network flights, compared to 508,900 in October 2006.
 
Horizon's October information for line-of-business traffic and revenue information is presented below. In both CPA arrangements, Horizon is insulated from market revenue factors and is guaranteed contractual revenue amounts based on operational capacity. As a result, yield and load factor information is not presented for CPA arrangements.
October 2007
 
Horizon "brand" flying includes those routes in the Horizon system not covered by either of its capacity purchase arrangements. Horizon bears the revenue risk in its brand flying markets. Revenue from the Alaska CPA is eliminated in consolidation.
Other Financial Information
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of October 31, 2007, Air Group cash and short-term investments totaled approximately $900 million.
Share Repurchase Program
Through November 26, 2007, the Company had repurchased 1,625,982 shares of its common stock for approximately $39.0 million.

Alaska Airlines
Alaska Airlines Mainline Capacity and Unit Cost Forecast
The information for Alaska Airlines below reflects mainline information, which excludes contract flying provided by Horizon and contract flying between Anchorage and Dutch Harbor, AK, provided by a third party. As described in previous filings, Alaska reclassified the revenues and costs for prior periods that are associated with the Dutch Harbor flying. As a result of this reclassification, CASM excluding fuel and other noted items for the fourth quarter of 2006 that was originally reported as 8.06 cents will now be reported as 8.00 cents. Mainline total RASM that was originally reported as 10.99 cents will now be reported as 10.93 cents.
 
 
 
Alaska Airlines Mainline Traffic and Revenue
Alaska's November mainline traffic increased 7.6% to 1.506 billion RPMs from 1.400 billion flown a year earlier. Mainline capacity during November was 1.963 billion ASMs, 4.5% higher than the 1.879 billion in November 2006. The mainline passenger load factor (the percentage of available seats occupied by fare-paying passengers) for the month was 76.7%, compared to 74.5% in November 2006. The airline carried 1,394,300 passengers compared to 1,360,900 in November 2006.
In November 2007, mainline passenger RASM increased 3.4% compared to November 2006 as a result of the 2.2-point increase in load factors and slightly higher yields. Mainline total RASM increased by 1.8%. The total RASM increase was less than the PRASM increase because of lower Mileage Plan and freight and mail revenues.
In October 2007, year-over-year mainline RASM was up 4.1%, compared to October 2006. Mainline passenger RASM was up 3.6% because of higher yields.
Alaska Purchased Capacity Flying
As discussed in our previous filings, Alaska and Horizon entered into a Capacity Purchase Agreement (CPA) effective January 1, 2007, whereby Alaska purchases capacity on certain routes ("incentive markets") from Horizon. In addition, Alaska has a capacity purchase agreement with a third party for service between Anchorage and Dutch Harbor, AK. Under these agreements, the actual passenger revenue from the incentive markets and between Anchorage and Dutch Harbor is identified as "Passenger revenue  purchased capacity" and the associated costs are identified as "Purchased capacity costs" on Alaska Airlines statement of operations. During the first nine months of 2007, expenses associated with purchased capacity exceeded the related revenues by $12.6 million.
Revenues in the incentive markets covered by the CPA with Horizon are highly seasonal in nature and, accordingly, we expect that "Passenger revenue  purchased capacity" will fall below costs in the fourth quarter, resulting in a full-year loss from purchased capacity flying in excess of the amount recorded in the first nine months of 2007. This is unchanged from previous guidance.
Horizon Air
Horizon Total System Capacity and Unit Cost Forecast
 
 
 
Horizon's CASM includes the expected loss on the sublease of Q200 aircraft to a third party. We expect the loss will be approximately $1.3 million per aircraft, which will be recorded when the aircraft leave our operating fleet. We expect to deliver three of the Q200s to the third party during the current quarter, for a total of approximately $3.9 million.
Horizon Traffic and Revenue
Horizon's total November traffic increased 10.5% to 238.0 million RPMs from 215.3 million flown a year earlier. Total capacity during November was 324.0 million ASMs, 11.0 % higher than the 291.9 million in November 2006. The airline carried 626,200 passengers compared to 548,400 in November 2006.
For Horizon's network flying (which excludes those flights operated as Frontier JetExpress), November traffic increased 31.0% to 220.8 million RPMs from 168.5 million flown a year earlier. The airline carried 598,700 passengers on the network flights, compared to 475,400 in November 2006.
Horizon's November information for line-of-business traffic and revenue information is presented below. In both CPA arrangements, Horizon is insulated from market revenue factors and is guaranteed contractual revenue amounts based on operational capacity. As a result, yield and load factor information is not presented.
November 2007
 
As previously reported, October RASM decreased 13.4% and 2.5% for Brand and Alaska CPA flying, respectively, and increased 1.5% for Frontier CPA flying and 0.5% for the total system overall.
Horizon brand flying includes those routes in the Horizon system not covered by either of its capacity purchase arrangements. Horizon bears the revenue risk in its brand flying markets. Revenue from the Alaska CPA is eliminated in consolidation. Horizon ceased flying for Frontier at the end of November.

Calculation of Economic Fuel Cost Per Gallon
 
Assuming $90 per barrel oil for the rest of 2007, we expect economic fuel cost per gallon to be approximately $2.46 for Alaska and $2.54 for Horizon for the fourth quarter.

Operating Fleet Plan
The following table summarizes firm aircraft commitments for Alaska (B737-800) and Horizon (Q400) by year, excluding aircraft that have already been delivered through December 19, 2007.
 
In addition to the firm orders noted above, Alaska has options to acquire 45 additional B737-800s and Horizon has options to acquire 20 Q400s.
 
Giving consideration to the current fleet transition plans for both Alaska and Horizon, the following table displays our actual and expected fleet count for the dates reflected below:
 
 
 
 
In December, we discovered an error in our calculation of deferred Mileage Plan revenue that existed as of September 30, 2007. The error resulted in a $6.3 million overstatement of passenger revenue in the third quarter ($4.0 million, net of tax, or $0.10 per diluted share). We have concluded that this item is not material, and in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, we will make appropriate adjustments to our previously filed financial statements when they are presented in future Exchange Act reports, including the unaudited Selected Quarterly Consolidated Financial Information in our 2007 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Because of the error in the timing of the recognition of this revenue, deferred revenue on our balance sheet at September 30, 2007 was understated by $6.3 million, or approximately 1% of the total Mileage Plan deferred revenue and related liabilities of $617 million, as corrected.
To assist in understanding the effects of this item, we set forth below the following unaudited summary adjusted data for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2007.

In our third quarter earnings release dated October 25, 2007, we also reported adjusted pretax and net earnings and other non-GAAP measures, which exclude certain items such as fleet transition costs and mark-to-market adjustments related to our fuel hedge portfolio. The adjustment impacts those non-GAAP results by the same amount.

Section 1. Right to Indemnification
Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved (including, without limitation, as a witness) in any actual or threatened action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a "proceeding"), by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a Director or officer of the corporation or that, being or having been such a Director or officer or employee of the corporation, he or she is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a Director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan (hereinafter an "indemnitee"), whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a Director, officer, employee or agent or in any other capacity while serving as a Director, officer, employee or agent, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the corporation to the full extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than permitted prior thereto) or by other applicable law as then in effect, against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts to be paid in settlement) actually and reasonably incurred or suffered by such indemnitee in connection therewith and such indemnification shall continue as to an indemnitee who has ceased to be a Director, officer, employee, or agent and shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and administrators; provided, however, that except as provided in Section 2 with respect to proceedings seeking to enforce rights to

indemnification, the corporation shall indemnify any such indemnitee seeking indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors of the corporation. The right to indemnification conferred in this Section shall be a contract right and shall include the right to be paid by the corporation the expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition (hereinafter an "advancement of expenses"); provided, however, that if the Delaware General Corporations Law requires, an advancement of expenses incurred by an indemnitee in his or her capacity as a Director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such indemnitee including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) shall be made only upon delivery to the corporation of an undertaking (hereinafter an "undertaking"), by or on behalf of such indemnitee to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal that such indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under this Section 1 or otherwise.
Section 2. Right of Indemnitee to Bring Suit.
If a claim under Section 1 is not paid in full by the corporation within sixty days after a written claim has been received by the corporation, except in the case of a claim for advancement of expenses, in which case the applicable period shall be twenty days, the indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit against the corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim. If successful in whole or in part in any such suit, the indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting such suit. The indemnitee shall be presumed to be entitled to indemnification under this Article upon submission of a written claim (and, in an action brought to enforce a claim for advancement of expenses, where the required undertaking, if any is required, has been tendered to the corporation), and thereafter the corporation shall have the burden of proof to overcome the presumption that the indemnitee is not so entitled. Neither the failure of the corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such suit that indemnification of the indemnitee is proper in the circumstances nor an actual determination by the corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification shall be a defense to the suit or create a presumption that the indemnitee is not so entitled.
.
Section 3. Nonexclusivity of Rights
The right to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses conferred in this Article shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise. Notwithstanding any amendment to or repeal of this Article, any indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification in accordance with the provisions hereof and thereof with respect to any acts or omissions of such indemnitee occurring prior to such amendment or repeal.
.
Section 4. Insurance, Contracts and Funding
The corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any Director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the Delaware General Corporation Law. The corporation may without further stockholder approval, enter into contracts with any indemnitee in furtherance of the provisions of this Article and may create a trust fund, grant a security interest or use other means (including, without limitation, a letter of credit) to ensure the payment of such amounts as may be necessary to effect indemnification as provided in this Article.

FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION
This report contains forward-looking statements subject to the safe harbor protection provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

For a discussion of these and other risk factors, see Item 1A of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006. All of the forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the risk factors discussed therein. These risk factors may not be exhaustive. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risk factors emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict such new risk factors, nor can it assess the impact, if any, of such new risk factors on our business or events described in any forward-looking statements. We expressly disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date of this report to conform them to actual results.

Pursuant to 17 CFR Part 243 ("Regulation FD"), the Company is submitting information relating to its financial and operational outlook for the fourth quarter of 2007. This report includes information regarding forecasts of available seat miles (ASMs), cost per available seat mile (CASM) excluding fuel consumption, as well as certain actual results for revenue passenger miles (RPMs), load factor and revenue per available seat mile (RASM), for its subsidiaries Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Horizon Air Industries, Inc. Our disclosure of operating cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel, provides us the ability to measure and monitor our performance without these items. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is total operating expense per available seat mile. However, due to the large fluctuations in fuel prices, we are unable to predict total operating expense for any future period with any degree of certainty. In addition, we believe the disclosure of fuel expense on an economic basis is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. Please see the cautionary statement under "Forward-Looking Information."
In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in this Item shall not be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), nor shall such information be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing. This report will not be deemed an admission as to the materiality of any information required to be disclosed solely to satisfy the requirements of Regulation FD.
Alaska Airlines
Alaska Airlines Mainline Capacity and Unit Cost Forecast
The information for Alaska Airlines below reflects mainline information, which excludes contract flying provided by Horizon and contract flying between Anchorage and Dutch Harbor, AK, provided by a third party. As described in previous filings, Alaska reclassified the revenues and costs for prior periods that are associated with the Dutch Harbor flying. As a result of this reclassification, CASM excluding fuel and other noted items for the fourth quarter of 2006 that was originally reported as 8.06 cents will now be reported as 8.00 cents. Mainline total RASM that was originally reported as 10.99 cents will now be reported as 10.93 cents.
 
 
 
Alaska Airlines Mainline Traffic and Revenue
Alaska's December mainline traffic increased 6.3% to 1.561 billion RPMs from 1.469 billion flown a year earlier. Mainline capacity during December was 2.059 billion ASMs, 5.2% higher than the 1.957 billion in December 2006. The mainline passenger load factor (the percentage of available seats occupied by fare-paying passengers) for the month was 75.8%, compared to 75.1% in December 2006. The airline carried 1,434,600 passengers compared to 1,412,400 in December 2006.
As previously reported, November 2007 mainline passenger RASM increased 3.4% compared to November 2006. Mainline total RASM increased by 1.8%. October 2007 mainline passenger RASM was up 3.6% because of higher yields. Mainline total RASM was up 4.1% compared to October 2006.
Alaska Purchased Capacity Flying
As discussed in our previous filings, Alaska and Horizon entered into a Capacity Purchase Agreement (CPA) effective January 1, 2007, whereby Alaska purchases capacity on certain routes ("incentive markets") from Horizon. In addition, Alaska has a capacity purchase agreement with a third party for service between Anchorage and Dutch Harbor, AK. Under these agreements, the actual passenger revenue from the incentive markets and between Anchorage and Dutch Harbor is identified as "Passenger revenue  purchased capacity" and the associated costs are identified as "Purchased capacity costs" on Alaska Airlines statement of operations. During the first nine months of 2007, expenses associated with purchased capacity exceeded the related revenues by $12.6 million
Revenues in the incentive markets covered by the CPA with Horizon are highly seasonal in nature and, accordingly, we expect that "Passenger revenue  purchased capacity" will again fall below costs in the fourth quarter, resulting in a full-year loss from purchased capacity flying in excess of the amount recorded in the first nine months of 2007. For the first two months of the fourth quarter, expenses exceeded related revenues by approximately $5.6 million.
Horizon Air
 
Our estimated cost per ASM excluding fuel decreased from our prior guidance of 14.9 15.0 cents due primarily to lower than expected maintenance costs because of the timing of certain maintenance events. Horizon's CASM includes the expected loss on the sublease of Q200 aircraft to a third party. We expect the loss will be approximately $1.3 million per aircraft, which will be recorded when the aircraft leave our operating fleet. We delivered three of the Q200s to the third party during the fourth quarter, for a total charge of approximately $3.9 million.
 
Horizon Traffic and Revenue
Horizon's total December traffic increased 7.8% to 232.6 million RPMs from 215.8 million flown a year earlier. Total capacity during December was 321.2 million ASMs, 7.8 % higher than the 298.0 million in December 2006. The airline carried 637,000 passengers compared to 553,200 in December 2006. Passenger load factor was unchanged at 72.4%. December 2006 statistics include Frontier JetExpress flying, but December 2007 statistics represent only Horizon's network flying as the Frontier JetExpress agreement ended in November 2007. The JetExpress capacity has been redeployed to the Horizon network.
Horizon's line-of-business capacity mix and load factor information for the fourth quarter is presented below:
Fourth Quarter 2007
 
Horizon's line-of-business traffic and revenue information for October and November is presented below. December yield and RASM information is not yet available. In both CPA arrangements, Horizon is insulated from market revenue factors and is guaranteed contractual revenue amounts based on operational capacity. As a result, yield and load factor information is not presented.
October and November 2007
 
Horizon brand flying includes those routes in the Horizon system not covered by either of its capacity purchase arrangements. Horizon bears the revenue risk in its brand flying markets. Revenue from the Alaska CPA is eliminated in consolidation.
 
Other Financial Information
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2007, Air Group cash and short-term investments totaled approximately $817 million.
Share Repurchase Program
Through December 31, 2007, the Company had repurchased 2,593,282 shares of its common stock for approximately $63 million.
Fuel Hedging
We are providing unaudited information about fuel price movements and the impact of our hedging program on our financial results. Management believes it is useful to compare results between periods on an economic basis. is defined as the raw or "into-plane" fuel cost less the cash we receive from hedge counterparties for hedges that settle during the period, offset by the premium expense that we recognize. A reconciliation of to our is presented below. is defined as the raw fuel cost plus the effect of mark-to-market adjustments that we include in our income statement as the value of our fuel-hedging portfolio increases and decreases.

Alaska Air Group, Inc today issued a press release reporting financial results for the full year and fourth quarter ended December 31, 2007. The press release is filed as Exhibit 99.1
 
 
Signatures
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
SEATTLE  Alaska Air Group, Inc. (NYSE:ALK) today reported full-year net income of $125.0 million, or $3.09 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $52.6 million, or $1.39 per share, in 2006. The prior year results include charges related to the transition to an all-Boeing 737 fleet at Alaska Airlines and for voluntary severance programs related to new labor contracts. Both periods include adjustments resulting from mark-to-market fuel hedge accounting. Excluding the impact of these items, the company would have reported net income of $92.3 million, or $2.28 per diluted share, compared to net income of $137.7 million, or $3.45 per diluted share, in 2006.
The company reported fourth quarter net income of $7.4 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $11.6 million, or $0.29 per share, in 2006. Similar to the items noted above, both periods include mark-to-market fuel hedge accounting adjustments and 2006 includes a favorable adjustment related to the voluntary severance programs. Excluding the impact of these adjustments, the company would have reported a fourth quarter net loss of $17.9 million, or $0.46 per share, compared to a net loss of $3.4 million, or $0.08 per share, in 2006. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures can be found on page 6.
"It's frustrating to report a fourth quarter adjusted loss in what has been a solid year relative to other carriers," said Bill Ayer, chairman and CEO. "The loss was driven primarily by skyrocketing fuel costs combined with fares that have not kept pace. However, our fleet transition, fuel hedging program and other efforts to reduce fuel consumption put us in an excellent position to compete in this difficult environment."
Alaska Airlines' mainline passenger traffic in the fourth quarter increased 6.0 percent on a capacity increase of 4.6 percent. Load factor increased by 1.0 percentage points to 74.7 percent. Alaska's mainline operating revenue per available seat mile (ASM) increased 2.7 percent and its operating costs per ASM excluding fuel and the special items mentioned above decreased 3.0 percent from the prior year. Alaska's total pretax income for the quarter was $15.2 million, compared to a pretax loss of $12.1 million in 2006. Excluding the items noted above, Alaska would have reported a pretax loss of $18.8 million for the quarter compared to a $1.9 million pretax loss in the fourth quarter of 2006.
Horizon Air's combined passenger traffic in the fourth quarter increased 9.7 percent on a 10.3 percent capacity increase. Load factor declined by 0.4 percentage points to 72.6 percent. Horizon's combined operating revenue per ASM increased 3.9 percent and its operating costs per ASM excluding fuel decreased 0.8 percent. Horizon's total pretax loss for the quarter was $4.8 million, compared to a pretax loss of $3.5 million in 2006. Excluding mark-to-market fuel-hedge accounting adjustments, Horizon's pretax loss was $11.2 million for the quarter compared to a pretax loss of $0.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2006.
Alaska Air Group had cash and short-term investments at Dec. 31, 2007, of $823 million. The company repurchased 2,593,282 shares of its common stock for $62.8 million through Dec. 31, 2007, pursuant to the $100 million share repurchase program authorized by the Board of Directors in September 2007. As of yesterday, the company had repurchased 3,292,882 shares of its common stock for a total of $79.3 million.
A summary of financial and statistical data for Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air, as well as a reconciliation of the reported non-GAAP financial measures, can be found on pages 7 through 11.

The following table summarizes Alaska Air Group, Inc.'s net income (loss) and amounts per share during 2007 and 2006 excluding adjustments to reflect the timing of gain or loss recognition resulting from mark-to-market fuel-hedge accounting, fleet transition costs related to the impairment of the MD-80 fleet, and restructuring charges and adjustments, as reported in accordance with GAAP (in millions except per share amounts):
 
 
In order to reconcile the diluted earnings per share on an adjusted basis to the GAAP loss per share for twelve months ended December 31, 2006, the table above includes $0.17 per share, which represents the impact of the additional shares that were used in the adjusted diluted earnings per share. Additionally, $1.6 million of interest, net of tax, on the convertible senior notes that were outstanding during the first quarter of the year was added back to earnings for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 in order to derive the diluted earnings per share on an adjusted basis.
The per share impact of the mark-to-market losses on fuel hedges, fleet transition costs, and restructuring and impairment charges have been presented in the table above using the basic shares outstanding of 37.939 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006.

Alaska and Horizon Unit Cost Forecast
During our quarterly earnings conference call, we expect to discuss forward-looking forecasted unit cost information for the 2008. This forecasted unit cost information includes non-GAAP unit cost estimates which are summarized in the following table together with the most directly comparable GAAP unit cost for both Alaska Mainline and Horizon Combined:
 
Our forecast of fuel costs is based on anticipated gallons consumed and estimated raw fuel cost per gallon. The estimate does not include the benefit of hedges that will settle in the period, nor does it include an estimate of mark-to-market adjustments in our fuel hedge portfolio. Given the volatility of fuel prices and the likely mark-to-market adjustments on our fuel hedge portfolio, readers should be cautioned that actual fuel expense will likely differ from the forecast above.

On February 8, 2008 the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Committee") of Alaska Air Group, Inc. (the "Company") took a number of actions.
The Committee determined that Alaska Air Group, Inc. Chairman and CEO Bill Ayer's salary would remain constant at $360,000 per year. This decision maintains Mr. Ayer's 2008 base salary at the same level as 2007, 2006, and 2005 (and lower than in years prior to 2005).
The Committee confirmed Performance-Based Pay plan payouts for 2007. The payouts are based on the Company's 2007 performance relative to safety, employee engagement, and financial performance goals established by the Committee for the year. The payouts were as follows: Mr. Ayer, $76,320; Mr. Tilden, $41,340; Mr. Saretsky, $44,520; Mr. Finan, $41,340; and Mr. Pinneo, $35,550.
The Committee approved the 2008 performance criteria pursuant to which awards may be paid to executive officers and other employees participating in the Performance-Based Pay plan as follows. Subject to the terms of the plan, participants will be eligible to receive payments if the Company achieves certain operational and financial performance criteria over the full year. The primary measures for 2008 and the relative weightings given to each measure are the Company's pre-tax profit margin (70%), cost per available seat mile excluding fuel (10%), safety as measured by employee injuries (10%), and employee engagement as measured by customer satisfaction (10%). For all employees, Performance-Based Pay payouts will be subject to an additional performance modifier that could increase, decrease, or maintain payout levels. For Alaska Airlines, the modifier is based upon monthly on-time performance (plus or minus 10 percentage points). For Horizon Air, the modifier is based on achieving specified pre-tax profit margin goals (plus or minus 10 percentage points).
The Committee also approved grants of stock options, restricted stock units and performance stock units under the Company's 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan to the Company's Named Executive Officers as described in the table below. The table presents the number of shares subject to each of these awards:
 
Each stock option was granted with an exercise price equal to $27.49, the closing price of a share of Company common stock on February 8, 2008, and the options are scheduled to vest in annual installments over a four-year period. The restricted stock units are scheduled to vest on the third anniversary of the grant date and are payable upon vesting in shares of Company common stock on a one-for-one basis. The performance units will be eligible to vest based on the Company's average pre-tax profit margin over the three-year period commencing January 1, 2008. The percentage of the performance units that vest may range from 0% to 200%, depending on the Company's performance during that period. Vested performance units are payable in shares of Company common stock on a one-for-one basis.
In connection with these award grants, the Committee approved a new form of agreement for use in evidencing performance stock unit awards. This form is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and

The Award shall vest and become no forfeitable as provided in Section 2 of the attached Terms and Conditions of Performance Stock Unit Award (the "").
Terms
The Award is granted under the Alaska Air Group, Inc. 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "") and subject to the Terms attached to this Agreement (incorporated herein by this reference) and to the Plan. The Award has been granted to the Participant in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other form of compensation otherwise payable or to be paid to the Participant. Capitalized terms are defined in the Plan if not defined herein. The parties agree to the terms of the Award set forth herein. The Participant acknowledges receipt of a copy of the Terms, the Plan and the Prospectus for the Plan.
Plan
Notwithstanding any other provision herein, the number of shares of Common Stock payable in respect of the Stock Units is subject to reduction as provided in Section 6 below.
 
 
. As used herein, the term "stock unit" shall mean a non-voting unit of measurement which is deemed for bookkeeping purposes to be equivalent to one outstanding share of Air Group's Common Stock (subject to adjustment as provided in Section 6 of the Plan) solely for purposes of the Plan and this Agreement. The Stock Units shall be used solely as a device for the determination of the payment to eventually be made to the Participant if such Stock Units vest pursuant to this Agreement. The Stock Units shall not be treated as property or as a trust fund of any kind.

2.
Vesting
(a) . Subject to Section 7 below, the Award shall vest and become nonforfeitable based on the achievement of the performance goals established by the Committee and set forth on Exhibit A attached hereto for the Performance Period identified on the cover page of this Agreement. The number of Stock Units that vest and become payable under this Agreement shall be determined based on the level of results or achievement of targets for each of the Performance Goals as set forth in Exhibit A. Except as otherwise expressly provided in Exhibit A, any Stock Units subject to the Award that do not vest in accordance with Exhibit A shall terminate as of the last day of the Performance Period.
Performance-Based Vesting
(b) . Notwithstanding any other provision herein or in the Plan, the Award, to the extent not then vested, shall become fully vested if either (i) the Participant's employment with the Company is terminated by the Company without Cause or by the Participant for Good Reason such termination occurs at any time within the period commencing six (6) months before a Change of Control and ending twenty-four (24) months after such Change of Control, or (ii) a Change of Control occurs and the Award is not assumed or otherwise continued following the Change of Control and is to be settled in accordance with Section 13 of the Plan. (For these purposes, the terms "Cause," "Change of Control" and "Good Reason" shall have the meanings ascribed to them in Exhibit B attached hereto.) For purposes of clarity, the number of Stock Units that shall be vested after giving effect to the foregoing accelerated vesting provision shall equal the number of Stock Units set forth on the cover page of this Agreement (subject to adjustment under Section 6 of the Plan), and the performance-based vesting provisions of Section 2(a) shall be disregarded. In the event that, upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, the Participant is entitled to accelerated vesting of the Award pursuant to clause (i) this Section 2(b) in connection with a termination of the Participant's employment prior to such Change of Control, the Award, to the extent it had not vested and was cancelled or otherwise terminated upon or prior to the date of such Change of Control solely as a result of such termination of employment, shall be reinstated and shall automatically become fully vested.
Possible Acceleration
and
. The vesting schedule requires continued employment or service through each applicable vesting date as a condition to the vesting of the applicable installment of the Award and the rights and benefits under this Agreement. Employment or service for only a portion of the vesting period, even if a substantial portion, will not entitle the Participant to any proportionate vesting or avoid or mitigate a termination of rights and benefits upon or following a termination of employment or services as provided in Section 7 below or under the Plan.
3.
Continuance of Employment
Nothing contained in this Agreement or the Plan constitutes an employment or service commitment by Air Group, affects the Participant's status as an employee at will who is subject to termination without cause, confers upon the Participant any right to remain employed by or in service to the Company, interferes in any way with the right of the Company at any time to terminate such employment or services, or affects the right of the Company to increase or decrease the Participant's other compensation or benefits. Nothing in this paragraph, however, is intended to adversely affect any independent contractual right of the Participant without his consent thereto.
 
. The Participant shall have no rights as a stockholder of Air Group, no dividend rights and no voting rights, with respect to the Stock Units and any shares of Common Stock underlying or issuable in respect of such Stock Units until such shares of Common Stock are actually issued to and held of record by the Participant. No adjustments will be made for dividends or other rights of a holder for which the record date is prior to the date of issuance of the stock certificate.
4.
Limitations on Rights Associated with Units
. Neither the Award, nor any interest therein or amount or shares payable in respect thereof may be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise disposed of, alienated or encumbered, either voluntarily or involuntarily. The transfer restrictions in the preceding sentence shall not apply to (a) transfers to Air Group, or (b) transfers by will or the laws of descent and distribution.
5.
Restrictions on Transfer
. On or as soon as administratively practical following the date on which any Stock Units subject to this Award vest pursuant to the terms hereof (and in all events within two and one-half months after such vesting event), Air Group shall deliver to the Participant a number of shares of Common Stock (either by delivering one or more certificates for such shares or by entering such shares in book entry form, as determined by Air Group in its discretion) equal to the number of Stock Units subject to this Award that vest on such date, unless such Stock Units terminate prior to such date pursuant to Section 7. Air Group's obligation to deliver shares of Common Stock or otherwise make payment with respect to vested Stock Units is subject to the condition precedent that the Participant or other person entitled under the Plan to receive any shares with respect to the vested Stock Units deliver to Air Group any representations or other documents or assurances that the Committee may deem necessary or desirable to assure compliance with all applicable legal and accounting requirements. The Participant shall have no further rights with respect to any Stock Units that are paid or that terminate pursuant to Section 7.
6.
Timing and Manner of Payment of Stock Units; Possible Reduction in Payment
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, in the event that (a) any Stock Units vest and become payable hereunder and (b) the number of shares of Common Stock payable in respect of the aggregate number of such vested units and all other then-vested and payable units subject to awards of performance stock units granted under the Plan on or about the Award Date exceeds the number of shares then available for issuance under the Plan and any other stockholder-approved equity compensation plan of Air Group, the number of shares available for issuance under the Plan shall be allocated on a pro rata basis to the Award and each other such performance stock unit award based on the number of shares then payable under such awards so that all such shares available for issuance shall be issued in respect of such awards and, in such event, the Participant shall have no rights with respect to any vested Stock Units that would otherwise have been paid but are not actually paid as a result of such proration. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the number of shares "available for issuance" under a plan shall exclude any shares issued in respect of an award granted under that plan on or before the date hereof and any shares subject to a then-outstanding award granted under that plan on or before the date hereof (other than a then-outstanding and payable performance stock unit award referred to in the preceding sentence).
The Participant's Stock Units shall terminate to the extent such units have not become vested prior to the first date the Participant is no longer employed by the Company, regardless of the reason for the termination of the Participant's employment with the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if the Participant's employment terminates as a result of the Participant's death, Total Disability or Retirement (as such terms are defined below), (i) the Participant's Stock Units shall be subject to pro-rata vesting such that the number of Stock Units subject

If any unvested Stock Units are terminated hereunder, such Stock Units shall automatically terminate and be cancelled as of the applicable termination date without payment of any consideration by Air Group and without any other action by the Participant, or the Participant's beneficiary or personal representative, as the case may be.
For purposes of this Agreement, "" means a "permanent and total disability" (within the meaning of Section 22(e)(3) of the Code or as otherwise determined by the Committee). For purposes of this Agreement, "" means that, as of the date of the termination of the Participant's employment with the Company, the Participant has either (i) attained age 55 with at least five (5) full years of service with the Company, or (ii) has attained age 60, or (iii) is a participant in and is entitled to commence a benefit under a Company-sponsored defined benefit plan and has at least 10 years of service with the Company.
Total Disability
Retirement
. The Committee may accelerate payment and vesting of the Stock Units in such circumstances as it, in its sole discretion, may determine. In addition, upon the occurrence of certain events relating to Air Group's stock contemplated by Section 6 of the Plan (including, without limitation, an extraordinary cash dividend on such stock), the Committee shall make adjustments in accordance with such section in the number of Stock Units then outstanding and the number and kind of securities that may be issued in respect of the Award. No such adjustment shall be made with respect to any ordinary cash dividend paid on the Common Stock. Furthermore, the Committee shall adjust the performance measures and performance goals referenced in Section 3 hereof to the extent (if any) it determines that the adjustment is necessary or advisable to preserve the intended incentives and benefits to reflect (1) any material change in corporate capitalization, any material corporate transaction (such as a reorganization, combination, separation, merger, acquisition, or any combination of the foregoing), or any complete or partial liquidation of the Air Group, (2) any change in accounting policies or practices, (3) the effects of any special charges to the Air Group's earnings, or (4) any other similar special circumstances.

Adjustments Upon Specified Events
. Subject to Section 19 of the Plan, upon any distribution of shares of Common Stock in respect of the Stock Units, Air Group shall automatically reduce the number of shares to be delivered by (or otherwise reacquire) the appropriate number of whole shares, valued at their then Fair Market Value (determined in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Plan), to satisfy any withholding obligations of the Company with respect to such distribution of shares at the minimum applicable withholding rates. In the event that Air Group cannot legally satisfy such withholding obligations by such reduction of shares, or in the event of a cash payment or any other withholding event in respect of the Stock Units, the Company shall be entitled to require a cash payment by or on behalf of the Participant and/or to deduct from other compensation payable to the Participant any sums required by federal, state or local tax law to be withheld with respect to such distribution or payment.
9.

Any notice to be given under the terms of this Agreement shall be in writing and addressed to Air Group at its principal office to the attention of the Secretary, and to the Participant at the Participant's last address reflected on Air Group's records, or at such other address as either party may hereafter designate in writing to the other.

FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION
This report contains forward-looking statements subject to the safe harbor protection provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

For a discussion of these and other risk factors, see Item 1A of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007. All of the forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the risk factors discussed therein. These risk factors may not be exhaustive. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risk factors emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict such new risk factors, nor can it assess the impact, if any, of such new risk factors on our business or events described in any forward-looking statements. We expressly disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date of this report to conform them to actual results.

Pursuant to 17 CFR Part 243 ("Regulation FD"), the Company is submitting information relating to its financial and operational outlook for 2008. This report includes information regarding forecasts of available seat miles (ASMs), cost per available seat mile (CASM) excluding fuel consumption, as well as certain actual results for revenue passenger miles (RPMs), load factor and revenue per available seat mile (RASM), for its subsidiaries Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Horizon Air Industries, Inc. Our disclosure of operating cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel, provides us the ability to measure and monitor our performance without these items. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is total operating expense per available seat mile. However, due to the large fluctuations in fuel prices, we are unable to predict total operating expense for any future period with any degree of certainty. In addition, we believe the disclosure of fuel expense on an economic basis is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. Please see the cautionary statement under "Forward-Looking Information."
In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in this report shall not be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), nor shall such information be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing. This report will not be deemed an admission as to the materiality of any information required to be disclosed solely to satisfy the requirements of Regulation FD.
ALASKA AIRLINES
Alaska Airlines Mainline Capacity and Unit Cost Forecast
 
 
Alaska Airlines Mainline Traffic and Revenue
Alaska's January mainline traffic increased 9.9% to 1.411 billion RPMs from 1.284 billion flown a year earlier. Mainline capacity during January was 2.049 billion ASMs, 6.2% higher than the 1.930 billion in January 2007. The mainline passenger load factor (the percentage of available seats occupied by fare-paying passengers) for the month was 68.9%, compared to 66.5% in January 2007. The airline carried 1,255,300 passengers compared to 1,216,500 in January 2007.
In January 2008, year-over-year mainline RASM was up 0.4% compared to January 2007. Mainline passenger RASM was up 1.5% primarily because of the higher load factor, offset by lower yields.
 
Alaska Purchased Capacity (ASMs) and Unit Cost Forecast
Alaska and Horizon have a Capacity Purchase Agreement (CPA) whereby Alaska purchases capacity on certain routes ("capacity purchase markets") from Horizon. In addition, Alaska has a capacity purchase agreement with a third party for service between Anchorage and Dutch Harbor, AK.
 
Alaska Purchased Capacity Traffic and Revenue
In January 2008, RASM for the purchased capacity flying increased 1.7% from January 2007 to 18.34 cents per ASM.
HORIZON AIR
 
Horizon's CASM includes the expected loss on the sublease of Q200 aircraft to a third party. We expect the loss will be approximately $6 million in the first quarter of 2008 as we deliver three of the remaining five Q200s to the third party under the sublease agreement.
Horizon Traffic and Revenue
Horizon's total January traffic increased 7.2% to 205.1 million RPMs from 191.3 million flown a year earlier. Total capacity during January was 317.1 million ASMs, 4.9 % higher than the 302.2 million in January 2007. The airline carried 586,000 passengers compared to 501,600 in January 2007.
 
Horizon's January information for line-of-business traffic and revenue information is presented below. In CPA arrangements, Horizon is (or was, as was the case with the Frontier CPA which ended in November 2007) insulated from market revenue factors and is guaranteed contractual revenue amounts based on operational capacity. As a result, yield and load factor information is not presented.

NM = Not Meaningful
Horizon brand flying includes those routes in the Horizon system not covered by the capacity purchase arrangements. Horizon bears the revenue risk in its brand flying markets. Revenue from the Alaska CPA is eliminated in consolidation.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
SEATTLE Alaska Air Group, Inc. (NYSE: ALK) today announced that its board of directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the company to purchase up to $50 million of its common stock. The new program follows the completion on February 29 of a program to repurchase $100 million of the company's outstanding stock. Under the program just completed, the company repurchased 4,113,782 shares, or 10 percent of the outstanding stock at the start of the program, at an average price of $24.31 per share.
"The board of directors is confident in Alaska Air Group's future business prospects and financial position. Accordingly, we believe that continuing our stock repurchase program will allow us to enhance shareholder value while providing us with the flexibility to continue investing in long-term strategic opportunities," said Bill Ayer, the company's chairman and chief executive officer."
Alaska intends to finance the repurchases with cash on hand. The repurchase program authorizes the company to purchase its common stock from time to time, through open market purchases, negotiated transactions or other means, including accelerated share repurchases and 10b5-1 trading plans in accordance with applicable securities laws.
This news release contains forward-looking statements that are intended to be subject to the safe harbor protection provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements relate to future events or our future financial performance and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results or performance to be materially different from those indicated by any forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include the statements concerning our confidence in the company's future business prospects and financial position, our belief that the repurchase program will allow us to enhance shareholder value while providing flexibility to continue investing in long-term strategic opportunities, and our intent to finance the repurchases with cash on hand. For a comprehensive discussion of potential risk factors, see Item 1A of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007. Some of these risks include increased competition, significant fuel costs, general economic conditions, labor costs and relations, our significant indebtedness, inability to meet cost reduction goals, terrorist attacks, seasonal fluctuations in our financial results, an aircraft accident, laws and regulations, and government fees and taxes. All of the forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the risk factors discussed therein. These risk factors may not be exhaustive. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risk factors emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict such new risk factors, nor can it assess the impact, if any, of such new risk factors on our business or events described in any forward-looking statements.

Exhibit 99.1
Investor Update  March 24, 2008
References in this update to "Air Group," "Company," "we," "us," and "our" refer to Alaska Air Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise specified.
This report includes information regarding forecasts of available seat miles (ASMs), cost per available seat mile (CASM) excluding fuel consumption, as well as certain actual results for revenue passenger miles (RPMs), load factor and revenue per available seat mile (RASM), for our subsidiaries Alaska Airlines, Inc. (Alaska) and Horizon Air Industries, Inc. (Horizon). Our disclosure of operating cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel, provides us the ability to measure and monitor our performance without these items. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is total operating expense per available seat mile. However, due to the large fluctuations in fuel prices, we are unable to predict total operating expense for any future period with any degree of certainty. In addition, we believe the disclosure of fuel expense on an economic basis is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. Please see the cautionary statement under "Forward-Looking Information."
We are providing unaudited information about fuel price movements and the impact of our hedging program on our financial results. Management believes it is useful to compare results between periods on an "economic basis." is defined as the raw or "into-plane" fuel cost less the cash we receive from hedge counterparties for hedges that settle during the period, offset by the premium expense that we recognize. Economic fuel expense more closely approximates the net cash outflow associated with purchasing fuel for our operation.

This update contains forward-looking statements subject to the safe harbor protection provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements relate to future events and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual outcomes to be materially different from those indicated by any forward-looking statements. For a comprehensive discussion of potential risk factors, see Item 1A of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007. Some of these risks include increased competition, significant fuel costs, general economic conditions, labor costs and relations, our significant indebtedness, inability to meet cost reduction goals, terrorist attacks, seasonal fluctuations in our financial results, an aircraft accident, laws and regulations, and government fees and taxes. All of the forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the risk factors discussed therein. These risk factors may not be exhaustive. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risk factors emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict such new risk factors, nor can it assess the impact, if any, of such new risk factors on our business or events described in any forward-looking statements.

   Forecast Information
*For Alaska, our forecasts of mainline cost per ASM and fuel cost per ASM are based on forward-looking estimates, which will likely differ from actual results due to several factors including, but not limited to, the volatility of fuel prices. Fuel cost per ASM above includes our estimate of raw fuel cost for the first quarter and the actual unfavorable adjustments to the value of our fuel-hedging portfolio in January and February. Our economic fuel cost per ASM will likely be different than the amount presented here.
**Because of the volatility of fuel prices, actual amounts may differ significantly.
 
Alaska has Capacity Purchase Agreements (CPA) with Horizon for certain routes and a third party whereby Alaska purchases capacity for service between Anchorage and Dutch Harbor, AK.
   February 2008 Statistics
The following data represents only the Horizon CPA flying as that flying represents approximately 95% of the total purchased capacity.

Line-of-Business Information
Horizon's year-to-date information for line-of-business traffic and revenue information is presented below. In CPA arrangements, Horizon is (or was, as was the case with the Frontier CPA which ended in November 2007) insulated from market revenue factors and is guaranteed contractual revenue amounts based on operational capacity. As a result, yield and load factor information is not presented. Horizon bears the revenue risk in its brand flying markets. Revenue from the Alaska CPA is eliminated in consolidation.

   Forecast Information
* For Horizon, our forecasts of cost per ASM and fuel cost per ASM are based on forward-looking estimates, which will likely differ significantly from actual results. There are several factors impacting our estimates including, but not limited to, the volatility of fuel prices. Fuel cost per ASM above includes our estimate of raw fuel cost for the first quarter and the actual unfavorable adjustments to the value of our fuel-hedging portfolio in January and February. We expect that our economic fuel cost per ASM will be lower.
Horizon's CASM includes the expected loss on the sublease of Q200 aircraft to a third party. We expect the loss will be approximately $6 million in the first quarter of 2008 as we deliver three of the remaining five Q200s to the third party under the existing sublease agreement.
**Horizon's fuel consumption now includes fuel that was formerly purchased by Frontier as part of the Frontier CPA agreement.
***Because of the volatility of fuel prices, actual amounts may differ significantly.

ITEM 2.02   Results of Operations And Financial Condition
Alaska Air Group, Inc. today issued a press release reporting financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2008. The press release is filed as Exhibit 99.1.
ITEM 2.05   Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities and
ITEM 2.06   Material Impairments
On April 23, 2008, Air Group's Board of Directors approved a plan to exit Horizon's Bombardier CRJ-700 fleet earlier than originally anticipated. With the exit from the CRJ fleet (combined with the previously announced transition out of its Q200 turboprop fleet), Horizon will move to a single fleet type consisting of 48 or more Bombardier Q400 turboprop aircraft. This plan allows us to reduce annual operating costs by reducing the size of its fleet, leveraging the favorable economics of the Q400, and achieve the favorable economics and efficiencies of a single fleet type. Horizon's current fleet of 65 aircraft includes two (2) owned and 18 leased CRJ-700 aircraft. We expect the transition to be completed within two years.
As a result of this decision, we believe the carrying values of the two owned aircraft and certain spare parts are no longer recoverable when compared to the estimated remaining future cash flows, including proceeds from final sale. Consequently, during the second quarter of 2008, we expect to record a non-cash impairment charge to write these assets down to their estimated fair value. Although the actual amount has not yet been finalized, we expect the impairment charge to be between $10 million and $15 million, before tax. No portion of the impairment charge will result in future cash expenditures.
In addition, Horizon plans to remove all of the leased CRJ-700 aircraft from operations prior to the end of the contractual lease terms. We are currently evaluating various alternatives to dispose of these aircraft in the most economically feasible way.
 
The nature, timing or amount of any potential gain or loss associated with these transactions cannot be reasaonably estimated at this time.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
SEATTLE  Alaska Air Group, Inc. (NYSE:ALK) today reported a first quarter net loss of $35.9 million, or $0.97 per share, compared to a net loss of $10.3 million, or $0.26 per share, in the first quarter of 2007. Both periods include adjustments resulting from mark-to-market fuel hedge accounting. Excluding the impact of these adjustments, the company would have reported a net loss of $36.3 million, or $0.98 per share, compared to a net loss of $15.8 million, or $0.39 per share, in the first quarter of 2007.
"Although Alaska Air Group is in a good position relative to the rest of the industry, high fuel prices are eroding our profits and revenues are not increasing fast enough to offset them," said Bill Ayer, chairman and chief executive officer. "In response to the current industry environment, we're taking a range of actions at Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air to increase revenues and lower costs, including transitioning Horizon to a single-type fleet of fuel-efficient Q400 aircraft."
Alaska Airlines' mainline passenger traffic in the first quarter increased 11.3 percent on a capacity increase of 6.8 percent. Load factor increased by 3.0 percentage points to 74.4 percent. Alaska's mainline operating revenue per available seat mile (ASM) increased 3.0 percent and its operating costs per ASM excluding fuel decreased 3.4 percent from the first quarter of 2007. Alaska's total pretax loss for the quarter was $37.9 million, compared to a pretax loss of $7.5 million in 2007. Excluding mark-to-market fuel hedging adjustments, Alaska would have reported a pretax loss of $37.7 million for the quarter, compared to a $14.3 million pretax loss in the first quarter of 2007.
Horizon Air's passenger traffic in the first quarter increased 4.9 percent on a 1.8 percent capacity increase. Load factor increased by 2.1 percentage points to 69.9 percent. Horizon's operating revenue per ASM increased 7.7 percent and its operating costs per ASM excluding fuel decreased 1.7 percent. Horizon's total pretax loss for the quarter was $17.2 million, compared to a pretax loss of $9.2 million in 2007. Excluding mark-to-market fuel-hedge accounting adjustments, Horizon's pretax loss was $18.1 million for the quarter, compared to a pretax loss of $11.2 million in the first quarter of 2007.
Alaska Air Group had cash and short-term investments of $922 million at March 31, 2008, and has more than $1 billion today.
Alaska Air Group has the second-best fuel hedge position in the industry, with half of Alaska and Horizon's planned consumption for the remainder of 2008 indexed to a crude oil price of $76 per barrel.
Alaska Air Group's debt-to-total capitalization ratio at March 31, 2008, was 73 percent. The company finished the quarter with 36.4 million shares outstanding.
Company acting in response to fuel costs, economy
Alaska Air Group also announced steps to further increase revenues and reduce expenses in response to record high fuel costs and a slowing economy. When fully implemented, these measures are expected to improve the company's full-year pretax income by about $150 million.
"Our economic fuel costs for the first quarter of 2008 jumped $89 million or 45 percent over what we paid a year ago on a slight increase in consumption," Ayer said. "Given the magnitude of this increase and the softening economy, we're taking aggressive actions now to improve our business and profitability."
Central to these actions is Horizon Air's plan to transition from a fleet of 65 aircraft and three aircraft types to a single fleet of 76-seat Bombardier Q400s. To do so, the airline will transition out of its fleet of 20 Bombardier CRJ-700 regional jets within two years. This fleet change is in addition to a previously announced phase-out of its 12 remaining 37-seat Bombardier Q200s by June 2009.
"Through its combination of passenger comfort, speed and efficiency, the Q400 is the best aircraft for the majority of our markets," said Jeff Pinneo, president and chief executive officer of Horizon Air. "Simplifying to a single fleet of Q400s will result in increased fuel efficiency, plus substantially reduced costs for aircraft maintenance, spare parts, and pilot and mechanic training."
 
The Q400 is one of the most technologically advanced turboprop aircraft in the world. In addition to its jet-like speed and cabin environment, the Q400 burns 30 percent less fuel and produces 30 percent less emissions than a 70-seat jet.
When the transition out of Q200s and CRJ-700s is complete, Horizon's fleet will consist of 48 Q400s or more, depending on how many of its 20 purchase options with Bombardier the airline chooses to exercise.
Flight frequency reductions will be necessary in certain markets as Horizon transitions from the Q200 to the higher-capacity Q400.
Some workforce reductions, which the airline hopes to accomplish primarily though attrition during the transition period, also will be necessary as Horizon moves to a smaller fleet.
Fee changes
Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air plan to raise certain fees to better align them with the current costs of providing added services. These include increasing the charge for booking through reservations and airport sales agents from $10 to $15, raising the fee for overweight baggage from $25 to $50, increasing the charge for transporting pets in the cabin from $75 to $100 one-way and raising the unaccompanied minor fee from $30 to $75 for one-way nonstop flights and from $60 to $75 for connecting flights. The increases are effective May 21, 2008.
By summer, the airlines also will begin charging $25 for a second checked bag. First class and top-tier Mileage Plan members and customers on flights within the state of Alaska will be exempt from the new fee.
"Rising fuel and service costs without equivalent fare increases have forced us to make these changes," said Gregg Saretsky, Alaska's executive vice president of flight and marketing. "We will continue to maintain a simple, customer-friendly fare structure and fees in accord with the costs of delivering these services in this environment of extremely high fuel prices."
Capacity changes
Alaska and Horizon are evaluating all routes to remove frequency in underperforming markets and redeploy it in more profitable ones. The airlines anticipate redeploying 3 percent to 5 percent of existing network capacity to generate new revenue in the fall schedule.
The airlines have already made substantial changes to their spring and summer schedules that include leaving the Orange County-Oakland and San Diego-San Francisco markets and reducing Long Beach-Seattle, Los Angeles-Eugene, Los Angeles-Mexico City, San Diego-Boise and San Diego-Spokane service. Aircraft serving these routes have been redeployed on transcontinental flights from Portland, Ore.; three daily trips to Hawaii, including Maui service starting in July; the airlines' new "West Most" Seattle-California schedule featuring 78 flights, with weekday hourly service to LAX and weekday flights nearly every two hours to five other airports; and new Horizon service to Flagstaff, Ariz.
 
Fuel conservation
Alaska and Horizon announced further initiatives to reduce fuel consumption that will save the airlines roughly 1 million gallons a month. These include implementing a new flight planning system to select more direct routings, establishing single-engine taxi procedures for Alaska and using more ground power instead of burning fuel with the aircraft's onboard auxiliary power unit. These steps are in addition to ongoing measures that include transitioning to more fuel-efficient aircraft, installing winglets on Alaska's Next Generation 737s, eliminating unnecessary weight onboard, and working with the Federal Aviation Administration to pursue more direct routings and fuel-saving approaches and departures using existing flight deck technology.
A summary of financial and statistical data for Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air, as well as a reconciliation of the reported non-GAAP financial measures, can be found on pages 9 through 13. Additionally, Alaska Air Group filed an investor update and information regarding the decision to transition out of Horizon's CRJ-700 fleet on Form 8-K today. Please refer to that 8-K for unit cost and capacity guidance for the second quarter and full year of 2008.

Investor Update  April 24, 2008
References in this update to "Air Group," "Company," "we," "us," and "our" refer to Alaska Air Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise specified.
This report includes information regarding forecasts of available seat miles (ASMs), cost per available seat mile (CASM) excluding fuel consumption, capital expenditures, and fleet information. Our disclosure of operating cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel, provides us the ability to measure and monitor our performance without these items. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is total operating expense per available seat mile. However, due to the large fluctuations in fuel prices, we are unable to predict total operating expense for any future period with any degree of certainty. In addition, we believe the disclosure of fuel expense on an economic basis is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. Please see the cautionary statement under "Forward-Looking Information."
Please see our press release dated today for actual financial and statistical information for the first quarter of 2008.
A slide presentation is furnished with this update. The presentation focuses on management's belief that the Company is better positioned than other domestic air carriers to weather an economic downturn. Additionally, it depicts the fuel efficiency of our fleets and the cost benefits of the recently announced Horizon fleet transition.

Forecast Information
*For Alaska, our forecasts of mainline cost per ASM and fuel cost per ASM are based on forward-looking estimates, which will likely differ from actual results due to several factors including, but not limited to, the volatility of fuel prices. Fuel cost per ASM above includes our estimate of raw fuel cost for the second quarter. Our economic fuel cost per ASM will likely be different than the amount presented here.
**Because of the volatility of fuel prices, actual amounts may differ significantly.
Advance Bookings
 
Alaska has Capacity Purchase Agreements (CPA) with Horizon for certain routes and a third party whereby Alaska purchases capacity for service between Anchorage and Dutch Harbor, AK.
Forecast Information (Horizon CPA)
The forecast reflects the Horizon CPA flying only as that flying represents approximately 95% of the total purchased capacity. The ASMs shown below are also included in Horizon's system forecast presented on the following page.

Investor Update  May 21, 2008
References in this update to "Air Group," "Company," "we," "us," and "our" refer to Alaska Air Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise specified.
This report includes information regarding forecasts of available seat miles (ASMs), cost per available seat mile (CASM) excluding fuel consumption, capital expenditures, and fleet information, as well as certain actual results for revenue passenger miles (RPMs), load factor and revenue per available seat mile (RASM), for our subsidiaries Alaska Airlines, Inc. (Alaska) and Horizon Air Industries, Inc. (Horizon). Our disclosure of operating cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel, provides us the ability to measure and monitor our performance without these items. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is total operating expense per available seat mile. However, due to the large fluctuations in fuel prices, we are unable to predict total operating expense for any future period with any degree of certainty. In addition, we believe the disclosure of fuel expense on an economic basis is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. Please see the cautionary statement under "Forward-Looking Information."
We are providing unaudited information about fuel price movements and the impact of our hedging program on our financial results. Management believes it is useful to compare results between periods on an "economic basis." is defined as the raw or "into-plane" fuel cost less the cash we receive from hedge counterparties for hedges that settle during the period, offset by the premium expense that we recognize. Economic fuel expense more closely approximates the net cash outflow associated with purchasing fuel for our operation.

(a) Departure of Directors or Certain Officers
Alaska Air Group Director Mr. Richard A. Wien retired from the Board effective May 20, 2008. The Board of Directors wishes to thank Mr. Wien for his dedication and service to the Board over the past 26 years.
In their March 2008 meeting, the Board of Directors voted to reduce the size of the Board to nine members effective as of the Annual Stockholder Meeting on May 20, 2008.
(e) Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
The Board of Directors (the "Board") of Alaska Air Group, Inc. (the "Company") previously adopted the Alaska Air Group, Inc. 2008 Performance Incentive Plan (the "2008 Plan"), subject to stockholder approval of the 2008 Plan. According to the preliminary results from the Company's annual stockholders' meeting held on May 20, 2008, the Company's stockholders have approved the 2008 Plan.
The following summary of the 2008 Plan is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the 2008 Plan, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference. The forms of award agreements to be used to evidence grants of nonqualified stock options, stock unit awards, and director deferred stock unit awards under the 2008 Plan are attached hereto as Exhibits 10.2, 10.3, and 10.4, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference.
The Board or one or more committees appointed by the Board will administer the 2008 Plan. The Board has delegated general administrative authority for the 2008 Plan to the Compensation Committee of the Board.
The administrator of the 2008 Plan has broad authority under the 2008 Plan to, among other things, select participants and determine the type(s) of award(s) that they are to receive, and determine the number of shares that are to be subject to awards and the terms and conditions of awards, including the price (if any) to be paid for the shares or the award.
Persons eligible to receive awards under the 2008 Plan include directors of the Company, officers or employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, and certain consultants and advisors to the Company or any of its subsidiaries.
The maximum number of shares of the Company's common stock ("Common Stock") that may be issued or transferred pursuant to awards under the 2008 Plan equals the sum of: (1) 2,100,000 shares, plus (2) the number of shares available for additional award grant purposes under the Company's 2004 Long-Term Incentive Equity Plan (the "2004 Plan") as of May 20, 2008 and determined immediately prior to the termination of the authority to grant new awards under that plan as of May 20, 2008, plus (3) the number of any shares subject to stock options granted under the 2004 Plan and outstanding as of May 20, 2008 which expire, or for any reason are cancelled or terminated, after that date without being exercised (including any shares subject to outstanding stock options granted under the Company's 1999 Long-Term Incentive Equity Plan (the "1999 Plan") which expire, or for any reason are cancelled or terminated, after May 20, 2008 without being exercised that would otherwise become available for award grant purposes under the 2004 Plan in accordance with the terms of that plan), plus (4) the number of any shares subject to restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards granted under the 2004 Plan that are outstanding and
unvested as of May 20, 2008 which are forfeited, terminated, cancelled, or otherwise reacquired after May 20, 2008 without having become vested. As of May 20, 2008, 79,712 shares were available for additional award grant purposes under the 2004 Plan, approximately 1,780,391 shares were subject to awards then outstanding under the 2004 Plan and approximately 1,136,823 shares were subject to awards then outstanding under the 1999 Plan.
Shares issued in respect of any "full-value award" granted under the 2008 Plan will be counted against the share limit described in the preceding paragraph as 1.7 shares for every one share actually issued in connection with the award. For example, if the Company granted 100 shares of its common stock under the 2008 Plan, 170 shares would be charged against the share limit with respect to that award. For this purpose, a "full-value award" generally means any award granted under the plan other than a stock option or stock appreciation right.
To the extent that an award is settled in cash or a form other than shares, the shares that would have been delivered had there been no such cash or other settlement will not be counted against the shares available for issuance under the 2008 Plan. In the event that shares are delivered in respect of a dividend equivalent right, only the actual number of shares delivered with respect to the award shall be counted against the share limits of the 2008 Plan. To the extent that shares are delivered pursuant to the exercise of a stock appreciation right or stock option, the number of underlying shares as to which the exercise related shall be counted against the applicable share limits of the 2008 Plan, as opposed to only counting the shares actually issued. Shares that are subject to or underlie awards which expire or for any reason are cancelled or terminated, are forfeited, fail to vest, or for any other reason are not paid or delivered under the 2008 Plan will again be available for subsequent awards under the 2008 Plan.
The types of awards that may be granted under the 2008 Plan include stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, stock bonuses and other forms of awards granted or denominated in Common Stock or units of Common Stock, as well as certain cash bonus awards.
As is customary in incentive plans of this nature, each share limit and the number and kind of shares available under the 2008 Plan and any outstanding awards, as well as the exercise or purchase prices of awards, and performance targets under certain types of performance-based awards, are subject to adjustment in the event of certain reorganizations, mergers, combinations, recapitalizations, stock splits, stock dividends, or other similar events that change the number or kind of shares outstanding, and extraordinary dividends or distributions of property to the stockholders.

Each of the foregoing numerical limits is subject to adjustment as contemplated by Section 4.3, Section 7.1, and Section 8.10.
 
 
 
 
. A stock option is the grant of a right to purchase a specified number of shares of Common Stock during a specified period as determined by the Administrator. An option may be intended as an incentive stock option within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code (an "ISO") or a nonqualified stock option (an option not intended to be an ISO). The award agreement for an option will indicate if the option is intended as an ISO; otherwise it will be deemed to be a nonqualified stock option. The maximum term of each option (ISO or nonqualified) shall be ten (10) years. The per share exercise price for each option shall be not less than 100% of the fair market value of a share of Common Stock on the date of grant of the option. When an option is exercised, the exercise price for the shares to be purchased shall be paid in full in cash or such other method permitted by the Administrator consistent with Section 5.5.
5.1.1
Stock Options
To the extent that the aggregate fair market value (determined at the time of grant of the applicable option) of stock with respect to which ISOs first become exercisable by a participant in any calendar year exceeds $100,000, taking into account both Common Stock subject to ISOs under this Plan and stock subject to ISOs under all other plans of the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries (or any parent or predecessor corporation to the extent required by and within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder), such options shall be treated as nonqualified stock options. In reducing the number of options treated as ISOs to meet the $100,000 limit, the most recently granted options shall be reduced first. To the extent a reduction of simultaneously granted options is necessary to meet the $100,000 limit, the Administrator may, in the manner and to the extent permitted by law, designate which shares of Common Stock are to be treated as shares acquired pursuant to the exercise of an ISO. ISOs may only be granted to employees of the Corporation or one of its subsidiaries (for this purpose, the term "subsidiary" is used as defined in Section 424(f) of the Code, which generally requires an unbroken chain of ownership of at least 50% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of each subsidiary in the chain beginning with the Corporation and ending with the subsidiary in question). There shall be imposed in any award agreement relating to ISOs such other terms and conditions as from time to time are required in order that the option be an "incentive stock option" as that term is defined in Section 422 of the Code. No ISO may be granted to any person who, at the time the option is granted, owns (or is deemed to own under Section 424(d) of the Code) shares of outstanding Common Stock possessing more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Corporation, unless the exercise price of such option is at least 110% of the fair market value of the stock subject to the option and such option by its terms is not exercisable after the expiration of five years from the date such option is granted.
5.1.2
Additional Rules Applicable to ISOs.
 
A stock appreciation right or "" is a right to receive a payment, in cash and/or Common Stock, equal to the excess of the fair market value of a specified number of shares of Common Stock on the date the SAR is exercised over the "" of the award, which base price shall be set forth in the applicable award agreement and shall be not less than 100% of the fair market value of a share of Common Stock on the date of grant of the SAR.

The Corporation will not be obligated to deliver any shares unless and until it receives full payment of the exercise or purchase price therefor and any related withholding obligations under Section 8.5 and any other conditions to exercise or purchase have been satisfied. Unless otherwise expressly provided in the applicable award agreement, the Administrator may at any time eliminate or limit a participant's ability to pay the purchase or exercise price of any award or shares by any method other than cash payment to the Corporation.

Unless otherwise expressly provided in the applicable award agreement, upon (or, as may be necessary to effect the adjustment, immediately prior to) any event or transaction described in the preceding paragraph or a sale of all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Corporation as an entirety, the Administrator shall equitably and proportionately adjust the performance standards applicable to any then-outstanding performance-based awards to the extent necessary to preserve (but not increase) the level of incentives intended by this Plan and the then-outstanding performance-based awards.
It is intended that, if possible, any adjustments contemplated by the preceding two paragraphs be made in a manner that satisfies applicable U.S. legal, tax (including, without limitation and as applicable in the circumstances, Section 424 of the Code, Section 409A of the Code and Section 162(m) of the Code) and accounting (so as to not trigger any charge to earnings with respect to such adjustment) requirements.
Without limiting the generality of Section 3.3, any good faith determination by the Administrator as to whether an adjustment is required in the circumstances pursuant to this Section 7.1, and the extent and nature of any such adjustment, shall be conclusive and binding on all persons.
 
 
Without limiting the preceding paragraph, in connection with any event referred to in the preceding paragraph or any change in control event defined in any applicable award agreement, the Administrator may, in its discretion, provide for the accelerated vesting of any award or awards as and to the extent determined by the Administrator in the circumstances.
The Administrator may adopt such valuation methodologies for outstanding awards as it deems reasonable in the event of a cash or property settlement and, in the case of options, SARs or similar rights, but without limitation on other methodologies, may base such settlement solely upon the excess if any of the per share amount payable upon or in respect of such event over the exercise or base price of the award.
In any of the events referred to in this Section 7.2, the Administrator may take such action contemplated by this Section 7.2 prior to such event (as opposed to on the occurrence of such event) to the extent that the Administrator deems the action necessary to permit the participant to realize the benefits intended to be conveyed with respect to the underlying shares. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrator may deem an acceleration to occur immediately prior to the applicable event and/or reinstate the original terms of the award if an event giving rise to an acceleration does not occur.
Without limiting the generality of Section 3.3, any good faith determination by the Administrator pursuant to its authority under this Section 7.2 shall be conclusive and binding on all persons.
 
 
 
 
such approvals by any listing, regulatory or governmental authority as may, in the opinion of counsel for the Corporation, be necessary or advisable in connection therewith. The person acquiring any securities under this Plan will, if requested by the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries, provide such assurances and representations to the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries as the Administrator may deem necessary or desirable to assure compliance with all applicable legal and accounting requirements.
 
 
 
 
 
 
In any case where a tax is required to be withheld in connection with the delivery of shares of Common Stock under this Plan, the Administrator may in its sole discretion (subject to Section 8.1) require or grant (either at the time of the award or thereafter) to the participant the right to elect, pursuant to such rules and subject to such conditions as the Administrator may establish, that the Corporation reduce the number of shares to be delivered by (or otherwise reacquire) the appropriate number of shares, valued in a consistent manner at their fair market value or at the sales price in accordance with authorized procedures for cashless exercises, necessary to satisfy the minimum applicable withholding obligation on exercise, vesting or payment. In no event shall the shares withheld exceed the minimum whole number of shares required for tax withholding under applicable law.

Vesting

[The Option shall become vested as to 25% of the total number of shares of Common Stock subject to the Option on each of the first, second, third and fourth anniversaries of the Award Date.]
The Option is granted under the Alaska Air Group, Inc. 2008 Performance Incentive Plan (the "") and subject to the Terms and Conditions of Nonqualified Stock Option (the "") attached to this Option Agreement (incorporated herein by this reference) and to the Plan. The Option has been granted to the Grantee in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other form of compensation otherwise payable or to be paid to the Grantee. Capitalized terms are defined in the Plan if not defined herein. The parties agree to the terms of the Option set forth herein. The Grantee acknowledges receipt of a copy of the Terms, the Plan and the Prospectus for the Plan.
Plan
Terms
 
In consideration of the Corporation's execution of this Option Agreement, the undersigned spouse of the Grantee agrees to be bound by all of the terms and provisions hereof and of the Plan.
 
 
 
 
The Option shall vest and become exercisable in percentage installments of the aggregate number of shares subject to the Option as set forth on the cover page of this Option Agreement. The Option may be exercised only to the extent the Option is vested and exercisable.
 
 
 
 
Notwithstanding any other provision herein or in the Plan, the Option, to the extent not then vested, shall become fully vested if (i) the Grantee's employment with the Corporation and its Subsidiaries is terminated by the Corporation or a Subsidiary without Cause or by the Grantee for Good Reason, and (ii) such termination occurs at any time within the period commencing six (6) months before a Change of Control and ending twenty-four (24) months after such Change of Control. (For these purposes, the terms "Cause," "Change of Control" and "Good Reason" shall have the meanings ascribed to them in Exhibit A attached hereto.) In the event that, upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, the Grantee is entitled to accelerated vesting of the Option pursuant to this paragraph in connection with a termination of the Grantee's employment prior to such Change of Control, the Option, to the extent it had not vested and was cancelled or otherwise terminated upon or prior to the date of such Change of Control solely as a result of such termination of employment, shall be reinstated and shall automatically become fully vested, and the Grantee shall be given a reasonable opportunity to exercise such accelerated portion of the Option before it terminates.
 
The vesting schedule requires continued employment or service through each applicable vesting date as a condition to the vesting of the applicable installment of the Option and the rights and benefits under this Option Agreement. Employment or service for only a portion of the vesting period, even if a substantial portion, will not entitle the Grantee to any proportionate vesting or avoid or mitigate a termination of rights and benefits upon or following a termination of employment or services as provided in Section 4 below or under the Plan.
Nothing contained in this Option Agreement or the Plan constitutes an employment or service commitment by the Corporation, affects the Grantee's status as an employee at will who is subject to termination without cause, confers upon the Grantee any right to remain employed by or in service to the Corporation or any Subsidiary, interferes in any way with the right of the Corporation or any Subsidiary at any time to terminate such employment or services, or affects the right of the Corporation or any Subsidiary to increase or decrease the Grantee's other compensation or benefits. Nothing in this paragraph, however, is intended to adversely affect any independent contractual right of the Grantee without his consent thereto.
The Option shall be exercisable by the delivery to the Secretary of the Corporation (or such other person as the Administrator may require pursuant to such administrative exercise procedures as the Administrator may implement from time to time) of:
 
 
 
 
The Administrator also may, but is not required to, authorize a non-cash payment alternative by notice and third party payment in such manner as may be authorized by the Administrator, or, subject to such procedures as the Administrator may adopt, authorize a "cashless exercise" with a third party who provides simultaneous financing for the purposes of (or who otherwise facilitates) the exercise of the Option.
 
The Option is subject to termination in connection with certain corporate events as provided in Section 7.2 of the Plan.
4.1
Possible Termination of Option upon Certain Corporate Events.
Subject to earlier termination on the Expiration Date of the Option or pursuant to Section 4.1 above, if the Grantee ceases to be employed by or ceases to provide services to the Corporation, the following rules shall apply (the last day that the Grantee is employed by or provides services to the Corporation is referred to as the Grantee's ""):
4.2
Termination of Option upon a Termination of Grantee's Employment or Services.
Severance Date
 
 
 
For purposes of the Option, "" means that, as of the Grantee's Severance Date, the Grantee has either (i) attained age 55 with at least five (5) full years of service with the Corporation, or (ii) has attained age 60, or (iii) is a participant in and is entitled to commence a benefit under a Corporation-sponsored defined benefit plan and has at least 10 years of service with the Corporation. For purposes of the Option, "" means a "permanent and total disability" (within the meaning of Section 22(e)(3) of the Code or as otherwise determined by the Administrator).
Retirement
Total Disability

Investor Update  June 23, 2008
References in this update to Air Group, Company, we, us, and our refer to Alaska Air Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise specified.
This report includes information regarding forecasts of available seat miles (ASMs), cost per available seat mile (CASM) excluding fuel and special charges, capital expenditures, and fleet information, as well as certain actual results for revenue passenger miles (RPMs), load factor and revenue per available seat mile (RASM), for our subsidiaries Alaska Airlines, Inc. (Alaska) and Horizon Air Industries, Inc. (Horizon).  Our disclosure of operating cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel and special charges, provides us the ability to measure and monitor our performance without these items.  The most directly comparable GAAP measure is total operating expense per available seat mile.  However, due to the large fluctuations in fuel prices, we are unable to predict total operating expense for any future period with any degree of certainty. In addition, we believe the disclosure of fuel expense on an economic basis is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. Please see the cautionary statement under Forward-Looking Information.
We are providing unaudited information about fuel price movements and the impact of our hedging program on our financial results.  Management believes it is useful to compare results between periods on an economic basis. is defined as the raw or into-plane fuel cost less the cash we receive from hedge counterparties for hedges that settle during the period, offset by the premium expense that we recognize.  Economic fuel expense more closely approximates the net cash outflow associated with purchasing fuel for our operation.

Forward-Looking Information
 
This update contains forward-looking statements subject to the safe harbor protection provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements relate to future events and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual outcomes to be materially different from those indicated by any forward-looking statements.  For a comprehensive discussion of potential risk factors, see Item 1A of the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007.   Some of these risks include increased competition, significant fuel costs, general economic conditions, labor costs and relations, our significant indebtedness, inability to meet cost reduction goals, terrorist attacks, seasonal fluctuations in our financial results, an aircraft accident, laws and regulations, and government fees and taxes.  All of the forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the risk factors discussed therein. These risk factors may not be exhaustive. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risk factors emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict such new risk factors, nor can it assess the impact, if any, of such new risk factors on our business or events described in any forward-looking statements. We expressly disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date of this report to conform them to actual results. Over time, our actual results, performance or achievements will likely differ from the anticipated results, performance or achievements that are expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements, and such differences might be significant and materially adverse.

Forecast
Information
*For Alaska, our forecasts of mainline cost per ASM and fuel cost per ASM are based on forward-looking estimates, which will likely differ from actual results due to several factors including, but not limited to, the volatility of fuel prices. Fuel cost per ASM above includes our estimate of raw fuel cost for the second quarter and the actual favorable adjustments to the value of our fuel-hedging portfolio in April and May. Our economic fuel cost per ASM will likely be different than the amount presented here.
**Because of the volatility of fuel prices, actual amounts may differ significantly.  We are unable to forecast economic fuel cost per gallon for fiscal 2008.
Fleet Transition Charges Expected in Second Quarter
As disclosed previously, Alaska has four MD-80 aircraft under long-term leases.  As these aircraft cease operating, we will have charges reflecting the aggregate lease payments remaining under the lease terms.  During the second quarter, two of these aircraft were retired and were placed in a long-term storage facility.  As a result, we expect to record a second quarter fleet transition charge of approximately $30 million.  We also expect similar charges in the third quarter when we retire the remaining two MD-80s under long-term leases.

Forecast Information
* For Horizon, our forecasts of cost per ASM and fuel cost per ASM are based on forward-looking estimates, which will likely differ significantly from actual results. There are several factors impacting our estimates including, but not limited to, the volatility of fuel prices. Fuel cost per ASM above includes our estimate of raw fuel cost for the second quarter and the actual favorable adjustments to the value of our fuel-hedging portfolio in April and May. We expect that our economic fuel cost per ASM will be lower.
Horizons CASM includes the expected loss on the sublease of Q200 aircraft to a third party.  We expect the loss will be approximately $3 million in the second quarter of 2008 as we have delivered the final two Q200s to the third party under the existing sublease agreement.
 
**Horizons fuel consumption now includes fuel that was formerly purchased by Frontier as part of the Frontier CPA agreement.
***Because of the volatility of fuel prices, actual amounts may differ significantly.  We are unable to forecast economic fuel cost per gallon for fiscal 2008.
 
Fleet Transition Charges Expected in Second Quarter
Horizons unit cost guidance does not yet include any impact from our recent decision to retire the CRJ-700 fleet earlier than expected.  As previously disclosed in our Form 8-K dated April 24, 2008, we expect to record an impairment charge in the second quarter on the two owned CRJ-700 aircraft.  The final amount of this charge has not yet been determined.
In addition, we expected to revise the salvage values and estimated useful lives of the two owned CRJ-700 aircraft and the related spare parts as well as spare parts associated with the remaining Q200 fleet, which we now plan to remove from service by the end of 2008. These changes in estimate could result in a change to operating expenses not reflected in the forecast above as the impact has not yet been quantified.

June 2008 Statistics
*percentage of available seats occupied by fare-paying passengers
Revenue information is not yet available for June. However, as previously disclosed in our last Investor Update dated June 23, Mainline unit revenues for the first two months of the second quarter were as follows:
 
Given the 0.4% increase in Passenger RASM in the two-month period and the 1.8 point reduction in load factor in June, we expect our PRASM for the second quarter to be about flat compared to the second quarter of 2007.
Forecast Information
*For Alaska, our forecasts of mainline cost per ASM and fuel cost per ASM are based on forward-looking estimates, which will likely differ from actual results due to several factors including, but not limited to, the volatility of fuel prices. Fuel cost per ASM is stated on a GAAP basis and thus includes mark to-market adjustments related to hedge accounting. We expect that our economic fuel cost per ASM will differ.
**Because of the volatility of fuel prices, actual amounts may differ significantly. We are unable to forecast economic fuel cost per gallon for the full year 2008.
Fleet Transition Charges Expected in Second Quarter
As disclosed previously, Alaska has four MD-80 aircraft under long-term leases. As these aircraft cease operating, we will have charges reflecting the aggregate lease payments and maintenance obligations remaining under the lease terms. During the second quarter, two of these aircraft were retired and were placed in a long-term storage facility. As a result, we expect to record a second quarter fleet transition charge in the range of $25 million to $27 million. This estimate (which is still being finalized) has been revised downward from the $30 million estimate disclosed in our June 23 Investor Update. We also expect similar charges in the third quarter when we retire the remaining two MD-80s under long-term leases.
 
Alaska has Capacity Purchase Agreements (CPA) with Horizon for certain routes and a third party whereby Alaska purchases capacity for service between Anchorage and Dutch Harbor, AK.
June 2008 Statistics (Horizon CPA)
The following data represents only the Horizon CPA flying as that flying represents approximately 95% of the total purchased capacity.
*Percentage of available seats occupied by fare-paying passengers
Revenue information is not yet available for June. However, as previously disclosed in our last Investor Update on June 23, Purchased Capacity unit revenues for the first two months of the second quarter were as follows:
Given the 1.5% decrease in Purchased Capacity RASM in the two-month period and the 1.9 point decrease in load factor in June, we expect our RASM for the second quarter to be down 3% to 4% compared to the second quarter of 2007.
Forecast Information (Horizon CPA)
* Costs associated with the Horizon CPA agreement are eliminated in consolidation
 
June 2008 Statistics
*percentage of available seats occupied by fare-paying passengers
Revenue information is not yet available for June. However, as previously disclosed in our last Investor Update on June 23, Horizon's system unit revenues for the first two months of the second quarter were as follows:
 
Given the 8.3% increase in RASM in the two-month period and the 1.6 point decrease in load factor in June, we expect our system RASM for the second quarter to be approximately 10% higher than the second quarter of 2007.
Line-of-Business Information
Horizon's information for line-of-business traffic and revenue information for the first two months of the second quarter information is presented below and was also presented in our June 23 Investor Update. In CPA arrangements, Horizon is (or was, as was the case with the Frontier CPA which ended in November 2007) insulated from market revenue factors and is guaranteed contractual revenue amounts based on operational capacity.

In addition, we expect to revise the salvage values and estimated useful lives of the two owned CRJ-700 aircraft and the related spare parts as well as spare parts associated with the remaining Q200 fleet, which we now plan to remove from service by the end of 2008.

ITEM 2.02   Results of Operations And Financial Condition
Alaska Air Group, Inc. today issued a press release reporting financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2008. The press release is filed as Exhibit 99.1.
ITEM 7.01.  Regulation FD Disclosure
Pursuant to 17 CFR Part 243 ("Regulation FD"), the Company is submitting information relating to its financial and operational outlook as attached in Exhibit 99.2.
In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information under this item and Exhibit 99.2 shall not be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), nor shall such information be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing. This report will not be deemed an admission as to the materiality of any information required to be disclosed solely to satisfy the requirements of Regulation FD.
ITEM 9.01   Financial Statements and Other Exhibits
 
 
Signatures
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
 
Executive Vice President/Finance and Planning and Chief Financial Officer
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
SEATTLE  Alaska Air Group, Inc. (NYSE:ALK) today reported second quarter net income of $63.1 million, or $1.74 per diluted share, compared to net income of $46.1 million, or $1.13 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2007. Excluding special items, the company reported a net loss of $14.1 million, or $0.39 per share, which compares to 2007 net income of $47.2 million, or $1.16 per share, and a First Call mean estimate loss of $0.41 per share.
The current-year results include charges associated with the transition to single fleets at both Alaska and Horizon of $32.1 million ($20.1 million after tax, or $0.56 per diluted share). Both periods include adjustments to reflect timing of gain or loss recognition resulting from mark-to-market fuel hedge accounting. Because of significant recent increases in crude oil prices, the value of the company's fuel hedge portfolio that will benefit future periods increased dramatically, resulting in a $155.3 million ($97.3 million after tax, or $2.69 per share) mark-to-market gain compared to a $1.8 million ($1.1 million after tax, or $0.03 per share) loss in the second quarter of 2007.
"Skyrocketing fuel prices have eclipsed the improvements that we've worked so hard to achieve in every area of our business," said Alaska Air Group Chairman and CEO Bill Ayer. "Decisive action, an excellent operation, and the genuine, caring service our people provide will help us survive what is shaping up to be the most difficult period in commercial aviation history."
The company outlined a plan that includes maintaining a strong cash balance, cutting capacity, increasing fares and other sources of revenue, conserving fuel and controlling non-fuel costs. Ayer announced that Alaska's fourth-quarter mainline capacity will decline by 5 percent from 2007 levels, and mainline capacity for 2009 will decrease by 5 percent to 10 percent compared with 2008.
The company is determining the full effect of the schedule reductions on work groups and expects to have more information in early September. Alaska Airlines announced today that management headcount would be reduced by 5 percent, effective Sept. 1. Horizon Air also reduced its management work force by 13 percent earlier this year and will further reduce operational and management positions in connection with capacity cuts.
"We are keenly aware of the impact on our employees and regret having to take these actions," Ayer said. "Current fuel prices  which are devastating for airlines and consumers alike  require these measures to ensure the viability of our company."
Alaska Airline's mainline passenger traffic in the second quarter increased 1.1 percent on a capacity increase of 1.6 percent. Load factor declined 0.4 percentage points to 78.1 percent. Alaska's mainline operating revenue per available seat mile (ASM) increased 0.9 percent and its operating cost per ASM excluding fuel and the special items mentioned above increased 2.9 percent. Alaska's total pretax income for the quarter was $87.3 million, compared to pretax income of $80.9 million in 2007. Excluding the mark-to-market fuel hedge adjustments and fleet transition charges, Alaska would have reported a pretax loss of $15.6 million for the quarter compared to pretax income of $82.4 million in the second quarter of 2007.
Horizon Air's passenger traffic in the second quarter declined 4.9 percent on a 3.0 percent capacity decrease. Load factor decreased by 1.5 percentage points to 73.6 percent. Horizon's operating revenue per ASM increased 9.4 percent and its operating cost per ASM excluding fuel and the special charges mentioned above decreased 4.2 percent. Horizon's total pretax income for the quarter was $12.6 million, compared to a pretax loss of $4.9 million in 2007. Excluding the mark-to-market fuel hedge adjustments and CRJ-700 fleet transition charges, Horizon's pretax loss would have been $7.7 million for the quarter compared to a pretax loss of $4.6 million in the second quarter of 2007.
Alaska Air Group had cash and short-term investments at June 30, 2008 of $1.0 billion.
A summary of financial and statistical data for Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air, as well as a reconciliation of the reported non-GAAP financial measures, can be found in the accompanying tables.

Investor Update  July 24, 2008
References in this update to "Air Group," "Company," "we," "us," and "our" refer to Alaska Air Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise specified.
This update includes forecasted operational and financial information for our subsidiaries Alaska Airlines, Inc. (Alaska) and Horizon Air Industries, Inc. (Horizon). Our disclosure of operating cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel and other items, provides us (and may provide investors) with the ability to measure and monitor our performance without these items. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is total operating expense per available seat mile. However, due to the large fluctuations in fuel prices, we are unable to predict total operating expense for any future period with any degree of certainty. In addition, we believe the disclosure of fuel expense on an economic basis is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. Please see the cautionary statement under "Forward-Looking Information."
Please see our press release dated today for actual financial and statistical information for the second quarter of 2008.
Forward-Looking Information
This update contains forward-looking statements subject to the safe harbor protection provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements relate to future events and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual outcomes to be materially different from those indicated by any forward-looking statements. For a comprehensive discussion of potential risk factors, see Item 1A of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007. Some of these risks include increased competition, significant fuel costs, general economic conditions, labor costs and relations, our significant indebtedness, inability to meet cost reduction goals, terrorist attacks, seasonal fluctuations in our financial results, an aircraft accident, laws and regulations, and government fees and taxes. All of the forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the risk factors discussed therein. These risk factors may not be exhaustive. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risk factors emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict such new risk factors, nor can it assess the impact, if any, of such new risk factors on our business or events described in any forward-looking statements. We expressly disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date of this report to conform them to actual results. Over time, our actual results, performance or achievements will likely differ from the anticipated results, performance or achievements that are expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements, and such differences might be significant and materially adverse.
Forecast Information
*For Alaska, our forecasts of mainline cost per ASM and fuel cost per ASM are based on forward-looking estimates, which will likely differ from actual results due to several factors including, but not limited to, the volatility of fuel prices. Fuel cost per ASM is stated on a GAAP basis and thus includes mark to-market adjustments related to hedge accounting. We expect that our economic fuel cost per ASM will differ from the fuel cost per ASM amount above.
**Because of the volatility of fuel prices, actual amounts may differ significantly. We are unable to forecast economic fuel cost per gallon for the full year 2008.
Fleet Transition and Restructuring Charges Expected in Third Quarter
As disclosed previously, Alaska has four MD-80 aircraft under long-term leases. As these aircraft cease operating, we will have charges reflecting the aggregate lease payments and maintenance obligations remaining under the lease terms. During the second quarter, two of these aircraft were retired and were placed in a long-term storage facility. As a result, we recorded a second quarter fleet transition charge of $26. The other two are expected to be retired in August, resulting in a similar charge of $25 to $28 million during the third quarter.
The forecast does not include the impact of severance charges associated with the 5% reduction in management headcount announced today. We expect the charge to be between $2.5 million and $3.0 million and will be recorded in the third quarter.
Advance Bookings
 
Alaska has Capacity Purchase Agreements (CPA) with Horizon for certain routes and a third party whereby Alaska purchases capacity for service between Anchorage and Dutch Harbor, AK.
Forecast Information (Horizon CPA)
The forecast reflects the Horizon CPA flying only as that flying represents approximately 95% of the total purchased capacity. The ASMs shown below are also included in Horizon's system forecast presented on the following page.
 
* Costs associated with the Horizon CPA agreement are eliminated in consolidation

Forecast Information
*For Horizon, our forecasts of cost per ASM and fuel cost per ASM are based on forward-looking estimates, which will likely differ significantly from actual results. There are several factors impacting our estimates including, but not limited to, the volatility of fuel prices, fleet transition activity, and the actual timing of aircraft or engine maintenance events.
Fuel cost per ASM is stated on a GAAP basis and thus includes mark-to-market adjustments related to hedge accounting. We expect that our economic fuel cost per ASM will differ from the fuel cost per ASM amount above.
**Because of the volatility of fuel prices, actual amounts may differ significantly. We are unable to forecast economic fuel cost per gallon for the full year 2008.
Fleet Transition Charges Expected in Third Quarter
There may be further fleet transition charges associated with the transition out of the CRJ-700 aircraft, one of which is expected to exit the fleet during the third quarter. The amount of any third quarter charge cannot be estimated at this time because the method of aircraft disposition is not yet known.

Fourth Quarter 2008 and Initial 2009 Capacity Guidance and Impact of Capacity Reductions
We currently expect fourth quarter 2008 capacity (as measured by Available Seat Miles) to be 6.5% to 7% lower than the fourth quarter of 2007. We expect capacity in the first quarter of 2009 to be down 10% compared to the first quarter of 2008 as a result of a planned 16% decline in the number of departures, offset by larger average aircraft size and an increase in our average stage length. Currently, our expectation is that full-year 2009 capacity will decline by 8%, although plans for the full year have not been finalized and are dependent on the general economic environment and fuel costs.
Since August 1, we have reduced the number of non-union management employees by approximately 5% (or 80 employees), roughly half through the elimination of open positions and half through layoffs. We expect to record a $1.6 million charge in the third quarter of 2008 for severance payments and medical benefits for affected management employees.
Because of the planned first quarter 2009 capacity reductions and 8% capacity reduction expected for 2009, we will be reducing the number of employees by an additional 850 to 1000, or approximately 9% to 10%. Impacted employees will include pilots, flight attendants, reservations and customer service agents, mechanics and some employees from other groups.
The company is working with the labor unions that represent these employees on ways to minimize the impact of the capacity reductions and reduce the need to furlough front-line employees. The company plans to offer extended leaves, a voluntary furlough program, and an early-out package with a lump sum payment based on years of service. These programs will also include continuation of medical coverage and travel benefits for a specified period of time.
The table below shows estimated reductions by workgroup:
 
We expect that the pilot reductions will take place between November 2008 and March 2009. Reductions in other employee groups will take place in the fourth quarter of 2008, with the majority of those reductions coming in November.
At this time, we are unable to estimate the amount of the charge associated with any severance and extended medical benefits for the impacted employees because the number of employees that will elect the early-out packages is still unknown. However, we do expect that some portion of the charge will be recorded in the third quarter.

Fleet Transition and Restructuring Charges Expected in Third Quarter
As disclosed previously, Alaska has four MD-80 aircraft under long-term leases. As these aircraft cease operating, we will have charges reflecting the aggregate lease payments and maintenance obligations remaining under the lease terms. Two of these aircraft were retired and placed in a storage facility during the second quarter, and the other two were retired at the end of August. We expect a charge of approximately $22 million during the third quarter associated with the retirement of these two aircraft.

*Costs associated with the Horizon CPA agreement are eliminated in consolidation
Initial 2009 Capacity Guidance
We currently estimate that capacity under the Horizon CPA will decline approximately 11% in the first quarter of 2009 compared to the first quarter of 2008. We expect full-year 2009 capacity to decline by 10%, although full-year plans have not yet been finalized.
 
Fourth Quarter 2008 and Initial 2009 Capacity Guidance and Impact of Capacity Reductions
We currently expect fourth quarter 2008 capacity (as measured by Available Seat Miles) to decline approximately 20% compared to the fourth quarter of 2007. We expect capacity in the first quarter of 2009 to be 14% to 15% lower than the first quarter of 2008 as a result of an 18% to 19% decline in the number of departures, offset by larger gauge resulting from the completed transition out of our fleet of 37-seat Q200 aircraft. Currently, our expectation is that full year 2009 capacity will decline by approximately 9%, although plans for the full year have not been finalized and are dependent on the general economic environment and fuel costs.
As a result of our Q200 transition and 2008 capacity reductions, we have taken or will be taking the following staffing actions during the third and fourth quarters of 2008:

In addition to the firm orders noted above, Alaska has options to acquire 45 additional B737-800s and Horizon has options to acquire 20 Q400s.
 
Impact of Boeing Strike
Due to the machinist strike at Boeing, Alaska may experience delays in the delivery of some of our 737-800 aircraft. We still expect to take delivery of five B737-800 aircraft in the third quarter. However, the timing of the five aircraft originally scheduled to be delivered in the fourth quarter is uncertain and dependent on the duration of the strike.
Potential Deferral of Q-400 Deliveries
Horizon is in discussions with Bombardier about deferring the 11 Q400 aircraft deliveries scheduled for delivery in 2009 and retiming them to coincide with the successful remarketing and transition out of the CRJ-700 aircraft. Horizon still plans to take delivery of the three Q400s originally scheduled for the fourth quarter of this year. However, the December delivery is now expected to arrive in January 2009.

ITEM 7.01.   Regulation FD Disclosure
Pursuant to 17 CFR Part 243 ("Regulation FD"), the Company is submitting information relating to its financial and operational outlook in the "Investor Update" as attached in Exhibit 99.1.
In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in this report shall not be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), nor shall such information be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing. This report will not be deemed an admission as to the materiality of any information required to be disclosed solely to satisfy the requirements of Regulation FD.

Exhibit 99.1
Investor Update  October 7, 2008
References in this update to "Air Group," "Company," "we," "us," and "our" refer to Alaska Air Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise specified.
This report includes actual and forecasted operational and financial information for our subsidiaries Alaska Airlines, Inc. (Alaska) and Horizon Air Industries, Inc. (Horizon). Our disclosure of operating cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel and other items, provides us (and may provide investors) with the ability to measure and monitor our performance without these items. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is total operating expense per available seat mile. However, due to the large fluctuations in fuel prices, we are unable to predict total operating expense for any future period with any degree of certainty. In addition, we believe the disclosure of fuel expense on an economic basis is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. Please see the cautionary statement under "Forward-Looking Information."
We are providing unaudited information about fuel price movements and the impact of our hedging program on our financial results. Management believes it is useful to compare results between periods on an "economic basis." is defined as the raw or "into-plane" fuel cost less the cash we receive from hedge counterparties for hedges that settle during the period, offset by the premium expense that we recognize. Economic fuel expense more closely approximates the net cash outflow associated with purchasing fuel for our operation.
Economic fuel expense
Forward-Looking Information
This update contains forward-looking statements subject to the safe harbor protection provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements relate to future events and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual outcomes to be materially different from those indicated by any forward-looking statements. For a comprehensive discussion of potential risk factors, see Item 1A of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007. Some of these risks include increased competition, significant fuel costs, general economic conditions, labor costs and relations, our significant indebtedness, inability to meet cost reduction goals, terrorist attacks, seasonal fluctuations in our financial results, an aircraft accident, laws and regulations, and government fees and taxes. All of the forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the risk factors discussed therein. These risk factors may not be exhaustive. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risk factors emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict such new risk factors, nor can it assess the impact, if any, of such new risk factors on our business or events described in any forward-looking statements. We expressly disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date of this report to conform them to actual results. Over time, our actual results, performance or achievements will likely differ from the anticipated results, performance or achievements that are expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements, and such differences might be significant and materially adverse.
 
We currently expect to report an adjusted profit for the third quarter. However, as a result of the significant decline in crude oil prices since the end of the second quarter, we expect to record approximately $220 million in mark-to-market loss on the value of our fuel hedge portfolio. This loss combined with other special items in the third quarter as noted in this Investor Update will result in a significant third quarter loss on a GAAP basis.
 
Capacity Guidance and Impact of Capacity Reductions
In our previous update, we forecast a 6.5% to 7% decline and a 10% decline in capacity (as measured by available seat miles) for the fourth quarter 2008 and first quarter 2009, respectively. Due to expected aircraft delivery delays in connection with the Boeing strike, we now expect capacity to be down between 7% and 8% in the fourth quarter 2008 and between 10% and 12% in the first quarter 2009. For the full year 2009, we expect capacity to be down 8% compared to 2008. Plans for the full year of 2009 are subject to change.
Since August 1, we have reduced the number of non-union management employees by approximately 5% (or 80 employees), roughly half through the elimination of open positions and half through layoffs. Additionally, we announced on September 12, 2008 a further reduction of 850 to 1,000 employees from operational work groups in response to our capacity reductions noted above.
September 2008 Statistics
*percentage of available seats occupied by fare-paying passengers
Actual revenue and fuel cost information is not yet available for September. However, information for the first two months of the third quarter is as follows:
Given the 1.4% increase in Passenger RASM in the two-month period and the 4-point increase in load factor in September, we expect our PRASM for the third quarter to be approximately 3%-4% higher than the third quarter of 2007.
Advance Booked Load Factors
During the fourth quarter, capacity as measured by ASMs is expected to decline by 5% in October and 9% in both November and December as compared to the same months in the fourth quarter of 2007.
 
Forecast Information
*For Alaska, our forecast of mainline cost per ASM excluding fuel and special items is based on forward-looking estimates, which may differ from actual results.
**Because of the volatility of fuel prices, actual amounts may differ significantly. We are unable to forecast economic fuel cost per gallon for the full year 2008. Additionally, we expect third quarter mark-to-market losses of approximately $180 million related to hedge accounting. This will cause our fuel cost on a GAAP basis to be significantly higher than our economic fuel cost.
Other Third Quarter Items
Fleet Transition
As disclosed previously, Alaska has four MD-80 aircraft under long-term leases. As these aircraft cease operating, we will have charges reflecting the aggregate lease payments and maintenance obligations remaining under the lease terms. Two of these aircraft were retired and placed in a storage facility during the second quarter, and the other two were retired at the end of August. We recorded a charge of $21.5 million during the third quarter associated with the retirement of these two aircraft.
Changes in Mileage Plan Program
Earlier this year, we announced a number of changes to our Mileage Plan program, effective November 1, 2008, in an effort to improve the program's economics. For example, we:
 
We also changed our Mileage Plan miles expiration policy so that accounts (with certain exceptions) with no mileage activity for two years will become inactive and the miles will be deleted. This change was implemented during the third quarter of 2008. As a result of the change, there was a reduction in the number of miles outstanding and thus a reduction in our obligation to provide award trips to inactive Mileage Plan members. Because of this reduction, Alaska recorded a benefit of $42 million in the third quarter, which will be included in other revenue. Based on the third quarter capacity of 6,306 million ASMs, RASM for the third quarter will be positively impacted by 0.7 cents. We also expect that the policy change will result in an increase in Mileage Plan revenues in future periods, although by a lesser amount.
Restructuring Charges
We expect to record a $3 million to $4 million charge in the third quarter of 2008 for severance payments and medical benefits for employees impacted by the capacity reductions discussed above. We expect further charges in the fourth quarter as employees accept early-out packages. At this time, we are unable to estimate the amount of the charge that will be recorded in the fourth quarter.
 
Alaska has Capacity Purchase Agreements (CPAs) with Horizon for certain routes and with a third party for service between Anchorage and Dutch Harbor, AK.
September 2008 Statistics (Horizon CPA)
The following data represents only the Horizon CPA flying as that flying represents approximately 95% of Alaska's total purchased capacity.
*Percentage of available seats occupied by fare-paying passengers
Revenue information is not yet available for September. However, purchased capacity unit revenues for the first two months of the third quarter were as follows:
Given the 3.8% increase in Passenger RASM in the two-month period, the improving yields in these markets, and the 3.5-point decline in load factor in September, we expect our PRASM for the third quarter to be 3% to 4% higher than the third quarter of 2007.
Advance Booked Load Factors
During the fourth quarter, capacity as measured by ASMs is expected to decline by 15% in both October and November and 18% in December as compared to the same months in the fourth quarter of 2007.
Forecast Information (Horizon CPA)
* Costs associated with the Horizon CPA agreement are eliminated in consolidation
 
Capacity Guidance and Impact of Capacity Reductions
As announced previously, we currently expect fourth quarter 2008 capacity (as measured by available seat miles) to decline approximately 20% compared to the fourth quarter of 2007. We also expect capacity in the first quarter of 2009 to be 14% to 15% lower than in the first quarter of 2008. Currently, our expectation is that full-year 2009 capacity will decline by approximately 9%, although plans for the full year have not been finalized.
As a result of our Q200 transition and 2008 capacity reductions, we have taken or will be taking the following staffing actions during the third and fourth quarters of 2008:
 
September 2008 Statistics
*Percentage of available seats occupied by fare-paying passengers
Actual revenue and fuel cost information is not yet available for September. However, information for the first two months of the third quarter is as follows:
Given the 15.7% increase in system RASM in the two-month period and the 1.3-point increase in load factor in September, we expect RASM for the third quarter to be 16% to 17% higher than the third quarter of 2007.
 
Line-of-Business Information
Horizon's line-of-business traffic and revenue information for the first two months of the third quarter is presented below. In CPA arrangements, Horizon is (or was, as is the case with the Frontier CPA that ended in November 2007) insulated from market revenue factors and is guaranteed contractual revenue amounts based on operational capacity. As a result, yield and load factor information is not presented. Horizon bears the revenue risk in its brand flying markets. Revenue from the Alaska CPA is eliminated in consolidation.
July and August 2008
 
Advance Booked Load Factors
During the fourth quarter, capacity as measured by ASMs is expected to decline by 22%, 21% and 16% in October, November, and December, respectively, as compared to the same months in the fourth quarter of 2007.
Forecast Information
*For Horizon, our forecast of cost per ASM excluding fuel and special items is based on forward-looking estimates, which may differ from actual results.
**Because of the volatility of fuel prices, actual amounts may differ significantly. We are unable to forecast economic fuel cost per gallon for the full year 2008. Additionally, we expect third quarter mark-to-market losses of approximately $40 million related to hedge accounting. This will cause our fuel cost on a GAAP basis to be significantly higher than our economic fuel cost.
 
Future Fuel Hedge Positions
Cash and Share Count
Given the current market volatility, we are evaluating the fair value of our cash and marketable securities portfolio to determine if any of the securities held are impaired. Based on our current estimates, we expect to record a charge of less than $5 million in the third quarter to write down the value of certain securities deemed to have "other-than-temporary" impairment. However, our evaluation is not yet complete and the amount of the charge could change.
Capital Expenditures
Total capital expenditures for 2008 are expected to be as follows (in millions):
 
Firm Aircraft Commitments
In addition to the firm orders noted above, Alaska has options to acquire 45 additional B737-800s and Horizon has options to acquire 20 Q400s. See the discussion below regarding the potential impact of the current Boeing strike and the possible deferral of Q400 aircraft on these commitments.
 
Impact of Boeing Strike
Due to the machinist strike at Boeing, Alaska may experience delays in the delivery of some of our 737-800 aircraft. The timing of the six aircraft scheduled for delivery in the fourth quarter is uncertain and dependent on the duration of the strike. Our capacity expectations are also subject to change based on the timing of these aircraft deliveries.
Potential Deferral of Q-400 Deliveries
Horizon is in discussions with Bombardier about deferring the 11 Q400 aircraft deliveries scheduled for 2009 and retiming them to coincide with the successful remarketing and transition out of the CRJ-700 aircraft. Horizon still plans to take delivery of the three Q400s originally scheduled for the fourth quarter of this year.
Projected Fleet Count (subject to Boeing strike and possible deferral of Q400 deliveries)
*F=Freighter; C=Combination freighter/passenger
** The planned CRJ fleet at December 31, 2008 and 2009 is subject to change as we finalize the fleet exit plan and is dependent on our ability to remarket these aircraft.
*** The expected fleet count at December 31, 2009 for Alaska is subject to change as we finalize the capacity reduction and aircraft utilization plan.
Effective Income Tax Rate
We base our estimated effective income tax rate on expected full-year pre-tax results calculated in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Because of the large mark-to-market losses resulting from the decline in the value of our fuel hedge portfolio, fleet transition and restructuring charges, and the impact of the Mileage Plan change all described above, there will be significant differences between our third quarter GAAP results and our adjusted results. We expect the effective tax rate on our adjusted pre-tax third quarter results to be between 40% and 45%.

Executive Vice President/Finance and Planning and Chief Financial Officer
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
Financial Highlights:
 
 
 
 
SEATTLE Alaska Air Group, Inc. (NYSE:ALK) today reported a net loss of $86.5 million for the third quarter of 2008 compared to net income of $81.8 million in 2007. Excluding special items, the company reported a third quarter net profit of $39.9 million, or $1.10 per diluted share, compared to $78.8 million, or $1.93 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2007.
"We are pleased to report an adjusted profit for the third quarter. Improved yields at both airlines helped recoup a portion of the $110 million increase in economic fuel expense," said CEO Bill Ayer. "Looking forward, the volatility of oil prices and the weak economy make this an extremely challenging environment. The key is to adapt our business to the changing conditions, and our fleet, balance sheet and strong customer following put us in a great position to do just that. I am grateful to the employees of Alaska and Horizon who, in spite of unprecedented head winds, have kept their focus on customers and have dramatically improved our operation."
The current-period results include a loss of $218.2 million ($136.7 million after tax, or $3.79 per diluted share) associated with the decline in the value of the company's fuel-hedge portfolio, compared to a $4.8 million gain ($3.0 million after tax, or $0.08 per diluted share) in the third
 
quarter of 2007. "While the value of the portfolio of our hedges that will settle in future periods has declined with the drop in oil prices, the total value at the end of the second quarter was still nearly $100 million. We had a net cash benefit of $44 million for hedges that settled during the quarter and $130 million so far this year," Ayer said.
Under GAAP accounting rules, the company's fuel-hedge portfolio must reflect the current market value at each reporting date with changes in market value reflected in current-period earnings. For hedge contracts that settle in future periods, rising oil prices generally result in recording unrealized gains; conversely, falling oil prices generally result in recording unrealized losses. To a large extent, this quarter's $218.2 million mark-to-market loss offsets the $155.3 million mark-to market gain reported in the second quarter when oil prices were at historical highs.
Other special items in the third quarter of 2008 include MD-80 and CRJ-700 fleet transition costs of $22.2 million ($13.9 million after tax, or $0.38 per diluted share) and severance costs of $3.7 million ($2.3 million after tax, or $0.06 per diluted share) associated with the reductions in force. During the third quarter, Alaska also recorded a $42.3 million benefit ($26.5 million after tax, or $0.73 per diluted share) from the reduction in the number of Mileage Plan miles outstanding after deleting accounts with no activity for more than two years under its new policy.
Alaska Airline's mainline passenger traffic in the third quarter declined 1.1 percent on a capacity decline of 0.8 percent compared to the third quarter of 2007. Load factor declined 0.2 percentage points to 79.5 percent. Alaska's mainline passenger revenue per available seat mile (ASM) increased 4.4 percent and its operating cost per ASM excluding fuel and the special items mentioned above declined 0.7 percent. Alaska's total pretax loss for the quarter was $107.4 million, compared to pretax income of $127.4 million in 2007. Excluding the special items above, Alaska's pretax income was $56.6 million for the quarter compared to pretax income of $123.4 million in the third quarter of 2007.
Horizon Air's passenger traffic in the third quarter declined 13.9 percent on a 12.8 percent capacity decrease. Load factor decreased by 0.9 percentage points to 76.3 percent. Horizon's passenger revenue per ASM increased 18.8 percent and its operating cost per ASM excluding fuel and the special items mentioned above increased 0.7 percent. Horizon's total pretax loss for the quarter was $25.1 million, compared to pretax income of $8.3 million in 2007. Excluding special items, Horizon's pretax income was $12.7 million for the quarter compared to pretax income of $7.5 million in the third quarter of 2007.
A summary of financial and statistical data for Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air, as well as a reconciliation of the reported non-GAAP financial measures, can be found in the accompanying tables.

See note on page 6 for information regarding an immaterial correction of amounts in the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2008 and 2007. The correction reduced net income or loss by $1.5 million ($0.04 per share) for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 and $0.7 million ($0.02 per share) for the nine months ended September 30, 2007.
 
CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (unaudited)
 
 
Air Group Net Income (Loss) and EPS Reconciliation:
The following table summarizes Alaska Air Group, Inc.'s net income (loss) and amounts per share during 2008 and 2007 excluding the benefit of the change in Mileage Plan expiration terms, restructuring and MD-80 and CRJ-700 fleet transition costs, and to reflect the timing of gain or loss recognition resulting from mark-to-market fuel-hedge accounting as reported in accordance with GAAP (in millions except per share amounts):
 
* Diluted EPS, excluding special items was calculated using diluted weighted-average shares outstanding of 36.232 million.

Correction of amounts presented for nine months ended September 30, 2008 and 2007
During the third quarter, we discovered an error in our calculation of stock-based compensation expense for certain awards granted after January 1, 2006. The error resulted in a $2.3 million understatement of wages and benefits in the first quarter of 2008, a $1.1 million understatement of expense in the first quarter of 2007 and a $2.9 million understatement of expense in 2006. We have concluded that these items are not material to those periods, and in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, we will make appropriate adjustments to our previously filed financial statements when they are presented in future Exchange Act reports.
Our results for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 and 2007 have been adjusted for this item. We have also adjusted our Financial and Statistical data schedules, unit cost reconciliations, and reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted amounts for both Alaska and Horizon.
:
Impact to 2008 reported amounts
The impact was to increase Air Group wages and benefits expense and total operating expenses and reduce the pretax result by $2.3 million ($1.9 million at Alaska and $0.4 million at Horizon). The after tax impact to Air Group was $1.5 million or $0.04 per share for the first quarter 2008. This amount impacts the first quarter of 2008 and thus the nine-month period ended September 30, 2008.
:
Impact to 2007 reported amounts
The impact was to increase Air Group wages and benefits expense and total operating expenses and reduce the pretax result by $1.1 million ($1.0 at Alaska and $0.1 at Horizon). The after tax impact to Air Group was $0.7 million or $0.02 per share. This amount impacts the first quarter of 2008 and thus the nine-month period ended September 30, 2007. Our total 2007 results will also be impacted by the same amount.

Pursuant to Regulation G, we are providing disclosure of the reconciliation of reported non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable financial measures reported on a GAAP basis. We believe that consideration of this measure of unit costs excluding fuel, purchased capacity costs, and other noted items may be important to investors for the following reasons:
:
Note A
 -  Cost per available seat mile (ASM) excluding fuel, purchased capacity costs, and other special items is one of the most important measures used by managements of both Alaska and Horizon and the Air Group Board of Directors in assessing quarterly and annual cost performance and, for Alaska Airlines, the operating results of the "mainline" operation, which includes the operation of aircraft branded in Alaska Airlines livery.
 -  Cost per ASM excluding fuel, purchased capacity costs, and other items as specified in our governing documents is an important metric used in the employee incentive plan that covers company management and executives.
 -  By eliminating fuel expense from our unit cost metrics, we believe that we have better visibility into the results of our non-fuel cost-reduction initiatives. Our industry is highly competitive, and characterized by high fixed costs, so even a small reduction in non-fuel operating costs can result in a significant improvement in operating results. In addition, we believe that all domestic carriers are similarly impacted by changes in jet fuel costs over the long run, so it is important for management (and thus investors) to understand the impact of (and trends in) company specific cost drivers such as labor rates and productivity, airport costs, and maintenance costs, which are more controllable by management.
 -  Cost per ASM excluding fuel and purchased capacity costs is a measure commonly used by industry analysts and we believe it is the basis by which they compare our airlines to others in the industry. The measure is also the subject of frequent questions from current or prospective investors.
 -  By eliminating the impact of certain noted or "special" items, management is provided the ability to measure and monitor performance both with and without these special items. Management believes that the disclosure of the impact of certain items such as the fleet transition costs is important to the reader as it provides information on significant items that are not indicative of future performance. Industry analysts and investors consistently measure the Company's performance without these items for better comparability between periods and between other airlines.
 -  Although we disclose our "mainline" unit revenues for Alaska to eliminate those revenues associated with purchased capacity flying performed by others on our behalf, we do not (nor are we able to) present unit revenues excluding the impact that rising fuel costs have had on ticket prices. This is a limitation of our non-GAAP measure that excludes fuel from unit costs, as economic fuel represents approximately 35% to 40% of our total mainline operating expenses (excluding special items), and fluctuations in our fuel prices are often the driver of changes in unit revenues in the mid-to long term. We would caution the readers of these financial statements not to place undue reliance on unit costs excluding fuel as a measure or predictor of future profitability.
The following tables reconcile our non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for both Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Horizon Air Industries, Inc.:

Line of Business Information:
Horizon brand flying includes those routes in the Horizon system not covered by the Alaska and Frontier Capacity Purchase Agreements (CPA). Horizon bears the revenue risk in those markets and, as a result, traffic, yield and load factor impact revenue recorded by Horizon. In CPA arrangements, Horizon is (or was, as was the case with the Frontier CPA which ended in November 2007) insulated from market revenue factors and is guaranteed contractual revenue amounts based on operational capacity. As a result, yield and load factor information is not presented.

Investor Update  October 23, 2008
References in this update to "Air Group," "Company," "we," "us," and "our" refer to Alaska Air Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise specified.
This update includes forecasted operational and financial information for our subsidiaries Alaska Airlines, Inc. (Alaska) and Horizon Air Industries, Inc. (Horizon). Our disclosure of operating cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel and other items, provides us (and may provide investors) with the ability to measure and monitor our performance without these items. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is total operating expense per available seat mile. However, due to the large fluctuations in fuel prices, we are unable to predict total operating expense for any future period with any degree of certainty. In addition, we believe the disclosure of fuel expense on an economic basis is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. Please see the cautionary statement under "Forward-Looking Information."
Please see our press release dated today for actual financial and statistical information for the third quarter of 2008.
Forward-Looking Information
This update contains forward-looking statements subject to the safe harbor protection provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements relate to future events and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual outcomes to be materially different from those indicated by any forward-looking statements. For a comprehensive discussion of potential risk factors, see Item 1A of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007. Some of these risks include increased competition, significant fuel costs, general economic conditions, labor costs and relations, our significant indebtedness, inability to meet cost reduction goals, terrorist attacks, seasonal fluctuations in our financial results, an aircraft accident, laws and regulations, and government fees and taxes. All of the forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the risk factors discussed therein. These risk factors may not be exhaustive. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risk factors emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict such new risk factors, nor can it assess the impact, if any, of such new risk factors on our business or events described in any forward-looking statements. We expressly disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date of this report to conform them to actual results. Over time, our actual results, performance or achievements will likely differ from the anticipated results, performance or achievements that are expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements, and such differences might be significant and materially adverse.
 
Forecast Information
 
*For Alaska, our forecast of mainline cost per ASM excluding fuel and restructuring charges is based on forward-looking estimates, which will likely differ from actual results.
**Because of the volatility of fuel prices, actual amounts may differ significantly.
Restructuring Charges Expected in Fourth Quarter
We expect further charges in the fourth quarter related to Alaska's reduction in work force that began during the third quarter. We expect to record a charge of approximately $15 million to $20 million in the fourth quarter. However, the actual amount will not be finalized until the number of employees who accept early-out packages is known. The final amount of the charge could differ significantly from this estimate.
Advance Bookings
 
2009 Capacity Guidance
As previously announced, we currently expect capacity in the first quarter of 2009 to be down between 10% and 12% and down approximately 8% for the full year of 2009 compared to the same periods in 2008. Plans for the full year of 2009 are subject to change.
 
Alaska has Capacity Purchase Agreements (CPA) with Horizon for certain routes and a third party whereby Alaska purchases capacity for service between Anchorage and Dutch Harbor, AK.
Forecast Information (Horizon CPA)
The forecast reflects the Horizon CPA flying only as that flying represents approximately 95% of the total purchased capacity. The ASMs shown below are also included in Horizon's system forecast presented on the following page.
 
* Costs associated with the Horizon CPA agreement are eliminated in consolidation

Forecast Information
 
*For Horizon, our forecast of cost per ASM excluding fuel is based on forward-looking estimates, which will likely differ significantly from actual results.
**Because of the volatility of fuel prices, actual amounts may differ significantly.
Fleet Transition Charges Expected in Fourth Quarter
There may be further fleet transition charges associated with the transition out of the CRJ-700 aircraft, two of which are expected to exit the fleet during the fourth quarter. The amount of any fourth quarter charge is not currently expected to be significant.
Advance Bookings  Brand Flying Only
 
2009 Capacity Guidance
As announced previously, we currently expect capacity in the first quarter of 2009 to be 14% to 15% lower than the first quarter of 2008. Additionally, our expectation is that full year 2009 capacity will decline by approximately 9%, although plans for the full year have not been finalized.
 
Future Fuel Hedge Positions
Our hedge strategy has resulted in realized gains of nearly $500 million since the fourth quarter of 2002. These gains and the overall changes in the value of our total hedge portfolio are presented in the graph below.
 
Cash and Share Count
Subsequent to the end of the third quarter, we drew $75 million from our existing $185 million line-of-credit facility. As of October 21, 2008, our cash and marketable securities balance was nearly $1.18 billion.
Capital Expenditures
Total actual and expected capital expenditures for the first six months and the full year 2008, respectively, are as follows (in millions):
 
Firm Aircraft Commitments
 
In addition to the firm orders noted above, Alaska has options to acquire 45 additional B737-800s and Horizon has options to acquire 20 Q400s. Although the table above represents current contractual commitments, our expectation is that the timing of delivery for these aircraft will differ. See the discussion below regarding the potential impact of the current Boeing strike and the possible deferral of Q400 aircraft on these commitments.
Impact of Boeing Strike
Due to the machinist strike at Boeing, Alaska may experience delays in the delivery of some of our 737-800 aircraft. The timing of the six aircraft scheduled for delivery in the fourth quarter is uncertain and dependent on the duration of the strike. Our capacity expectations are also subject to change based on the timing of these aircraft deliveries.
Potential Deferral of Q-400 Deliveries
Horizon is in discussions with Bombardier about deferring the 11 Q400 aircraft deliveries scheduled for delivery in 2009 and retiming them to coincide with the successful remarketing and transition out of the CRJ-700 aircraft. Horizon still plans to take delivery of one of the three Q400s originally scheduled for the fourth quarter of this year.
 
Projected Fleet Count (subject to Boeing strike and possible deferral of Q400 deliveries)
 
*F=Freighter; C=Combination freighter/passenger
** The planned CRJ and Q400 fleets at December 31, 2008 and 2009 are subject to change as we finalize the fleet transition plan and are dependent on our ability to remarket the CRJ aircraft and defer Q400 deliveries.
*** The expected fleet count at December 31, 2009 for Alaska is subject to change as we finalize the capacity reduction and aircraft utilization plan.

Exhibit 99.1
Investor Update  November 17, 2008
References in this update to "Air Group," "Company," "we," "us," and "our" refer to Alaska Air Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise specified.
This update includes forecasted operational and financial information for our subsidiaries Alaska Airlines, Inc. (Alaska) and Horizon Air Industries, Inc. (Horizon). Our disclosure of operating cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel and other items, provides us (and may provide investors) with the ability to measure and monitor our performance without these items. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is total operating expense per available seat mile. However, due to the large fluctuations in fuel prices, we are unable to predict total operating expense for any future period with any degree of certainty. In addition, we believe the disclosure of fuel expense on an economic basis is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. Please see the cautionary statement under "Forward-Looking Information."
We are providing unaudited information about fuel price movements and the impact of our hedging program on our financial results. Management believes it is useful to compare results between periods on an "economic basis." is defined as the raw or "into-plane" fuel cost less the cash we receive from hedge counterparties for hedges that settle during the period, offset by the recognition of premiums originally paid for those settled hedges (but excluding hedge contracts that are terminated earlier than their contractual settlement dates). Economic fuel expense more closely approximates the net cash outflow associated with purchasing fuel for our operation.

2009 Capacity Guidance
As announced previously, we currently expect capacity in the first quarter of 2009 to be 14% to 15% lower than the first quarter of 2008. Additionally, our expectation is that full year 2009 capacity will decline by approximately 9%, although plans for the full year have not been finalized.

Fleet Transition Charges Expected in Fourth Quarter
There may be further fleet transition charges associated with the transition out of the CRJ-700 aircraft, two of which are expected to exit the fleet during the fourth quarter. The amount of any fourth quarter charge is not currently expected to be significant.
 
Future Fuel Hedge Positions*
*All of our 2008, 2010 and 2011 positions and the majority of our 2009 positions are call options which are designed to effectively cap our cost of the crude oil component of our jet fuel purchases. With call options, we benefit from a decline in crude oil prices, as there is no downward exposure other than the premiums we pay to enter into the contracts.
We are in the process of modifying our hedge portfolio to take advantage of the recent and rapid decline in oil prices. To do this, we are terminating certain hedges that were originally scheduled to settle in 2009 and replacing those instruments with new hedges that have lower strike prices. Upon termination of these hedges, the cash that we receive has been significantly less than the premium we paid when we purchased the original hedge contract. The net economic cost of the modifications that we made thus far in the fourth quarter is approximately $30 million (measured as the difference between the original premium paid and the proceeds received upon termination). However, we believe that restructuring our hedge portfolio provides important strategic benefit because it significantly reduces our exposure to increases in fuel costs in 2009.

Impact of Boeing Strike
Due to the machinist strike at Boeing, Alaska will experience delays in the delivery of 737-800 aircraft. We expect an updated delivery schedule by the end of November. In our next Investor Update, the revised schedule will be reflected in our fleet information and capital expenditures estimates.
Deferral of Q-400 Deliveries
Horizon is in discussions with Bombardier about deferring future Q400 aircraft deliveries and retiming them to coincide with the successful remarketing and transition out of the CRJ-700 aircraft. The tables below represent the current proposal from Bombardier for future deliveries, although we are continuing to negotiate and the schedule is subject to change.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
SEATTLE The Alaska Air Group board of directors and Bill Ayer, chairman and chief executive officer, today announced a realignment to strengthen the company's senior leadership.
As part of the changes, Brad Tilden has been elected president of Alaska Airlines, reporting to Ayer. Previously Alaska Air Group's chief financial officer and executive vice president of finance and planning, Tilden will oversee the airline's operating divisions and marketing, in addition to retaining responsibility for network planning and revenue management.
"Brad's engaging leadership style and strong values, coupled with his financial judgment and commitment to ongoing process improvement, make him the right person to take on expanded responsibility for our operations, marketing, planning and customer experience as we continue to improve our long-term competitiveness," Ayer said.
Tilden joined Alaska Airlines as controller in 1991 and was promoted to chief financial officer in 2000. Prior to joining Alaska, he spent eight years with the accounting firm of Price Waterhouse at its offices in Seattle and Melbourne, Australia. He holds bachelor's and master's degrees in business administration and is a private pilot.
Replacing Tilden as chief financial officer and executive vice president of finance for Alaska Air Group and Alaska Airlines is Glenn Johnson, formerly Alaska Airlines' executive vice president of customer service  airports and maintenance and engineering. In addition to leading the company's finance organization, he will oversee information technology, strategic planning and corporate real estate.
Johnson has had a long career at Alaska Airlines and sister carrier Horizon Air in a variety of finance and customer service roles, including vice president of finance and treasurer at both carriers. "Glenn's extensive background in finance, as well as his operational and customer service expertise, makes him uniquely qualified to lead our finance, real estate, IT and strategic planning efforts at this critical time," Ayer said.
The company also announced the election of Ben Minicucci as Alaska Airlines' chief operating officer and executive vice president of operations. Previously vice president of Seattle operations, Minicucci will report to Tilden in this new position, and will lead flight operations and maintenance and engineering, in addition to airport customer service.
"In the year since Ben assumed leadership of our Seattle operation, he has re-engineered a host of operational functions, resulting in dramatic improvements to our on-time performance and baggage handling. Through this promotion, he will be more directly positioned to drive similar improvements throughout our network," Ayer said.
Minicucci was Alaska Airlines' staff vice president of maintenance and engineering before overseeing the airline's Seattle operations. He came to Alaska from Air Canada and a 14-year career in the Canadian Armed Forces, where he was responsible for aircraft maintenance. He holds bachelor's and master's degrees in mechanical engineering.
Stepping into a vice president role leading Alaska Air Group's planning and revenue management, reporting to Tilden, will be Andrew Harrison. Formerly managing director of planning, Harrison joined Alaska Airlines after a 16-year career in public accounting.
As part of the leadership changes, Gregg Saretsky, formerly Alaska Airlines' executive vice president of flight and marketing, will leave the company. "Gregg is a highly respected leader who guided our transcontinental expansion and built a strong marketing organization that has helped us fend off relentless competition," Ayer said. "We appreciate his many contributions during his 10 years at Alaska."
Alaska Airlines and sister carrier Horizon Air together serve more than 90 cities through an expansive network in Alaska, the Lower 48, Hawaii, Canada and Mexico. Alaska Airlines ranked "Highest in Customer Satisfaction among Traditional Network Carriers (tie)" in the J.D. Power and Associates 2008 North America Airline Satisfaction Study

ITEM 7.01.   Regulation FD Disclosure
Pursuant to 17 CFR Part 243 ("Regulation FD"), the Company is submitting information relating to its financial and operational outlook in the "Investor Update" as attached in Exhibit 99.1.
In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in this report shall not be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), nor shall such information be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.

Exhibit 99.1
Investor Update  December 19, 2008
References in this update to "Air Group," "Company," "we," "us," and "our" refer to Alaska Air Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise specified.
This update includes forecasted operational and financial information for our subsidiaries Alaska Airlines, Inc. (Alaska) and Horizon Air Industries, Inc. (Horizon). Our disclosure of operating cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel and other items, provides us (and may provide investors) with the ability to measure and monitor our performance without these items. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is total operating expense per available seat mile. However, due to the large fluctuations in fuel prices, we are unable to predict total operating expense for any future period with any degree of certainty. In addition, we believe the disclosure of fuel expense on an economic basis is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. Please see the cautionary statement under "Forward-Looking Information."
We are providing unaudited information about fuel price movements and the impact of our hedging program on our financial results. Management believes it is useful to compare results between periods on an "economic basis." is defined as the raw or "into-plane" fuel cost less the cash we receive from hedge counterparties for hedges that settle during the period, offset by the premium expense that we recognize. Economic fuel expense more closely approximates the net cash outflow associated with purchasing fuel for our operation.

Forward-Looking Information
This update contains forward-looking statements subject to the safe harbor protection provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements relate to future events and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual outcomes to be materially different from those indicated by any forward-looking statements. For a comprehensive discussion of potential risk factors, see Item 1A of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007. Some of these risks include increased competition, significant fuel costs, general economic conditions, labor costs and relations, our significant indebtedness, inability to meet cost reduction goals, terrorist attacks, seasonal fluctuations in our financial results, an aircraft accident, laws and regulations, and government fees and taxes. All of the forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the risk factors discussed therein. These risk factors may not be exhaustive. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risk factors emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict such new risk factors, nor can it assess the impact, if any, of such new risk factors on our business or events described in any forward-looking statements. We expressly disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date of this report to conform them to actual results. Over time, our actual results, performance or achievements will likely differ from the anticipated results, performance or achievements that are expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements, and such differences might be significant and materially adverse.
 
November 2008 Statistics
*percentage of available seats occupied by fare-paying passengers
Advance Booked Load Factors
Forecast Information
*For Alaska, our forecasts of mainline cost per ASM excluding fuel, restructuring charges and fleet transition costs is based on forward-looking estimates, which will likely differ from actual results.
**Because of the volatility of fuel prices, actual amounts may differ significantly from our estimates. Our forecasted economic fuel expense includes the net cost of hedges settled during the period. We expect the amount to be approximately $5.5 million during the fourth quarter for Alaska.
Restructuring Charges Expected in Fourth Quarter
As previously announced, we expect charges in the fourth quarter related to Alaska's reduction in work force that began during the third quarter. The original estimate of this fourth quarter charge was $15 million to $20 million. Based on information currently available, the estimate has been revised to $8 million to $10 million. The final amount of the charge could differ from this estimate.
2009 Capacity Guidance
As previously announced, we currently expect capacity in the first quarter of 2009 to be down between 10% and 12% and down approximately 8% for full year 2009 compared to the same periods in 2008. These capacity plans are subject to change.
 
Alaska has Capacity Purchase Agreements (CPA) with Horizon for certain routes and with a third party for service between Anchorage and Dutch Harbor, AK.

Line-of-Business Information
Horizon's line-of-business traffic and revenue information is presented below. In CPA arrangements, Horizon is (or was, in the case of the Frontier CPA which ended in November 2007) insulated from market revenue factors and is guaranteed contractual revenue amounts based on operational capacity. As a result, yield and load factor information is not presented. Horizon bears the revenue risk in its brand flying markets. Revenue from the Alaska CPA is eliminated in consolidation.

**Because of the volatility of fuel prices, actual amounts may differ significantly from our estimates. Our forecasted economic fuel expense includes the net cost of hedges settled during the period. We expect the amount to be approximately $1.1 million during the fourth quarter for Horizon.
Fleet Transition Charges Expected in Fourth Quarter
We currently expect fleet transition charges of between $2 million and $3 million associated with the transition out of two CRJ-700 aircraft that were removed from operations during the fourth quarter and delivered to a third party under a sublease arrangement. We expect further charges in 2009 as we exit the remaining fleet, although we cannot estimate the amount or timing of any 2009 charges at this time.
2009 Capacity Guidance
As announced previously, we currently expect capacity in the first quarter of 2009 to be 14% to 15% lower than the first quarter of 2008. Additionally, our expectation is that full year 2009 capacity will decline by approximately 9%, although plans for the full year have not yet been finalized.
 
Future Fuel Hedge Positions*
*All of our 2008, 2010 and 2011 positions and the majority of our 2009 positions are call options which are designed to effectively cap our cost of the crude oil component of our jet fuel purchases. With call options, we benefit from a decline in crude oil prices, as there is no downward exposure other than the premiums we pay to enter into the contracts.
As previously disclosed, we are modifying our hedge portfolio to take advantage of the recent and rapid decline in oil prices. We have terminated certain hedges that were originally scheduled to settle in 2009 and 2010 and replaced those instruments with new hedges that have lower strike prices. Upon termination of these hedges, the cash that we receive has been significantly less than the original premium we paid for the hedge contract. The net economic cost of the modifications that we have made thus far in the fourth quarter is approximately $35 million (measured as the difference between the original premium paid and the proceeds received upon termination). This amount will not be included in our calculation of and will therefore be excluded from our presentation of "adjusted" results for the period. We believe that restructuring our hedge portfolio provides important strategic benefit because it significantly reduces our exposure to increases in fuel costs in 2009 and beyond.

Impact of Boeing Strike and Deferral of Q400 Deliveries
Due to the machinist strike at Boeing, Alaska will experience delays in the delivery of 737-800 aircraft. We have received an updated delivery schedule from Boeing, which is reflected in the projected fleet count table below. Horizon has negotiated a deferral of Q400 deliveries with Bombardier to retime those deliveries to coincide with the successful remarketing and transition out of the CRJ-700 aircraft. The tables below reflect the revised schedule.
Capital Expenditures
Total expected capital expenditures for 2008 and 2009 are as follows (in millions):
 
* The amount above is presented net of the expected return of $80 million of pre-delivery payments from Boeing to reflect the timing of B737-800 aircraft deliveries that were deferred as a result of the Boeing strike. This return reduces the expected capital expenditures in 2008 and increases the expected amount for 2009.
 
Firm Aircraft Commitments
In addition to the firm orders noted above, Alaska has options to acquire 45 additional B737-800s and Horizon has options to acquire 10 Q400s. Alaska has notified Boeing of its intent to exercise the option on one 737-800 for delivery in 2009. Once that option has been converted to a firm commitment, we will have seven firm commitments for B737-800 aircraft in 2010.
Projected Fleet Count
* The expected fleet count at December 31, 2009 for Alaska is subject to change. We plan to sell up to four B737-700 aircraft in 2009 as a result of our capacity reductions, which is reflected in the 2009 changes above.
** F=Freighter; C=Combination freighter/passenger
*** All remaining Q200 aircraft have been taken out of scheduled service, but are expected to operate as spare aircraft through the end of January 2009.
**** The planned CRJ and Q400 fleets at December 31, 2009 are subject to change as we finalize the fleet transition plan and is dependent on our ability to remarket the CRJ aircraft.

December 2008 Statistics
 
*percentage of available seats occupied by fare-paying passengers
Actual revenue and fuel cost information is not yet available for December. However, information for the first two months of the fourth quarter, as previously disclosed, is as follows:
Advance Booked Load Factors
 
Forecast Information
*For Alaska, our forecasts of mainline cost per ASM excluding fuel, restructuring charges and fleet transition costs is based on forward-looking estimates, which will likely differ from actual results. Unit cost guidance for the quarter is relatively unchanged from our previous update. Although the December weather had an impact on our costs and capacity for the quarter, reductions in other costs offset the upward pressure on unit costs.
**Because of the volatility of fuel prices, actual amounts may differ significantly from our estimates. Our forecasted economic fuel expense includes the net cost of hedges settled during the period. We expect the amount to be approximately $5.4 million during the fourth quarter for Alaska. This amount does not include premiums associated with hedges that have been terminated as part of our hedge restructuring program. See page 7.
Impact of December Storms in Pacific Northwest
In the last two weeks of December, severe winter weather affected operations in the Pacific Northwest, most notably Seattle and Portland. We estimate that the storms resulted in 2% fewer ASMs than expected in December and between $6 million and $8 million in lost revenue and passenger refunds. However, we are still evaluating our estimate based on refunds processed subsequent to year end. Additionally, we estimate a $2 million increase in non-fuel expenses directly related to the storm including overtime and passenger inconvenience costs. Offsetting these amounts was an estimated $1 million in fuel savings as a result of the flight cancellations.
Restructuring Charges Expected in Fourth Quarter
As previously announced, we expect charges of approximately $8 million in the fourth quarter related to Alaska's reduction in work force that began during the third quarter.
2009 Capacity Guidance
As previously announced, we currently expect capacity in the first quarter of 2009 to be down between 10% and 12% and down approximately 8% for full year 2009 compared to the same periods in 2008. These capacity plans are subject to change.

Impact of December Storms in Pacific Northwest
In the last two weeks of December, severe winter weather affected operations in the Pacific Northwest, most notably Seattle and Portland. We estimate that the storms resulted in 6% fewer ASMs than expected in December and between $3 million and $4 million in lost revenue and passenger refunds. However, we are still evaluating our estimate based on refunds processed subsequent to year end. Additionally, we estimate a $1 million increase in non-fuel expenses directly related to the storm including overtime and passenger inconvenience costs. Offsetting these amounts was an estimated $1 million in fuel savings as a result of the flight cancellations.
Fleet Transition Charges Expected in Fourth Quarter
We currently expect fleet transition charges of between $2 million and $5 million associated with the transition out of two CRJ-700 aircraft that were removed from operations during the fourth quarter and delivered to a third party under a sublease arrangement. The final amount is pending a review of the accounting treatment. We expect further charges in 2009 as we exit the remaining fleet, although we cannot estimate the amount or timing of any 2009 charges at this time.
2009 Capacity Guidance
As announced previously, we currently expect capacity in the first quarter of 2009 to be 14% to 15% lower than the first quarter of 2008. Additionally, our expectation is that full year 2009 capacity will decline by approximately 9%, although plans for the full year have not yet been finalized.

This amount will not be included in our calculation of and will therefore be excluded from our presentation of "adjusted" results for the period. We believe that restructuring our hedge portfolio provides important strategic benefit because it significantly reduces our exposure to increases in fuel costs in 2009 and beyond.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
Fourth-Quarter Financial Highlights:
 
 
 
 
SEATTLE  Alaska Air Group, Inc. (NYSE: ALK) today reported a fourth quarter 2008 net loss of $75.2 million compared to net income of $7.4 million in fourth quarter 2007. Excluding special items, the company reported a net profit of $16.4 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $17.9 million, or $0.46 per share, in fourth quarter 2007.
Special items for the fourth quarter include the following:
 
 
 
 
The company reported a full-year 2008 net loss of $135.9 million compared to net income of $124.3 million in 2007. Excluding the full-year impact of the special items noted above, the $42.3 million benefit ($26.5 million after tax, or $0.73 per share) from changes in the company's Mileage Plan
 
program in the third quarter and MD-80 fleet transitions costs, the company reported a 2008 net profit of $4.4 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, compared to $91.6 million, or $2.26 per diluted share, in 2007.
Financial and operational highlights for 2008 include:
 
 
 
 
"In a year of unprecedented volatility that included soaring fuel prices and an economic meltdown, we were pleased to eke out a small profit for 2008, excluding special items, and be one of only a few major airlines to do so," said CEO Bill Ayer. "Our concerted efforts to control costs, improve our operation and tailor our schedule to better match customer demand have prepared us to face whatever hurdles the current year brings. I want to thank our people for taking excellent care of customers and stepping up to the challenge to see us through this period of great uncertainty."
Alaska Airline's mainline passenger traffic in the fourth quarter declined 4.4 percent on a capacity decline of 7.1 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2007. Load factor increased 2.3 percentage points to 77.0 percent. Alaska's mainline passenger revenue per available seat mile (ASM) increased 5.9 percent and its operating cost per ASM, excluding fuel and the special items mentioned above, increased 0.6 percent. Alaska's total pretax loss for the quarter was $93.4 million, compared to pretax income of $15.2 million in 2007. Excluding special items, Alaska's pretax income was $23.8 million for the quarter compared to a pretax loss of $18.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2007.
Horizon Air's passenger traffic in the fourth quarter declined 22.4 percent on a 21.1 percent capacity decrease. Load factor decreased by 1.2 percentage points to 71.4 percent. Horizon's passenger revenue per ASM increased 13.6 percent and its operating cost per ASM, excluding fuel and the special items mentioned above, increased 2.9 percent. Horizon's total pretax loss for the quarter was $25.7 million, compared to a pretax loss of $4.8 million in 2007. Excluding special items, Horizon's pretax income was $3.2 million for the quarter compared to a pretax loss of $11.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2007.
The company's debt-to-capital ratio was 81%:19% as of Dec. 31, 2008 compared to 70%:30% at Dec. 31, 2007. The decline is attributable to the nearly $500 million increase in long-term debt and the
 
GAAP loss of $135.9 million in 2008. The largest component of the change, however, was the significant increase in the company's unfunded defined benefit pension obligation, which is recorded through equity net of the tax effect. The liability increased approximately $300 million from Dec. 31, 2007 primarily as a result of the decline in market value in the plan's assets. On a projected benefit obligation basis, the company's liability is 59.4% funded at Dec. 31, 2008 compared to 86.2% a year earlier.
A summary of financial and statistical data for Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air, as well as a reconciliation of the reported non-GAAP financial measures, can be found in the accompanying tables.
A conference call regarding the fourth quarter and full-year 2008 results will be simulcast via the Internet at 8:30 a.m. Pacific Time on January 29, 2009. It can be accessed through the company's website at . For those unable to listen to the live broadcast, a replay will be available after the conclusion of the call at .

Air Group Net Income (Loss) and EPS Reconciliation:
The following table summarizes Alaska Air Group, Inc.'s net income (loss) and amounts per share during 2008 and 2007 excluding the benefit of the change in Mileage Plan expiration terms, restructuring and MD-80 and CRJ-700 fleet transition costs, and to reflect fuel on an economic basis and reconciles those amounts to results as reported in accordance with GAAP (in millions except per share amounts):
 
* Diluted EPS, excluding special items was calculated using diluted weighted-average shares outstanding of 36.568 million and 36.657 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2008, respectively.
1
Correction of amounts presented for twelve months ended December 31, 2008
As disclosed previously, during the third quarter of 2008, we discovered an error in our calculation of stock-based compensation expense for certain awards granted after January 1, 2006. The error resulted in a $2.3 million understatement of wages and benefits in the first quarter of 2008 and a $1.1 million understatement of expense in the first quarter of 2007. We have concluded that these items are not material to those periods, and in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, we will make appropriate adjustments to our previously filed financial statements when they are presented in future Exchange Act reports.
Our results for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 have been adjusted for this item. We have also adjusted our Financial and Statistical data schedules, unit cost reconciliations, and reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted amounts for both Alaska and Horizon.

Pursuant to Regulation G, we are providing disclosure of the reconciliation of reported non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable financial measures reported on a GAAP basis. We believe that consideration of this measure of unit costs excluding fuel, purchased capacity costs, and other noted items may be important to investors for the following reasons:
:
Note A
 -  Cost per available seat mile (ASM) excluding fuel, purchased capacity costs, and other special items is one of the most important measures used by managements of both Alaska and Horizon and the Air Group Board of Directors in assessing quarterly and annual cost performance and, for Alaska Airlines, the operating results of the "mainline" operation, which includes the operation of aircraft branded in Alaska Airlines livery.
 -  Cost per ASM excluding fuel, purchased capacity costs, and other items as specified in our governing documents is an important metric used in the employee incentive plan that covers company management and executives.
 -  By eliminating fuel expense from our unit cost metrics, we believe that we have better visibility into the results of our non-fuel cost-reduction initiatives. Our industry is highly competitive, and characterized by high fixed costs, so even a small reduction in non-fuel operating costs can result in a significant improvement in operating results. In addition, we believe that all domestic carriers are similarly impacted by changes in jet fuel costs over the long run, so it is important for management (and thus investors) to understand the impact of (and trends in) company specific cost drivers such as labor rates and productivity, airport costs, and maintenance costs, which are more controllable by management.
 -  Cost per ASM excluding fuel and purchased capacity costs is a measure commonly used by industry analysts and we believe it is the basis by which they compare our airlines to others in the industry. The measure is also the subject of frequent questions from current or prospective investors.
 -  By eliminating the impact of certain noted or "special" items, management is provided the ability to measure and monitor performance both with and without these special items. Management believes that the disclosure of the impact of certain items such as the fleet transition costs and restructuring charges is important to the reader as it provides information on significant items that are not indicative of future performance. Industry analysts and investors consistently measure the Company's performance without these items for better comparability between periods and between other airlines.
 -  Although we disclose our "mainline" unit revenues for Alaska to eliminate those revenues associated with purchased capacity flying performed by others on our behalf, we do not (nor are we able to) present unit revenues excluding the impact that rising fuel costs have had on ticket prices. This is a limitation of our non-GAAP measure that excludes fuel from unit costs, as economic fuel represents approximately 35% of our total annual mainline operating expenses (excluding special items), and fluctuations in our fuel prices are often the driver of changes in unit revenues in the mid-to long term. We would caution the readers of these financial statements not to place undue reliance on unit costs excluding fuel as a measure or predictor of future profitability.
The following tables reconcile our non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for both Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Horizon Air Industries, Inc.:
Alaska Airlines, Inc.
(in millions, except for per ASM unit information)
 
 
Horizon Air Industries, Inc.
(in millions, except for per ASM unit information)
 
Line of Business Information:
Horizon brand flying includes those routes in the Horizon system not covered by the Alaska and Frontier Capacity Purchase Agreements (CPA). Horizon bears the revenue risk in those markets and, as a result, traffic, yield and load factor impact revenue recorded by Horizon. In CPA arrangements, Horizon is (or was, as was the case with the Frontier CPA which ended in November 2007) insulated from market revenue factors and is guaranteed contractual revenue amounts based on operational capacity. As a result, yield and load factor information is not presented.

* Includes gains or losses recognized during the current period for contracts settling in future periods and the reversal of cumulative gains or losses recognized in prior periods for contracts that settled in the current period.
** These amounts reflect losses on the early termination of hedge contracts originally scheduled to settle in 2009 and 2010. The net amount represents the difference between the original premiums paid for the terminated contracts and the cash received upon termination.

Investor Update  January 29, 2009
References in this update to "Air Group," "Company," "we," "us," and "our" refer to Alaska Air Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise specified.
This update includes forecasted operational and financial information for our subsidiaries Alaska Airlines, Inc. (Alaska) and Horizon Air Industries, Inc. (Horizon). Our disclosure of operating cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel and other items, provides us (and may provide investors) with the ability to measure and monitor our performance without these items. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is total operating expense per available seat mile. However, due to the large fluctuations in fuel prices, we are unable to predict total operating expense for any future period with any degree of certainty. In addition, we believe the disclosure of fuel expense on an economic basis is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. Please see the cautionary statement under "Forward-Looking Information."
Please see our press release dated today for actual financial and statistical information for the fourth quarter and full year 2008.
Forward-Looking Information
This update contains forward-looking statements subject to the safe harbor protection provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements relate to future events and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual outcomes to be materially different from those indicated by any forward-looking statements. For a comprehensive discussion of potential risk factors, see Item 1A of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007. Some of these risks include increased general economic conditions, competition, significant fuel costs, labor costs and relations, our significant indebtedness, inability to meet cost reduction goals, terrorist attacks, seasonal fluctuations in our financial results, an aircraft accident, laws and regulations, and government fees and taxes. All of the forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the risk factors discussed therein. These risk factors may not be exhaustive. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risk factors emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict such new risk factors, nor can it assess the impact, if any, of such new risk factors on our business or events described in any forward-looking statements. We expressly disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date of this report to conform them to actual results. Over time, our actual results, performance or achievements will likely differ from the anticipated results, performance or achievements that are expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements, and such differences might be significant and materially adverse.
 
Forecast Information
 
*For Alaska, our forecast of mainline cost per ASM excluding fuel and restructuring charges is based on forward-looking estimates, which will likely differ from actual results.
**Because of the volatility of fuel prices, actual amounts may differ significantly. The first-quarter forecast assumes an average $45-per-barrel price of oil and a refinery margin of 50 cents per gallon. Because of the unpredictable nature of oil prices, our full-year 2009 forecast is not meaningful at this time.
Advance Booked Load Factors
 
* The Easter holiday is in April this year, but was in March in 2008. This shift is negatively impacting March advance bookings. April advance booked load factor is tracking slightly ahead of April 2008 at this time.
 
Alaska has Capacity Purchase Agreements (CPA) with Horizon for certain routes and with a third party for service between Anchorage and Dutch Harbor, AK.
Forecast Information (Horizon CPA)
The forecast reflects only the Horizon CPA flying as that flying represents approximately 95% of the total purchased capacity. The ASMs shown below are also included in Horizon's system forecast presented on the following page.
 
* Costs associated with the Horizon CPA agreement are eliminated in consolidation
Advance Booked Load Factors
 
* The Easter holiday is in April this year, but was in March in 2008. This shift is negatively impacting March advance bookings. April advance booked load factor is tracking even with April 2008 at this time.
 
Forecast Information
 
*For Horizon, our forecast of cost per ASM excluding fuel is based on forward-looking estimates, which will likely differ significantly from actual results.
**Because of the volatility of fuel prices, actual amounts may differ significantly. The first-quarter forecast assumes an average $45-per-barrel price of oil and a refinery margin of 50 cents per gallon. Because of the unpredictable nature of oil prices, our full-year 2009 forecast is not meaningful at this time.
Fleet Transition Charges Expected in 2009
There may be further fleet transition charges associated with the transition out of the CRJ-700 aircraft. Because we do not currently know how many aircraft will leave the fleet in 2009, nor do we know the types of transactions that will occur, we cannot estimate with any certainty the amount or timing of any related charges.
Advance Booked Load Factors  Brand Flying Only
 
* The Easter holiday is in April this year, but was in March in 2008. This shift is negatively impacting March advance bookings. April advance booked load factor is tracking slightly ahead of April 2008 at this time.
 
Future Fuel Hedge Positions
*All of our 2008, 2010 and 2011 positions and the majority of our 2009 positions are call options, which are designed to effectively cap our cost of the crude oil component of our jet fuel purchases. With call options, we benefit from a decline in crude oil prices, as there is no downward exposure other than the premiums we pay to enter into the contracts.
Cash and Share Count
Capital Expenditures
Total actual and expected capital for expenditures 2008 and 2009, respectively, are as follows (in millions):
 
Firm Aircraft Commitments
In addition to the firm orders noted above, Alaska has options to acquire 45 additional B737-800s and Horizon has options to acquire 10 Q400s. Alaska has notified Boeing of its intent to exercise the option on one 737-800 for delivery in 2010. Once that option has been converted to a firm commitment, we will have seven firm commitments for B737-800 aircraft in 2010. The table below includes the option aircraft in the "2010 Changes" column.
 
Projected Fleet Count
 
1
Alaska originally planned to have 115 aircraft at December 31, 2008, but five B737-800 deliveries were deferred until 2009 as a result of the Boeing mechanics strike late in 2008.
2
The expected fleet counts at December 31, 2009 and 2010 for Alaska are subject to change. We are seeking to sell up to four B737-700 aircraft in 2009 as a result of our capacity reductions, which is reflected in the 2009 changes above.
3
F=Freighter; C=Combination freighter/passenger
4
All remaining Q200 aircraft have been taken out of scheduled service, but are expected to operate as spare aircraft through the end of January 2009.
5
The planned CRJ and Q400 fleets at December 31, 2009 and 2010 are subject to change and are dependent on our ability to remarket the CRJ aircraft.

On January 29, 2009 the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Committee") of Alaska Air Group, Inc. (the "Company") took a number of actions.
The Committee approved 2009 base salaries for executive-level employees. For the fourth year in a row, the Committee agreed to Mr. Ayer's request that he receive no increase to his base salary. Mr. Ayer's 2009 base salary will remain at $360,000 and the Committee commends his leadership in this regard.
The Committee confirmed payouts for the 2008 Performance-Based Pay plan. The payouts are based on the Company's 2008 performance relative to safety, employee engagement, and financial performance goals established by the Committee for the year. The payouts were as follows: Mr. Ayer, $186,840.03; Mr. Tilden, $108,421.07; Mr. Saretsky, $114,439.50; Mr. Johnson, $108,001.89; and Mr. Pinneo, $78,032.21.
The Committee approved the 2009 performance criteria pursuant to which awards may be paid to executive officers and other employees participating in the Performance-Based Pay plan as follows. Subject to the terms of the plan, participants will be eligible to receive payments if the Company achieves certain operational and financial performance criteria over the full year. The primary measures for 2009 and the relative weightings given to each measure are the Company's pre-tax profit margin (70%), cost per available seat mile excluding fuel (10%), safety as measured by lost time injuries per full time equivalent employee (10%), and employee engagement as measured by total number of months of successful payout under the Company's broad-based Operational Performance Rewards program (10%). Operational Performance Rewards program payouts are based upon a reported Department of Transportation performance level of 80% or higher, or a rating among the top three for the reported month. For all employees, Performance-Based Pay payouts will be subject to an additional performance modifier that could increase, decrease, or maintain payout levels. The modifier is based upon the number of months of successful payout under the Company's broad-based Operational Performance Rewards program (plus or minus 10 percentage points).
The Committee approved grants of stock options and restricted stock units under the Company's 2008 Performance Incentive Plan to the Company's Named Executive Officers as described in the table below. The table presents the number of shares subject to each of these awards:
 
 
Mr. Ayer's 2009 grant includes a special share allocation reflecting the Board's confidence in his leadership and his on-going commitment to drive Air Group's future performance. Each stock option was granted with an exercise price equal to $27.56, the closing price of a share of Company common stock on January 29, 2009. With the exception of a portion of the non-qualified options granted to Mr. Ayer, options are scheduled to vest in annual installments over a four-year period. The restricted stock units are scheduled to vest on the third anniversary of the grant date and are payable upon vesting in shares of Company common stock on a one-for-one basis.
The stock options and restricted stock unit awards are evidenced by the applicable form of award agreement previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In connection with Mr. Ayer's award, the Committee approved a new form of agreement for use as well. These forms are attached hereto as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2 and incorporated herein by reference.

Option
 
Vesting
1,2
The Option shall become vested as to 100% of the total number of shares of Common Stock subject to the Option on the third anniversary of the Award Date.
The Option is granted under the Alaska Air Group, Inc. 2008 Performance Incentive Plan (the "") and subject to the Terms and Conditions of Nonqualified Stock Option (the "") attached to this Option Agreement (incorporated herein by this reference) and to the Plan. The Option has been granted to the Grantee in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other form of compensation otherwise payable or to be paid to the Grantee. Capitalized terms are defined in the Plan if not defined herein. The parties agree to the terms of the Option set forth herein. The Grantee acknowledges receipt of a copy of the Terms, the Plan and the Prospectus for the Plan.
Plan
Terms
 
 
 
 
 
The Option shall vest and become exercisable in percentage installments of the aggregate number of shares subject to the Option as set forth on the cover page of this Option Agreement. The Option may be exercised only to the extent the Option is vested and exercisable.
 
 
 
 
Notwithstanding any other provision herein or in the Plan, the Option, to the extent not then vested, shall become fully vested if (i) the Grantee's employment with the Corporation and its Subsidiaries is terminated by the Corporation or a Subsidiary without Cause or by the Grantee for Good Reason, and (ii) such termination occurs at any time within the period commencing six (6) months before a Change of Control and ending twenty-four (24) months after such Change of Control. (For these purposes, the terms "Cause," "Change of Control" and "Good Reason" shall have the meanings ascribed to them in Exhibit A attached hereto.) In the event that, upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, the Grantee is entitled to accelerated vesting of the Option pursuant to this paragraph in connection with a termination of the Grantee's employment prior to such Change of Control, the Option, to the extent it had not vested and was cancelled or otherwise terminated upon or prior to the date of such Change of Control solely as a result of such termination of employment, shall be reinstated and shall automatically become fully vested, and the Grantee shall be given a reasonable opportunity to exercise such accelerated portion of the Option before it terminates.
 
The vesting schedule requires continued employment or service through each applicable vesting date as a condition to the vesting of the applicable installment of the Option and the rights and benefits under this Option Agreement. Employment or service for only a portion of the vesting period, even if a substantial portion, will not entitle the Grantee to any proportionate vesting or avoid or mitigate a termination of rights and benefits upon or following a termination of employment or services as provided in Section 4 below or under the Plan.
Nothing contained in this Option Agreement or the Plan constitutes an employment or service commitment by the Corporation, affects the Grantee's status as an employee at will who is subject to termination without cause, confers upon the Grantee any right to remain employed by or in service to the Corporation or any Subsidiary, interferes in any way with the right of the Corporation or any Subsidiary at any time to terminate such employment or services, or affects the right of the Corporation or any
Subsidiary to increase or decrease the Grantee's other compensation or benefits. Nothing in this paragraph, however, is intended to adversely affect any independent contractual right of the Grantee without his consent thereto.
 
The Option shall be exercisable by the delivery to the Secretary of the Corporation (or such other person as the Administrator may require pursuant to such administrative exercise procedures as the Administrator may implement from time to time) of:
 
 
 
 
The Administrator also may, but is not required to, authorize a non-cash payment alternative by notice and third party payment in such manner as may be authorized by the Administrator, or, subject to such procedures as the Administrator may adopt, authorize a "cashless exercise" with a third party who provides simultaneous financing for the purposes of (or who otherwise facilitates) the exercise of the Option.
 
The Option is subject to termination in connection with certain corporate events as provided in Section 7.2 of the Plan.
4.1
Possible Termination of Option upon Certain Corporate Events.
Subject to earlier termination on the Expiration Date of the Option or pursuant to Section 4.1 above, if the Grantee ceases to be employed by or ceases to provide services to the Corporation, the following rules shall apply (the last day that the Grantee is employed by or provides services to the Corporation is referred to as the Grantee's ""):
4.2
Termination of Option upon a Termination of Grantee's Employment or Services.
Severance Date
 
 
For purposes of the Option, "" means a "permanent and total disability" (within the meaning of Section 22(e)(3) of the Code or as otherwise determined by the Administrator).
Total Disability
In all events the Option is subject to earlier termination on the Expiration Date of the Option or as contemplated by Section 4.1. The Administrator shall be the sole judge of whether the Grantee continues to render employment or services for purposes of this Option Agreement.
 
The Option and any other rights of the Grantee under this Option Agreement or the Plan are nontransferable and exercisable only by the Grantee, except as set forth in Section 5.7 of the Plan.
 
Any notice to be given under the terms of this Option Agreement shall be in writing and addressed to the Corporation at its principal office to the attention of the Secretary, and to the Grantee at the address last reflected on the Corporation's payroll records, or at such other address as either party may hereafter designate in writing to the other. Any such notice shall be delivered in person or shall be enclosed in a properly sealed envelope addressed as aforesaid, registered or certified, and deposited (postage and registry or certification fee prepaid) in a post office or branch post office regularly maintained by the United States Government. Any such notice shall be given only when received, but if the Grantee is no longer employed by the Corporation, shall be deemed to have been duly given five business days after the date mailed in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.
 
The Option and all rights of the Grantee under this Option Agreement are subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan, incorporated herein by this reference. The Grantee agrees to be bound by the terms of the Plan and this Option Agreement. The Grantee acknowledges having read and understanding the Plan, the Prospectus for the Plan, and this Option Agreement. Unless otherwise expressly provided in other sections of this Option Agreement, provisions of the Plan that confer discretionary authority on the Board or the Administrator do not and shall not be deemed to create any rights in the Grantee unless such rights are expressly set forth herein or are otherwise in the sole discretion of the Board or the Administrator so conferred by appropriate action of the Board or the Administrator under the Plan the date hereof.
after
 
This Option Agreement and the Plan together constitute the entire agreement and supersede all prior understandings and agreements, written or oral, of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof. The Plan and this Option Agreement may be amended pursuant to Section 8.6 of the Plan. Such amendment must be in writing and signed by the Corporation. The Corporation may, however, unilaterally waive any provision hereof in writing to the extent such waiver does not adversely affect the interests of the Grantee hereunder, but no such waiver shall operate as or be construed to be a subsequent waiver of the same provision or a waiver of any other provision hereof.
This Option Agreement shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to conflict of law principles thereunder.
 
Subject to the Corporation's right to terminate the Option pursuant to Section 7.2 of the Plan, this Option Agreement shall be assumed by, be binding upon and inure to the benefit of any successor or successors to the Corporation.
 
This Option Agreement may be executed simultaneously in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.
 
The section headings of this Option Agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall not be deemed to alter or affect any provision hereof.
For purposes of the Option, the following terms shall have the meanings set forth is this Exhibit A.
"" means the occurrence of any of the following:
Cause
 
 
 
 
provided, however, that no act or omission by the Grantee shall be deemed to be "willful" if the Grantee reasonably believed in good faith that such acts or omissions were in the best interests of the Corporation.
"" means the occurrence of any of the following:
Change of Control
 
(A) any consolidation or merger of the Corporation in which the Corporation is not the continuing or surviving corporation or pursuant to which shares of common stock of the Corporation would be converted into cash, securities or other property, other than a merger of the Corporation in which the holders of common stock of the Corporation immediately prior to the merger have the same proportionate ownership of common stock of the surviving corporation immediately after the merger; or
(B) any sale, lease, exchange or other transfer (in one transaction or a series of related transactions) of all, or substantially all, the assets of the Corporation.
 
 
 
Unless the Board shall determine otherwise, a Change of Control shall not be deemed to have occurred by reason of any corporate reorganization, merger, consolidation, transfer of assets, liquidating distribution or other transaction entered into solely by and between the Corporation and any affiliate thereof, provided such transaction has been approved by at least two-thirds (2/3) of the Incumbent Directors (as defined above) then in office and voting.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall a transaction or other event that occurred prior to the date of grant of the Option constitute a Change of Control, and no Change of Control after the first Change of Control to occur after the grant date shall be considered for purposes of the Option.
"" means, without the Grantee's express written consent, the occurrence of any one or more of the following:
Good Reason
 
 
 
 
provided, however, that any such condition shall not constitute "Good Reason" unless both (x) the Grantee provides written notice to the Corporation of the condition claimed to constitute Good Reason within ninety (90) days of the initial existence of such condition, and (y) the Corporation fails to remedy such condition within thirty (30) days of receiving such written notice thereof; and provided, further, that in all events the termination of the Grantee's employment with the Corporation shall not be treated as a termination for "Good Reason" unless such termination occurs not more than two (2) years following the initial existence of the condition claimed to constitute "Good Reason."

In the event that, upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, the Participant is entitled to accelerated vesting of the Award pursuant to this Section 2 in connection with a termination of the Participant's employment prior to such Change of Control, the Award, to the extent it had not vested and was cancelled or otherwise terminated upon or prior to the date of such Change of Control solely as a result of such termination of employment, shall be reinstated and shall automatically become fully vested and shall be paid in accordance with Section 6 upon the Change of Control. For purposes of this Agreement, "" shall mean a "separation from service" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(h)(1), without regard to the optional alternative definitions available thereunder (i.e. generally a termination of the Participant's employment with the Corporation or a Subsidiary).
2.
Vesting; Possible Acceleration
Separation from Service
. The vesting schedule requires continued employment or service through each applicable vesting date as a condition to the vesting of the applicable installment of the Award and the rights and benefits under this Agreement. Employment or service for only a portion of the vesting period, even if a substantial portion, will not entitle the Participant to any proportionate vesting or avoid or mitigate a termination of rights and benefits upon or following a termination of employment or services as provided in Section 7 below or under the Plan.
3.
Continuance of Employment
Nothing contained in this Agreement or the Plan constitutes an employment or service commitment by the Corporation, affects the Participant's status as an employee at will who is subject to termination without cause, confers upon the Participant any right to remain employed by or in service to the Corporation or any Subsidiary, interferes in any way with the right of the Corporation or any Subsidiary at any time to terminate such employment or services, or affects the right of the Corporation or any Subsidiary to increase or decrease the Participant's other compensation or benefits. Nothing in this paragraph, however, is intended to adversely affect any independent contractual right of the Participant without his consent thereto.
. The Participant shall have no rights as a stockholder of the Corporation, no dividend rights and no voting rights, with respect to the Stock Units and any shares of Common Stock underlying or issuable in respect of such Stock Units until such shares of Common Stock are actually issued to and held of record by the Participant. No adjustments will be made for dividends or other rights of a holder for which the record date is prior to the date of issuance of the stock certificate.
4.
Limitations on Rights Associated with Units
. Neither the Award, nor any interest therein or amount or shares payable in respect thereof may be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise disposed of, alienated or encumbered, either voluntarily or involuntarily. The transfer restrictions in the preceding sentence shall not apply to (a) transfers to the Corporation, or (b) transfers by will or the laws of descent and distribution.
5.
Restrictions on Transfer
. On or as soon as administratively practical following each vesting of the applicable portion of the total Award pursuant to the terms hereof (and in all events within ninety (90) days after such vesting event), the Corporation shall deliver to the Participant a number of shares of Common Stock (either by delivering one or more certificates for such shares or by entering such shares in book entry form, as determined by the Corporation in its discretion) equal to the number of Stock Units subject to this Award that vest on the applicable vesting date; provided, however, that in the event that the vesting and payment of the Stock Units is triggered by the Participant's Separation from Service and the Participant is a "specified employee" (within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(i)) on the date of such Separation from Service, the Participant shall not be entitled to any payment of the Stock Units until the earlier of (i) the date which is six (6) months after the Participant's Separation from Service with the Corporation for any reason other than death, or (ii) the date of the Participant's death, if and to the extent such delay in payment is required to comply with Section 409A of the Code. The Corporation's obligation to deliver shares of Common Stock or otherwise make payment with respect to vested Stock Units is subject to the condition precedent that the Participant or other person entitled under the Plan to receive any shares with respect to the vested Stock Units deliver to the Corporation any representations or other documents or assurances that the Administrator may deem necessary or desirable to assure compliance with all applicable legal and accounting requirements. The Participant shall have no further rights with respect to any Stock Units that are paid or that terminate pursuant to Section 7.
6.
Timing and Manner of Payment of Stock Units
. The Participant's Stock Units shall terminate to the extent such units have not become vested prior to the first date the Participant is no longer employed by the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries, regardless of the reason for the termination of the Participant's employment with the Corporation or a Subsidiary; provided, however, that if the Participant's employment terminates as a result of the Participant's death or Disability (as such term is defined below), the Participant's Stock Units, to the extent such units are not then vested, shall become fully vested as of the date of termination of the Participant's employment and shall be paid in accordance with Section 6 promptly following the Participant's Separation from Service. If any unvested Stock Units are terminated hereunder, such Stock Units shall automatically terminate and be cancelled as of the applicable termination date without payment of any consideration by the Corporation and without any other action by the Participant, or the Participant's beneficiary or personal representative, as the case may be.
7.
Effect of Termination of Employment
For purposes of this Agreement, "Disability" means a "disability" as such term is defined for purposes of Section 409A of the Code.
. Upon the occurrence of certain events relating to the Corporation's stock contemplated by Section 7.1 of the Plan (including, without limitation, an extraordinary cash dividend on such stock), the Administrator shall make adjustments in accordance with such section in the number of Stock Units then outstanding and the number and kind of securities that may be issued in respect of the Award. No such adjustment shall be made with respect to any ordinary cash dividend paid on the Common Stock. Notwithstanding any provision in the Plan, any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Corporation shall assume the Award, and any payment of the Stock Units shall be made at the times provided in this Agreement.
8.
Adjustments Upon Specified Events
. Subject to Section 8.1 of the Plan, upon any distribution of shares of Common Stock in respect of the Stock Units, the Corporation shall automatically reduce the number of shares to be delivered by (or otherwise reacquire) the appropriate number of whole shares, valued at their then Fair Market Value (determined in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Plan), to satisfy any withholding obligations of the Corporation or its Subsidiaries with respect to such distribution of shares at the minimum applicable withholding rates. In the event that the Corporation cannot legally satisfy such withholding obligations by such reduction of shares, or in the event of a cash payment or any other withholding event in respect of the Stock Units, the Corporation (or a Subsidiary) shall be entitled to require a cash payment by or on behalf of the Participant and/or to deduct from other compensation payable to the Participant any sums required by federal, state or local tax law to be withheld with respect to such distribution or payment.
9.
Tax Withholding
. Any notice to be given under the terms of this Agreement shall be in writing and addressed to the Corporation at its principal office to the attention of the Secretary, and to the Participant at the Participant's last address reflected on the Corporation's records, or at such other address as either party may hereafter designate in writing to the other. Any such notice shall be given only when received, but if the Participant is no longer an employee of the Corporation, shall be deemed to have been duly given by the Corporation when enclosed in a properly sealed envelope addressed as aforesaid, registered or certified, and deposited (postage and registry or certification fee prepaid) in a post office or branch post office regularly maintained by the United States Government.
10. ces
Noti
. The Award and all rights of the Participant under this Agreement are subject to the terms and conditions of the provisions of the Plan, incorporated herein by reference. The Participant agrees to be bound by the terms of the Plan and this Agreement. The Participant acknowledges having read and understanding the Plan, the Prospectus for the Plan, and this Agreement. Unless otherwise expressly provided in other sections of this Agreement, provisions of the Plan that confer discretionary authority on the Board or the Administrator do not (and shall not be deemed to) create any rights in the Participant unless such rights are expressly set forth herein or are otherwise in the sole discretion of the Board or the Administrator so conferred by appropriate action of the Board or the Administrator under the Plan the date hereof.
11.
Plan
after
. This Agreement and the Plan together constitute the entire agreement and supersede all prior understandings and agreements, written or oral, of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof. The Plan and this Agreement may be amended pursuant to Section 8.6 of the Plan. Such amendment must be in writing and signed by the Corporation. The Corporation may, however, unilaterally waive any provision hereof in writing to the extent such waiver does not adversely affect the interests of the Participant hereunder, but no such waiver shall operate as or be construed to be a subsequent waiver of the same provision or a waiver of any other provision hereof.
12.
Entire Agreement
. Participation in the Plan confers no rights or interests other than as herein provided. This Agreement creates only a contractual obligation on the part of the Corporation as to amounts payable and shall not be construed as creating a trust. Neither the Plan nor any underlying program, in and of itself, has any assets. The Participant shall have only the rights of a general unsecured creditor of the Corporation with respect to amounts credited and benefits payable, if any, with respect to the Stock Units, and rights no greater than the right to receive the Common Stock as a general unsecured creditor with respect to Stock Units, as and when payable hereunder.
13.
Limitation on Participant's Rights
. This Agreement may be executed simultaneously in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.
14.
Counterparts
. The section headings of this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall not be deemed to alter or affect any provision hereof.
15.
Section Headings
. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to conflict of law principles thereunder.
16.
Governing Law
. It is intended that the terms of the Award will not result in the imposition of any tax liability pursuant to Section 409A of the Code. This Agreement shall be construed and interpreted consistent with that intent.

"" means the occurrence of any of the following:
Change of Control
 
(A) any consolidation or merger of the Corporation in which the Corporation is not the continuing or surviving corporation or pursuant to which shares of common stock of the Corporation would be converted into cash, securities or other property, other than a merger of the Corporation in which the holders of common stock of the Corporation immediately prior to the merger have the same proportionate ownership of common stock of the surviving corporation immediately after the merger; or
(B) any sale, lease, exchange or other transfer (in one transaction or a series of related transactions) of all, or substantially all, the assets of the Corporation;
 
 
provided, however, that a transaction shall not constitute a Change of Control unless it is a "change in the ownership or effective control" of the Corporation, or a change "in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets" of the Corporation within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code.
Unless the Board shall determine otherwise, a Change of Control shall not be deemed to have occurred by reason of any corporate reorganization, merger, consolidation, transfer of assets, liquidating distribution or other transaction entered into solely by and between the Corporation and any affiliate thereof, provided such transaction has been approved by at least two-thirds (2/3) of the Incumbent Directors (as defined above) then in office and voting.

Exhibit 99.1
Investor Update  February 25, 2009
References in this update to "Air Group," "Company," "we," "us," and "our" refer to Alaska Air Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise specified.
This update includes forecasted operational and financial information for our subsidiaries Alaska Airlines, Inc. (Alaska) and Horizon Air Industries, Inc. (Horizon). Our disclosure of operating cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel and other items, provides us (and may provide investors) with the ability to measure and monitor our performance without these items. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is total operating expense per available seat mile. However, due to the large fluctuations in fuel prices, we are unable to predict total operating expense for any future period with any degree of certainty. In addition, we believe the disclosure of fuel expense on an economic basis is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. Please see the cautionary statement under "Forward-Looking Information."
We are providing unaudited information about fuel price movements and the impact of our hedging program on our financial results. Management believes it is useful to compare results between periods on an "economic basis." is defined as the raw or "into-plane" fuel cost less any cash we receive from hedge counterparties for hedges that settle during the period, offset by the recognition of premiums originally paid for those hedges that settle during the period. Economic fuel expense more closely approximates the net cash outflow associated with purchasing fuel for our operation.

Forward-Looking Information
This update contains forward-looking statements subject to the safe harbor protection provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements relate to future events and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual outcomes to be materially different from those indicated by any forward-looking statements. For a comprehensive discussion of potential risk factors, see Item 1A of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008. Some of these risks include current economic conditions, increases in operating costs including fuel, competition, labor costs and relations, our significant indebtedness, inability to meet cost reduction goals, terrorist attacks, seasonal fluctuations in our financial results, an aircraft accident, laws and regulations, and government fees and taxes. All of the forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the risk factors discussed therein. These risk factors may not be exhaustive. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risk factors emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict such new risk factors, nor can it assess the impact, if any, of such new risk factors on our business or events described in any forward-looking statements. We expressly disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date of this report to conform them to actual results. Over time, our actual results, performance or achievements will likely differ from the anticipated results, performance or achievements that are expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements, and such differences might be significant and materially adverse.

   Forecast Information
*For Alaska, our forecasts of mainline cost per ASM excluding fuel, restructuring charges and fleet transition costs is based on forward-looking estimates, which will likely differ from actual results.
**Because of the volatility of fuel prices, actual amounts may differ significantly from our estimates. The first-quarter forecast assumes an average $45-per-barrel price of oil, a refinery margin of 46 cents per gallon, and a net hedge cost of 30 cents per gallon. Because of the unpredictable nature of oil prices, our full-year 2009 forecast is not meaningful at this time.

  Future Fuel Hedge Positions*
 
*All of our 2010 and 2011 positions and the majority of our 2009 positions are call options which are designed to effectively cap our cost of the crude oil component of our jet fuel purchases. With call options, we benefit from a decline in crude oil prices, as there is no cash outlay other than the premiums we pay to enter into the contracts.
Cash and Share Count
 
On February 19, 2009, Alaska completed sale-leaseback financing transactions for three B737-800 resulting in gross proceeds of $115.5 million, bringing the total cash and marketable securities balance to $1.05 billion as of February 20, 2009.
Capital Expenditures
Total expected capital expenditures for 2009 are as follows (in millions):
 
Firm Aircraft Commitments
 
In addition to the firm orders noted above, Alaska has options to acquire 44 additional B737-800s and Horizon has options to acquire 10 Q400s.
 
Projected Fleet Count

The expected fleet counts at December 31, 2009 and 2010 for Alaska are subject to change as we continue to refine the capacity reduction and aircraft utilization plan, and attempt to market four of our B737-700 aircraft.

The planned CRJ and Q400 fleets at December 31, 2009 and 2010 are subject to change as we finalize the fleet transition plan and is dependent on our ability to remarket the CRJ aircraft.

Labor Updates
Alaska recently reached an agreement in concept with the Air Line Pilots Association on a new four-year contract with our pilots.  Details of the agreement will be disclosed when the contract language is published in a tentative agreement.
Alaskas flight attendants ratified a new contract that extended their current contract by two years through April 2012.  As part of the new contract, flight attendants will receive a 1.5% pay increase on May 1, 2010 and May 1, 2011.  Flight attendants will now participate in the same performance-based incentive plan as Alaskas management and dispatch employees.

Because of the unpredictable nature of oil prices, our full-year 2009 forecast is not meaningful at this time.
Based on our advance booked load factor for March and current ticket yields, we expect March 2009 unit revenues to decline compared to March 2008.
Q200 Fleet Transition Charges Expected in First Quarter
Horizon expects to record an estimated charge of $6 million in the first quarter related to the final six Q200 aircraft removed from operations during the period.  The actual amount could differ from this estimate when the calculation is finalized.  In the first quarter of 2008, Horizon recorded Q200 fleet transition charges of $6.7 million. Consistent with past practice, we do not expect to exclude Q200 fleet transition charges from our adjusted results.

Future Fuel Hedge Positions*
*All of our 2010 and 2011 positions and the majority of our 2009 positions are call options which are designed to effectively cap our cost of the crude oil component of our jet fuel purchases.  With call options, we benefit from a decline in crude oil prices, as there is no cash outlay other than the premiums we pay to enter into the contracts.
Cash and Share Count
Capital Expenditures
Total expected capital expenditures for 2009 are as follows (in millions):
Firm Aircraft Commitments
In addition to the firm orders noted above, Alaska has options to acquire 44 additional B737-800s and Horizon has options to acquire 10 Q400s.

The expected fleet counts at December 31, 2009 and 2010 for Alaska are subject to change as we continue to refine the capacity reduction and aircraft utilization plan, and attempt to market four of our B737-700 aircraft.

The planned CRJ and Q400 fleets at December 31, 2009 and 2010 are subject to change as we finalize the fleet transition plan and is dependent on our ability to remarket the CRJ aircraft.

Investor Update  April 8,
2009
References in this update to Air Group, Company, we, us, and our refer to Alaska Air Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise specified.
This update includes forecasted operational and financial information for our subsidiaries Alaska Airlines, Inc. (Alaska) and Horizon Air Industries, Inc. (Horizon).  Our disclosure of operating cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel and other items, provides us (and may provide investors) with the ability to measure and monitor our performance without these items.  The most directly comparable GAAP measure is total operating expense per available seat mile.  However, due to the large fluctuations in fuel prices, we are unable to predict total operating expense for any future period with any degree of certainty. In addition, we believe the disclosure of fuel expense on an economic basis is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. Please see the cautionary statement under Forward-Looking Information.
We are providing unaudited information about fuel price movements and the impact of our hedging program on our financial results.  Management believes it is useful to compare results between periods on an economic basis.
Economic fuel expense
is defined as the raw or into-plane fuel cost less any cash we receive from hedge counterparties for hedges that settle during the period, offset by the recognition of premiums originally paid for those hedges that settle during the period.  Economic fuel expense more closely approximates the net cash outflow associated with purchasing fuel for our operation.
Forward-Looking Information
 
This update contains forward-looking statements subject to the safe harbor protection provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements relate to future events and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual outcomes to be materially different from those indicated by any forward-looking statements.  For a comprehensive discussion of potential risk factors, see Item 1A of the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008.   Some of these risks include current economic conditions, increases in operating costs including fuel, competition, labor costs and relations, our significant indebtedness, inability to meet cost reduction goals, terrorist attacks, seasonal fluctuations in our financial results, an aircraft accident, laws and regulations, and government fees and taxes.  All of the forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the risk factors discussed therein. These risk factors may not be exhaustive. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risk factors emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict such new risk factors, nor can it assess the impact, if any, of such new risk factors on our business or events described in any forward-looking statements. We expressly disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date of this report to conform them to actual results. Over time, our actual results, performance or achievements will likely differ from the anticipated results, performance or achievements that are expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements, and such differences might be significant and materially adverse.

*RPMs as a percentage of ASMs
Revenue and fuel cost information is not yet available for March.  However, information for the first two months of the first quarter, as previously disclosed, is as follows:

Forecast Information
* Actual results
** For Alaska, our forecasts of mainline cost per ASM excluding fuel, restructuring charges and fleet transition costs is based on forward-looking estimates, which may differ from actual results.
*** Because of the volatility of fuel prices, actual amounts may differ significantly from our estimates. Because of the unpredictable nature of oil prices, our full-year 2009 forecast is not meaningful at this time.
Given our load factor for March and current ticket-yield information, we expect March unit revenues will be lower than those in March 2008.
Impact of Mt. Redoubt Eruptions
The recent eruptions of Mt. Redoubt in Alaska have significantly impacted our operations in the state of Alaska.  
Since the volcanic eruptions began Sunday, March 22, Alaska Airlines has canceled more than 300 flights affecting more than 20,000 passengers.  Most of these passengers were re-accommodated on other flights.  Full refunds are available to passengers that are not re-accommodated on another flight.  The eruptions have also resulted in disruptions in our cargo operations.
Labor Updates
As previously disclosed, Alaska recently reached an agreement in concept with the Air Line Pilots Association on a new four-year contract with our pilots.  Details of the agreement will be disclosed at a later date.
Alaskas flight attendants ratified a new contract that extended the current contract by two years through April 2012.  As part of the new contract, flight attendants will receive a 1.5% pay increase on May 1, 2010 and May 1, 2011.  Flight attendants will now participate in the same performance-based incentive plan as Alaskas non-union and dispatch employees.

Q200 Fleet Transition Charges Expected in First Quarter
As previously disclosed, Horizon expects to record a charge of approximately $4 million to $6.5 million in the first quarter related to the final six Q200 aircraft removed from operations during the period.  The actual amount could differ from this estimate when the calculation is finalized.  In the first quarter of 2008, Horizon recorded Q200 fleet transition charges of $5.8 million.
Consistent with past practice, Q200 fleet transition charges are not considered special items and are thus not excluded from our adjusted results.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
 
 
 
First Quarter Financial Highlights:
 
 
 
 
 SEATTLE  Alaska Air Group, Inc. (NYSE: ALK) today reported a first quarter 2009 net loss of $19.2 million compared to a net loss of $37.3 million in the first quarter of 2008. Excluding mark-to-market fuel hedge gains of $10 million ($6.2 million after tax, or $0.17 per share), the company reported a net loss of $25.4 million, or $0.70 per share, compared to a net loss of $37.7 million, or $1.02 per share, in first quarter 2008.
   
 
 The following table summarizes the companys net loss and amounts per share during the first quarter of 2009 and 2008 excluding adjustments to reflect the timing of gain or loss recognition resulting from mark-to-market fuel-hedge accounting as reported in accordance with GAAP (in millions except per-share amounts):
   
 
While our first quarter financial results improved over last year
 
  
 due to a significant decline in fuel cost
, were disappointed to report a loss for the quarter
. To minimize the impact of the steep decline in air travel demand, we have reduced our schedules, reallocated capacity and taken fare actions
, said
Bill Ayer, Alaska Air Group's chairman and chief executive officer. 
We are responding to the continued economic uncertainty by maintaining a healthy level of liquidity, retiming some capital expenditures, controlling costs, reducing capacity and actively pursuing revenue opportunities
.
 Alaska Airlines' mainline passenger traffic in the first quarter declined 7.7 percent on a 9.3 percent capacity decrease compared to the first quarter of 2008. Load factor increased 1.3 percentage points to 75.7 percent. Alaskas mainline passenger revenue per available seat mile (ASM) decreased 2.0 percent and its operating cost per ASM, excluding fuel and the mark-to-market fuel hedge gains, increased 11.3 percent.
   
Alaska
s total pretax loss for the quarter was $18.3 million, compared to a pretax loss of $39.8 million in the first quarter of 2008. Excluding mark-to-market fuel hedge gains,
Alaska
s pretax loss was $26.6 million for the quarter compared to a pretax loss of $39.6 million in the same period of 2008.
 Horizon Airs passenger traffic in the first quarter declined 20.4 percent on a 16.5 percent capacity decrease compared to the first quarter of 2008. Load factor declined by 3.3 percentage points to 66.6 percent. Horizons passenger revenue per ASM decreased 0.7 percent and its operating cost per ASM, excluding fuel and mark-to-market fuel hedge gains, increased 5.8 percent. Horizons total pretax loss for the 
   
quarter was $10.5 million, compared to a pretax loss of $17.6 million in the first quarter of 2008. Excluding mark-to-market fuel hedge gains, Horizons pretax loss was $12.2 million for the quarter compared to a pretax loss of $18.5 million in the first quarter of 2008.

A summary of financial and statistical data for Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air, as well as a reconciliation of the reported non-GAAP financial measures, can be found in the accompanying tables. A glossary of financial terms can be found at the end of this release.
 
First checked bag service charge and guarantee
 Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air also announced they will join nearly all major domestic carriers in charging for a first checked bag. The $15 service charge  effective July 7 for tickets purchased beginning May 1  includes a guarantee to compensate passengers if their luggage is not  at baggage claim 25 minutes after their flight parks at the gate.
   
 Were adapting to a marketplace in which customers increasingly want the lowest fare possible, with the option to pay extra to use other services, Ayer said. We want to continue matching the lowest fare in the market without being at a revenue disadvantage to our competitors. But were also going to provide customers more value for what were charging through the bag service guarantee, which no other airline offers.
   
 Customers whose luggage is not at baggage claim within 25 minutes after their flight parks at the gate will receive 2,500 Alaska Airlines Mileage Plan miles or an e-certificate worth $25 off a future flight.
   
 First class, MVP and MVP Gold Mileage Plan members, unaccompanied minors, military personnel on active duty and passengers traveling to or from Mexico City and Guadalajara, Mexico, will not be charged for a first checked bag. Customers traveling solely within the state of Alaska also will continue to be allowed three free checked bags.
   
 In conjunction with the change, the service charge for a third bag will drop from $100 to $50, so passengers who check three bags will pay a total of $90 instead of $125. The second checked bag charge will remain at $25. Passengers checking two bags will pay a total of $40. The fees for overweight and oversized bags, currently $50 or $75 depending on weight and size, also will not change.

Forecast
Information
* For Alaska, our forecasts of mainline cost per ASM excluding fuel is based on forward-looking estimates, which may differ from actual results.
** Because of the volatility of fuel prices, actual amounts may differ significantly from our estimates. Because of the unpredictable nature of oil prices, our full-year 2009 forecast is not meaningful at this time.
Changes in Advance Booked Load Factors (percentage of available seat miles that are sold)
* The Easter holiday is in April this year, but was in March 2008.
Labor Updates
Alaska recently reached a tentative agreement with the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) on a new four-year contract representing Alaskas pilots.  Details of the agreement will not be disclosed until the vote has been completed.
First Bag Fee
Alaska and Horizon will begin charging a $15 fee for a first checked bag effective July 7, 2009 for tickets purchased beginning May 1, 2009.  The fee includes a guarantee to compensate passengers if their luggage is not in baggage claim within 25 minutes after their flight arrives at the gate.  The first bag fee will not apply to certain passengers.  We believe that this fee will likely result in increased ancillary revenues for Air Group of approximately $70 million or more annually.

Forecast Information
* For Horizon, our forecast of cost per ASM excluding fuel is based on forward-looking estimates, which may differ significantly from actual results.
** Because of the volatility of fuel prices, actual amounts may differ significantly from our estimates. Because of the unpredictable nature of oil prices, our full-year 2009 forecast is not meaningful at this time.

First Bag Fee
As noted above, Alaska and Horizon will begin charging a $15 fee for a first checked bag effective July 7, 2009 for tickets purchased beginning May 1, 2009.  We believe that this fee will likely result in increased ancillary revenues for Air Group of approximately $70 million or more annually.

Future Fuel Hedge Positions*
*All of our 2010 and 2011 positions and the majority of our 2009 positions are call options which are designed to effectively cap our cost of the crude oil component of our jet fuel purchases.  With call options, we benefit from a decline in crude oil prices, as there is no cash outlay other than the premiums we pay to enter into the contracts.

Capital Expenditures
 
Total expected capital expenditures for 2009 are as follows (in millions):
 
As noted below,
Alaska
is deferring delivery on a number of B737-800 aircraft, resulting in fewer aircraft-related capital expenditures in 2009.  
 
The increase from prior guidance in expected non-aircraft capital expenditures at
Alaska
is primarily due to projected costs associated with our likely move to a different terminal at
Los Angeles
 
International
 
Airport
in early 2010.  We have estimated $20 million for 2009, although total project costs through 2010 will likely be higher.  Details of the funding mechanism and cost-sharing arrangements have not yet been worked out with the airport authority.  As a result, this estimate is subject to change.

Firm Aircraft Commitments
 
In April 2009,
Ala
ska
entered into an agreement with Boeing to defer the
del
ivery on a number of B737-800 aircraft and exercised options for an additional four aircraft to be
del
ivered in 2014 and 2015.  With this new agreement, we do not plan to take any B737-800 aircraft
del
iveries in 2011.
 
Horizon is currently in discussions with Bombardier to defer all remaining 2009, 2010 and 2011 Q400 deliveries to later periods.  A final agreement has not yet been
reached
, so the delivery schedule below is based on the current commitment.  We expect to reach an agreement later in the second quarter of this year.

The expected fleet counts at December 31, 2009 and 2010 for Alaska are subject to change as we continue to refine the capacity reduction and aircraft utilization plan, and attempt to market four of our B737-700 aircraft.

The planned CRJ and Q400 fleets at December 31, 2009 and 2010 are subject to change as we finalize the fleet transition plan and is dependent on our ability to remarket the CRJ aircraft.

Exhibit 99.1
Investor Update  May 20, 2009
References in this update to Air Group, Company, we, us, and our refer to Alaska Air Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise specified.
This update includes forecasted operational and financial information for our subsidiaries Alaska Airlines, Inc. (Alaska) and Horizon Air Industries, Inc. (Horizon).  Our disclosure of operating cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel and other items, provides us (and may provide investors) with the ability to measure and monitor our performance without these items.  The most directly comparable GAAP measure is total operating expense per available seat mile.  However, due to the large fluctuations in fuel prices, we are unable to predict total operating expense for any future period with any degree of certainty. In addition, we believe the disclosure of fuel expense on an economic basis is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. Please see the cautionary statement under Forward-Looking Information.
We are providing unaudited information about fuel price movements and the impact of our hedging program on our financial results.  Management believes it is useful to compare results between periods on an economic basis.
Economic fuel expense
is defined as the raw or into-plane fuel cost less any cash we receive from hedge counterparties for hedges that settle during the period, offset by the recognition of premiums originally paid for those hedges that settle during the period.  Economic fuel expense more closely approximates the net cash outflow associated with purchasing fuel for our operation.
Forward-Looking Information
 
This update contains forward-looking statements subject to the safe harbor protection provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements relate to future events and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual outcomes to be materially different from those indicated by any forward-looking statements.  For a comprehensive discussion of potential risk factors, see Item 1A of the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008.   Some of these risks include current economic conditions, increases in operating costs including fuel, competition, labor costs and relations, our significant indebtedness, inability to meet cost reduction goals, terrorist attacks, seasonal fluctuations in our financial results, an aircraft accident, laws and regulations, and government fees and taxes.  All of the forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the risk factors discussed therein. These risk factors may not be exhaustive. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risk factors emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict such new risk factors, nor can it assess the impact, if any, of such new risk factors on our business or events described in any forward-looking statements. We expressly disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date of this report to conform them to actual results. Over time, our actual results, performance or achievements will likely differ from the anticipated results, performance or achievements that are expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements, and such differences might be significant and materially adverse.

New Pilot Contract
On May 19, 2009, we announced that our pilots, represented by the Air Line Pilots Association, ratified a new four-year contract.  This negotiated agreement replaces the contract that had been in place since May 1, 2005.  The 2005 contract resulted from an arbitrators decision and included immediate wage reductions that approximated 26% across the pilot group, work rule changes, and higher employee health care contributions.
The significant terms of the new contract are as follows:
 
Pilots will receive a one-time bonus following ratification of the contract that we expect to be approximately $20 million in the aggregate.  The transition expense associated with establishing the sick-leave payout program described above is expected to be between $10 million and $15 million.  We are currently evaluating the appropriate accounting treatment for these items.

First Bag Fee
As previously disclosed, Alaska and Horizon will begin charging a $15 service fee for a first checked bag effective July 7, 2009 for tickets purchased beginning May 1, 2009.  The first bag fee will not apply to certain passengers, including our Mileage Plan MVP and MVP Gold passengers, those traveling solely within the state of Alaska, those traveling to Guadalajara and Mexico City, and military personnel.  We believe that this fee will likely result in increased ancillary revenues for Air Group of approximately $70 million or more annually and approximately $30 million in 2009.
Schedule Update
As previously disclosed, in response to the decline in passenger demand for travel in markets most impacted by the H1N1 flu virus, we recently announced that we are reducing our capacity to Mexico destinations by 37% beginning July 2, with some selective cancellations beginning immediately.  Flights to and from Mexico represented approximately 13% of Alaskas total passenger traffic in the first quarter of 2009, generally the highest quarter of the year, and 8% of total traffic in the full year of 2008.  We will monitor the situation closely and will make further changes to our schedule if necessary.  The capacity will be redeployed to other leisure destination markets, primarily Hawaii.  In the fall, Alaska will also add three new cities to its route structure  Houston and Austin, Texas and Atlanta, Georgia.  After giving consideration to the changes above, we still expect full-year capacity to decline approximately 6% compared to 2008.  This is unchanged from our previous guidance.
Changes in Advance Booked Load Factors (percentage of available seat miles that are sold)
* May advance booked load factors have declined from our previous guidance.  We believe this is primarily due to the H1N1 virus threat resulting in significant demand decline to Mexico and, to a lesser extent, other destinations.
Forecast Information
 
*For Alaska, our forecasts of mainline cost per ASM excluding fuel are based on forward-looking estimates, which will likely differ from actual results.  As noted on the previous page, the guidance above includes the impact of the wage increases for pilots resulting from the new contract.  However, the estimates above include the impact of the signing bonus or sick-leave payout program as the accounting treatment is still being finalized.

Line-of-Business Information
In CPA arrangements, Horizon is  insulated from market revenue factors and is guaranteed contractual revenue amounts based on operational capacity.  As a result, yield and load factor information is not presented.  Horizon bears the revenue risk in its brand flying markets. Revenue from the Alaska CPA is eliminated in consolidation.  The actual passenger revenue generated on CPA flights is noted in the Alaska  Purchased Capacity section on page 4.

As previously disclosed, our pilots, represented by the Air Line Pilots Association, ratified a new four-year contract expiring in 2013.
The significant terms of the new contract are:
The increase in wages and benefits that result from this contract is expected to be approximately $23 million in 2009, including $5 million of additional cost associated with post-retirement medical coverage, and is included in the unit cost forecast on the following page.  
In addition to the terms above, pilots received a one-time bonus following ratification of the contract that totaled approximately $21 million in the aggregate.  Together with the estimated $15 million transition expense associated with establishing the sick-leave payout program described above, these one-time costs will be excluded from our adjusted earnings and our cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel and special charges.
First Bag Fee
As previously disclosed, Alaska and Horizon will begin charging a $15 service fee for a first checked bag, effective July 7, 2009 for tickets purchased beginning May 1, 2009.  The first bag fee will not apply to certain passengers, including our Mileage Plan MVP and MVP Gold passengers, those traveling solely within the state of Alaska, those traveling to Guadalajara and Mexico City, and military personnel.  We believe that this fee will likely result in increased ancillary revenues for Air Group of approximately $70 million or more annually and approximately $30 million in 2009.
New Markets
Alaska recently announced daily service between San Jose, California and Austin, Texas beginning September 2, 2009.  This service is in addition to new routes previously announced such as between Seattle and Austin, Seattle and Houston, Seattle and Atlanta, among others.

Forecast Information
*For Alaska, our forecasts of mainline cost per ASM excluding fuel are based on forward-looking estimates, which will likely differ from actual results.  As noted on the previous page, the guidance above includes the impact of the wage increases for pilots resulting from the new contract.  Special items include the pilot signing bonus and transition charge to the new sick-leave payout program.
 
**Because of the volatility of fuel prices, actual amounts may differ significantly from our estimates. Because of the unpredictable nature of oil prices, our full-year 2009 forecast is not meaningful at this time.

Line-of-Business Information
In CPA arrangements, Horizon is  insulated from market revenue factors and is guaranteed contractual revenue amounts based on operational capacity.  As a result, yield and load factor information is not presented.  Horizon bears the revenue risk in its brand flying markets. Revenue from the Alaska CPA is eliminated in consolidation.  The actual passenger revenue generated on CPA flights is noted in the Alaska  Purchased Capacity section on page 3.

Forecast Information (includes brand and CPA flying)
*For Horizon, our forecast of cost per ASM excluding fuel and other items is based on forward-looking estimates, which will likely differ significantly from actual results. The measure includes both brand flying and CPA flying performed for Alaska.
**Because of the volatility of fuel prices, actual amounts may differ significantly from our estimates.  Because of the unpredictable nature of oil prices, our full-year 2009 forecast is not meaningful at this time.
Q200 Fleet Transition Charges
As previously disclosed, Horizon recorded a charge of $4.8 million in the first quarter related to the final six Q200 aircraft removed from operations during that period.  As more information becomes known and as Horizon continues to pursue alternatives to dispose of these aircraft, we expect an additional charge in the second quarter.  Although we have not completed any transactions and our estimates could change based on any final disposal activity, we believe the second quarter charge could be in the range of $4 million to $6 million.  The unit cost guidance above include the estimated Q200 charge as the amount is being finalized.  We expect our next Investor Update, to be filed in early July, will have a final estimate.  Consistent with past practice, Q200 fleet transition charges will not be considered special items and will not be excluded from our adjusted results.

Consolidated Nonoperating Expense
We expect that our consolidated nonoperating expense will be approximately $17 million to $18 million for the second quarter 2009.  This increase from our previous guidance is primarily due to changes in variable interest rates and the impact on capitalized interest resulting from the delays in Boeing aircraft deliveries.
 
Future Fuel Hedge Positions*
*All of our 2010 and 2011 positions and the majority of our 2009 positions are call options, which are designed to effectively cap the cost of the crude oil component of our jet fuel purchases.  With call options, we benefit from a decline in crude oil prices, as there is no cash outlay other than the premiums we pay to enter into the contracts.
Additionally, we have used either fixed-price physical contracts or financial swaps to fix the refinery margin component for approximately 42% of our third quarter 2009 jet fuel purchases at an average price per barrel of $9.28, or 22 cents per gallon.  The June 19, 2009 closing spot rate for the LA Jet fuel refinery margin was 22 cents per gallon.
Cash and Share Count
As previously disclosed, on June 11, 2009
Alaska Air Groups
Board of Directors authorized a $50 million share repurchase program.  Through
June 22, 2009, we have purchased
450,000 shares totaling $7.6 million.

Firm Aircraft Commitments
 
Horizon is currently in discussions with Bombardier to defer all remaining 2009, 2010 and 2011 Q400 deliveries to later periods.  A final agreement has not been
reached
, so the delivery schedule below is based on the current commitment.  We expect to reach an agreement
soon

In addition to the firm orders noted above,
Alaska

The expected fleet counts at December 31, 2009 and 2010 for Alaska are subject to change as we continue to refine the capacity reduction and aircraft utilization plan, and attempt to market four of our B737-700 aircraft.

The planned CRJ and Q400 fleets at December 31, 2009 and 2010 are subject to change as we finalize the fleet transition plan and is dependent on our ability to remarket the CRJ aircraft.

Investor Update  July 10, 2009
References in this update to Air Group, Company, we, us, and our refer to Alaska Air Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise specified.
This update includes forecasted operational and financial information for our subsidiaries Alaska Airlines, Inc. (Alaska) and Horizon Air Industries, Inc. (Horizon).  Our disclosure of operating cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel and other items, provides us (and may provide investors) with the ability to measure and monitor our performance without these items.  The most directly comparable GAAP measure is total operating expense per available seat mile.  However, due to the large fluctuations in fuel prices, we are unable to predict total operating expense for any future period with any degree of certainty. In addition, we believe the disclosure of fuel expense on an economic basis is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. Please see the cautionary statement under Forward-Looking Information.
We are providing unaudited information about fuel price movements and the impact of our hedging program on our financial results.  Management believes it is useful to compare results between periods on an economic basis.
Economic fuel expense
is defined as the raw or into-plane fuel cost less any cash we receive from hedge counterparties for hedges that settle during the period, offset by the recognition of premiums originally paid for those hedges that settle during the period.  Economic fuel expense more closely approximates the net cash outflow associated with purchasing fuel for our operation.
Forward-Looking Information
 
This update contains forward-looking statements subject to the safe harbor protection provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements relate to future events and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual outcomes to be materially different from those indicated by any forward-looking statements.  For a comprehensive discussion of potential risk factors, see Item 1A of the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008.   Some of these risks include current economic conditions, increases in operating costs including fuel, competition, labor costs and relations, our significant indebtedness, inability to meet cost reduction goals, terrorist attacks, seasonal fluctuations in our financial results, an aircraft accident, laws and regulations, and government fees and taxes.  All of the forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the risk factors discussed therein.  We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risk factors emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict such new risk factors, nor can it assess the impact, if any, of such new risk factors on our business or events described in any forward-looking statements. We expressly disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date of this report to conform them to actual results. Over time, our actual results, performance or achievements will likely differ from the anticipated results, performance or achievements that are expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements, and such differences might be significant and materially adverse.

June 2009 Statistics
*RPMs as a percentage of ASMs
Actual revenue and fuel cost information is not yet available for June.  However, information for the first two months of the second quarter, as previously disclosed, is as follows:
Based on the April and May actual results above, and giving consideration to expected June results, we are forecasting Passenger RASM to be down between 6% and 7% in the second quarter of 2009 when compared to the second quarter of 2008.
Impact of Modified Affinity Card Agreement
In June, we modified of our Alaska Airlines affinity card agreement with the Bank of America.  The revised agreement enhances the economics of the program, and provides for, among other things, an increase in the rate at which we sell miles to the bank. This revised agreement was retroactive to January 1, 2009 and will result in approximately $15 million of incremental revenue that we expect to record in June, pending final review of the accounting treatment.  We expect to record $12 million of the $15 million in other revenue and the remaining $3 million in passenger revenue.
The impact of the modified affinity card agreement is not included in the unit revenue guidance above.
Impact of New Pilot Contract
As previously disclosed, our pilots, represented by the Air Line Pilots Association, ratified a new four-year contract expiring in 2013.
The significant terms of the new contract are:
The increase in wages and benefits that result from this contract is expected to be approximately $23 million in 2009, including $5 million of additional cost associated with post-retirement medical coverage, and is included in the unit cost forecast on the following page.
In addition to the terms above, pilots received a one-time bonus following ratification of the contract that totaled approximately $21 million in the aggregate.  Together with the estimated $15 million transition expense associated with establishing the sick-leave payout program described above, these one-time costs (totaling approximately $36 million pretax) will be excluded from our adjusted earnings and our cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel and special charges.
First Bag Fee
As previously disclosed, on July 7 Alaska and Horizon began charging a $15 service fee for a first checked bag for tickets purchased after May 1, 2009.  We believe that this fee will likely result in increased ancillary revenues for Air Group of approximately $70 million or more annually and approximately $30 million in the second half of 2009.

Second Quarter Financial and Other Highlights:
 
   
 
 SEATTLE  Alaska Air Group, Inc. (NYSE: ALK) today reported second quarter 2009 net income of $29.1 million, or $0.79 per diluted share, compared to net income of $63.1 million, or $1.74 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2008. Excluding Alaskas new pilot contract transition costs of $35.8 million ($22.3 million after tax or $0.61 per diluted share) and mark-to-market fuel hedge gains of $39.8 million ($24.9 million after tax or $0.68 per diluted share), the company reported net income of $26.5 million, or $0.72 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $14.1 million, or $0.39 per share, excluding special items in the second quarter of 2008.
   
 
 
 
Alaska Air Group Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Bill Ayer said the quarters earnings were shaped by a steep decline in fuel prices, network adjustments and employees hard work and attention to customers. 
Weve made significant changes at both airlines over many years
,
said Ayer. While theres more to do, were seeing clear signs that what were doing is working.  He noted that he expects the economy to be very challenging for the foreseeable future. The company plans to maintain a healthy level of cash with a continued focus on improving revenues and reducing costs.
 
The following table summarizes the companys net income (loss) and earnings per diluted share (EPS) during the second quarters of 2009 and 2008 excluding one-time pilot contract costs, fleet transition costs and adjustments to reflect the timing of gain or loss recognition resulting from mark-to-market fuel-hedge accounting as reported in accordance with GAAP (in millions except per-share amounts):

Exhibit 99.2
Investor Update  July 23, 2009
References in this update to Air Group, Company, we, us, and our refer to Alaska Air Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise specified.
This update includes forecasted operational and financial information for our subsidiaries Alaska Airlines, Inc. (Alaska) and Horizon Air Industries, Inc. (Horizon).  Our disclosure of operating cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel and other items, provides us (and may provide investors) with the ability to measure and monitor our performance without these items.  The most directly comparable GAAP measure is total operating expense per available seat mile.  However, due to the large fluctuations in fuel prices, we are unable to predict total operating expense for any future period with any degree of certainty.  In addition, we believe the disclosure of fuel expense on an economic basis is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operational performance.  Please see the cautionary statement under Forward-Looking Information.
Please see our press release dated today for actual financial and statistical information for the second quarter of 2009.
Forward-Looking Information
 
This update contains forward-looking statements subject to the safe harbor protection provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements relate to future events and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual outcomes to be materially different from those indicated by any forward-looking statements.  For a comprehensive discussion of potential risk factors, see Item 1A of the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008.   Some of these risks include current economic conditions, increases in operating costs including fuel, competition, labor costs and relations, our significant indebtedness, inability to meet cost reduction goals, terrorist attacks, seasonal fluctuations in our financial results, an aircraft accident, laws and regulations, and government fees and taxes.  All of the forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the risk factors discussed therein. These risk factors may not be exhaustive. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risk factors emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict such new risk factors, nor can it assess the impact, if any, of such new risk factors on our business or events described in any forward-looking statements. We expressly disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date of this report to conform them to actual results. Over time, our actual results, performance or achievements will likely differ from the anticipated results, performance or achievements that are expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements, and such differences might be significant and materially adverse.
 
 
 
 
Forecast Information
* For Alaska, our forecasts of mainline cost per ASM excluding fuel are based on forward-looking estimates, which will likely differ from actual results. Special items for the year include the pilot contract transition costs recorded in the second quarter of 2009.
** Because of the volatility of fuel prices, actual amounts may differ significantly from our estimates. Because of the unpredictable nature of oil prices, our full-year 2009 forecast is not meaningful at this time.
Changes in Advance Booked Load Factors (percentage of ASMs that are sold)
* The trends in advanced bookings have significantly improved as the date of travel approaches.
Alaska
has Capacity Purchase Agreements (CPA) with Horizon for certain routes and with a third party for service between
Anchorage
and
Dutch Harbor
,
AK
.
Forecast Information (Horizon CPA)
* Costs associated with the Horizon CPA agreement represent the amount paid by Alaska to Horizon for operating costs plus a specified profit margin and are eliminated in consolidation.
Changes in Advance Booked Load Factors (percentage of ASMs that are sold)
* The trends in advanced bookings have improved as the date of travel approaches.  Purchased capacity advance booked load factors have been negatively impacted by the replacement of 37-seat Q200 aircraft with larger Q400 aircraft.

** Because of the volatility of fuel prices, actual amounts may differ significantly from our estimates. Because of the unpredictable nature of oil prices, our full-year 2009 forecast is not meaningful at this time.
Changes in Advance Booked Load Factors  Brand Flying Only (percentage of ASMs that are sold)
* The trends in advanced bookings have significantly improved as the date of travel approaches.
 
 
 
 
Future Fuel Hedge Positions*
*All of our 2010 and 2011 positions and virtually all of our remaining 2009 positions are call options, which are designed to effectively cap the cost of the crude oil component of our jet fuel purchases.  With call options, we benefit from a decline in crude oil prices, as there is no cash outlay other than the premiums we pay to enter into the contracts.
Additionally, we have used either fixed-price physical contracts or financial swaps to fix the refining margin component for approximately
47% an
d 17% of our third and fourth quarter 2009 jet fuel purchases, respectively, at an average price of 22 cents per gallon.  The July 21, 2009 closing spot rate for the LA Jet fuel refining margin was 27 cents per gallon.
Cash and Share Count
 
As previously disclosed, on June 11, 2009
Alaska Air Groups
Board of Directors authorized a $50 million share repurchase program.  Through
July 21, 2009, we had purchase
d 1,293,178 shares totaling $23.1 million.
Capital Expenditures
 
Total expected gross capital expenditures for 2009 are as follows (in millions):
 
*Amounts exclude any proceeds from the sale of assets.
 
 
 
Firm Aircraft Commitments
 
The tables below reflect the current delivery schedules for firm aircraft
.
In addition to the firm orders noted above,
Alaska
has options to acquire 40 additional B737-800s and Horizon has options to acquire 10 Q400s.
Projected Fleet Count
F=Freighter; C=Combination freighter/passenger
1
The expected fleet counts at December 31, 2009 and 2010 for Alaska are subject to change as we continue to refine the capacity reduction and aircraft utilization plan, and attempt to market four of our B737-700 aircraft.
2
The planned CRJ fleet activity is subject to change as we finalize the fleet transition plan and is dependent on our ability to remarket the CRJ aircraft.  If we are unable to dispose of the CRJ aircraft to coincide with the delivery of the Q400 aircraft, we may remove the CRJ aircraft from service and place them in temporary storage until a suitable disposal alternative is arranged.

Investor Update  August 21, 2009
References in this update to Air Group, Company, we, us, and our refer to Alaska Air Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise specified.
This update includes forecasted operational and financial information for our subsidiaries Alaska Airlines, Inc. (Alaska) and Horizon Air Industries, Inc. (Horizon).

In addition, we believe the disclosure of fuel expense on an economic basis is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. Please see the cautionary statement under Forward-Looking Information.
We are providing unaudited information about fuel price movements and the impact of our hedging program on our financial results.  Management believes it is useful to compare results between periods on an economic basis.
Economic fuel expense
is defined as the raw or into-plane fuel cost less any cash we receive from hedge counterparties for hedges that settle during the period, offset by the recognition of premiums originally paid for those hedges that settle during the period.  Economic fuel expense more closely approximates the net cash outflow associated with purchasing fuel for our operation.

**RASM and Passenger RASM were favorably impacted by first bag fee revenue, which began on July 7, 2009, of approximately $4.9 million for

mainline.  Given the seasonally high passenger count for July, this amount is in line with our previously disclosed estimate of $70 million in incremental annual revenue for Air Group. RASM was also favorably impacted by the revised Mileage Plan affinity card agreement described in our second quarter 10Q which we estimate will provide approximately $15 million in incremental revenue for the last six months of 2009, or approximately $2.5 million per month.

In CPA arrangements, Horizon is  insulated from market revenue factors and is guaranteed contractual revenue amounts based on operational capacity.  As a result, yield and load factor information is not presented.  Horizon bears the revenue risk in its brand flying markets. Revenue from the Alaska CPA is eliminated in consolidation.

August 2009 Statistics
*percentage of available seats occupied by fare-paying passengers
 
** RASM and Passenger RASM were favorably impacted by first bag fee revenue of approximatel
y $6.7 million
for August 2009
and $11.6 million for
the first two months of the third quarter for
Alaska
mainline operations (first bag fee was effective July 7, 2009).  Given the seasonally high passenger count for July and August, this amount is in line with our previously disclosed estimate of $70 million in incremental annual revenue for Air Group. RASM was also favorably impacted by the revised Mileage Plan affinity card agreement described in our second quarter 10Q which we estimate will provide approximately $15 million in incremental revenue for the last six months of 2009, or approximately $2.5 million per month.

In CPA arrangements, Horizon is  insulated from market revenue factors and is guaranteed contractual revenue amounts based on operational capacity.  As a result, yield and load factor information is not presented.  Horizon bears the revenue risk in its brand flying markets. Revenue from the Alaska CPA is eliminated in consolidation.

Future Fuel Hedge Positions*
*All of our 2010 through 2012 positions and the majority of our 2009 positions are call options, which are designed to effectively cap our cost of the crude oil component of our jet fuel purchases.  With call options, we benefit from a decline in crude oil prices, as there is no cash outlay other than the premiums we pay to enter into the contracts.
In addition to crude oil contracts, we have used both fixed-price physical contracts and financial swaps to fix the refining margin component for approximatel
y 47% of our third and fourth quarter 2009
estimated
jet fuel purchases at an average price of 22 cents per gallon and 24% of our first quarter 2010

jet fuel purchases at an average price of 25 cents per gallon.

The planned CRJ fleet activity is subject to change as we finalize the fleet transition plan and is dependent on our ability to remarket the CRJ aircraft.  If we are unable to dispose of the CRJ aircraft to coincide with the delivery of the Q400 aircraft, we may remove the CRJ aircraft from service and place them in temporary storage until a suitable disposal alternative is arranged.  Alternatively, older Q400 aircraft may be removed from service in lieu of CRJ aircraft if that alternative is more economical.

Exhibit 99.1
Investor Update  October 8, 2009
References in this update to Air Group, Company, we, us, and our refer to Alaska Air Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise specified.
This update includes forecasted operational and financial information for our subsidiaries Alaska Airlines, Inc. (Alaska) and Horizon Air Industries, Inc. (Horizon).  Our disclosure of operating cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel and other items, provides us (and may provide investors) with the ability to measure and monitor our performance without these items.  The most directly comparable GAAP measure is total operating expense per available seat mile.  However, due to the large fluctuations in fuel prices, we are unable to predict total operating expense for any future period with any degree of certainty. In addition, we believe the disclosure of fuel expense on an economic basis is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. Please see the cautionary statement under Forward-Looking Information.
We are providing unaudited information about fuel price movements and the impact of our hedging program on our financial results.  Management believes it is useful to compare results between periods on an economic basis.
Economic fuel expense
is defined as the raw or into-plane fuel cost less any cash we receive from hedge counterparties for hedges that settle during the period, offset by the recognition of premiums originally paid for those hedges that settle during the period.  Economic fuel expense more closely approximates the net cash outflow associated with purchasing fuel for our operation.
Forward-Looking Information
 
This update contains forward-looking statements subject to the safe harbor protection provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements relate to future events and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual outcomes to be materially different from those indicated by any forward-looking statements.  For a comprehensive discussion of potential risk factors, see Item 1A of the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008.   Some of these risks include current economic conditions, increases in operating costs including fuel, competition, labor costs and relations, our significant indebtedness, inability to meet cost reduction goals, terrorist attacks, seasonal fluctuations in our financial results, an aircraft accident, laws and regulations, and government fees and taxes.  All of the forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the risk factors discussed therein. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risk factors emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict such new risk factors, nor can it assess the impact, if any, of such new risk factors on our business or events described in any forward-looking statements. We expressly disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date of this report to conform them to actual results. Over time, our actual results, performance or achievements will likely differ from the anticipated results, performance or achievements that are expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements, and such differences might be significant and materially adverse.

Third Quarter Financial and Other Highlights:
 
 
SEATTLE  Alaska Air Group, Inc. (NYSE: ALK) today reported third quarter 2009 net income of $87.6 million, or $2.46 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $86.5 million, or $2.40 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2008. Excluding mark-to-market fuel hedge gains of $7.3 million ($4.6 million after tax or $0.13 per diluted share), the company reported net income of $83.0 million, or $2.33 per diluted share, compared to net income of $39.9 million, or $1.10 per diluted share, excluding
mark-to-market fuel hedge losses and other special items in the third quarter of 2008.
 
Our work to reduce capacity to better match demand, redeploy aircraft into promising new markets, and achieve record operational reliability contributed to our best quarterly financial performance in many years, said Bill Ayer, Alaska Air Groups chairman and chief executive officer. My thanks to our people for taking excellent care of customers
and for their relentless efforts to improve our business.
 
 
The following table reconciles the companys adjusted net income and earnings per diluted share (EPS) during the third quarters of 2009 and 2008 to the most directly related amounts as reported in accordance with GAAP (in millions except per-share amounts):

Investor Update  October 22, 2009
References in this update to Air Group, Company, we, us, and our refer to Alaska Air Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise specified.
This update includes actual third quarter consolidated statistical information and forecasted operational and financial information for our subsidiaries Alaska Airlines, Inc. (Alaska) and Horizon Air Industries, Inc. (Horizon).  Our disclosure of operating cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel and other items, provides us (and may provide investors) with the ability to measure and monitor our performance without these items.  The most directly comparable GAAP measure is total operating expense per available seat mile.  However, due to the large fluctuations in fuel prices, we are unable to predict total operating expense for any future period with any degree of certainty.  In addition, we believe the disclosure of fuel expense on an economic basis is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operational performance.  Please see the cautionary statement under Forward-Looking Information.

If we are unable to dispose of the CRJ aircraft to coincide with the delivery of the Q400 aircraft, we plan to reduce the average utilization of Horizons fleet in order to maintain capacity plans.

Future Fuel Hedge Positions*
*All of our future positions are call options, which are designed to effectively cap the cost of the crude oil component of our jet fuel purchases.  With call options, we benefit from a decline in crude oil prices, as there is no cash outlay other than the premiums we pay to enter into the contracts.
Additionally, we have used either fixed-price physical contracts or financial swaps to fix the refining margin component for approximatel
y 47% of our fourth quarter 2009 estimated jet fuel purchases and 27% of our first quarter 2010 estimated jet fuel purchases at an average price of 22 cents per gallon and 25 cents per gallon, respectively.

Exhibit 99.1
Investor Update  November 10, 2009
References in this update to Air Group, Company, we, us, and our refer to Alaska Air Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise specified.
This update includes forecasted operational and financial information for our subsidiaries Alaska Airlines, Inc. (Alaska) and Horizon Air Industries, Inc. (Horizon).  Our disclosure of operating cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel and other items, provides us (and may provide investors) with the ability to measure and monitor our performance without these items.  The most directly comparable GAAP measure is total operating expense per available seat mile.  However, due to the large fluctuations in fuel prices, we are unable to predict total operating expense for any future period with any degree of certainty. In addition, we believe the disclosure of fuel expense on an economic basis is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. Please see the cautionary statement under Forward-Looking Information.
We are providing unaudited information about fuel price movements and the impact of our hedging program on our financial results.  Management believes it is useful to compare results between periods on an economic basis. is defined as the raw or into-plane fuel cost less any cash we receive from hedge counterparties for hedges that settle during the period, offset by the recognition of premiums originally paid for those hedges that settle during the period.  Economic fuel expense more closely approximates the net cash outflow associated with purchasing fuel for our operation.

Forward-Looking Information
 
This update contains forward-looking statements subject to the safe harbor protection provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements relate to future events and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual outcomes to be materially different from those indicated by any forward-looking statements.  For a comprehensive discussion of potential risk factors, see Item 1A of the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008 and revisions in Item 1A of the Companys Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2009.   Some of these risks include current economic conditions, increases in operating costs including fuel, competition, labor costs and relations, our significant indebtedness, inability to meet cost reduction goals, terrorist attacks, seasonal fluctuations in our financial results, an aircraft accident, laws and regulations, and government fees and taxes.  All of the forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the risk factors discussed therein. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risk factors emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict such new risk factors, nor can it assess the impact, if any, of such new risk factors on our business or events described in any forward-looking statements. We expressly disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date of this report to conform them to actual results. Over time, our actual results, performance or achievements will likely differ from the anticipated results, performance or achievements that are expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements, and such differences might be significant and materially adverse.

New Markets and 2010 Capacity
Alaska announced today new service between two California cities to the Hawaiian Islands beginning in March 2010.  Service between San Jose and Maui three times per week will begin on March 11, 2010 and between San Jose and Kona four times per week will begin on March 12, 2010.  Daily service between Sacramento and Maui will begin on March 26, 2010.  
With this new service and other schedule changes planned in 2010, we expect Alaska mainline capacity will grow 1% to 2% in 2010 as compared to the full year of 2009.  This preliminary guidance is subject to change as we finalize our 2010 plan.

 * Capacity includes Alaska mainline operations, Horizon brand flying, and CPA flying with Horizon only.
Effective Income Tax Rate
We evaluate our tax rate each quarter and make adjustments when necessary.  Although our fourth quarter and full-year effective tax rates have not yet been calculated, it is important to note that the effective rate can be volatile and is highly dependent on the level of pretax income or loss and the magnitude of any nondeductible expenses in relation to the pretax amount.  We currently expect that our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter will be higher than the 39.7% effective income tax rate on our adjusted pretax earnings for the first nine months of 2009.

November 2009 Statistics
*percentage of available seats occupied by fare-paying passengers
** RASM and Passenger RASM were favorably impacted by first bag fee revenue of approximately $5.2 million for November 2009 and $10.5 million for the first two months of the fourth quarter for Alaska mainline operations (first bag fee was effective July 7, 2009).  RASM was also favorably impacted by the revised Mileage Plan affinity card agreement described in our second quarter 10Q which we estimate will provide approximately $7.5 million in incremental revenue for the fourth quarter of 2009, or approximately $2.5 million per month.
Changes in Advance Booked Load Factors (percentage of available seat miles that are sold)
* December advanced booked load factor comparisons are not meaningful at this time because of the large number of snow-related cancellations in the last two weeks of December 2008.  We currently expect the final load factor for December 2009 to be approximately 83.5% compared to 80.7% in December 2008.
** The year-over-year improvement in advanced booked load factors for January and February is primarily attributable to the recent post-holiday fare sale launched by Alaska and Horizon for travel from January 5, 2010 through March 10, 2010.
Forecast Information
Labor Contract Extension
On December 17, 2009, Alaskas ramp service and stores agents, represented by the International Association of Machinists (IAM), ratified a two-year extension of their collective bargaining agreement, which will now become amendable on July 19, 2012.  This agreement includes participation in Air Groups Performance-Based Pay (PBP) incentive plan for 2009 and beyond in which most other employees at Alaska and Horizon participate, a 1.5% pay increase in June 2010 and 2011, and a signing bonus of approximately $0.5 million in the aggregate.  The estimated increase in incentive pay expense representing the difference between the expected amount these employees will receive from the PBP plan and what they would have received under the previous profit-sharing plan is approximately $1.8 million and is included in the forecast of unit costs above.
Alaskas clerical, office and passenger service employees (COPS), also represented by the IAM, rejected a two-year extension proposal identical to the terms of the proposal ratified by the ramp service employees and stores agents.  As a result, COPS employees are the only remaining work group at Alaska that participate in a profit-sharing plan other than PBP.

* December advanced booked load factor comparisons are not meaningful at this time because of the large number of snow-related cancellations in the last two weeks of December 2008.  We currently expect the final load factor for December 2009 to be approximately 76.5% compared to 74.3% in December 2008.

Labor Contract Extensions and Updates
On December 21, 2009, Horizons flight attendants, represented by the Association of Flight Attendants, ratified a new two-year contract.  The agreement includes participation in Air Groups PBP incentive plan for 2009 and beyond, at least a 3% pay increase over the life of the contract, and a signing bonus of $0.3 million in the aggregate.
Historically, only a small percentage of non-represented employees at Horizon participated in the PBP plan.  To better align the incentive plans for this group with other Horizon and Alaska employees, Horizon has also added all remaining non-represented employees (approximately 1,400 people) to the PBP plan.
The participation of these new work groups in PBP is estimated to result in an additional $3.5 million in incentive pay, representing the difference between the expense from the PBP plan and what would have been received under the previous profit-sharing plan. As a result, the only remaining work groups at Horizon that do not participate in the PBP plan are pilots, mechanics, and represented station personnel in Canada.

SEATTLE  Alaska Air Group, Inc. (NYSE: ALK) today reported fourth quarter 2009 net income of $24.1 million, or $0.67 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $75.2 million, or $2.08 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2008. Excluding mark-to-market fuel hedge gains of
 
$31.7 million ($19.7 million after tax or $0.55 per diluted share), the company reported net income of $4.4 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, in 2009 compared to net income of $16.4 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, excluding special items in the fourth quarter of 2008.
 
The company reported full-year 2009 net income of $121.6 million, compared to a net loss of $135.9 million in 2008.  Excluding the impact of the items noted in the table below, the company reported 2009 net income of $88.7 million, or $2.45 per diluted share, an $84.3 million improvement from the $4.4 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, in 2008.
 
 
 
 
Our 
traffic and unit revenue performance, driven by positive network changes, outpaced the industry throughout the year.  This performance, combined with lower fuel costs, placed Alaska Air Groups profitability among the best in the industry for 2009, said Bill Ayer, chairman and chief executive officer. This marks our sixth consecutive year of profits on an adjusted basis.
 
Based on its 2009 profit and operational performance, the company will distribute a total of
$76 million from its pay-for-performance incentive plans.
 
Our employees ongoing commitment to operating reliably and providing exceptional customer service is fundamental to building a great company for the long term, and broad participation in a common gain-sharing plan helps align Alaska and Horizon employees around important performance goals, said Ayer. I want to thank our people for their hard work and dedication, which contributed significantly to our 2009 results.

Investor Update  January 28, 2010
References in this update to Air Group, Company, we, us, and our refer to Alaska Air Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise specified.
This update includes actual fourth quarter and full-year 2009 consolidated statistical information and forecasted operational and financial information for our subsidiaries Alaska Airlines, Inc. (Alaska) and Horizon Air Industries, Inc. (Horizon).  Our disclosure of operating cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel and other items, provides us (and may provide investors) with the ability to measure and monitor our performance without these items.  The most directly comparable GAAP measure is total operating expense per available seat mile.  However, due to the large fluctuations in fuel prices, we are unable to predict total operating expense for any future period with any degree of certainty.  In addition, we believe the disclosure of fuel expense on an economic basis is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operational performance.  Please see the cautionary statement under Forward-Looking Information.
Please see our press release dated today for actual financial and statistical information for the fourth quarter and full year of 2009.

Forecast Information
Changes in Advance Booked Load Factors (percentage of ASMs that are sold)
Alaska has Capacity Purchase Agreements (CPA) with Horizon for certain routes and with a third party for service between Anchorage and Dutch Harbor, AK.
Forecast Information (Horizon CPA)
* Costs associated with the Horizon CPA agreement represent the amount paid by Alaska to Horizon for operating costs plus a specified profit margin and are eliminated in consolidation.
Changes in Advance Booked Load Factors (percentage of ASMs that are sold)

Forecast Information
* Capacity includes brand flying and CPA flying for Alaska.  Brand capacity is expected to decline approximately 10% in the first quarter of 2010 compared to the prior-year period.
** For Horizon, our forecast of cost per ASM excluding fuel is based on forward-looking estimates, which may differ significantly from actual results.

Actual Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2009 Statistics
Forecast Information
* Statistics include Alaska mainline operations, Horizon brand flying, and CPA flying with Horizon only.
Fuel Price Sensitivity
Given our current fuel-hedge portfolio, the following table depicts the approximate fuel prices under various crude oil and refining margin prices for the full-year 2010:
Nonoperating Expense
Our consolidated nonoperating expense is estimated to be approximately $19 million in the first quarter of 2010.

Capital Expenditures
 
Total expected gross capital expenditures for 2010 are as follows (in millions):
 
*Amounts exclude any proceeds from the sale of assets.
Firm Aircraft Commitments
 
The tables below reflect the current delivery schedules for firm aircraft.
 
In addition to the firm orders noted above, Alaska has options to acquire 40 additional B737-800s and Horizon has options to acquire 10 Q400s.
Projected Fleet Count
 
F=Freighter; C=Combination freighter/passenger
1
The expected fleet counts at December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012 are subject to change.
2
The planned CRJ fleet activity is subject to change and is dependent on our ability to remarket the CRJ aircraft.  If we are unable to dispose of the CRJ aircraft to coincide with the delivery of the Q400 aircraft, we plan to reduce the average utilization of Horizons fleet in order to maintain capacity plans.

Future Fuel Hedge Positions*
*All of our future positions are call options, which are designed to effectively cap the cost of the crude oil component of our jet fuel purchases.  With call options, we benefit from a decline in crude oil prices, as there is no cash outlay other than the premiums we pay to enter into the contracts.
Additionally, we have used either fixed-price physical contracts or financial swaps to fix the refining margin component for approximately 50% and 6% of our first quarter and second quarter 2010 estimated jet fuel purchases, respectively, at an average price of 23 cents per gallon.

ITEM 5.02  Departure of Directors or Principal Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Principal Officers
 
On January 27, 2010 the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the Committee) of Alaska Air Group, Inc. (the Company) approved the payouts for the 2009 Performance-Based Pay plan. The payouts are based on the Companys 2009 performance relative to safety, customer satisfaction, and financial performance goals established by the Committee for the year. The payouts were as follows: Mr. Ayer, $620,585; Mr. Tilden, $439,577; Mr. Johnson, $387,863; Mr. Minicucci, $323,215; and Mr. Pinneo, $339,216.
The Committee also approved the 2010 performance criteria pursuant to which awards may be paid to executive officers and other employees participating in the Performance-Based Pay plan as follows. Subject to the terms of the plan, participants will be eligible to receive payments if the Company achieves certain operational and financial performance criteria over the full year. The primary measures for 2010 and the relative weightings given to each measure are the Companys pre-tax profit margin (70%), cost per available seat mile excluding fuel (10%), safety as measured by lost time injuries per full time equivalent employee and aircraft ground damage per 10,000 departures (10%), and customer satisfaction as measured by total number of times each airline meets or exceeds the monthly Operational Performance Rewards customer satisfaction goal (10%).  For all employees, Performance-Based Pay payouts will be subject to an additional performance modifier that could increase, decrease, or maintain payout levels.  The modifier is based upon the dollar value of ancillary revenues collected per passenger.

Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Principal Officers; Election of Officers; Appointment of Principal Officers
 
On February 3, 2010, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the Committee) of Alaska Air Group, Inc. (the Company) took the following actions.
 
The Committee confirmed its philosophy to pay the senior-most executive officers base pay below market, with an opportunity to earn market pay through short-term and long-term incentive plans if the Company performs well.  The Committee set base salary for Chairman and CEO Bill Ayer at $400,000.   At $400,000 per year, Mr. Ayers base salary is below the 25 percentile as compared to market, based on airline peer group information provided by the Committees independent compensation consultant. The Committee also set base salary for the Companys other Named Executive Officers:  Alaska Airlines (Alaska) President Brad Tilden, $375,000; Alaska Air Group Executive Vice President/Finance and Chief Financial Officer Glenn Johnson, $300,000; Alaska Chief Operating Officer Ben Minicucci, $285,000; and  President of Horizon Air Industries, Inc. (Horizon) Jeff Pinneo, $240,000.
th
 
The Committee approved Performance-Based Pay plan participation rates of 100% for Mr. Ayer, 85% for Mr. Tilden, and 75% for Messrs. Johnson, Minicucci, and Pinneo.  Participation rates are expressed as a percentage of base salary for the fiscal year assuming target performance is achieved. The actual amounts paid under the PBP plan may be higher if the performance targets are exceeded or lower (or even 0%) if the targets are not met.
 
The Committee also approved grants of stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs) and performance stock units under the Companys 2008 Performance Incentive Plan (PIP) to each of the Named Executive Officers. The table below presents the number of shares subject to each of these awards:
 
 
Each stock option was granted with an exercise price equal to $33.26, the closing price of a share of Company common stock on February 3, 2010, and is scheduled to vest in annual installments over a four-year period. The RSUs are scheduled to vest on the third anniversary of the grant date and are payable upon vesting in shares of Company common stock on a one-for-one basis. The performance units will be eligible to vest based on the Companys total shareholder return (TSR) relative to an airline peer group provided by the Committees independent compensation consultant measured over the three-year period commencing January 1, 2010. The Companys performance will be ranked as compared to its peer group.  The percentage of the performance units that vest may range from 0% to 200%, depending on the Companys performance during that period. Vested performance units are payable in shares of Company common stock on a one-for-one basis.
 
In connection with certain grants, the Committee approved forms of agreements for use in evidencing the stock options and performance stock unit awards granted under the PIP. These forms are attached hereto as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2, respectively, and incorporated herein by reference.
 
Mr. Ayers grant is proportioned to bring his total direct compensation to the 50 percentile as compared to market, based on airline peer group information provided by the Committees independent compensation consultant.

      .  As used herein, the term stock unit shall mean a non-voting unit of measurement which is deemed for bookkeeping purposes to be equivalent to one outstanding share of the Corporations Common Stock (subject to adjustment as provided in Section 7.1 of the Plan) solely for purposes of the Plan and this Agreement.

      .
2.
Vesting
 
(a)      .  Subject to Sections 2(b) and 7 below, the Award shall vest and become nonforfeitable based on the achievement of the performance goals established by the Administrator and set forth on Exhibit A attached hereto for the Performance Period identified on the cover page of this Agreement.  The number of Stock Units that vest and become payable under this Agreement shall be determined based on the level of results or achievement of targets for each of the Performance Goals as set forth in Exhibit A.  Except as otherwise expressly provided in Exhibit A, in Section 2(b) and in Section 7(b), any Stock Units subject to the Award that do not vest on or before the last day of the Performance Period pursuant to such provisions shall terminate as of the last day of the Performance Period.
Performance-Based Vesting
 
(b)      .  Notwithstanding any other provision herein or in the Plan, the Award, to the extent then outstanding and not vested, shall become fully vested if (i) the Participants employment with the Corporation is terminated during the Performance Period by the Corporation without Cause or by the Participant for Good Reason, and (ii) such termination occurs at any time within the period commencing six (6) months before a Change of Control and ending twenty-four (24) months after such Change of Control (and in either case during the Performance Period).  (For these purposes, the terms Cause, Change of Control and Good Reason shall have the meanings ascribed to them in Exhibit B attached hereto.)  In the event that, upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, the Participant is entitled to accelerated vesting of the Award pursuant to this Section 2 in connection with a termination of the Participants employment prior to such Change of Control, the Award, to the extent it had not vested and was cancelled or otherwise terminated upon or prior to the date of such Change of Control solely as a result of such termination of employment, shall be reinstated (as though no such termination had occurred) and shall automatically become fully vested as of the date of the Change of Control (even if after the Performance Period but only if the termination of employment occurred during the Performance Period).
Possible Acceleration
 
      .  Except as expressly provided in Section 2(b) and 7(b), the vesting schedule requires continued employment or service through each applicable vesting date as a condition to the vesting of the applicable installment of the Award and the rights and benefits under this Agreement.  Employment or service for only a portion of the vesting period, even if a substantial portion, will not entitle the Participant to any proportionate vesting or avoid or mitigate a termination of rights and benefits upon or following a termination of employment or services as provided in Section 7(a) below or under the Plan.
3.
Continuance of Employment
 
Nothing contained in this Agreement or the Plan constitutes an employment or service commitment by the Corporation, affects the Participants status as an employee at will who is subject to termination without cause, confers upon the Participant any right to remain employed by or in service to the Corporation, interferes in any way with the right of the Corporation at any time to terminate such employment or services, or affects the right of the Corporation to increase or decrease the Participants

The Participant shall have no rights as a stockholder of the Corporation, no dividend rights and no voting rights, with respect to the Stock Units and any shares of Common Stock underlying or issuable in respect of such Stock Units until such shares of Common Stock are actually issued to and held of record by the Participant.  No adjustments will be made for dividends or other rights of a holder for which the record date is prior to the date of issuance of the stock certificate.
4.
Limitations on Rights Associated with Units

Neither the Award, nor any interest therein or amount or shares payable in respect thereof may be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise disposed of, alienated or encumbered, either voluntarily or involuntarily.

5.
Restrictions on Transfer

The Option shall vest and become exercisable in percentage installments of the aggregate number of shares subject to the Option as set forth on the cover page of this Option Agreement.  The Option may be exercised only to the extent the Option is vested and exercisable.

Exhibit 99.1
Investor Update  February 18, 2010
References in this update to Air Group, Company, we, us, and our refer to Alaska Air Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise specified.
This update includes forecasted operational and financial information for our subsidiaries Alaska Airlines, Inc. (Alaska) and Horizon Air Industries, Inc. (Horizon).  Our disclosure of operating cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel and other items, provides us (and may provide investors) with the ability to measure and monitor our performance without these items.  The most directly comparable GAAP measure is total operating expense per available seat mile.  However, due to the large fluctuations in fuel prices, we are unable to predict total operating expense for any future period with any degree of certainty. In addition, we believe the disclosure of fuel expense on an economic basis is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. Please see the cautionary statement under Forward-Looking Information.
We are providing unaudited information about fuel price movements and the impact of our hedging program on our financial results.  Management believes it is useful to compare results between periods on an economic basis. is defined as the raw or into-plane fuel cost less any cash we receive from hedge counterparties for hedges that settle during the period, offset by the recognition of premiums originally paid for those hedges that settle during the period.  Economic fuel expense more closely approximates the net cash outflow associated with purchasing fuel for our operation.

Forward-Looking Information
 
This update contains forward-looking statements subject to the safe harbor protection provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

For a comprehensive discussion of potential risk factors, see Item 1A of the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008 and revisions in Item 1A of the Companys Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2009.  Some of these risks include current economic conditions, increases in operating costs including fuel, competition, labor costs and relations, our significant indebtedness, inability to meet cost reduction goals, terrorist attacks, seasonal fluctuations in our financial results, an aircraft accident, laws and regulations, and government fees and taxes.  All of the forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the risk factors discussed therein. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risk factors emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict such new risk factors, nor can it assess the impact, if any, of such new risk factors on our business or events described in any forward-looking statements. We expressly disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date of this report to conform them to actual results.

Line-of-Business Information
In CPA arrangements, Horizon is  insulated from market revenue factors and is guaranteed contractual revenue amounts based on operational capacity.  As a result, yield and load factor information is not presented.  Horizon bears the revenue risk in its brand flying markets. Revenue from the Alaska CPA is eliminated in consolidation.  The actual passenger revenue generated on CPA flights is noted in the Alaska  Purchased Capacity section on page 3.

Future Fuel Hedge Positions*
*All of our future positions are call options, which are designed to effectively cap the cost of the crude oil component of our jet fuel purchases.  With call options, we benefit from a decline in crude oil prices, as there is no cash outlay other than the premiums we pay to enter into the contracts.
Additionally, we have used either fixed-price physical contracts or financial swaps to fix the refining margin component for approximately 50% and 31% of our first and second quarter 2010 estimated jet fuel purchases, respectively, at an average price of 23 cents per gallon.

Exhibit 99.1
 
Investor Update  March 9, 2010
References in this update to Air Group, Company, we, us, and our refer to Alaska Air Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise specified.
This update includes forecasted operational and financial information for our subsidiaries Alaska Airlines, Inc. (Alaska) and Horizon Air Industries, Inc. (Horizon).  Our disclosure of operating cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel and other items, provides us (and may provide investors) with the ability to measure and monitor our performance without these items.  The most directly comparable GAAP measure is total operating expense per available seat mile.  However, due to the large fluctuations in fuel prices, we are unable to predict total operating expense for any future period with any degree of certainty. In addition, we believe the disclosure of fuel expense on an economic basis is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. Please see the cautionary statement under Forward-Looking Information.
We are providing unaudited information about fuel price movements and the impact of our hedging program on our financial results.  Management believes it is useful to compare results between periods on an economic basis. is defined as the raw or into-plane fuel cost less any cash we receive from hedge counterparties for hedges that settle during the period, offset by the recognition of premiums originally paid for those hedges that settle during the period.  Economic fuel expense more closely approximates the net cash outflow associated with purchasing fuel for our operation.

Forward-Looking Information
 
This update contains forward-looking statements subject to the safe harbor protection provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements relate to future events and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual outcomes to be materially different from those indicated by any forward-looking statements.  For a comprehensive discussion of potential risk factors, see Item 1A of the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009.  Some of these risks include current economic conditions, increases in operating costs including fuel, competition, labor costs and relations, our significant indebtedness, inability to meet cost reduction goals, terrorist attacks, seasonal fluctuations in our financial results, an aircraft accident, laws and regulations, and government fees and taxes.  All of the forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the risk factors discussed therein. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risk factors emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict such new risk factors, nor can it assess the impact, if any, of such new risk factors on our business or events described in any forward-looking statements. We expressly disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date of this report to conform them to actual results. Over time, our actual results, performance or achievements will likely differ from the anticipated results, performance or achievements that are expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements, and such differences might be significant and materially adverse.

Horizons line-of-business traffic information for the first two months of 2010 is presented below.  Traffic and revenue information for January has also been repeated as the February revenue results are not yet final and are not being presented in this table.  In the CPA arrangement with Alaska, Horizon is insulated from market revenue factors and is guaranteed contractual revenue amounts based on operational capacity.  As a result, yield and load factor information is not presented.  Horizon bears the revenue risk in its brand flying markets. Revenue from the Alaska CPA is eliminated in consolidation.  The actual passenger revenue generated on CPA flights is noted in the Alaska  Purchased Capacity section on page 3.

First quarter highlights:
 
SEATTLE  Alaska Air Group, Inc. (NYSE: ALK) today reported first quarter 2010 net income of $5.3 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $19.2 million, or $0.53 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2009. Excluding mark-to-market fuel hedge losses of $12.5 million ($7.8 million after tax or $0.21 per diluted share), the company reported first quarter 2010 net income of $13.1 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $25.4 million, or $0.70 per diluted share, excluding special items in the first quarter of 2009.
 
 
 
 
 
Producing a profit in our seasonally weakest period is particularly noteworthy, said Bill Ayer, Alaska Air Groups chairman and chief executive officer. The last time we reported a significant first-quarter profit was in 1999.
 
Our results were driven by higher load factors, improving pricing trends and good cost management. Selective schedule reductions coupled with entry into new markets also contributed to our strong performance and provide a foundation for continued improvement.
 
Our operational results continue to be outstanding. For the most recent 12-month DOT reporting period, Alaska held the No. 1 spot in on-time performance among the 10 largest U.S. airlines. And recently, Horizon was ranked among the worlds top five airlines for 2009 on-time performance. I want to thank all our employees for running a safe, reliable operation and providing outstanding customer service.
 
The following table reconciles the companys adjusted net income and earnings per diluted share (EPS) during the first quarters of 2010 and 2009 to amounts as reported in accordance with GAAP (in millions except per-share amounts):
Financial and statistical data for Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air, as well as a reconciliation of the reported non-GAAP financial measures, can be found in the accompanying tables. A glossary of financial terms can be found at the end of this release.
 
A conference call regarding the first quarter results will be simulcast via the Internet at 8:30 a.m. Pacific time on Apr. 22, 2010. It can be accessed through the companys Web site at alaskaair.com/investors. For those unable to listen to the live broadcast, a replay will be available after the conclusion of the call at alaskaair.com/investors.

*Amounts exclude any proceeds from the sale of assets.
Firm Aircraft Commitments
 
The tables below reflect the current delivery schedules for firm aircraft as of March 31, 2010.
 
* One B737-800 delivery of the four has since been delivered.
In addition to the firm orders noted above, Alaska has options to acquire 40 additional B737-800s and Horizon has options to acquire 10 Q400s.
Projected Fleet Count
F=Freighter; C=Combination freighter/passenger
1
The expected fleet counts at December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012 are subject to change.
2
The planned CRJ fleet activity is subject to change and is dependent on our ability to remarket the CRJ aircraft.  If we are unable to dispose of the CRJ aircraft to coincide with the delivery of the Q400 aircraft, we plan to reduce the average utilization of Horizons fleet in order to maintain capacity plans.

Future Fuel Hedge Positions*
*All of our future positions are call options, which are designed to effectively cap the cost of the crude oil component of our jet fuel purchases.  With call options, we benefit from a decline in crude oil prices, as there is no cash outlay other than the premiums we pay to enter into the contracts.
Additionally, we have used either fixed-price physical contracts or financial swaps to fix the refining margin component for approximately 50%, 21%, and 2% of our second quarter, third quarter, and fourth quarter 2010 estimated jet fuel purchases, respectively, at an average price of 23 cents, 27 cents, and 30 cents per gallon, respectively.
Changes to Certain Fees
We announced today that we will begin charging $20 each for up to three checked bags.  This increases the current service charge for the first bag from $15, but decreases the charges for the second and third bags.  We also announced that we would reduce and simplify fees for unaccompanied minors and eliminate free same-day standby travel and courtesy holds on tickets purchased through Alaska/Horizon reservations or our websites. We expect these changes to provide incremental revenue of approximately $30 million annually.   These changes will be effective beginning June 16, 2010.
New Markets
Alaska recently announced daily non-stop service between San Diego and Puerto Vallarta, Mexico beginning in November 2010; daily non-stop service between San Diego and Maui beginning in October 2010; seasonal service four times weekly between Portland and Kona beginning in November; and daily non-stop service between Portland and Honolulu beginning in September 2010.  Horizon announced four daily non-stop flights between Los Angeles and San Jose, Cal. beginning in August 2010.
Termination of Pre-delivery Payment Facility
Effective April 16, 2010, the Company terminated its pre-delivery payment (PDP) facility.  This facility was used from time to time to fund a portion of the pre-delivery payments made to Boeing for future B737-800 aircraft deliveries.  No amounts were outstanding under the PDP facility at March 31, 2010.

Section 4.
 
.
Notice of Meetings
 
Except as otherwise provided by statute, notice of each meeting of stockholders shall be given not less than ten (10) and not more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting as of the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting.  Such notice shall state the place, if any (or the means of remote communication, if any, by which stockholders and proxyholders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at the meeting), date and hour of the meeting, the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting (if such date is different from the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting) and, in the case of a special meeting, the general nature of the business to be transacted (no business other than that specified in the notice may be transacted).

Section 5. 
Quorum.
 
At any meeting of stockholders, the holders of record of a majority of the total number of shares of outstanding stock of the corporation entitled to vote, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business except as otherwise provided by statute or the Certificate of Incorporation.
 
If a quorum is present at any meeting of stockholders, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the subject matter shall be the act of the stockholders, except as otherwise expressly provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, these Bylaws or applicable law. Each Director shall be elected by the vote of a majority of the votes cast with respect to the Directors election at any meeting of stockholders for the election of Directors at which a quorum is present, provided that if, as of the tenth (10) day preceding the date the notice of the meeting is first sent to the stockholders of the corporation, the number of nominees exceeds the number of Directors to be elected (a Contested Election), the Directors shall be elected by the vote of a plurality of the shares represented in person or by proxy at any such meeting and entitled to vote on the election of Directors. For purposes of clarity, it is stated that the provisions of the foregoing sentence do not apply to vacancies and newly created directorships filled by a vote of the Board of Directors under Section 2 of Article III of these Bylaws. For purposes of this Section 5, a majority of the votes cast means that the number of shares voted for a Directors election exceeds the number of votes cast against that Directors election (with abstentions and broker non-votes not counted as a vote cast either for or against that Directors election). In order for a nominee who already serves as a Director to become a nominee of the Board of Directors for further service on the Board of Directors, the Director shall have tendered, prior to the mailing of the proxy statement for the annual or special meeting at which he or she is to be nominated for election as a Director, an irrevocable resignation in accordance with Section 141(b) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the Delaware General Corporation Law) that is contingent on (i) that person not receiving a majority of the votes cast in an election that is not a Contested Election, and (ii) acceptance of that resignation by the Board of Directors in accordance with policies and procedures adopted by the Board of Directors for that purpose.  In the event a nominee who already serves as a Director fails to receive a majority of the votes cast in an election that is not a Contested Election, the Governance and Nominating Committee, or such other committee designated by the Board of Directors pursuant to these Bylaws, will make a recommendation to the Board of Directors on whether to accept or reject the resignation, or whether other action should be taken. The Board of Directors will act on the committees recommendation and publicly disclose its decision and the rationale behind it within ninety (90) days from the date of certification of the election results. The committee in making its recommendation and the Board of Directors in making its decision may each consider any factors and other information that they consider appropriate and relevant.  The Director who tenders his or her resignation will not participate in the Board of Directors decision with respect to whether to accept or reject his or her resignation. If the Board of Directors accepts a Directors resignation pursuant to this Section 5, or if a nominee for Director is not elected and the nominee does not already serve as a Director, then the Board of Directors may fill the resulting vacancy in accordance with the provisions of these Bylaws or may decrease the size of the Board of
th
Directors in accordance with the provisions of these Bylaws.  Directors shall hold office until the next annual meeting and until their successors shall be duly elected.

Except to the extent inconsistent with such rules and regulations as adopted by the Board of Directors, the chairman of any meeting of stockholders shall have the right and authority to convene and (for any or no reason) to adjourn the meeting, to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and to do all such acts as, in the judgment of such chairman, are appropriate for the proper conduct of the meeting. Such rules, regulations or procedures, whether adopted by the Board of Directors or prescribed by the chairman of the meeting, may include, without limitation, (i) establishing an agenda or order of business for the meeting, (ii) rules and procedures for maintaining order at the meeting and the safety of those present, (iii) limitations on participation in such meeting to stockholders of record of the corporation and their duly authorized and constituted proxies, and such other persons as the chairman will permit, (iv) restrictions on entry to the meeting after the time fixed for the commencement thereof, and (v) limitations on the time allotted to questions or comments by participants. The chairman of the meeting, in addition to making any other determinations that may be appropriate to the conduct of the meeting, shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that a matter or business was not properly brought before the meeting and, if the chairman should so determine, any such matter or business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted or considered.  Unless and to the extent determined by the Board of Directors or the chairman of the meeting, meetings of stockholders will not be required to be held in accordance with rules of parliamentary procedure.

Voting
 
The stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall be only persons in whose name shares stand on the stock records of the corporation on the record date for the
determination of stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting fixed in accordance with Section 3 of Article VI of these Bylaws.  Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation or as required by law, at each meeting of stockholders, each holder of shares entitled to vote at such meeting shall be entitled to one vote for each share of stock having voting power in respect of each matter upon which a vote is to be taken. Shares of its own capital stock belonging to the corporation, or to another corporation if a majority of the shares entitled to vote in the election of Directors of such other corporation is held by the corporation, shall neither be entitled to vote nor counted for quorum purposes.

The right to indemnification conferred in this Article VII shall be a contract right and, in accordance with and subject to the provisions of Section 2 of this Article VII, shall include the right to be paid by the corporation the expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition.

Advance of Expenses
 
The corporation will advance to any person eligible for indemnification pursuant to Section 1 of this Article VII, prior to the final disposition of the proceeding, all expenses reasonably incurred by any such person in connection with defending such proceeding, upon receipt of a request therefor; provided, however, that an advancement of expenses incurred by an indemnitee in his or her capacity as a Director or officer shall be made only upon delivery to the corporation of an undertaking (hereinafter an undertaking) by or on behalf of such indemnitee to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal that such indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under this Section 2 or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the obligation of the corporation to advance costs and expenses pursuant to this Section 2 shall be subject to the condition that, if, when and to the extent the corporation determines, at any time prior to the final disposition of the proceedings, that the indemnitee would not be permitted to be indemnified under applicable law, the corporation shall be entitled to be reimbursed, within thirty (30) days of such determination, by the indemnitee (who shall agree to reimburse the corporation as a condition to receipt of any such advances) for all such amounts theretofore paid; provided, however, that if the indemnitee has commenced or thereafter commences legal proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction to secure a determination that the indemnitee may be indemnified under applicable law, any determination made by the corporation that the indemnitee would not be permitted to be indemnified under applicable law shall not be binding and the indemnitee shall not be required to reimburse the corporation for any advance of costs or expenses until a final judicial determination is made with respect thereto (as to which all rights of appeal therefrom have been exhausted or lapsed).

If successful in whole or in part in any such suit, the indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting such suit. The indemnitee shall be presumed to be entitled to indemnification under this Article VII upon submission of a written claim (and, in an action brought to enforce a claim for advancement of expenses, where the required undertaking is required, has been tendered to the corporation), and thereafter the corporation shall have the burden of proof to overcome the presumption that the indemnitee is not so entitled. Neither the failure of the corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such suit that indemnification of the indemnitee is proper in the circumstances nor an actual determination by the corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification shall be a defense to the suit or create a presumption that the indemnitee is not so entitled.

The corporation may without further stockholder approval, enter into contracts with any indemnitee in furtherance of the provisions of this Article VII and may create a trust fund, grant a security interest or use other means (including, without limitation, a letter of credit) to ensure the payment of such amounts as may be necessary to effect indemnification as provided in this Article VII.

Exhibit 99.1
 
Investor Update  May 18, 2010
References in this update to Air Group, Company, we, us, and our refer to Alaska Air Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise specified.
This update includes forecasted operational and financial information for our subsidiaries Alaska Airlines, Inc. (Alaska) and Horizon Air Industries, Inc. (Horizon).  Our disclosure of operating cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel and other items, provides us (and may provide investors) with the ability to measure and monitor our performance without these items.  The most directly comparable GAAP measure is total operating expense per available seat mile.  However, due to the large fluctuations in fuel prices, we are unable to predict total operating expense for any future period with any degree of certainty. In addition, we believe the disclosure of fuel expense on an economic basis is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. Please see the cautionary statement under Forward-Looking Information.
We are providing unaudited information about fuel price movements and the impact of our hedging program on our financial results.  Management believes it is useful to compare results between periods on an economic basis. is defined as the raw or into-plane fuel cost less any cash we receive from hedge counterparties for hedges that settle during the period, offset by the recognition of premiums originally paid for those hedges that settle during the period.  Economic fuel expense more closely approximates the net cash outflow associated with purchasing fuel for our operation.

All of the forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the risk factors discussed therein. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risk factors emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict such new risk factors, nor can it assess the impact, if any, of such new risk factors on our business or events described in any forward-looking statements. We expressly disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date of this report to conform them to actual results. Over time, our actual results, performance or achievements will likely differ from the anticipated results, performance or achievements that are expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements, and such differences might be significant and materially adverse.

Alaska has Capacity Purchase Agreements (CPA) with Horizon for certain routes and with a third party for service between Anchorage and Dutch Harbor, AK.
April 2010 Statistics
The following data represents only the Horizon CPA flying as that flying represents approximately 95% of the total purchased capacity.

Line-of-Business Information
In CPA arrangements, Horizon is  insulated from market revenue factors and is guaranteed contractual revenue amounts based on operational capacity.  As a result, yield and load factor information is not presented.  Horizon bears the revenue risk in its brand flying markets. Revenue from the Alaska CPA is eliminated in consolidation.  The actual passenger revenue generated on CPA flights is noted in the Alaska  Purchased Capacity section on page 3.

Fleet Transition Charges in Second Quarter 2010
As previously disclosed, we may record fleet transition charges in the second quarter associated with the removal of one to three CRJ-700 aircraft from our operations through a sublease to a third-party carrier.  At this time, we expect the charge to be between $5 million and $15 million, depending on the number of aircraft that are subleased.  The forecast of cost per ASM above does not include the impact of these charges.

April 2010 Statistics
Forecast Information
* Statistics include Alaska mainline operations, Horizon brand flying, and CPA flying with Horizon only.
** Our forecasts of cost per ASM excluding fuel are based on forward-looking estimates, which will likely differ from actual results.
***Because of the volatility of fuel prices, actual amounts may differ significantly from our estimates.  Full-year estimates would not be meaningful at this time.
Nonoperating Expense
We expect that our consolidated nonoperating expense will be approximately $17 million to $18 million in the second quarter of 2010.
Share Repurchase
Through May 14, 2010, Air Group has repurchased 1,909,478 shares of its common stock for approximately $47.3 million under our existing $50 million repurchase program.  The program expires in June, although we expect to complete the program by the end of May.

Capital Expenditures
 
Total expected gross capital expenditures for 2010 are as follows (in millions):
 
*Amounts exclude any proceeds from the sale of assets.
Firm Aircraft Commitments
 
The tables below reflect the current delivery schedules for firm aircraft as of April 30, 2010.
 
In addition to the firm orders noted above, Alaska has options to acquire 40 additional B737-800s and Horizon has options to acquire 10 Q400s.
Projected Fleet Count
F=Freighter; C=Combination freighter/passenger

The expected fleet counts at December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012 are subject to change.
2
The planned CRJ fleet activity is subject to change and is dependent on our ability to remarket the CRJ aircraft.  If we are unable to dispose of the CRJ aircraft to coincide with the delivery of the Q400 aircraft, we plan to reduce the average utilization of Horizons fleet in order to maintain capacity plans.

Future Fuel Hedge Positions*
*All of our future positions are call options, which are designed to effectively cap the cost of the crude oil component of our jet fuel purchases.  With call options, we benefit from a decline in crude oil prices, as there is no cash outlay other than the premiums we pay to enter into the contracts.
Additionally, we have used either fixed-price physical contracts or financial swaps to fix the refining margin component for approximately 50%, 28%, and 2% of our second quarter, third quarter, and fourth quarter 2010 estimated jet fuel purchases, respectively, at an average price of 23 cents, 27 cents, and 30 cents per gallon, respectively.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
SEATTLE Alaska Air Group today announced several senior leadership changes at the company and its subsidiary Horizon Air: Jeff Pinneo is retiring from the role of president and CEO of Horizon Air, after eight years at the regional carriers helm and more than 28 years working at Horizon and sister carrier, Alaska Airlines. Glenn Johnson, formerly Alaska Air Groups chief financial officer and executive vice president of finance, was elected president of Horizon Air. Brandon Pedersen, previously Alaska Air Groups vice president of finance and controller, was elected chief financial officer of Alaska Air Group.
Pinneo will remain at Horizon Air for several months to aid in the transition.
Throughout his long career at Horizon and Alaska, Jeff has left an indelible mark on our customer offerings, marketing programs and, most of all, our people, said Bill Ayer, chairman and CEO of Alaska Air Group. Jeffs big heart and relentless focus on delivering the highest-quality service to customers are reflected throughout Horizons operations. Employees at both carriers have benefited greatly from his leadership and ideas.
During his term as Horizons president and CEO, Pinneo successfully steered the airline through some of the industrys most challenging years. Elected Horizons leader only a few months after Sept. 11, Pinneo oversaw substantial improvements in the carriers operational performance and customer satisfaction in the following years. This culminated in Air Transport World magazine honoring Horizon as Regional Airline of the Year in 2007 and Forbes.com ranking Horizon among the top five airlines worldwide in on-time performance in 2009.
 
 
 
To his new role as Horizons president, Johnson brings more than 28 years of experience at Alaska Air Group, including oversight of customer services, finance, strategy, project management, maintenance and engineering, information technology, and corporate real estate.
Glenn knows and respects Horizons employees and culture after 12 years there overseeing finance and then customer service, Ayer said. This experience, coupled with his extensive financial and operational background at both Horizon and Alaska, gives him the right perspective to position Horizon for new opportunities and long-term success. Johnson has announced his intent to launch a comprehensive review of Horizons market position, and fleet and financial performance.
Pedersen, a certified public accountant, joined Alaska Air Group in 2003, after a successful career in public accounting. In 2006, he was elected the companys vice president of finance and controller, with responsibility for accounting, payroll, tax, financial reporting and investor relations. In his new role as Alaska Air Groups chief financial officer, he adds oversight of information technology, treasury, procurement and project management.
A longtime and very capable leader in our finance organization, Brandon has helped us successfully weather this challenging economic environment, Ayer said. With his extensive background in accounting and reporting, exceptional communications skills, and commitment to achieving strong financial performance, he is well-prepared to take on this expanded role.
Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air, subsidiaries of Alaska Air Group (NYSE: ALK), together serve more than 90 cities through an expansive network in Alaska, the Lower 48, Hawaii, Canada and Mexico. Alaska Airlines ranked Highest in Customer Satisfaction Among Traditional Network Carriers in the J.D. Power and Associates 2008, 2009 and 2010 North America Airline Satisfaction Studies.

Exhibit 99.1
 
Investor Update  June 15, 2010
References in this update to Air Group, Company, we, us, and our refer to Alaska Air Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise specified.
This update includes forecasted operational and financial information for our subsidiaries Alaska Airlines, Inc. (Alaska) and Horizon Air Industries, Inc. (Horizon).  Our disclosure of operating cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel and other items, provides us (and may provide investors) with the ability to measure and monitor our performance without these items.  The most directly comparable GAAP measure is total operating expense per available seat mile.  However, due to the large fluctuations in fuel prices, we are unable to predict total operating expense for any future period with any degree of certainty. In addition, we believe the disclosure of fuel expense on an economic basis is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. Please see the cautionary statement under &# 8220;Forward-Looking Information.
We are providing unaudited information about fuel price movements and the impact of our hedging program on our financial results.  Management believes it is useful to compare results between periods on an economic basis. is defined as the raw or into-plane fuel cost less any cash we receive from hedge counterparties for hedges that settle during the period, offset by the recognition of premiums originally paid for those hedges that settle during the period.  Economic fuel expense more closely approximates the net cash outflow associated with purchasing fuel for our operation.
Economic fuel expense
Forward-Looking Information
 
This update contains forward-looking statements subject to the safe harbor protection provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements relate to future events and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual outcomes to be materially different from those indicated by any forward-looking statements.  For a comprehensive discussion of potential risk factors, see Item 1A of the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009.   Some of these risks include current economic conditions, increases in operating costs including fuel, competition, labor costs and relations, our significant indebtedness , inability to meet cost reduction goals, terrorist attacks, seasonal fluctuations in our financial results, an aircraft accident, laws and regulations, and government fees and taxes.  All of the forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the risk factors discussed therein. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risk factors emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict such new risk factors, nor can it assess the impact, if any, of such new risk factors on our business or events described in any forward-looking statements. We expressly disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date of this report to conform them to actual results. Over time, our actual results, performance or achievements will likely differ from the anticipated results, performance or achievements that are expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements, and such differences might be significant and material ly adverse.
 
 
 
 
May 2010 Statistics
*percentage of available seats occupied by fare-paying passengers
** RASM and Passenger RASM were favorably impacted by first bag fee revenue of approximately $6.3 million and $12.2 million for May 2010 and quarter-to-date, respectively (first bag fee was effective July 7, 2009).
Impact of 2009 revisions to our affinity card agreement on June comparisons
In June 2009, we recorded approximately $15 million of revenue in other-net revenue related to our renegotiated affinity card agreement.  Because the modified agreement was retroactive to January 1, 2009, roughly half of the $15 million benefit related to miles sold during the first quarter of 2009. As a result, the year-over-year RASM comparison in June 2010 will be negatively impacted.  There is no material impact on June year-over-year Passenger RASM (PRASM) comparisons.
Forecast Information
Changes in Advance Booked Load Factors (percentage of ASMs that are sold)*
* Percentage point change for advanced booked load factors compared to the same point in time last year.
 
 
 
 
Alaska has Capacity Purchase Agreements (CPA) with Horizon for certain routes and with a third party for service between Anchorage and Dutch Harbor, AK.
May 2010 Statistics
The following data represents only the Horizon CPA flying as that flying represents approximately 95% of the total purchased capacity.
 
* Percentage of available seats occupied by fare-paying passengers
** Passenger RASM was favorably impacted by first bag fee revenue of approximately $0.9 million and $1.9 million for May 2010 and quarter-to-date, respectively.
Forecast Information (Horizon CPA)
* Costs associated with the Horizon CPA agreement represent the amount paid by Alaska to Horizon for flights operated under that agreement and are eliminated in consolidation.
Changes in Advance Booked Load Factors (percentage of ASMs that are sold)*
* Percentage point change for advanced booked load factors compared to the same point in time last year.
 
 
 
*percentage of available seats occupied by fare-paying passengers
**RASM and Passenger RASM were favorably impacted by first bag fee revenue of approximately $1.4 million and $2.7 million for May 2010 and quarter-to-date, respectively.
Line-of-Business Information
In CPA arrangements, Alaska assumes the market revenue risk and pays Horizon an agreed-upon rate based on capacity.  As a result, yield and load factor information is not presented.  Horizon bears the revenue risk in its brand flying markets. Revenue from the Alaska CPA is eliminated in consolidation.  The actual passenger revenue generated on CPA flights is noted in the Alaska  Purchased Capacity section on page 3.
Horizons line-of-business traffic and revenue information is presented below.
 
April and May 2010
 
 
 
 
Forecast Information (includes brand and CPA flying)
* Capacity includes brand flying and CPA flying for Alaska.  Brand capacity is expected to decline approximately 2%  in both the second quarter and full-year of 2010, compared to the prior-year period.
** For Horizon, our forecast of cost per ASM excluding fuel and other items is based on forward-looking estimates, which will likely differ significantly from actual results.
*** Because of the volatility of fuel prices, actual amounts may differ significantly from our estimates.  Our economic fuel cost per gallon estimate for the second quarter includes the following per-gallon assumptions:    crude oil cost  $1.90 ($80 per barrel); refining margin  32 cents; taxes and fees  18 cents; benefit of settled hedges  7 cents.  Full-year estimates would not be meaningful at this time.
Changes in Advance Booked Load Factors  Brand Flying (percentage of ASMs that are sold)*
* Percentage point change for advanced booked load factors compared to the same point in time last year.
Special Charges in Second Quarter 2010
We expect to record fleet transition charges of approximately $3.5 million in the second quarter of 2010 associated with the removal of one CRJ-700 aircraft from our operations through a sublease to a third-party carrier.  We will likely record additional transition charges as more CRJ aircraft are removed from the fleet in future quarters. However the timing and amount of any further charges cannot be estimated at this time.
The forecast of cost per ASM above excludes the impact of the second quarter CRJ transition charges. Consistent with our past practice, CRJ fleet transition charges will be excluded from our adjusted net income and earnings-per-share information.
 
 
 
 
May 2010 Statistics
Forecast Information
* Statistics include Alaska mainline operations, Horizon brand flying, and CPA flying with Horizon only.
** Our forecasts of cost per ASM excluding fuel are based on forward-looking estimates, which will likely differ from actual results.
***Because of the volatility of fuel prices, actual amounts may differ significantly from our estimates.  Full-year estimates would not be meaningful at this time.
Nonoperating Expense
We expect that our consolidated nonoperating expense will be approximately $17 million to $18 million in the second quarter of 2010.
Share Repurchase
 Air Group recently completed its $50 million share repurchase program.  Under the program, we repurchased 1,970,326 shares of common stock.
On June 10, 2010, the Air Group Board of Directors authorized a new $50 million repurchase program.  This program will expire in June 2011.  No purchases have been made under this program as of the date of this Investor Update.
Cash and Share Count
 
 
 
 
Capital Expenditures
 
Total expected gross capital expenditures for 2010 are as follows (in millions):
 
*Amounts exclude any proceeds from the sale of assets.
Firm Aircraft Commitments
 
The tables below reflect the current delivery schedules for firm aircraft as of May 31, 2010.
 
In addition to the firm orders noted above, Alaska has options to acquire 40 additional B737-800s and Horizon has options to acquire 10 Q400s.
Projected Fleet Count
F=Freighter; C=Combination freighter/passenger
1
The expected fleet counts at December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012 are subject to change.
2
The planned CRJ fleet activity is subject to change and is dependent on our ability to remarket the CRJ aircraft.  If we are unable to dispose of the CRJ aircraft to coincide with the delivery of the Q400 aircraft, we plan to reduce the average utilization of Horizons fleet in order to maintain capacity plans.
3
 
 
 
 
Future Fuel Hedge Positions*
*All of our future positions are call options, which are designed to effectively cap the cost of the crude oil component of our jet fuel purchases.  With call options, we benefit from a decline in crude oil prices, as there is no cash outlay other than the premiums we pay to enter into the contracts.
Additionally, we have used either fixed-price physical contracts or financial swaps to fix the refining margin component for approximately 50%, 36%, and 2% of our second quarter, third quarter, and fourth quarter 2010 estimated jet fuel purchases, respectively, at an average price of 23 cents, 28 cents, and 30 cents per gallon, respectively.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Second quarter highlights:
 
SEATTLE  Alaska Air Group, Inc. (NYSE: ALK) today reported second quarter 2010 net income of $58.6 million, or $1.60 per diluted share, compared to net income of $29.1 million, or $0.79 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2009. Excluding mark-to-market fuel hedge losses of
$37.6 million ($23.3 million after tax or $0.63 per diluted share) and CRJ-700 transition charges of
$3.4 million ($2.1 million after tax or $0.06 per diluted share), the company reported net income of $84.0 million, or $2.29 per diluted share, compared to net income of $26.5 million, or $0.72 per share, excluding special items in the second quarter of 2009.
 
 
 
 
 
Our second quarter adjusted net earnings represent the best quarterly profit in our history. The results were driven by strong revenues and good cost control, partially offset by higher fuel costs," said Bill Ayer, chairman and chief executive officer. Thanks to the employees at Alaska and Horizon, our reliability and customer service continue to be outstanding. Alaska has held the No. 1 spot in DOT on-time performance among the 10 largest U.S. airlines for 13 of the last 14 months. And for the third year in a row, J.D. Power and Associates named Alaska Airlines highest in customer satisfaction among traditional network carriers in North America.
 
The following table reconciles the companys adjusted net income and earnings per diluted share (EPS) during the second quarters of 2010 and 2009 to amounts as reported in accordance with GAAP (in millions except per-share amounts):
Financial and statistical data for Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air, as well as a reconciliation of the reported non-GAAP financial measures, can be found in the accompanying tables. A glossary of financial terms can be found on page 4 of this release.
A conference call regarding the second quarter 2010 results will be simulcast via the Internet at 8:30 a.m. Pacific time on July 22, 2010. It can be accessed through the companys Web site at alaskaair.com/investors.

Investor Update  July 22, 2010
References in this update to Air Group, Company, we, us, and our refer to Alaska Air Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise specified.
This update includes actual second quarter 2010 consolidated statistical information and forecasted operational and financial information for our subsidiaries Alaska Airlines, Inc. (Alaska) and Horizon Air Industries, Inc. (Horizon).  Our disclosure of operating cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel and other items, provides us (and may provide investors) with the ability to measure and monitor our performance without these items.  The most directly comparable GAAP measure is total operating expense per available seat mile.  However, due to the large fluctuations in fuel prices, we are unable to predict total operating expense for any future period with any degree of certainty. In addition, we believe the disclosure of fuel expense on an economic basis is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing o perational performance. Please see the cautionary statement under Forward-Looking Information.
Please see our press release dated today for actual financial and statistical information for the second quarter of 2010.
Forward-Looking Information
 
This update contains forward-looking statements subject to the safe harbor protection provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

For a comprehensive discussion of potential risk factors, see Item 1A of the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009.   Some of these risks include current economic conditions, increases in operating costs including fuel, competition, labor costs and relations, our significant indebtedness , inability to meet cost reduction goals, terrorist attacks, seasonal fluctuations in our financial results, an aircraft accident, laws and regulations, and government fees and taxes.

Forecast Information
* For Alaska, our forecasts of mainline cost per ASM excluding fuel are based on forward-looking estimates, which will likely differ from actual results.
** Because of the volatility of fuel prices, actual amounts may differ significantly from our estimates. Our economic fuel cost per gallon estimate for the second quarter includes the following per-gallon assumptions:  crude oil cost  $1.92 ($80 per barrel); refining margin  32 cents; taxes and fees  15 cents; cost of settled hedges  4 cents.  Full-year estimates would not be meaningful at this time.
Changes in Advance Booked Load Factors (percentage of ASMs that are sold)*
* Percentage point change compared to the same point in time last year.
Alaska has Capacity Purchase Agreements (CPA) with Horizon for certain routes and with a third party for service between Anchorage and Dutch Harbor, AK.
Forecast Information (Horizon CPA)
* Costs associated with the Horizon CPA agreement represent the amount paid by Alaska to Horizon for operating costs plus a specified profit margin and are eliminated in consolidation.
Changes in Advance Booked Load Factors (percentage of ASMs that are sold)*
* Percentage point change compared to the same point in time last year.

Forecast Information (includes brand and CPA flying)
* Capacity includes brand flying and CPA flying for Alaska.  Brand capacity is expected to decline approximately 5% and 7% in the third quarter and full-year of 2010, respectively, compared to the prior-year period.
** For Horizon, our forecast of cost per ASM excluding fuel and other items is based on forward-looking estimates, which will likely differ significantly from actual results.
*** Because of the volatility of fuel prices, actual amounts may differ significantly from our estimates.  Our economic fuel cost per gallon estimate for the second quarter includes the following per-gallon assumptions:    crude oil cost  $1.92 ($80 per barrel); refining margin  32 cents; taxes and fees  19 cents; cost of settled hedges  4 cents.  Full-year estimates would not be meaningful at this time.
Changes in Advance Booked Load Factors  Brand Flying (percentage of ASMs that are sold)*
* Percentage point change compared to the same point in time last year.
Fleet Transition Charges in Third Quarter 2010
We expect to record fleet transition charges in the third quarter associated with the removal of four CRJ-700 aircraft from our operations through either sublease or lease assignment to a third-party carrier.  At this time, we expect the charge to be between $7 million and $9 million.  The forecast of cost per ASM above does not include these charges.
Other Horizon Changes
We are working to improve Horizon's profitability. A number of alternatives and strategies are being considered, including:
Many of these activities or strategies could result in additional costs in the coming quarters related to disposing of the CRJ aircraft, employee furloughs or other events.  These costs cannot be reasonably estimated at this time, except as noted above.

Actual Second Quarter 2010 Statistics
Forecast Information
* Statistics include Alaska mainline operations, Horizon brand flying, and CPA flying with Horizon only.
Fuel Price Sensitivity
Given our current fuel-hedge portfolio, the following table depicts the sensitivity of fuel prices under various crude oil and refining margin prices for the remainder of 2010:
Nonoperating Expense
We expect that our consolidated nonoperating expense will be approximately $17 million to $18 million in the third quarter of 2010.
Share Repurchase
On June 10, 2010, the Air Group Board of Directors authorized a new $50 million repurchase program.  This program will expire in June 2011.  No purchases have been made under this program as of the date of this Investor Update.

Capital Expenditures
 
Total expected gross capital expenditures for 2010 are as follows (in millions):
 
*Amounts exclude any proceeds from the sale of assets.
Firm Aircraft Commitments
 
The tables below reflect the current delivery schedules for firm aircraft as of June 30, 2010.
 
In June, Alaska converted two options for B737-800 aircraft into firm orders to be delivered in 2012.  These orders are included in the table above.  In addition to the firm orders noted above, Alaska has options to acquire 38 additional B737-800s and Horizon has options to acquire 10 Q400s.
Projected Fleet Count
F=Freighter; C=Combination freighter/passenger

The expected fleet counts at December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012 are subject to change.
2
The planned CRJ fleet activity is subject to change and is dependent on our ability to remarket the CRJ aircraft.

Future Fuel Hedge Positions*
*All of our future positions are call options, which are designed to effectively cap the cost of the crude oil component of our jet fuel purchases.  With call options, we benefit from a decline in crude oil prices, as there is no cash outlay other than the premiums we pay to enter into the contracts.
Additionally, we have used either fixed-price physical contracts or financial swaps to fix the refining margin component for approximately 50% and 10% of our third quarter and fourth quarter 2010 estimated jet fuel purchases, respectively, at an average price of 30 cents and 31 cents per gallon, respectively.

Exhibit 99.1
 
Investor Update  August 19, 2010
References in this update to Air Group, Company, we, us, and our refer to Alaska Air Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise specified.
This update includes forecasted operational and financial information for our subsidiaries Alaska Airlines, Inc. (Alaska) and Horizon Air Industries, Inc. (Horizon).  Our disclosure of operating cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel and other items, provides us (and may provide investors) with the ability to measure and monitor our performance without these items.  The most directly comparable GAAP measure is total operating expense per available seat mile.  However, due to the large fluctuations in fuel prices, we are unable to predict total operating expense for any future period with any degree of certainty. In addition, we believe the disclosure of fuel expense on an economic basis is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. Please see the cautionary statement under &# 8220;Forward-Looking Information.
We are providing unaudited information about fuel price movements and the impact of our hedging program on our financial results.  Management believes it is useful to compare results between periods on an economic basis. is defined as the raw or into-plane fuel cost less any cash we receive from hedge counterparties for hedges that settle during the period, offset by the recognition of premiums originally paid for those hedges that settle during the period.  Economic fuel expense more closely approximates the net cash outflow associated with purchasing fuel for our operation.

**Alaska annualized the first bag service charge on July 7, 2010.  All else equal, year-over-year unit revenue growth will be more modest than it had been prior to reaching the anniversary date of the first bag service charge implementation.
Forecast Information
* For Alaska, our forecasts of mainline cost per ASM excluding fuel are based on forward-looking estimates, which will likely differ from actual results.
** Because of the volatility of fuel prices, actual amounts may differ significantly from our estimates. Our economic fuel cost per gallon estimate for the third quarter includes the following per-gallon assumptions:  crude oil cost  $1.92 ($80 per barrel); refining margin  32 cents; taxes and fees  15 cents; cost of settled hedges  4 cents.  Full-year estimates would not be meaningful at this time.

Line-of-Business Information
In CPA arrangements, Alaska assumes the market revenue risk and pays Horizon an agreed-upon rate based on capacity.  As a result, yield and load factor information is not presented.  Horizon bears the revenue risk in its brand flying markets. Revenue from the Alaska CPA is eliminated in consolidation.  The actual passenger revenue generated on CPA flights is noted in the Alaska  Purchased Capacity section on page 3.

Fleet Transition Charges in Third Quarter 2010
As previously disclosed, we expect to record fleet transition charges in the third quarter associated with the removal of four CRJ-700 aircraft from our operations through lease assignment to a third-party carrier.  At this time, we expect the charge to be between $6 million and $8 million.  The forecast of cost per ASM above does not include these charges.
Horizon Changes
Aircraft Maintenance
We previously announced our decision to outsource the heavy maintenance functions for Horizon Q-400 aircraft.  Heavy maintenance for the CRJ-700 aircraft is already being provided by an outside vendor.  We believe this change will result in approximately $3 million in cost savings annually.  As a result of this decision, we will be eliminating a number of positions in the maintenance division through either early-out packages or voluntary and involuntary furloughs.  We believe these actions will result in an estimated third-quarter charge of less than $3 million.  The forecast of cost per ASM above does not include this charge.
All-CPA Structure
Effective January 1, 2011, Horizon will shift to a model whereby all of its flying will be performed on behalf of Alaska Airlines under a capacity purchase agreement (CPA).  Currently, Horizon operates approximately 43% of its schedule as CPA flying for Alaska.  We believe this change in structure will align Horizon with other regional carriers in the industry and will remove complexity and duplication between Horizon and Alaska.  We are currently working on structure and financial presentation and expect to have more information in the coming months.  This change will have no financial impact to Air Group as any payments between Alaska and Horizon will be eliminated in consolidation.

Nonoperating Expense
We expect that our consolidated nonoperating expense will be approximately $17 million to $18 million in the third quarter of 2010.
Share Repurchase
Through August 17, 2010, Air Group has repurchased 34,000 shares of its common stock for approximately $1.8 million under our existing $50 million repurchase program.  The program expires in June 2011.

Exhibit 99.1
Investor Update  September 14, 2010
References in this update to Air Group, Company, we, us, and our refer to Alaska Air Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise specified.
This update includes forecasted operational and financial information for our subsidiaries Alaska Airlines, Inc. (Alaska) and Horizon Air Industries, Inc. (Horizon).  Our disclosure of operating cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel and other items, provides us (and may provide investors) with the ability to measure and monitor our performance without these items.  The most directly comparable GAAP measure is total operating expense per available seat mile.  However, due to the volatility of fuel prices, we are unable to predict total operating expense for any future period with any degree of certainty. In addition, we believe the disclosure of fuel expense on an economic basis is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. Please see the cautionary statement under For ward-Looking Information.
We are providing unaudited information about fuel price movements and the impact of our hedging program on our financial results.  Management believes it is useful to compare results between periods on an economic basis. is defined as the raw or into-plane fuel cost less any cash we receive from hedge counterparties for hedges that settle during the period, offset by the recognition of premiums originally paid for those hedges that settle during the period.  Economic fuel expense more closely approximates the net cash outflow associated with purchasing fuel for our operation.

Forward-Looking Information
 
This update contains forward-looking statements subject to the safe harbor protection provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements relate to future events and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual outcomes to be materially different from those indicated by any forward-looking statements.  For a comprehensive discussion of potential risk factors, see Item 1A of the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009.   Some of these risks include current economic conditions, increases in operating costs including fuel, competition, labor costs and relations, our significant indebtedness , inability to meet cost reduction goals, terrorist attacks, seasonal fluctuations in our financial results, an aircraft accident, laws and regulations, and government fees and taxes.  All of the forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the risk factors discussed therein. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risk factors emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict such new risk factors, nor can it assess the impact, if any, of such new risk factors on our business or events described in any forward-looking statements. We expressly disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date of this report to conform them to actual results. Over time, our actual results, performance or achievements will likely differ from the anticipated results, performance or achievements that are expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements, and such differences might be significant and material ly adverse.
 
 
 
 
August 2010 Statistics
*percentage of available seats occupied by fare-paying passengers
Comparison to 2008  2010 Compared to 2008
In 2009, Alaska's mainline PRASM declines were much more modest than the average of the domestic airline industry. We believe this outperformance in 2009 can be attributed to our lower exposure to business and international traffic, the timing of our introduction of the first bag fee, and the extensive changes we made to our network.  As a result, our 2010 vs. 2009 PRASM increases have been smaller than those experienced in the domestic industry because we are starting from a higher base.
Some investors believe that it is useful to compare 2010 unit revenues to the same period in 2008. The following table presents the changes in PRASM from 2008 for Alaska mainline performance and the industry:
*Air Transport Association (ATA) domestic PRASM, excluding Alaska
Forecast Information
* For Alaska, our forecasts of mainline cost per ASM excluding fuel are based on forward-looking estimates, which will likely differ from actual results.
** Because of the volatility of fuel prices, actual amounts may differ significantly from our estimates. Our economic fuel cost per gallon estimate for the third quarter includes the following per-gallon assumptions:  crude oil cost  $1.88 ($79 per barrel); refining margin  31 cents; taxes and fees  15 cents; cost of settled hedges  4 cents.  Full-year estimates would not be meaningful at this time.
Changes in Advance Booked Load Factors (percentage of available seat miles that are sold)
* Percentage point change compared to the same point in time last year.

Alaska has Capacity Purchase Agreements (CPA) with Horizon for certain routes and with a third party for service between Anchorage and Dutch Harbor, AK.
August 2010 Statistics
The following data represents only the Horizon CPA flying as that flying represents approximately 95% of the total purchased capacity.
* Percentage of available seats occupied by fare-paying passengers
** Purchased capacity PRASM of 24.69 cents for August 2010 was 12.4% higher than the 21.97 cents reported in August 2008.
Forecast Information (Horizon CPA)
* Costs associated with the Horizon CPA agreement represent the amount paid by Alaska to Horizon for flights operated under that agreement and are eliminated in consolidation.
Changes in Advance Booked Load Factors (percentage of ASMs that are sold)
* Percentage point change compared to the same point in time last year.

*percentage of available seats occupied by fare-paying passengers
** Horizon brand flying PRASM of 24.00 cents for August 2010 was 12.1% higher than the 21.40 cents reported in August 2008.
Line-of-Business Information
In CPA arrangements, Alaska assumes the market revenue risk and pays Horizon an agreed-upon rate based on capacity.  As a result, yield and load factor information is not presented.  Horizon bears the revenue risk in its brand flying markets. Revenue from the Alaska CPA is eliminated in consolidation.  The actual passenger revenue generated on CPA flights is noted in the Alaska  Purchased Capacity section on page 3.
Horizons line-of-business traffic and revenue information is presented below.

Forecast Information (includes brand and CPA flying)
* Capacity includes brand flying and CPA flying for Alaska.  Brand capacity is expected to decline approximately 4% and 7% in the third quarter and full-year of 2010, respectively, compared to the prior-year period.
** For Horizon, our forecast of cost per ASM excluding fuel and other items is based on forward-looking estimates, which will likely differ significantly from actual results.
*** Because of the volatility of fuel prices, actual amounts may differ significantly from our estimates.  Our economic fuel cost per gallon estimate for the third quarter includes the following per-gallon assumptions:    crude oil cost  $1.88 ($79 per barrel); refining margin  31 cents; taxes and fees  19 cents; cost of settled hedges  4 cents.  Full-year estimates would not be meaningful at this time.
Changes in Advance Booked Load Factors  Brand Flying (percentage of ASMs that are sold)*
* Percentage point change compared to the same point in time last year.
Fleet Transition Charges in Third Quarter 2010
As previously disclosed, we expect to record fleet transition charges in the third quarter associated with the removal of four CRJ-700 aircraft from our operations through lease assignment to a third-party carrier.  At this time, we expect the charge to be approximately $7 million.  The forecast of cost per ASM above does not include these charges.
Horizon Changes
Aircraft Maintenance
We previously announced our decision to outsource the heavy maintenance functions for Horizon Q400 aircraft.  We believe this change will result in approximately $3 million in cost savings annually.  Heavy maintenance for the CRJ-700 aircraft is already being provided by an outside vendor.  As a result of this decision, we have eliminated a number of positions in the maintenance division through either early-out packages or voluntary furloughs.  We believe these actions will result in an estimated third-quarter charge of approximately $3 million.  The forecast of cost per ASM above does not include this charge.
All-CPA Structure
As previously announced, effective January 1, 2011, Horizon will shift to a model whereby all of its flying will be performed on behalf of Alaska Airlines under a capacity purchase agreement (CPA).  Currently, Horizon operates approximately 43% of its schedule as CPA flying for Alaska.  We believe this change in structure will align Horizon with other regional carriers in the industry and will remove complexity and duplication between Horizon and Alaska.  We are currently working on structure and financial presentation and expect to have more information in the coming months.  This change will have no financial impact to consolidated results as any payments between Alaska and Horizon will be eliminated in consolidation.

August 2010 Statistics
* Statistics include Alaska mainline operations, Horizon brand flying, and CPA flying with Horizon only.  Revenue metrics include revenue from third-party CPA flying, but not the corresponding capacity, which is nominal.
** Consolidated PRASM of 13.64 cents for August 2010 was 0.9% lower than the 13.76 cents reported in August 2008.
Forecast Information
* Statistics include Alaska mainline operations, Horizon brand flying, and CPA flying with Horizon only.
** Our forecasts of cost per ASM excluding fuel are based on forward-looking estimates, which will likely differ from actual results.
***Because of the volatility of fuel prices, actual amounts may differ significantly from our estimates.  Full-year estimates would not be meaningful at this time.
Nonoperating Expense
We expect that our consolidated nonoperating expense will be approximately $17 million in the third quarter of 2010.
Share Repurchase
Through September 13, 2010, Air Group has repurchased 82,000 shares of its common stock for approximately $4.0 million under our existing $50 million repurchase program that began in June 2010.  The program expires in June 2011.
Cash and Share Count

Capital Expenditures
 
Total expected gross capital expenditures for 2010 are as follows (in millions):
 
*Amounts exclude any proceeds from the sale of assets.
Firm Aircraft Commitments
 
The tables below reflect the current delivery schedules for firm aircraft as of August 31, 2010.
 
In addition to the firm orders noted above, Alaska has options to acquire 38 B737-800s and Horizon has options to acquire 10 Q400s.
Projected Fleet Count
F=Freighter; C=Combination freighter/passenger
1
The expected fleet counts at December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012 are subject to change and are highly dependent on our ability to remarket the CRJ aircraft.

7
 
Future Fuel Hedge Positions*
*All of our future positions are call options, which are designed to effectively cap the cost of the crude oil component of our jet fuel purchases.  With call options, we benefit from a decline in crude oil prices, as there is no cash outlay other than the premiums we pay to enter into the contracts.
Additionally, we have used either fixed-price physical contracts or financial swaps to fix the refining margin component for approximately 50% and 45% of our third quarter and fourth quarter 2010 estimated jet fuel purchases at average prices of 30 cents per gallon and 29 cents per gallon, respectively, and 3% of our first quarter 2011 estimated purchases at an average price of 28 cents per gallon.

Exhibit 99.2
Investor Update  October 21, 2010
References in this update to Air Group, Company, we, us, and our refer to Alaska Air Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise specified.
This update includes actual third quarter 2010 consolidated statistical information and forecasted operational and financial information for our subsidiaries Alaska Airlines, Inc. (Alaska) and Horizon Air Industries, Inc. (Horizon).  Our disclosure of operating cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel and other items, provides us (and may provide investors) with the ability to measure and monitor our performance without these items.  The most directly comparable GAAP measure is total operating expense per available seat mile.  However, due to the large fluctuations in fuel prices, we are unable to predict total operating expense for any future period with any degree of certainty. In addition, we believe the disclosure of fuel expense on an economic basis is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing op erational performance. Please see the cautionary statement under Forward-Looking Information.
Please see our press release dated today for actual financial and statistical information for the third quarter of 2010.
Forward-Looking Information
 
This update contains forward-looking statements subject to the safe harbor protection provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements relate to future events and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual outcomes to be materially different from those indicated by any forward-looking statements.  For a comprehensive discussion of potential risk factors, see Item 1A of the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009.   Some of these risks include current economic conditions, increases in operating costs including fuel, competition, labor costs and relations, our significant indebtedness , inability to meet cost reduction goals, terrorist attacks, seasonal fluctuations in our financial results, an aircraft accident, laws and regulations, and government fees and taxes.  All of the forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the risk factors discussed therein. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risk factors emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict such new risk factors, nor can it assess the impact, if any, of such new risk factors on our business or events described in any forward-looking statements. We expressly disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date of this report to conform them to actual results. Over time, our actual results, performance or achievements will likely differ from the anticipated results, performance or achievements that are expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements, and such differences might be significant and material ly adverse.
 
 
 
 
Forecast Information
* For Alaska, our forecasts of mainline cost per ASM excluding fuel are based on forward-looking estimates, which will likely differ from actual results.
** Because of the volatility of fuel prices, actual amounts may differ significantly from our estimates. Our economic fuel cost per gallon estimate for the fourth quarter includes the following per-gallon assumptions:  crude oil cost  $1.98 ($83 per barrel); refining margin  38 cents; taxes and fees  15 cents; cost of settled hedges  1 cent.
Changes in Advance Booked Load Factors (percentage of ASMs that are sold)*
* Percentage point change compared to the same point in time last year.
Alaska has Capacity Purchase Agreements (CPA) with Horizon for certain routes and with a third party for service between Anchorage and Dutch Harbor, AK.
Forecast Information (Horizon CPA)
* Costs associated with the Horizon CPA agreement represent the amount paid by Alaska to Horizon for operating costs plus a specified profit margin and are eliminated in consolidation.
Changes in Advance Booked Load Factors (percentage of ASMs that are sold)*
* Percentage point change compared to the same point in time last year.

Forecast Information (includes brand and CPA flying)
* Capacity includes brand flying and CPA flying for Alaska.  Brand capacity is expected to decline approximately 12% and 7% in the fourth quarter and full-year of 2010, respectively, compared to the prior-year period.
** For Horizon, our forecast of cost per ASM excluding fuel and other items is based on forward-looking estimates, which will likely differ significantly from actual results.
*** Because of the volatility of fuel prices, actual amounts may differ significantly from our estimates.  Our economic fuel cost per gallon estimate for the fourth quarter includes the following per-gallon assumptions:    crude oil cost  $1.98 ($83 per barrel); refining margin  38 cents; taxes and fees  19 cents; cost of settled hedges 2 cents.
Changes in Advance Booked Load Factors  Brand Flying (percentage of ASMs that are sold)*
* Percentage point change compared to the same point in time last year.
Pilot Tentative Agreement
Horizon and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT), representing Horizons pilots, have reached a tentative agreement on a new collective bargaining agreement.  The IBT has indicated that Horizons pilots will hold a ratification vote in November 2010.

Actual Third Quarter 2010 Statistics
* Statistics include Alaska mainline operations, Horizon brand flying, and all CPA flying.
Forecast Information
Capacity forecast includes Alaska mainline operations, Horizon brand flying, and CPA flying with Horizon only.
(a)
Our forecasted CASM amounts are based on consolidated costs per ASM using total ASMs, which include Alaska mainline operations, Horizon brand flying, and all CPA flying.  Capacity for third-party CPA flying is expected to be approximately 15 million ASMs and 65 million ASMs for the fourth quarter and full-year 2010, respectively.
(b)
Our forecast of cost per ASM excluding fuel is based on forward-looking estimates, which may differ from actual results.
(c)
Because of the volatility of fuel prices, actual amounts may differ significantly from our estimates.
(d)
Fuel Price Sensitivity
Given our current fuel-hedge portfolio, the following table depicts the sensitivity of fuel prices under various crude oil and refining margin prices for the remainder of 2010:
Nonoperating Expense
We expect that our consolidated nonoperating expense will be approximately $20 million in the fourth quarter of 2010.
 
4
 
Capital Expenditures
 
Total expected gross capital expenditures for 2010 are as follows (in millions):
 
*Amounts exclude any proceeds from the sale of assets.
The increase in anticipated aircraft capital expenditures in 2010 is due an increase in advance aircraft purchase deposits because of the likely acceleration of Q400 aircraft deliveries from 2012 and 2013 into 2011.  See further discussion below.
Firm Aircraft Commitments
 
The tables below reflect the current delivery schedules for firm aircraft as of September 30, 2010.
 
*Horizon is working on an agreement to dispose of eight CRJ-700 aircraft in the first half of 2011 through either sublease or lease assignment to a third-party carrier.  If we are able to do this, we intend to accelerate the delivery of the eight remaining Q400 aircraft on order to 2011 to coincide with the anticipated exit dates of the CRJ-700 aircraft.
In addition to the firm orders noted above, Alaska has options to acquire 38 additional B737-800s and Horizon has options to acquire 10 Q400s.
Projected Fleet Count

The expected fleet counts at December 31, 2011 and 2012 are subject to change.

We are currently working on an agreement to dispose of eight CRJ-700 aircraft in 2011.

Future Fuel Hedge Positions*
*All of our future positions are call options, which are designed to effectively cap the cost of the crude oil component of our jet fuel purchases.  With call options, we benefit from a decline in crude oil prices, as there is no cash outlay other than the premiums we pay to enter into the contracts.
Additionally, we have used either fixed-price physical contracts or financial swaps to fix the refining margin component for approximately 50% fourth quarter 2010 estimated jet fuel purchases at an average price of 30 cents per gallon and 15% of our first quarter 2011 estimated purchases at an average price of 34 cents per gallon.

Exhibit 99.1
 
Investor Update  November 16, 2010
References in this update to Air Group, Company, we, us, and our refer to Alaska Air Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise specified.
This update includes forecasted operational and financial information for our subsidiaries Alaska Airlines, Inc. (Alaska) and Horizon Air Industries, Inc. (Horizon).  Our disclosure of operating cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel and other items, provides us (and may provide investors) with the ability to measure and monitor our performance without these items.  The most directly comparable GAAP measure is total operating expense per available seat mile.  However, due to the large fluctuations in fuel prices, we are unable to predict total operating expense for any future period with any degree of certainty. In addition, we believe the disclosure of fuel expense on an economic basis is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. Please see the cautionary statement under &# 8220;Forward-Looking Information.
We are providing unaudited information about fuel price movements and the impact of our hedging program on our financial results.  Management believes it is useful to compare results between periods on an economic basis. is defined as the raw or into-plane fuel cost less any cash we receive from hedge counterparties for hedges that settle during the period, offset by the recognition of premiums originally paid for those hedges that settle during the period.  Economic fuel expense more closely approximates the net cash outflow associated with purchasing fuel for our operation.

Mechanics Tentative Agreement
Horizon and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT), representing Horizons aircraft technicians, have reached a tentative agreement on a new collective bargaining agreement.  A ratification vote is in progress.

Forecast Information
Nonoperating Expense
We expect that our consolidated nonoperating expense will be approximately $20 million in the fourth quarter of 2010.
Share Repurchase
Through November 12, 2010, Air Group has repurchased 170,000 shares of its common stock for approximately $8.4 million under our existing $50 million repurchase program.  The program expires in June 2011.
Cash and Share Count

Capital Expenditures
 
Total expected gross capital expenditures for 2010 are as follows (in millions):
 
*Amounts exclude any proceeds from the sale of assets.
The increase in anticipated aircraft capital expenditures in 2010 is due an increase in advance aircraft purchase deposits because of the acceleration of Q400 aircraft deliveries from 2012 and 2013 into 2011. This acceleration of Q400 aircraft deliveries will also increase our expected 2011 gross capital expenditures to $312 million.
Firm Aircraft Commitments
 
The tables below reflect the current delivery schedules for firm aircraft as of October 31, 2010.
 
Horizon has entered into an agreement to dispose of eight CRJ-700 aircraft in the first half of 2011 through either sublease or lease assignment to a third-party carrier.  We have also accelerated the delivery of the eight remaining Q400 aircraft on order to 2011 to coincide with the anticipated exit dates of the CRJ-700 aircraft.
In addition to the firm orders noted above, Alaska has options to acquire 38 additional B737-800s and Horizon has options to acquire 10 Q400s.
Projected Fleet Count

Future Fuel Hedge Positions*
*All of our future positions are call options, which are designed to effectively cap the cost of the crude oil component of our jet fuel purchases.  With call options, we benefit from a decline in crude oil prices, as there is no cash outlay other than the premiums we pay to enter into the contracts.
Additionally, we have used either fixed-price physical contracts or financial swaps to fix the refining margin component for approximately 50% fourth quarter 2010 estimated jet fuel purchases at an average price of 30 cents per gallon and 30% of our first quarter 2011 estimated purchases at an average price of 35 cents per gallon.

Investor Update  January 6, 2011
Note to Investors
This abbreviated Investor Update is being provided to communicate certain actual fourth quarter 2010 mainline and consolidated operating statistics.  It includes forecasted mainline and consolidated unit cost (excluding fuel) and passenger unit revenue (PRASM) information, estimated economic fuel cost per gallon for the quarter, and expected consolidated non-operating expense.  We began this process at the end of third quarter and expect to provide this abbreviated Investor Update following our traffic releases for the last month of the quarter.
Unit revenue, unit cost and other financial forecasts are estimates only. Actual amounts reported may differ and are dependent on our normal quarter-end closing process.
A full Investor Update with information about fuel hedge positions, planned capital expenditures, fleet information, and share repurchase activity will be provided in connection with our fourth quarter earnings release scheduled for January 25, 2011
References in this update to Air Group, Company, we, us, and our refer to Alaska Air Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise specified.
Information about Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
Our disclosure of operating cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel and other items, provides us (and may provide investors) with the ability to measure and monitor our performance without these items.  The most directly comparable GAAP measure is total operating expense per available seat mile.  However, due to the volatility of fuel prices, we are unable to predict total operating expense for any future period with any degree of certainty. In addition, we believe the disclosure of fuel expense on an economic basis is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. Please see the cautionary statement under Forward-Looking Information.
We are providing unaudited information about fuel price movements and the impact of our hedging program on our financial results.  Management believes it is useful to compare results between periods on an economic basis. is defined as the raw or into-plane fuel cost less any cash we receive from hedge counterparties for hedges that settle during the period, offset by the recognition of premiums originally paid for those hedges that settle during the period.  Economic fuel expense more closely approximates the net cash outflow associated with purchasing fuel for our operation.

Highlights:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
           Over the last twelve months, Alaska earned recognition for the following:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SEATTLE  Alaska Air Group, Inc. (NYSE: ALK) today reported record fourth quarter 2010 net income of $64.8 million, or $1.75 per diluted share, compared to net income of $24.1 million, or $0.67 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2009. Excluding mark-to-market fuel hedge gains of $28.1 million ($17.4 million after tax or $0.47 per diluted share), the company reported record net income of $47.4 million, or $1.28 per diluted share, compared to net income of $4.4 million, or $0.12 per share, excluding special items in the fourth quarter of 2009.
 
The company reported full-year 2010 record net income of $251.1 million, compared to $121.6 million in 2009.  Excluding the impact of the items noted in the table below, the company reported record net income of $262.6 million, or $7.14 per diluted share for 2010, a $173.9 million improvement from the $88.7 million, or $2.45 per diluted share, in 2009.  This marks the companys seventh consecutive year of adjusted profits.
 
We are very pleased to report record fourth-quarter and full-year profits.  These results were driven by strong revenue growth, excellent cost management, an on-time operation, and promising new markets, 2010 was a record year in nearly every regard and reflects the efforts of the past decade as much as the last twelve months.  At the heart of our results are 12,000 dedicated Alaska and Horizon employees.  I want to thank them for being open to new ideas and working together to deliver outstanding customer service and operational performance.  And though its been difficult at times, because of our collective perseverance and the structural changes weve made, our future is as bright as its ever been.
 said Chairman and CEO Bill Ayer.

 The following tables reconcile the companys adjusted net income and earnings per diluted share (EPS) during the fourth quarters and full years of 2010 and 2009 to amounts as reported in accordance with GAAP (in millions except per-share amounts):
   
 
Today Alaska Airlines is also announcing an order for 15 new Boeing 737 aircraft to be delivered in 2012 through 2014, including 13 new B737-900ER (extended range) aircraft, which will be new to the Alaska fleet.
 
The 737-900ER will be a great addition to our next generation Boeing 737 fleet.  It will improve our already best-in-class rating for fuel-efficiency, said Alaska Airlines President Brad Tilden. Depending on the ultimate configuration, the larger 737-900ER will have between 21 and 27 seats more than our existing B737-800 aircraft and will be a perfect fit for our longer-haul and high traffic West Coast markets.

The following table outlines Alaska Airlines current delivery schedule giving consideration to this order announcement:
 
 
Because the company exceeded its financial and operational goals for the year, more than 12,000 Air Group employees have earned $92 million of incentive pay  the most it has ever paid.  Virtually every employee will receive a performance-based bonus in excess of one months pay, on top of $1,050 to $1,200 per employee for meeting on-time and customer satisfaction goals during the year.  In addition, Alaska Airlines made a voluntary supplemental contribution of $100 million to its defined-benefit pension plans, bringing the full-year total to almost $150 million and the two-year total to nearly $300 million, resulting in a funded status of 85% as of December 31, 2010.  Our generous incentive payout, combined with our commitment to fund our pension obligations, is consistent with our vision of sharing our success broadly with our employees, Ayer said.
 
Financial and statistical data for Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air, as well as a reconciliation of the reported non-GAAP financial measures, can be found in the accompanying tables. A glossary of financial terms can be found on page 6 of this release.
 
A conference call regarding the fourth quarter 2010 results will be simulcast via the Internet at 8:30 a.m. Pacific time on Jan. 25, 2011. It can be accessed through the companys Web site at alaskaair.com/investors.

Investor Update  January 25, 2011
References in this update to Air Group, Company, we, us, and our refer to Alaska Air Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise specified.
Note to Investors
This update includes forecasted 2011 operational and financial information for our consolidated and mainline operations.
Beginning January 1, 2011, Horizon Air Industries, Inc. (Horizon) began flying 100% of its capacity under a capacity purchase arrangement with Alaska Airlines, Inc. (Alaska).  As such, Horizon standalone information will no longer be presented.  We are presenting consolidated Air Group and Alaska mainline information only.  The consolidated data includes regional flying performed under CPA arrangements with both Horizon and third parties.

Fuel Price Sensitivity
Given our current fuel-hedge portfolio, the following table depicts the sensitivity of fuel prices under various crude oil and refining margin prices for the full year 2011:
Fleet Transition Charges
We currently expect to remove four CRJ-700 aircraft from our operations in the first quarter of 2011 and thirteen for the first six months of the year.  These aircraft will be either be, leased, subleased, or assigned to a third party.  Depending on the ultimate disposition, we expect to record a charge of up to $3 million per aircraft as they are removed from operations.  The charge for the first quarter is expected to be up to $12 million.  This charge is excluded from our unit cost forecast above.
Nonoperating Expense
We expect that our consolidated nonoperating expense will be approximately $17 million in the first quarter of 2011.
Capital Expenditures
Including the airplane order announced today, expected gross capital expenditures for 2011 and 2012 are as follows (in millions):
 
Preliminary estimate, subject to change
(a)
Firm Aircraft Commitments
The tables below reflect the current delivery schedules for firm aircraft as of January 25, 2011, including the Boeing order announcement.
 
In addition to the firm orders noted above, Air Group has options to acquire 42 additional B737 aircraft and 10 Q400 aircraft.

Projected Fleet Count
F=Freighter; C=Combination freighter/passenger
(a)
The expected fleet counts at December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013 are subject to change.
(b) 
Future Fuel Hedge Positions
(a)
All of our future positions are call options, which are designed to effectively cap the cost of the crude oil component of our jet fuel purchases.  With call options, we benefit from a decline in crude oil prices, as there is no cash outlay other than the premiums we pay to enter into the contracts.
(a)
 
Additionally, we have used either fixed-price physical contracts or financial swaps to fix the refining margin component for approximately 50% first quarter 2011 estimated jet fuel purchases at an average price of 37 cents per gallon and 14% of our second quarter 2011 estimated purchases at an average price of 41 cents per gallon.

ITEM 5.02. Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
 
On February 7, 2011, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the Committee) of Alaska Air Group, Inc. (the Company) took the following actions.
 
The Committee confirmed its philosophy to set base pay for senior-most executive officers below market, with an opportunity to earn market pay through short-term and long-term incentive plans if the Company performs well.  The Committee set base salary for Chairman and CEO Bill Ayer at $412,000, which is below the 25
th
percentile as compared to market, based on airline peer group information provided by the Committee's independent compensation consultant. The Committee also set base salary for the Company's other Named Executive Officers:  Alaska Airlines (Alaska) President Brad Tilden, $390,000; President of Horizon Air Industries, Inc. (Horizon) Glenn Johnson, $310,000; Alaska Chief Operating Officer Ben Minicucci, $295,000; and Alaska Air Group Vice President/Finance and Chief Financial Officer Brandon Pedersen, $265,000.
 
For the 2011 plan year, Performance-Based Pay plan participation rates for these executive officers remain at the same levels established by the Committee in 2010: 100% for Mr. Ayer, 85% for Mr. Tilden, 75% for Messrs. Johnson and Minicucci, and 65% for Mr. Pedersen. Participation rates are expressed as a percentage of base salary for the fiscal year assuming target performance is achieved. The actual amounts paid under the PBP plan may be higher if the performance targets are exceeded or lower (or even 0%) if the targets are not met.
 
The Committee also approved grants of stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs) and performance stock units under the Company's 2008 Performance Incentive Plan (PIP) to each of the Named Executive Officers. The table below presents the number of shares subject to each of these awards:
 
     
Each stock option award was granted with an exercise price of $61.30, the closing price on the New York Stock Exchange of a share of Alaska Air Group common stock on February 7, 2011. The stock options are scheduled to vest in annual installments over a four-year period. The RSUs are scheduled to vest on the third anniversary of the grant date and are payable upon vesting in shares of Company common stock on a one-for-one basis. The performance units will be eligible to vest based on the Company's total shareholder return (TSR) relative to an airline peer group provided by the Committee's independent compensation consultant measured over the three-year period commencing January 1, 2011. The Company's performance will be ranked as compared to its peer group.  The percentage of the performance units that vest may range from 0% to 200%, depending on the Company's relative performance during that period. Vested performance units are payable in shares of Company common stock on a one-for-one basis.
 
The stock options, restricted stock unit awards and performance unit awards are evidenced by applicable forms of award agreement previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
Mr. Ayer's grant brings his target total direct compensation to approximately 15% below the 50
th
percentile as compared to market, based on airline peer group information provided by the Committee's independent compensation consultant.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
Investor Update - February 17, 2011
 
References in this update to Air Group, Company, we, us, and our refer to Alaska Air Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise specified.
 
This update includes forecasted operational and financial information for our consolidated and mainline operations. Our disclosure of operating cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel and other item s, provides us (and may provide investors) with the ability to measure and monitor our performance without these items. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is total operating expense per available seat mile. However, due to the large fluctuations in fuel prices, we are unable to predict total operating expense for any future period with any degree of certainty. In addition, we believe the disclosure of fuel expense on an economic basis is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. Please see the cautionary statement under Forward-Looking Information.
 
We are providing unaudited information about fuel price movements and the impact of our hedging program on our financial results. Management believes it is useful to compare results between periods on an economic basis.
Economic fuel expense
is defined as the raw or into-plane fuel cost less any cash we receive from hedge counterparties for hedges that settle during the period, offset by the recognition of premiums originally paid for those hedges that settle during the period. Economic fuel expense more closely approximates the net cash outflow associated with purchasing fuel for our operation.
 
 
Forward-Looking Information
This update contains forward-looking statements subject to the safe harbor protection provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements relate to future events and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual outcomes to be materially different from those indicated by any forward-looking statements. For a comprehensive discussion of potential risk factors, see Item 1A of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009. Some of these risks include current economic conditions, increases in operating costs including fuel, competition, labor costs and relations, our significant indebtedness, inability to meet cost reduction goals, terrorist attacks, sea sonal fluctuations in our financial results, an aircraft accident, laws and regulations, and government fees and taxes. All of the forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the risk factors discussed therein. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risk factors emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict such new risk factors, nor can it assess the impact, if any, of such new risk factors on our business or events described in any forward-looking statements. We expressly disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date of this report to conform them to actual results. Over time, our actual results, performance or achievements will likely differ from the anticipated results, performance or achievements that are expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements, and such differences might be significant and materially adverse.

January 2011 Statistics
(a)
Percentage of available seats occupied by fare-paying passengers
 
Forecast Information
 
(a)
For Alaska, our forecasts of mainline cost per ASM excluding fuel are based on forward-looking estimates, which will likely differ from actual results.
(b)
Because of the volatility of fuel prices, actual amounts may differ significantly from our estimates. Our economic fuel cost per gallon estimate for the first quarter includes the following per-gallon assumptions: crude oil cost - $2.07 ($87 per barrel); refining margin - 66 cents; taxes and fees - 14 cents; benefit of settled hedges - 7 cents. Full-year estimates would not be meaningful at this time.
 
Changes in Advance Booked Load Factors (percentage of ASMs that are sold)
(a)
Percentage point change compared to the same point in time last year.

Statistics include Alaska mainline operations and all regional affiliates.
 
Forecast Information
(a)
Capacity forecast includes Alaska mainline operations and all regional affiliates.
(b)
Our forecasted CASM amounts are based on consolidated costs per ASM using total ASMs, which include Alaska mainline operations and all regional flying performed under CPA arrangements.
(c)
Our forecast of cost per ASM excluding fuel is based on forward-looking estimates, which may differ from actual results.
(d)
Because of the volatility of fuel prices, actual amounts may differ significantly from our estimates. Full-year estimates would not be meaningful at this time.
 
Changes in Advance Booked Load Factors (percentage of ASMs that are sold)
(a)
Percentage point change compared to the same point in time last year.
 
Fleet Transition Charges
We currently expect to remove four CRJ-700 aircraft from our operations in the first quarter of 2011 and thirteen for the first six months of the year. These aircraft will be either be, leased, subleased, or assigned to a third party. Depending on the ultimate disposition, we expect to record a charge of up to $3 million per aircraft as they are removed from operations. The charge for the first quarter is expected to be up to $12 million. This charge is excluded from our unit cost forecast above.
 
Nonoperating Expense
We expect that our consolida ted nonoperating expense will be approximately $17 million in the first quarter of 2011.
 
Share Repurchase
Through February 7, 2011, Air Group has repurchased 551,000 shares of its common stock for approximately $30.7 million under our existing $50 million repurchase program. The program expires in June 2011.

Cash and Share Count
(a)
The decline in the cash balance from December 31, 2010 is due to the prepayment of long-term debt, aircraft delivery payments, and normal semi-annual aircraft rent payments.
 
Capital Expenditures
Total expected gros s capital expenditures for 2011 and 2012 are as follows (in millions):
(a)
Preliminary estimate, subject to change
 
Firm Aircraft Commitment s
The tables below reflect the current delivery schedules for firm aircraft as of January 31, 2011:
 
 
In addition to the firm orders noted above, Air Group has options to acquire 42 additional B737 aircraft and 10 Q400 aircraft.
 
Projected Fleet Count

F=Freighter; C=Combination freighter/passenger
(b)
The expected fleet counts at December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013 are subject to change.
(c)
We currently have an agreement to dispose of 13 CRJ-700 aircraft in 2011.
 
4
 
 
 
Future Fuel Hedge Positions
 
(a)
 
(a)
All of our future positions are call options, which are designed to effectively cap the cost of the crude oil component of our jet fuel purchases. With call options, we benefit from a decline in crude oil prices, as there is no cash outlay other than the premiums we pay to enter into the contracts.
 
Additionally, we have used either fixed-price physical contracts or financial swaps to fix the refining margin component for approximately 50% first quarter 2011 estimated jet fuel purchases at an average price of 37 cents per gallon and 22% of our second quarter 2011 estimated purchases at an average price of 47 cents per gallon.

ALASKA AIR GROUP REPORTS MARCH OPERATIONAL RESULTS
 
    
SEATTLE - Alaska Air Group, Inc. (NYSE: ALK) today reported March operational results for its subsidiaries, Alaska Airlines (Alaska) and Horizon Air (Horizon).
 
ALASKA AIRLINES
Alaska reported a 19.3 percent increase in traffic on a 15.3 percent increase in capacity, resulting in a 2.9-point increase in load factor to a record 87.4 percent. Alaska also reported that 82.6 percent of its flights arrived on time in March, a 4.6-point decrease compared to the 87.2 percent reported in March 2010. March on-time results were negatively impacted by a systems outage that disrupted operations on March 26, 2011.
The following table shows the operational results for March 2011 and year-to-date 2011, compared to the prior-year periods:
 
 
 
 
HORIZON AIR
Horizon reported a 0.1 percent decline in traffic on a 7.5 percent decline in capacity compared to March 2010, resulting in a 5.8-point increase in load factor to a record 79.1 percent. Horizon also reported that 80.2 percent of its flights arrived on time in March 2011, a 10.9-point decrease compared to the 91.1 percent reported in March 2010. Like Alaska, Horizon's on-time performance results were negatively impacted by a systems outage that disrupted operations on March 26, 2011.
The following table shows the operational results for March 2011 and year-to-date 2011, compared to the prior-year periods:

Investor Update - April 5, 2011
 
Note to Investors
This abbreviated Investor Update is being provided to communicate certain actual first quarter 2011 mainline and consolidated operating statistics.  It includes forecasted mainline and consolidated unit cost (excluding fuel) and passenger unit revenue (PRASM) information, estimated economic fuel cost per gallon for the quarter, and expected consolidated non-operating expense.  
 
Unit revenue, unit cost and other financial forecasts are estimates only. Actual amounts reported may differ and are dependent on our normal quarter-end closing process.
 
A full Investor Update with information about fuel hedge positions, planned capital expenditures, fleet information, and share repurchase activity will be provided in connection with our first quarter earnings release scheduled for April 21, 2011
 
References in this update to Air Group, Company, we, us, and our refer to Alaska Air Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise specified.
 
Information about Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
Our disclosure of operating cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel and other items, provides us (and may provide investors) with the ability to measure and monitor our performance without these items.  The most directly comparable GAAP measure is total operating expense per available seat mile.  However, due to the volatility of fuel prices, we are unable to predict total operating expense for any future period with any degree of certainty. In addition, we believe the disclosure of fuel expense on an economic basis is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. Please see the cautionary statement under Forward-Looking Information.
 
We are providing unaudited information about fuel price movements and the impact of our hedging program on our financial results.  Management believes it is useful to compare results between periods on an economic basis.
 
Economic fuel expense is defined as the raw or into-plane fuel cost less any cash we receive from hedge counterparties for hedges that settle during the period, offset by the recognition of premiums originally paid for those hedges that settle during the period.  Economic fuel expense more closely approximates the net cash outflow associated with purchasing fuel for our operation.
 
Forward-Looking Information 
This update contains forward-looking statements subject to the safe harbor protection provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements relate to future events and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual outcomes to be materially different from those indicated by any forward-looking statements.  For a comprehensive discussion of potential risk factors, see Item 1A of the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010.  Some of these risks include current economic conditions, increases in operating costs including fuel, competition, labor costs and relations, our significant indebtedness, inability to meet cost reduction goals, terrorist attacks, seasonal fluctuations in our financial results, an aircraft accident, laws and regulations, and government fees and taxes.  All of the forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the risk factors discussed therein. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risk factors emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict such new risk factors, nor can it assess the impact, if any, of such new risk factors on our business or events described in any forward-looking statements. We expressly disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date of this report to conform them to actual results. Over time, our actual results, performance or achievements will likely differ from the anticipated results, performance or achievements that are expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements, and such differences might be significant and materially adverse.

ALASKA AIR GROUP REPORTS RECORD FIRST QUARTER RESULTS
    
First quarter highlights:
SEATTLE - Alaska Air Group, Inc. (NYSE: ALK) today reported first quarter 2011 net income of
$74.2
million, or
$2.01
per diluted share, compared to net income of
$5.3
million, or
$0.15
per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2010. Excluding mark-to-market fuel hedge gains of $82.0 million (
$51.0
million after tax, or
$1.38
per diluted share) and CRJ-700 fleet transition costs of $10.1 million (
$6.3
million after tax, or
$0.17
per diluted share), the company reported record first
 
1
 
quarter 2011 net income of
$29.5
million, or
$0.80
per diluted share, compared to net income of
$13.1
million, or
$0.36
per diluted share, excluding special items in the first quarter of 2010.
We are pleased to report a record first-quarter profit. This quarter's results are due to strong passenger demand leading to a 16 percent, or $136 million, improvement in revenue. This profit is especially gratifying given the significant increase in fuel costs, said Chairman and CEO Bill Ayer. As we look ahead, fuel prices will be an even bigger challenge, but we are well positioned with our efficient fleet, diversified network and the fundamental changes weve made to our business over the past several years. Our people are operating a great airline and their hard work is paying off.
The following table reconciles the company's adjusted net income and earnings per diluted share (EPS) during the first quarters of 2011 and 2010 to amounts as reported in accordance with GAAP (in millions except per-share amounts):
 
 
Statistical data, as well as a reconciliation of the reported non-GAAP financial measures, can be found in the accompanying tables. A glossary of financial terms can be found on page 4 of this release.
 
A conference call regarding the first quarter results will be simulcast via the Internet at 8:30 a.m. Pacific time on Apr. 21, 2011. It can be accessed through the company's Web site at alaskaair.com/investors.

Note A:
 Pursuant to Regulation G, we are providing disclosure of the reconciliation of reported non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable financial measures reported on a GAAP basis. We believe that consideration of these non-GAAP financial measures may be important to investors for the following reasons:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Note B:
Air Group's operations are treated as an integrated route network intended to maximize the results of the company. However, the Company has historically had two primary operating and reporting segments, consisting of Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air, for which separate financial information is available and regularly evaluated by our chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance.
 
Alaska operates a fleet of passenger jets ("mainline operations") and contracts with affiliated (Horizon) and non-affiliated third party carriers for regional capacity under which Alaska receives all passenger revenue from those flights. Horizon operates a fleet of turboprop and regional jet aircraft and sells all of its capacity to Alaska pursuant to a capacity purchase arrangement (the Horizon CPA). The Horizon CPA reflects what the Company believes are current market rates received by other regional carriers for similar flying. Amounts paid by Alaska to Horizon are available to pay for various Horizon operating expenses such as crew expenses, maintenance, and aircraft ownership costs.
 
Effective January 1, 2011, Horizon's business model changed such that 100% of it's capacity is sold to Alaska under the Horizon CPA. As is typical for similar arrangements, certain costs such landing fees, selling and distribution costs, and fuel costs directly related to regional flights operated by Horizon are now recorded by Alaska. Because of this change, Horizon's revenues and expenses and Alaska's Regional revenues and expenses have changed significantly on a year over year basis.
 
All inter-company revenues and expenses are eliminated in consolidated, and these changes have no impact on our consolidated results.

Exhibit 99.2
Investor Update - April 21, 2011
 
References in this update to Air Group, Company, we, us, and our refer to Alaska Air Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise specified.
 
This update includes forecasted operational and financial information for our consolidated and mainline operations. Our disclosure of operating cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel and other items, provides us (and may provide investors) with the ability to measure and monitor our performance without these items. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is total operating expenses per available seat mile. However, due to the large fluctuations in fuel prices, we are unable to predict total operating expenses for any future period with any degree of certainty. In addition, we believe the disclosure of fuel expense on an economic basis is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. Please see the cautionary statement under Forward-Looking Information.
 
We are providing unaudited information about fuel price movements and the impact of our hedging program on our financial results. Management believes it is useful to compare results between periods on an economic basis.
Economic fuel expense
is defined as the raw or into-plane fuel cost less any cash we receive from hedge counterparties for hedges that settle during the period, offset by the recognition of premiums originally paid for those hedges that settle during the period. Economic fuel expense more closely approximates the net cash outflow associated with purchasing fuel for our operation.
 
 
Forward-Looking Information
This update contains forward-looking statements subject to the safe harbor protection provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements relate to future events and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual outcomes to be materially different from those indicated by any forward-looking statements. For a comprehensive discussion of potential risk factors, see Item 1A of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010. Some of these risks include general economic conditions, increases in operating costs including fuel, competition, labor costs and relations, our significant indebtedness, inability to meet cost reduction goals, terrorist attacks, seasonal fluctuations in our financial results, an aircraft accident, laws and regulations, and government fees and taxes. All of the forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the risk factors discussed therein. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risk factors emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict such new risk factors, nor can it assess the impact, if any, of such new risk factors on our business or events described in any forward-looking statements. We expressly disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date of this report to conform them to actual results. Over time, our actual results, performance or achievements will likely differ from the anticipated results, performance or achievements that are expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements, and such differences might be significant and materially adverse.

Future Fuel Hedge Positions
 
(a)
We use both call options on crude oil futures and swap instruments on LA Jet refining margins to hedge against price volatility of future jet fuel consumption. We have refining margin swaps in place for approximately 50% of our second quarter 2011 estimated jet fuel purchases at an average price of 59 cents per gallon and 22% of our third quarter 2011 estimated purchases at an average price of 73 cents per gallon. Our crude oil positions are as follows:
(a)
All of our future positions are call options, which are designed to effectively cap the cost of the crude oil component of our jet fuel purchases. With call options, we benefit from a decline in crude oil prices, as there is no cash outlay other than the premiums we pay to enter into the contracts.
 
Fuel Price Sensitivity
Given our current fuel-hedge portfolio, the following table depicts the sensitivity of fuel prices under various crude oil and refining margin prices for the full year 2011:

ITEM 8.01. Other Events
On or about April 4, 2011, Alaska Air Group, Inc. (the Company) furnished or otherwise made available to stockholders its proxy statement (the Proxy Statement) describing the matters to be voted upon at the Company's Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the Annual Meeting) to be held at the Museum of Flight in Seattle, Washington at 2 p.m. on Tuesday, May 17, 2011. At the Annual Meeting, stockholders are being asked, among other things, to vote on a proposal to approve an amendment to the Company's 2008 Performance Incentive Plan (the 2008 Plan) to increase the number of shares available for issuance under the 2008 Plan by 2,200,000 shares (which is identified in the Proxy Statement as Proposal 6), with a corresponding increase in the number of shares that may be subject to options granted under the 2008 Plan that are intended to qualify as incentive stock options under the U.S. tax laws. In order to facilitate stockholder approval of the amendment to the 2008 Plan, the Company is revising its proposed amendment to the 2008 Plan to reduce the proposed increase in the number of shares subject to the 2008 Plan from 2,200,000 shares to 1,900,000 shares. The foregoing reduction in the proposed share increase has been approved by the Company's Board of Directors. All other terms of the 2008 Plan will remain as described in the Proxy Statement.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
Investor Update - May 16, 2011
 
References in this update to Air Group, Company, we, us, and our refer to Alaska Air Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise specified.
 
This update includes forecasted operational and financial information for our consolidated and mainline operations. Our disclosure of operating cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel and other items, provides us (and may provide investors) with the ability to measure and monitor our performance without these items. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is total operating expense per available seat mile. However, due to the large fluctuations in fuel prices, we are unable to predict total operating expense for any future period with any degree of certainty. In addition, we believe the disclosure of fuel expense on an economic basis is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. Please see the cautionary statement under Forward-Looking Information.
 
We are providing unaudited information about fuel price movements and the impact of our hedging program on our financial results. Management believes it is useful to compare results between periods on an economic basis.
Economic fuel expense
is defined as the raw or into-plane fuel cost less any cash we receive from hedge counterparties for hedges that settle during the period, offset by the recognition of premiums originally paid for those hedges that settle during the period. Economic fuel expense more closely approximates the net cash outflow associated with purchasing fuel for our operation.
 
 
Forward-Looking Information
This update contains forward-looking statements subject to the safe harbor protection provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements relate to future events and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual outcomes to be materially different from those indicated by any forward-looking statements. For a comprehensive discussion of potential risk factors, see Item 1A of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010. Some of these risks include general economic conditions, increases in operating costs including fuel, competition, labor costs and relations, our significant indebtedness, inability to meet cost reduction goals, terrorist attacks, seasonal fluctuations in our financial results, an aircraft accident, laws and regulations, and government fees and taxes. All of the forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the risk factors discussed therein. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risk factors emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict such new risk factors, nor can it assess the impact, if any, of such new risk factors on our business or events described in any forward-looking statements. We expressly disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date of this report to conform them to actual results. Over time, our actual results, performance or achievements will likely differ from the anticipated results, performance or achievements that are expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements, and such differences might be significant and materially adverse.

Future Fuel Hedge Positions
 
(a)
We use both call options on crude oil futures and swap instruments on LA Jet refining margins to hedge against price volatility of future jet fuel consumption. We have refining margin swaps in place for approximately 50% of our second quarter 2011 estimated jet fuel purchases at an average price of 59 cents per gallon and 36% of our third quarter 2011 estimated purchases at an average price of 72 cents per gallon. Our crude oil positions are as follows:
(a)
    All of our future positions are call options, which are designed to effectively cap the cost of the crude oil component of our jet fuel purchases. With call options, we benefit from a decline in crude oil prices, as there is no cash outlay other than the premiums we pay to enter into the contracts.

2008 PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE PLAN
 
Adopted by the the Alaska Air Group, Inc. Board of Directors on March 13, 2008
Approved by Alaska Air Group, Inc. Shareholders on May 20, 2008
Amended by the Alaska Air Group, Inc. Board of Directors on March 10, 2011
Amended Plan Approved by Alaska Air Group, Inc. Shareholders on May 17, 2011
 
 
 
The purpose of this Alaska Air Group, Inc.
2008 Performance Incentive Plan (this 
Plan
) of Alaska Air Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the 
Corporation
), is to promote the success of the Corporation and to increase stockholder value by providing an additional means through the grant of awards to attract, motivate, retain and reward selected employees and other eligible persons.
 
The Administrator (as such term is defined in Section 3.1) may grant awards under this Plan only to those persons that the Administrator determines to be Eligible Persons. An 
Eligible Person
 is any person who is either: (a) an officer (whether or not a director) or employee of the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries; (b) a director of the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries; or (c) an individual consultant or advisor who renders or has rendered bona fide services (other than services in connection with the offering or sale of securities of the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries in a capital-raising transaction or as a market maker or promoter of securities of the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries) to the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries and who is selected to participate in this Plan by the Administrator; provided, however, that a person who is otherwise an Eligible Person under clause (c) above may participate in this Plan only if such participation would not adversely affect either the Corporation's eligibility to use Form S-8 to register under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the 
Securities Act
), the offering and sale of shares issuable under this Plan by the Corporation or the Corporation's compliance with any other applicable laws. An Eligible Person who has been granted an award (a participant) may, if otherwise eligible, be granted additional awards if the Administrator shall so determine. As used herein, 
Subsidiary
 means any corporation or other entity a majority of whose outstanding voting stock or voting power is beneficially owned directly or indirectly by the Corporation; and 
Board
 means the Board of Directors of the Corporation.
 
3.1
    The Administrator
. This Plan shall be administered by and all awards under this Plan shall be authorized by the Administrator. The 
Administrator
 means the Board or one or more committees appointed by the Board or another committee (within its delegated authority) to administer all or certain aspects of this Plan. Any such committee shall be comprised solely of one or more directors or such number of directors as may be required under applicable law. A committee may delegate some or all of its authority to another committee so constituted. The Board or a committee comprised solely of directors may also delegate, to the extent permitted by Section 157(c) of the Delaware General Corporation Law and any other applicable law, to one or more officers of the Corporation,
 
 
 
its powers under this Plan (a) to designate the officers and employees of the Corporation and its Subsidiaries who will receive grants of awards under this Plan, and (b) to determine the number of shares subject to, and the other terms and conditions of, such awards. The Board may delegate different levels of authority to different committees with administrative and grant authority under this Plan. Unless otherwise provided in the Bylaws of the Corporation or the applicable charter of any Administrator: (a) a majority of the members of the acting Administrator shall constitute a quorum, and (b) the vote of a majority of the members present assuming the presence of a quorum or the unanimous written consent of the members of the Administrator shall constitute action by the acting Administrator.
 
With respect to awards intended to satisfy the requirements for performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the 
Code
), this Plan shall be administered by a committee consisting solely of two or more outside directors (as this requirement is applied under Section 162(m) of the Code); provided, however, that the failure to satisfy such requirement shall not affect the validity of the action of any committee otherwise duly authorized and acting in the matter. Award grants, and transactions in or involving awards, intended to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 
Exchange Act
), must be duly and timely authorized by the Board or a committee consisting solely of two or more non-employee directors (as this requirement is applied under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act). To the extent required by any applicable listing agency, this Plan shall be administered by a committee composed entirely of independent directors (within the meaning of the applicable listing agency).
 
3.2
    Powers of the Administrator
. Subject to the express provisions of this Plan, the Administrator is authorized and empowered to do all things necessary or desirable in connection with the authorization of awards and the administration of this Plan (in the case of a committee or delegation to one or more officers, within the authority delegated to that committee or person(s)), including, without limitation, the authority to:
 
(a)    determine eligibility and, from among those persons determined to be eligible, the particular Eligible Persons who will receive an award under this Plan;
(b)        grant awards to Eligible Persons, determine the price at which securities will be offered or awarded and the number of securities to be offered or awarded to any of such persons, determine the other specific terms and conditions of such awards consistent with the express limits of this Plan, establish the installments (if any) in which such awards shall become exercisable or shall vest (which may include, without limitation, performance and/or time-based schedules), or determine that no delayed exercisability or vesting is required, establish any applicable performance targets, and establish the events of termination or reversion of such awards;
(c)    approve the forms of award agreements (which need not be identical either as to type of award or among participants);
(d)        construe and interpret this Plan and any agreements defining the rights and obligations of the Corporation, its Subsidiaries, and participants under this Plan, further define the terms used in this Plan, and prescribe, amend and rescind rules
 
 
 
and regulations relating to the administration of this Plan or the awards granted under this Plan;
(e)        cancel, modify, or waive the Corporation's rights with respect to, or modify, discontinue, suspend, or terminate any or all outstanding awards, subject to any required consent under Section 8.6.5;
(f)        accelerate or extend the vesting or exercisability or extend the term of any or all such outstanding awards (in the case of options or stock appreciation rights, within the maximum ten-year term of such awards) in such circumstances as the Administrator may deem appropriate (including, without limitation, in connection with a termination of employment or services or other events of a personal nature) subject to any required consent under Section 8.6.5;
(g)    adjust the number of shares of Common Stock subject to any award, adjust the price of any or all outstanding awards or otherwise change previously imposed terms and conditions, in such circumstances as the Administrator may deem appropriate, in each case subject to Sections 4 and 8.6 (and subject to the no repricing provision below);
(h)        determine the date of grant of an award, which may be a designated date after but not before the date of the Administrator's action (unless otherwise designated by the Administrator, the date of grant of an award shall be the date upon which the Administrator took the action granting an award);
(i)        determine whether, and the extent to which, adjustments are required pursuant to Section 7 hereof and authorize the termination, conversion, substitution or succession of awards upon the occurrence of an event of the type described in Section 7;
(j)        acquire or settle (subject to Sections 7 and 8.6) rights under awards in cash, stock of equivalent value, or other consideration (subject to the no repricing provision below); and
(k)    determine the fair market value of the Common Stock or awards under this Plan from time to time and/or the manner in which such value will be determined.
Notwithstanding the foregoing and except for an adjustment pursuant to Section 7.1 or a repricing approved by stockholders, in no case may the Administrator (1) amend an outstanding stock option or SAR to reduce the exercise price or base price of the award, (2) cancel, exchange, or surrender an outstanding stock option or SAR in exchange for cash or other awards for the purpose of repricing the award, or (3) cancel, exchange, or surrender an outstanding stock option or SAR in exchange for an option or SAR with an exercise or base price that is less than the exercise or base price of the original award.
3.3
    
Binding Determinations
. Any action taken by, or inaction of, the Corporation, any Subsidiary, or the Administrator relating or pursuant to this Plan and within its authority hereunder or under applicable law shall be within the absolute discretion of that entity or body and shall be conclusive and binding upon all persons. Neither the Board nor any Board committee, nor any member thereof or person acting at the direction thereof, shall be
 
 
 
liable for any act, omission, interpretation, construction or determination made in good faith in connection with this Plan (or any award made under this Plan), and all such persons shall be entitled to indemnification and reimbursement by the Corporation in respect of any claim, loss, damage or expense (including, without limitation, attorneys' fees) arising or resulting therefrom to the fullest extent permitted by law and/or under any directors and officers liability insurance coverage that may be in effect from time to time.
 
3.4
    
Reliance on Experts
. In making any determination or in taking or not taking any action under this Plan, the Administrator may obtain and may rely upon the advice of experts, including employees and professional advisors to the Corporation. No director, officer or agent of the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries shall be liable for any such action or determination taken or made or omitted in good faith.
 
3.5
    
Delegation
. The Administrator may delegate ministerial, non-discretionary functions to individuals who are officers or employees of the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries or to third parties.
 
4.
SHARES OF COMMON STOCK SUBJECT TO THE PLAN; SHARE LIMITS
 
4.1
    
Shares Available
. Subject to the provisions of Section 7.1, the capital stock that may be delivered under this Plan shall be shares of the Corporation's authorized but unissued Common Stock and any shares of its Common Stock held as treasury shares. For purposes of this Plan, 
Common Stock
 shall mean the common stock of the Corporation and such other securities or property as may become the subject of awards under this Plan, or may become subject to such awards, pursuant to an adjustment made under Section 7.1.
 
4.2
    
Share Limits
. The maximum number of shares of Common Stock that may be delivered pursuant to awards granted to Eligible Persons under this Plan (the 
Share Limit
) is equal to the sum of the following:
 
(1)    4,000,000 shares of Common Stock, plus
(2)    the number of shares of Common Stock available for additional award grant purposes under the Corporation's 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the 
2004 Plan
) as of the date of stockholder approval of this Plan (the 
Stockholder Approval Date
) and determined immediately prior to the termination of the authority to grant new awards under the 2004 Plan as of the Stockholder Approval Date, plus
(3)    the number of any shares subject to stock options granted under the 2004 Plan and outstanding on the Stockholder Approval Date which expire, or for any reason are cancelled or terminated, after the Stockholder Approval Date without being exercised (including any shares subject to stock options granted under the Corporation's 1999 Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan (the 
1999 Plan
) outstanding on the Stockholder Approval Date which expire, or for any reason are cancelled or terminated, after the Stockholder Approval Date and would otherwise become eligible for award grant purposes under the 2004 Plan in accordance with the provisions of that plan);
(4)    the number of any shares subject to restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards
 
 
 
granted under the 2004 Plan that are outstanding and unvested on the Stockholder Approval Date that are forfeited, terminated, cancelled or otherwise reacquired by the Corporation without having become vested.
provided that in no event shall the Share Limit exceed 6,999,517 shares (which is the sum of the 4,000,000 shares set forth above, plus the number of shares available under the 2004 Plan for additional award grant purposes as of the Effective Date (as such term is defined in Section 8.6.1), plus the aggregate number of shares subject to awards previously granted and outstanding under the 2004 Plan and the 1999 Plan as of the Effective Date).
Shares issued in respect of any Full-Value Award granted under this Plan shall be counted against the foregoing Share Limit as 1.7 shares for every one share actually issued in connection with such award. (For example, if a stock bonus of 100 shares of Common Stock is granted under this Plan, 170 shares shall be charged against the Share Limit in connection with that award.)     For this purpose, a 
Full-Value Award
 means any award under this Plan that is
not
a stock option grant or a stock appreciation right grant.
The following limits also apply with respect to awards granted under this Plan:
(a)    The maximum number of shares of Common Stock that may be delivered pursuant to options qualified as incentive stock options granted under this Plan is 4,000,000
shares.
 
(b)    The maximum number of shares of Common Stock subject to those options and stock appreciation rights that are granted during any calendar year to any individual under this Plan is 300,000
shares.
 
(c)    Additional limits with respect to Performance-Based Awards are set forth in Section 5.2.3.
Each of the foregoing numerical limits is subject to adjustment as contemplated by Section 4.3, Section 7.1, and Section 8.10.
4.3
    
Awards Settled in Cash, Reissue of Awards and Shares
. Except as provided in the next sentence, shares that are subject to or underlie awards granted under this Plan which expire or for any reason are cancelled or terminated, are forfeited, fail to vest, or for any other reason are not paid or delivered under this Plan shall again be available for subsequent awards under this Plan. Shares that are exchanged by a participant or withheld by the Corporation as full or partial payment in connection with any award under this Plan, as well as any shares exchanged by a participant or withheld by the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries to satisfy the tax withholding obligations related to any award, shall not be available for subsequent awards under this Plan. To the extent that an award granted under this Plan is settled in cash or a form other than shares of Common Stock, the shares that would have been delivered had there been no such cash or other settlement shall not be counted against the shares available for issuance under this Plan. In the event that shares of Common Stock are delivered in respect of a dividend equivalent right granted under this Plan, the number of shares delivered with respect to the award shall be counted against the share limits of this Plan (including, for purposes of clarity, the limits of Section 4.2 of this Plan). (For purposes of clarity, if 1,000 dividend equivalent rights are granted and outstanding when the Corporation pays a dividend, and 50 shares are delivered in payment
 
 
 
of those rights with respect to that dividend, 85 shares (after giving effect to the Full-Value Award premium counting rules) shall be counted against the share limits of this Plan). To the extent that shares of Common Stock are delivered pursuant to the exercise of a stock appreciation right or stock option granted under this Plan, the number of underlying shares as to which the exercise related shall be counted against the applicable share limits under Section 4.2, as opposed to only counting the shares issued. (For purposes of clarity, if a stock appreciation right relates to 100,000 shares and is exercised at a time when the payment due to the participant is 15,000 shares, 100,000 shares shall be charged against the applicable share limits under Section 4.2 with respect to such exercise.) Refer to Section 8.10 for application of the foregoing share limits with respect to assumed awards. The foregoing adjustments to the share limits of this Plan are subject to any applicable limitations under Section 162(m) of the Code with respect to awards intended as performance-based compensation thereunder.
 
4.4
    Reservation of Shares; No Fractional Shares; Minimum Issue
.
The Corporation shall at all times reserve a number of shares of Common Stock sufficient to cover the Corporation's obligations and contingent obligations to deliver shares with respect to awards then outstanding under this Plan (exclusive of any dividend equivalent obligations to the extent the Corporation has the right to settle such rights in cash). No fractional shares shall be delivered under this Plan. The Administrator may pay cash in lieu of any fractional shares in settlements of awards under this Plan. The Administrator may from time to time impose a limit (of not greater than 100 shares) on the minimum number of shares that may be purchased or exercised as to awards granted under this Plan unless (as to any particular award) the total number purchased or exercised is the total number at the time available for purchase or exercise under the award.
 
5.
AWARDS
 
5.1    
Type and Form of Awards
. The Administrator shall determine the type or types of award(s) to be made to each selected Eligible Person. Awards may be granted singly, in combination or in tandem. Awards also may be made in combination or in tandem with, in replacement of, as alternatives to, or as the payment form for grants or rights under any other employee or compensation plan of the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries. The types of awards that may be granted under this Plan are (subject, in each case, to the no repricing provisions of Section 3.2):
 
5.1.1    
Stock Options
. A stock option is the grant of a right to purchase a specified number of shares of Common Stock during a specified period as determined by the Administrator. An option may be intended as an incentive stock option within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code (an 
ISO
) or a nonqualified stock option (an option not intended to be an ISO). The award agreement for an option will indicate if the option is intended as an ISO; otherwise it will be deemed to be a nonqualified stock option. The maximum term of each option (ISO or nonqualified) shall be ten (10) years. The per share exercise price for each option shall be not less than 100% of the fair market value of a share of Common Stock on the date of grant of the option. When an option is exercised, the exercise price for the shares to be purchased shall be paid in full in cash or such other method permitted by the Administrator consistent with Section 5.5.
 
 
 
 
5.1.2    
Additional Rules Applicable to ISOs
. To the extent that the aggregate fair market value (determined at the time of grant of the applicable option) of stock with respect to which ISOs first become exercisable by a participant in any calendar year exceeds $100,000, taking into account both Common Stock subject to ISOs under this Plan and stock subject to ISOs under all other plans of the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries (or any parent or predecessor corporation to the extent required by and within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder), such options shall be treated as nonqualified stock options. In reducing the number of options treated as ISOs to meet the $100,000 limit, the most recently granted options shall be reduced first. To the extent a reduction of simultaneously granted options is necessary to meet the $100,000 limit, the Administrator may, in the manner and to the extent permitted by law, designate which shares of Common Stock are to be treated as shares acquired pursuant to the exercise of an ISO. ISOs may only be granted to employees of the Corporation or one of its subsidiaries (for this purpose, the term subsidiary is used as defined in Section 424(f) of the Code, which generally requires an unbroken chain of ownership of at least 50% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of each subsidiary in the chain beginning with the Corporation and ending with the subsidiary in question). There shall be imposed in any award agreement relating to ISOs such other terms and conditions as from time to time are required in order that the option be an incentive stock option as that term is defined in Section 422 of the Code. No ISO may be granted to any person who, at the time the option is granted, owns (or is deemed to own under Section 424(d) of the Code) shares of outstanding Common Stock possessing more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Corporation, unless the exercise price of such option is at least 110% of the fair market value of the stock subject to the option and such option by its terms is not exercisable after the expiration of five years from the date such option is granted.
 
5.1.3    
Stock Appreciation Rights
. A stock appreciation right or 
SAR
 is a right to receive a payment, in cash and/or Common Stock, equal to the excess of the fair market value of a specified number of shares of Common Stock on the date the SAR is exercised over the 
base price
 of the award, which base price shall be set forth in the applicable award agreement and shall be not less than 100% of the fair market value of a share of Common Stock on the date of grant of the SAR. The maximum term of a SAR shall be ten (10) years.
 
5.1.4
    Other Awards; Dividend Equivalent Rights
. The other types of awards that may be granted under this Plan include: (a) stock bonuses, restricted stock, performance stock, stock units, phantom stock or similar rights to purchase or acquire shares, whether at a fixed or variable price or ratio related to the Common Stock, upon the passage of time, the occurrence of one or more events, or the satisfaction of performance criteria or other conditions, or any combination thereof; (b) any similar securities with a value derived from the value of or related to the Common Stock and/or returns thereon; or (c) cash awards. Dividend equivalent rights may be granted as a separate award or in connection with another award under this Plan; provided, however, that dividend equivalent rights may not be granted in connection with a stock option or SAR granted under this Plan. In addition, any dividends and/or dividend equivalents as to the unvested portion of a restricted
 
 
 
stock award that is subject to performance-based vesting requirements or the unvested portion of a stock unit award that is subject to performance-based vesting requirements will be subject to termination and forfeiture to the same extent as the corresponding portion of the award to which they relate.
 
5.2
    Section 162(m) Performance-Based Awards
.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any of the types of awards listed in Section 5.1.4 above may be, and options and SARs granted to officers and employees (
Qualifying Options
 and 
Qualifying SARS
, respectively) typically will be, granted as awards intended to satisfy the requirements for performance-based compensation within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code (
Performance-Based Awards
). The grant, vesting, exercisability or payment of Performance-Based Awards may depend (or, in the case of Qualifying Options or Qualifying SARs, may also depend) on the degree of achievement of one or more performance goals relative to a pre-established targeted level or levels using one or more of the Business Criteria set forth below (on an absolute basis or relative to the performance of other companies or upon comparisons of any of the indicators of performance relative to other companies) for the Corporation on a consolidated basis or for one or more of the Corporation's subsidiaries, segments, divisions or business units, or any combination of the foregoing. Any Qualifying Option or Qualifying SAR shall be subject only to the requirements of Section 5.2.1 and 5.2.3 in order for such award to satisfy the requirements for performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code. Any other Performance-Based Award shall be subject to all of the following provisions of this Section 5.2.
 
5.2.1
    Class; Administrator
.
The eligible class of persons for Performance-Based Awards under this Section 5.2 shall be officers and employees of the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries. The Administrator approving Performance-Based Awards or making any certification required pursuant to Section 5.2.4 must be constituted as provided in Section 3.1 for awards that are intended as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code.
 
5.2.2
    Performance Goals
.
The specific performance goals for Performance-Based Awards (other than Qualifying Options and Qualifying SARs) shall be, on an absolute or relative basis, established based on one or more of the following business criteria (
Business Criteria
) as selected by the Administrator in its sole discretion: earnings per share, cash flow (which means cash and cash equivalents derived from either net cash flow from operations or net cash flow from operations, financing and investing activities), stock price, total stockholder return, gross revenue, revenue growth, operating income (before or after taxes), net earnings (before or after interest, taxes, depreciation and/or amortization), return on equity or on assets or on net investment, cost containment or reduction, profitability, economic value added, market share, productivity, safety, customer satisfaction, on-time performance, or any combination thereof. These terms are used as applied under generally accepted accounting principles or in the financial reporting of the Corporation or of its Subsidiaries. To qualify awards as performance-based under Section 162(m), the applicable Business Criterion (or Business Criteria, as the case may be) and specific performance goal or goals (targets) must be established and approved by the Administrator during the first 90 days of the performance period (and, in the case of performance periods of less than one year, in no event after 25%
 
 
 
or more of the performance period has elapsed) and while performance relating to such target(s) remains substantially uncertain within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code. The terms of the Performance-Based Awards may specify the manner, if any, in which performance targets shall be adjusted to mitigate the unbudgeted impact of material, unusual or nonrecurring gains and losses, accounting changes or other extraordinary events not foreseen at the time the targets were set unless the Administrator provides otherwise at the time of establishing the targets. The applicable performance measurement period may not be less than three months nor more than 10 years.
 
5.2.3
    Form of Payment; Maximum Performance-Based Award
.
Grants or awards under this Section 5.2 may be paid in cash or shares of Common Stock or any combination thereof. Grants of Qualifying Options and Qualifying SARs to any one participant in any one calendar year shall be subject to the limit set forth in Section 4.2(b). The maximum number of shares of Common Stock which may be delivered pursuant to Performance-Based Awards (other than Qualifying Options and Qualifying SARs, and other than cash awards covered by the following sentence) that are granted to any one participant in any one calendar year shall not exceed 300,000
shares,
either individually or in the aggregate, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 7.1. In addition, the aggregate amount of compensation to be paid to any one participant in respect of all Performance-Based Awards payable only in cash and not related to shares of Common Stock and granted to that participant in any one calendar year shall not exceed $1,000,000. Awards that are cancelled during the year shall be counted against these limits to the extent required by Section 162(m) of the Code.
 
5.2.4
    Certification of Payment
.
Before any Performance-Based Award under this Section 5.2 (other than Qualifying Options and Qualifying SARs) is paid and to the extent required to qualify the award as performance-based compensation within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code, the Administrator must certify in writing that the performance target(s) and any other material terms of the Performance-Based Award were in fact timely satisfied.
 
5.2.5
    Reservation of Discretion
.
The Administrator will have the discretion to determine the restrictions or other limitations of the individual awards granted under this Section 5.2 including the authority to reduce awards, payouts or vesting or to pay no awards, in its sole discretion, if the Administrator preserves such authority at the time of grant by language to this effect in its authorizing resolutions or otherwise.
 
5.2.6
    Expiration of Grant Authority
.
As required pursuant to Section 162(m) of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder, the Administrator's authority to grant new awards that are intended to qualify as performance-based compensation within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code (other than Qualifying Options and Qualifying SARs) shall terminate upon the first meeting of the Corporation's stockholders that occurs in the fifth year following the year in which the Corporation's stockholders first approve this Plan, subject to any subsequent extension that may be approved by stockholders.
 
5.3
    
Award Agreements
. Each award shall be evidenced by either (1) a written award
 
 
 
agreement in a form approved by the Administrator and executed by the Corporation by an officer duly authorized to act on its behalf, or (2) an electronic notice of award grant in a form approved by the Administrator and recorded by the Corporation (or its designee) in an electronic recordkeeping system used for the purpose of tracking award grants under this Plan generally (in each case, an award agreement), as the Administrator may provide and, in each case and if required by the Administrator, executed or otherwise electronically accepted by the recipient of the award in such form and manner as the Administrator may require. The Administrator may authorize any officer of the Corporation (other than the particular award recipient) to execute any or all award agreements on behalf of the Corporation. The award agreement shall set forth the material terms and conditions of the award as established by the Administrator consistent with the express limitations of this Plan.
5.4
    Deferrals and Settlements
. Payment of awards may be in the form of cash, Common Stock, other awards or combinations thereof as the Administrator shall determine, and with such restrictions as it may impose. The Administrator may also require or permit participants to elect to defer the issuance of shares or the settlement of awards in cash under such rules and procedures as it may establish under this Plan. The Administrator may also provide that deferred settlements include the payment or crediting of interest or other earnings on the deferral amounts, or the payment or crediting of dividend equivalents where the deferred amounts are denominated in shares.
5.5    
Consideration for Common Stock or Awards
.
The purchase price for any award granted under this Plan or the Common Stock to be delivered pursuant to an award, as applicable, may be paid by means of any lawful consideration as determined by the Administrator, including, without limitation, one or a combination of the following methods:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In no event shall any shares newly-issued by the Corporation be issued for less than the minimum lawful consideration for such shares or for consideration other than consideration permitted by applicable state law. Shares of Common Stock used to satisfy the exercise price of an option shall be valued at their fair market value on the date of exercise. The Corporation will not be obligated to deliver any shares unless and until it receives full payment of the exercise or purchase price therefor and any related withholding obligations under Section 8.5 and any other conditions to exercise or purchase have been satisfied. Unless otherwise expressly provided in the applicable award agreement, the Administrator
 
 
 
may at any time eliminate or limit a participant's ability to pay the purchase or exercise price of any award or shares by any method other than cash payment to the Corporation.
5.6    Definition of Fair Market Value
. For purposes of this Plan, fair market value shall mean, unless otherwise determined or provided by the Administrator in the circumstances, the closing price (in regular trading) for a share of Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange (the 
Exchange
) for the date in question or, if no sales of Common Stock were reported on the Exchange on that date, the closing price (in regular trading) for a share of Common Stock on the Exchange for the next preceding day on which sales of Common Stock were reported on the Exchange. The Administrator may, however, provide with respect to one or more awards that the fair market value shall equal the closing price (in regular trading) for a share of Common Stock on the Exchange on the last trading day preceding the date in question or the average of the high and low trading prices of a share of Common Stock on the Exchange for the date in question or the most recent trading day. If the Common Stock is no longer listed or is no longer actively traded on the Exchange as of the applicable date, the fair market value of the Common Stock shall be the value as reasonably determined by the Administrator for purposes of the award in the circumstances. The Administrator also may adopt a different methodology for determining fair market value with respect to one or more awards if a different methodology is necessary or advisable to secure any intended favorable tax, legal or other treatment for the particular award(s) (for example, and without limitation, the Administrator may provide that fair market value for purposes of one or more awards will be based on an average of closing prices (or the average of high and low daily trading prices) for a specified period preceding the relevant date).
 
5.7
    Transfer Restrictions
.
 
5.7.1    
Limitations on Exercise and Transfer
. Unless otherwise expressly provided in (or pursuant to) this Section 5.7 or required by applicable law: (a) all awards are non-transferable and shall not be subject in any manner to sale, transfer, anticipation, alienation, assignment, pledge, encumbrance or charge; (b) awards shall be exercised only by the participant; and (c) amounts payable or shares issuable pursuant to any award shall be delivered only to (or for the account of) the participant.
 
5.7.2    
Exceptions
. The Administrator may permit awards to be exercised by and paid to, or otherwise transferred to, other persons or entities pursuant to such conditions and procedures, including limitations on subsequent transfers, as the Administrator may, in its sole discretion, establish in writing. Any permitted transfer shall be subject to compliance with applicable federal and state securities laws and shall not be for value (other than nominal consideration, settlement of marital property rights, or for interests in an entity in which more than 50% of the voting interests are held by the Eligible Person or by the Eligible Person's family members).
 
5.7.3    
Further Exceptions to Limits on Transfer
. The exercise and transfer restrictions in Section 5.7.1 shall not apply to:
 
(a)    transfers to the Corporation (for example, in connection with the expiration or termination of the award),
(b)    the designation of a beneficiary to receive benefits in the event of the participant's
 
 
 
death or, if the participant has died, transfers to or exercise by the participant's beneficiary, or, in the absence of a validly designated beneficiary, transfers by will or the laws of descent and distribution,    
(c)    subject to any applicable limitations on ISOs, transfers to a family member (or former family member) pursuant to a domestic relations order if approved or ratified by the Administrator,
(d)    if the participant has suffered a disability, permitted transfers or exercises on behalf of the participant by his or her legal representative, or
(e)    the authorization by the Administrator of cashless exercise procedures with third parties who provide financing for the purpose of (or who otherwise facilitate) the exercise of awards consistent with applicable laws and the express authorization of the Administrator.
5.8    
International Awards
. One or more awards may be granted to Eligible Persons who provide services to the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries outside of the United States. Any awards granted to such persons may be granted pursuant to the terms and conditions of any applicable sub-plans, if any, appended to this Plan and approved by the Administrator.
 
6.
EFFECT OF TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT OR SERVICE ON AWARDS
 
6.1    
General
. The Administrator shall establish the effect of a termination of employment or service on the rights and benefits under each award under this Plan and in so doing may make distinctions based upon, inter alia, the cause of termination and type of award. If the participant is not an employee of the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries and provides other services to the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries, the Administrator shall be the sole judge for purposes of this Plan (unless a contract or the award otherwise provides) of whether the participant continues to render services to the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries and the date, if any, upon which such services shall be deemed to have terminated.
 
6.2    
Events Not Deemed Terminations of Service
. Unless the express policy of the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries, or the Administrator, otherwise provides, the employment relationship shall not be considered terminated in the case of (a) sick leave, (b) military leave, or (c) any other leave of absence authorized by the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries, or the Administrator; provided that, unless reemployment upon the expiration of such leave is guaranteed by contract or law or the Administrator otherwise provides, such leave is for a period of not more than three months. In the case of any employee of the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries on an approved leave of absence, continued vesting of the award while on leave from the employ of the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries may be suspended until the employee returns to service, unless the Administrator otherwise provides or applicable law otherwise requires. In no event shall an award be exercised after the expiration of the term set forth in the applicable award agreement.
 
6.3    
Effect of Change of Subsidiary Status
. For purposes of this Plan and any award, if an entity ceases to be a Subsidiary of the Corporation a termination of employment or service
 
 
 
shall be deemed to have occurred with respect to each Eligible Person in respect of such Subsidiary who does not continue as an Eligible Person in respect of the Corporation or another Subsidiary that continues as such after giving effect to the transaction or other event giving rise to the change in status unless the Subsidiary that is sold, spun-off or otherwise divested (or its successor or a direct or indirect parent of such Subsidiary or successor) assumes the Eligible Person's award(s) in connection with such transaction.
 
7.
ADJUSTMENTS; ACCELERATION
 
7.1    
Adjustments
. Subject to Section 7.2, upon (or, as may be necessary to effect the adjustment, immediately prior to): any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a stock split in the form of a stock dividend) or reverse stock split; any merger, combination, consolidation, or other reorganization; any spin-off, split-up, or similar extraordinary dividend distribution in respect of the Common Stock; or any exchange of Common Stock or other securities of the Corporation, or any similar, unusual or extraordinary corporate transaction in respect of the Common Stock; then the Administrator shall equitably and proportionately adjust (1) the number and type of shares of Common Stock (or other securities) that thereafter may be made the subject of awards (including the specific share limits, maximums and numbers of shares set forth elsewhere in this Plan), (2) the number, amount and type of shares of Common Stock (or other securities or property) subject to any outstanding awards, (3) the grant, purchase, or exercise price (which term includes the base price of any SAR or similar right) of any outstanding awards, and/or (4) the securities, cash or other property deliverable upon exercise or payment of any outstanding awards, in each case to the extent necessary to preserve (but not increase) the level of incentives intended by this Plan and the then-outstanding awards.
Unless otherwise expressly provided in the applicable award agreement, upon (or, as may be necessary to effect the adjustment, immediately prior to) any event or transaction described in the preceding paragraph or a sale of all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Corporation as an entirety, the Administrator shall equitably and proportionately adjust the performance standards applicable to any then-outstanding performance-based awards to the extent necessary to preserve (but not increase) the level of incentives intended by this Plan and the then-outstanding performance-based awards.
It is intended that, if possible, any adjustments contemplated by the preceding two paragraphs be made in a manner that satisfies applicable U.S. legal, tax (including, without limitation and as applicable in the circumstances, Section 424 of the Code, Section 409A of the Code and Section 162(m) of the Code) and accounting (so as to not trigger any charge to earnings with respect to such adjustment) requirements.
Without limiting the generality of Section 3.3, any good faith determination by the Administrator as to whether an adjustment is required in the circumstances pursuant to this Section 7.1, and the extent and nature of any such adjustment, shall be conclusive and binding on all persons.
7.2    
Corporate Transactions - Assumption and Termination of Awards
. Upon the occurrence of any of the following: any merger, combination, consolidation, or other reorganization in connection with which the Corporation does not survive (or does not survive as a public company in respect of its Common Stock); any exchange of Common Stock or other
 
 
 
securities of the Corporation in connection with which the Corporation does not survive (or does not survive as a public company in respect of its Common Stock); a sale of all or substantially all the business, stock or assets of the Corporation in connection with which the Corporation does not survive (or does not survive as a public company in respect of its Common Stock); a dissolution of the Corporation; or any other event in which the Corporation does not survive (or does not survive as a public company in respect of its Common Stock); then the Administrator may make provision for a cash payment in settlement of, or for the termination, assumption, substitution or exchange of any or all outstanding share-based awards or the cash, securities or property deliverable to the holder of any or all outstanding share-based awards, based upon, to the extent relevant under the circumstances, the distribution or consideration payable to holders of the Common Stock upon or in respect of such event. Upon the occurrence of any event described in the preceding sentence, then, unless the Administrator has made a provision for the substitution, assumption, exchange or other continuation or settlement of the award or (unless the Administrator has provided for the termination of the award) the award would otherwise continue in accordance with its terms in the circumstances: (1) unless otherwise provided in the applicable award agreement, each then-outstanding option and SAR shall become fully vested,     all shares of restricted stock then outstanding shall fully vest free of restrictions, and each other award granted under this Plan that is then outstanding shall become payable to the holder of such award; and (2) each award shall terminate upon the related event; provided that the holder of an option or SAR shall be given reasonable advance notice of the impending termination and a reasonable opportunity to exercise his or her outstanding vested options and SARs (after giving effect to any accelerated vesting required in the circumstances) in accordance with their terms before the termination of such awards (except that in no case shall more than ten days' notice of the impending termination be required and any acceleration of vesting and any exercise of any portion of an award that is so accelerated may be made contingent upon the actual occurrence of the event).
    
The Administrator may adopt such valuation methodologies for outstanding awards as it deems reasonable in the event of a cash or property settlement and, in the case of options, SARs or similar rights, but without limitation on other methodologies, may base such settlement solely upon the excess if any of the per share amount payable upon or in respect of such event over the exercise or base price of the award.
In any of the events referred to in this Section 7.2, the Administrator may take such action contemplated by this Section 7.2 prior to such event (as opposed to on the occurrence of such event) to the extent that the Administrator deems the action necessary to permit the participant to realize the benefits intended to be conveyed with respect to the underlying shares. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrator may deem an acceleration to occur immediately prior to the applicable event and, in such circumstances, will reinstate the original terms of the award if an event giving rise to an acceleration does not occur.
Without limiting the generality of Section 3.3, any good faith determination by the Administrator pursuant to its authority under this Section 7.2 shall be conclusive and binding on all persons.
7.3    
Other Acceleration Rules
. The Administrator may override the provisions of Section 7.2 by express provision in the award agreement and may accord any Eligible Person a right to
 
 
 
refuse any acceleration, whether pursuant to the award agreement or otherwise, in such circumstances as the Administrator may approve. The portion of any ISO accelerated in connection with an event referred to in Section 7.2 (or such other circumstances as may trigger accelerated vesting of the award) shall remain exercisable as an ISO only to the extent the applicable $100,000 limitation on ISOs is not exceeded. To the extent exceeded, the accelerated portion of the option shall be exercisable as a nonqualified stock option under the Code.
 
7.4    
Definition of Change in Control
. With respect to a particular award granted under this Plan, a Change in Control shall be deemed to have occurred as of the first day, after the date of grant of the particular award, that any one or more of the following conditions shall have been satisfied:
 
(i)    the consummation of:
(A)    any consolidation or merger of the Corporation in which the Corporation is not the continuing or surviving corporation or pursuant to which shares of common stock of the Corporation would be converted into cash, securities or other property, other than a merger of the Corporation in which the holders of common stock of the Corporation immediately prior to the merger have the same proportionate ownership of common stock of the surviving corporation immediately after the merger; or
(B)    any sale, lease, exchange or other transfer (in one transaction or a series of related transactions) of all, or substantially all, the assets of the Corporation.
(ii)    at any time during a period of twenty-four (24) months, fewer than a majority of the members of the Board are Incumbent Directors. For these purposes, 
Incumbent Directors
 means (A) individuals who constitute the Board at the beginning of such period; and (B) individuals who were nominated or elected by all of, or a committee composed entirely of, the individuals described in (A); and (C) individuals who were nominated or elected by individuals described in (B).
(iii)    any Person (meaning any individual, entity or group within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) or 14(d) of the Exchange Act) shall, as a result of a tender or exchange offer, open market purchases, privately-negotiated purchases or otherwise, become the beneficial owner (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of the then-outstanding securities of the Corporation ordinarily (and apart from rights accruing under special circumstances) having the right to vote in the election of members of the Board (Voting Securities to be calculated as provided in paragraph (d) of Rule 13d-3 in the case of rights to acquire common stock of the Corporation) representing 20% or more of the combined voting power of the then-outstanding Voting Securities.
(iv)    approval by the stockholders of the Corporation of any plan or proposal for the liquidation or dissolution of the Corporation.
Unless the Board shall determine otherwise, a Change of Control shall not be deemed to have occurred by reason of any corporate reorganization, merger, consolidation, transfer of assets, liquidating distribution or other transaction entered into solely by and between the
 
 
 
Corporation and any affiliate thereof, provided such transaction has been approved by at least two-thirds (2/3) of the Incumbent Directors (as defined above) then in office and voting.
 
8.1    
Compliance with Laws
. This Plan, the granting and vesting of awards under this Plan, the offer, issuance and delivery of shares of Common Stock, and/or the payment of money under this Plan or under awards are subject to compliance with all applicable federal and state laws, rules and regulations (including but not limited to state and federal securities law and federal margin requirements) and to such approvals by any listing, regulatory or governmental authority as may, in the opinion of counsel for the Corporation, be necessary or advisable in connection therewith. The person acquiring any securities under this Plan will, if requested by the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries, provide such assurances and representations to the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries as the Administrator may deem necessary or desirable to assure compliance with all applicable legal and accounting requirements.
 
8.2    
No Rights to Award
. No person shall have any claim or rights to be granted an award (or additional awards, as the case may be) under this Plan, subject to any express contractual rights (set forth in a document other than this Plan) to the contrary.
 
8.3    
No Employment/Service Contract
. Nothing contained in this Plan (or in any other documents under this Plan or in any award) shall confer upon any Eligible Person or other participant any right to continue in the employ or other service of the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries, constitute any contract or agreement of employment or other service or affect an employee's status as an employee at will, nor shall interfere in any way with the right of the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries to change a person's compensation or other benefits, or to terminate his or her employment or other service, with or without cause. Nothing in this Section 8.3, however, is intended to adversely affect any express independent right of such person under a separate employment or service contract other than an award agreement.
 
8.4    
Plan Not Funded
. Awards payable under this Plan shall be payable in shares or from the general assets of the Corporation, and no special or separate reserve, fund or deposit shall be made to assure payment of such awards. No participant, beneficiary or other person shall have any right, title or interest in any fund or in any specific asset (including shares of Common Stock, except as expressly otherwise provided) of the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries by reason of any award hereunder. Neither the provisions of this Plan (or of any related documents), nor the creation or adoption of this Plan, nor any action taken pursuant to the provisions of this Plan shall create, or be construed to create, a trust of any kind or a fiduciary relationship between the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries and any participant, beneficiary or other person. To the extent that a participant, beneficiary or other person acquires a right to receive payment pursuant to any award hereunder, such right shall be no greater than the right of any unsecured general creditor of the Corporation.
 
8.5    
Tax Withholding
. Upon any exercise, vesting, or payment of any award, or upon the disposition of shares of Common Stock acquired pursuant to the exercise of an ISO prior to satisfaction of the holding period requirements of Section 422 of the Code, or upon any
 
 
 
other tax withholding event with respect to any award, the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries shall have the right at its option to:
 
(a)    require the participant (or the participant's personal representative or beneficiary, as the case may be) to pay or provide for payment of at least the minimum amount of any taxes which the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries may be required to withhold with respect to such award event or payment; or
(b)    deduct from any amount otherwise payable in cash (whether related to the award or otherwise) to the participant (or the participant's personal representative or beneficiary, as the case may be) the minimum amount of any taxes which the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries may be required to withhold with respect to such award event or payment.
In any case where a tax is required to be withheld in connection with the delivery of shares of Common Stock under this Plan, the Administrator may in its sole discretion (subject to Section 8.1) require or grant (either at the time of the award or thereafter) to the participant the right to elect, pursuant to such rules and subject to such conditions as the Administrator may establish, that the Corporation reduce the number of shares to be delivered by (or otherwise reacquire) the appropriate number of shares, valued in a consistent manner at their fair market value or at the sales price in accordance with authorized procedures for cashless exercises, necessary to satisfy the minimum applicable withholding obligation on exercise, vesting or payment. In no event shall the shares withheld exceed the minimum whole number of shares required for tax withholding under applicable law.
8.6    
Effective Date, Termination and Suspension, Amendments
.
 
8.6.1    
Effective Date
. This Plan is effective as of March 13, 2008, the date of its approval by the Board (the 
Effective Date
). This Plan shall be submitted for and subject to stockholder approval no later than twelve months after the Effective Date. Unless earlier terminated by the Board, this Plan shall terminate at the close of business on the day before the tenth anniversary of the Effective Date. After the termination of this Plan either upon such stated expiration date or its earlier termination by the Board, no additional awards may be granted under this Plan, but previously granted awards (and the authority of the Administrator with respect thereto, including the authority to amend such awards) shall remain outstanding in accordance with their applicable terms and conditions and the terms and conditions of this Plan.
 
8.6.2    
Board Authorization
. The Board may, at any time, terminate or, from time to time, amend, modify or suspend this Plan, in whole or in part. No awards may be granted during any period that the Board suspends this Plan.
 
8.6.3    
Stockholder Approval
. To the extent then required by applicable law or any applicable listing agency or required under Sections 162, 422 or 424 of the Code to preserve the intended tax consequences of this Plan, or deemed necessary or advisable by the Board, any amendment to this Plan shall be subject to stockholder approval.
 
8.6.4    
Amendments to Awards
. Without limiting any other express authority of the Administrator under (but subject to) the express limits of this Plan, the Administrator by
 
 
 
agreement or resolution may waive conditions of or limitations on awards to participants that the Administrator in the prior exercise of its discretion has imposed, without the consent of a participant, and (subject to the requirements of Sections 3.2 and 8.6.5) may make other changes to the terms and conditions of awards. Any amendment or other action that would constitute a repricing of an award is subject to the limitations set forth in Section 3.2.
 
8.6.5    
Limitations on Amendments to Plan and Awards
. No amendment, suspension or termination of this Plan or amendment of any outstanding award agreement shall, without written consent of the participant, affect in any manner materially adverse to the participant any rights or benefits of the participant or obligations of the Corporation under any award granted under this Plan prior to the effective date of such change. Changes, settlements and other actions contemplated by Section 7 shall not be deemed to constitute changes or amendments for purposes of this Section 8.6.
 
8.7    
Privileges of Stock Ownership
. Except as otherwise expressly authorized by the Administrator, a participant shall not be entitled to any privilege of stock ownership as to any shares of Common Stock not actually delivered to and held of record by the participant. Except as expressly required by Section 7.1 or otherwise expressly provided by the Administrator, no adjustment will be made for dividends or other rights as a stockholder for which a record date is prior to such date of delivery.
 
8.8    
Governing Law; Construction; Severability
.
 
8.8.1    
Choice of Law
. This Plan, the awards, all documents evidencing awards and all other related documents shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware.
 
8.8.2    
Severability
. If a court of competent jurisdiction holds any provision invalid and unenforceable, the remaining provisions of this Plan shall continue in effect.
        
8.8.3    
Plan Construction
.
 
(a)    
Rule 16b-3
. It is the intent of the Corporation that the awards and transactions permitted by awards be interpreted in a manner that, in the case of participants who are or may be subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, qualify, to the maximum extent compatible with the express terms of the award, for exemption from matching liability under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Corporation shall have no liability to any participant for Section 16 consequences of awards or events under awards if an award or event does not so qualify.
(b)    
Section 162(m)
. Awards under Section 5.1.4 to persons described in Section 5.2 that are either granted or become vested, exercisable or payable based on attainment of one or more performance goals related to the Business Criteria, as well as Qualifying Options and Qualifying SARs granted to persons described in Section 5.2, that are approved by a committee composed solely of two or more outside directors (as this requirement is
 
 
 
applied under Section 162(m) of the Code) shall be deemed to be intended as performance-based compensation within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code unless such committee provides otherwise at the time of grant of the award. It is the further intent of the Corporation that (to the extent the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries or awards under this Plan may be or become subject to limitations on deductibility under Section 162(m) of the Code) any such awards and any other Performance-Based Awards under Section 5.2 that are granted to or held by a person subject to Section 162(m) will qualify as performance-based compensation or otherwise be exempt from deductibility limitations under Section 162(m).
8.9    
Captions
. Captions and headings are given to the sections and subsections of this Plan solely as a convenience to facilitate reference. Such headings shall not be deemed in any way material or relevant to the construction or interpretation of this Plan or any provision thereof.    
 
8.10    
Stock-Based Awards in Substitution for Stock Options or Awards Granted by Other Corporation
.
Awards may be granted to Eligible Persons in substitution for or in connection with an assumption of employee stock options, SARs, restricted stock or other stock-based awards granted by other entities to persons who are or who will become Eligible Persons in respect of the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries, in connection with a distribution, merger or other reorganization by or with the granting entity or an affiliated entity, or the acquisition by the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, of all or a substantial part of the stock or assets of the employing entity. The awards so granted need not comply with other specific terms of this Plan, provided the awards reflect only adjustments giving effect to the assumption or substitution consistent with the conversion applicable to the Common Stock in the transaction and any change in the issuer of the security. Any shares that are delivered and any awards that are granted by, or become obligations of, the Corporation, as a result of the assumption by the Corporation of, or in substitution for, outstanding awards previously granted by an acquired company (or previously granted by a predecessor employer (or direct or indirect parent thereof) in the case of persons that become employed by the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries in connection with a business or asset acquisition or similar transaction) shall not be counted against the Share Limit or other limits on the number of shares available for issuance under this Plan.
 
8.11    
Non-Exclusivity of Plan
. Nothing in this Plan shall limit or be deemed to limit the authority of the Board or the Administrator to grant awards or authorize any other compensation, with or without reference to the Common Stock, under any other plan or authority.
 
8.12    
No Corporate Action Restriction
. The existence of this Plan, the award agreements and the awards granted hereunder shall not limit, affect or restrict in any way the right or power of the Board or the stockholders of the Corporation to make or authorize: (a) any adjustment, recapitalization, reorganization or other change in the capital structure or business of the Corporation or any Subsidiary, (b) any merger, amalgamation, consolidation or change in the ownership of the Corporation or any Subsidiary, (c) any issue of bonds, debentures, capital, preferred or prior preference stock ahead of or affecting the capital stock (or the rights thereof) of the Corporation or any Subsidiary, (d) any
 
 
 
dissolution or liquidation of the Corporation or any Subsidiary, (e) any sale or transfer of all or any part of the assets or business of the Corporation or any Subsidiary, or (f) any other corporate act or proceeding by the Corporation or any Subsidiary. No participant, beneficiary or any other person shall have any claim under any award or award agreement against any member of the Board or the Administrator, or the Corporation or any employees, officers or agents of the Corporation or any Subsidiary, as a result of any such action.
 
8.13    
Other Company Benefit and Compensation Programs
. Payments and other benefits received by a participant under an award made pursuant to this Plan shall not be deemed a part of a participant's compensation for purposes of the determination of benefits under any other employee welfare or benefit plans or arrangements, if any, provided by the Corporation or any Subsidiary, except where the Administrator expressly otherwise provides or authorizes in writing. Awards under this Plan may be made in addition to, in combination with, as alternatives to or in payment of grants, awards or commitments under any other plans or arrangements of the Corporation or its Subsidiaries.
 
8.14    
Clawback Policy
. The awards granted under this Plan are subject to the terms of the Corporation's recoupment, clawback or similar policy as it may be in effect from time to time, as well as any similar provisions of applicable law, any of which could in certain circumstances require repayment or forfeiture of awards or any shares of Common Stock or other cash or property received with respect to the awards (including any value received from a disposition of the shares acquired upon payment of the awards).

Exhibit 99.1
 
Investor Update - June 13, 2011
References in this update to Air Group, Company, we, us, and our refer to Alaska Air Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise specified.
Note to Investors
Beginning May 14, 2011, SkyWest Airlines, Inc. (SkyWest) began flying certain routes under a capacity purchase arrangement with Alaska Airlines, Inc. (Alaska).  As such, the consolidated data includes regional flying performed under CPA arrangements with Horizon Air Industries, Inc. (Horizon), SkyWest and other third parties.
Information about Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This update includes forecasted operational and financial information for our consolidated and mainline operations. Our disclosure of operating cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel and other items, provides us (and may provide investors) with the ability to measure and monitor our performance without these items. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is total operating expense per available seat mile. However, due to the large fluctuations in fuel prices, we are unable to predict total operating expense for any future period with any degree of certainty. In addition, we believe the disclosure of fuel expense on an economic basis is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. Please see the cautionary statement under Forward-Looking Information.
We are providing unaudited information about fuel price movements and the impact of our hedging program on our financial results. Management believes it is useful to compare results between periods on an economic basis.
Economic fuel expense
is defined as the raw or into-plane fuel cost less any cash we receive from hedge counterparties for hedges that settle during the period, offset by the recognition of premiums originally paid for those hedges that settle during the period. Economic fuel expense more closely approximates the net cash outflow associated with purchasing fuel for our operation.
Forward-Looking Information
This update contains forward-looking statements subject to the safe harbor protection provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements relate to future events and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual outcomes to be materially different from those indicated by any forward-looking statements. For a comprehensive discussion of potential risk factors, see Item 1A of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010. Some of these risks include general economic conditions, increases in operating costs including fuel, competition, labor costs and relations, our significant indebtedness, inability to meet cost reduction goals, seasonal fluctuations in our financial results, an aircraft accident, and changes in laws and regulations. All of the forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the risk factors discussed therein. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risk factors emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict such new risk factors, nor can it assess the impact, if any, of such new risk factors on our business or events described in any forward-looking statements. We expressly disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date of this report to conform them to actual results. Over time, our actual results, performance or achievements will likely differ from the anticipated results, performance or achievements that are expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements, and such differences might be significant and materially adverse.

Fleet Transition Charges
All of the CRJ-700 aircraft have been removed from Horizon's operating fleet as of May 31, 2011. The charge for the second quarter of 2011 is expected to be approximately $18 million to $20 million. This charge is excluded from our unit cost forecast above.
Nonoperating Expense
We expect that our consolidated nonoperating expense will be approximately $13 million in the second quarter of 2011.
Share Repurchase
On June 10, 2011, our Board of Directors authorized another $50 million share repurchase. The authorization will expire on June 10, 2012. Since 2007, the Company has repurchased over 7.5 million shares of its common stock for approximately $212 million.

Future Fuel Hedge Positions
 
(a)
We use both call options on crude oil futures and swap instruments on LA Jet refining margins to hedge against price volatility of future jet fuel consumption. We have refining margin swaps in place for approximately 50% of our second quarter 2011 estimated jet fuel purchases at an average price of 59 cents per gallon and 36% of our third quarter 2011 estimated purchases at an average price of 72 cents per gallon. Our crude oil positions are as follows:
(a)
    All of our future oil positions are call options, which are designed to effectively cap the cost of the crude oil component of our jet fuel purchases. With call options, we benefit from a decline in crude oil prices, as there is no cash outlay other than the premiums we pay to enter into the contracts.

Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
(e) Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
On June 20, 2011, the Board of Directors (the Board) of Alaska Air Group, Inc. (the Company) approved amendments to the Company's 1995 Elected Officers Supplementary Retirement Plan (the Supplementary Retirement Plan). The Supplementary Retirement Plan is a nonqualified defined benefit plan maintained for the benefit of eligible officers of the Company, including named executive officers William S. Ayer, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, Glenn S. Johnson, the President of Horizon Air, and Bradley D. Tilden, the President of Alaska Airlines, and has been closed to new participants since April 1, 2003. The monthly amount of an officer's benefit under the plan is a percentage between 50% and 75% of the officer's average monthly base salary, with the specific percentage determined based on the officer's years of service with the Company and years of service as an elected officer. The benefit amount is subject to offset by the amount of the officer's Social Security benefits and benefits paid under the Company's tax-qualified defined benefit plan that accrued after the officer became eligible to participate in the Supplementary Retirement Plan. Effective January 1, 2014, the Supplementary Retirement Plan will be frozen so that participants in the plan will not accrue any benefits with respect to services performed or compensation earned on or after that date. The Board also approved similar amendments to the Company's tax-qualified defined benefit plan for salaried employees.
The Board also approved amendments to the Defined Contribution OSRP program under the Company's Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan (the DC OSRP Program). Under the DC OSRP Program, the Company contributes an amount to a participating officer's account under the program equal to a specified percentage of the officer's compensation for a particular year, less the maximum amount that the Company could have contributed under applicable law to the officer's account under the Company's tax-qualified plan for that year. Currently, officers are not eligible to participate in the DC OSRP Program if they participate in the Supplementary Retirement Plan. The amendments to the DC OSRP Program provide that, effective January 1, 2014, officers who previously participated in the Supplementary Retirement Plan, including the named executive officers identified above, and who are then employed by the Company will be eligible to participate in the DC OSRP Program with the percentage used to determine the annual amount of the Company contribution to the DC OSRP Program for each such officer being 12%.
The foregoing description of the Company's benefit plans is qualified in its entirety by the terms and provisions of the applicable benefit plan. The Company intends to file the Supplementary Retirement Plan and the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan, each as amended as described above, with the Company's report on Form 10-Q for the current fiscal quarter.

ALASKA AIR GROUP REPORTS RECORD ADJUSTED SECOND QUARTER RESULTS
    
Second
quarter highlights:
SEATTLE - Alaska Air Group, Inc. (NYSE: ALK) today reported
second
quarter
2011
net income of
$28.8 million
, or
$0.78
per diluted share, compared to net income of
$58.6 million
, or
$1.60
per diluted share, in the
second
quarter of
2010
. Excluding mark-to-market fuel hedge losses of
$70.9 million
(
$44.1 million
after tax, or
$1.21
per diluted share) and fleet transition costs of
$26.8 million
(
$16.7 million
after tax, or
$0.45
per diluted share), the company reported record
second
quarter 2011 net income of
$89.6 million
, or
$2.44
per diluted share, compared to net income of
$84.0 million
, or
$2.29

diluted share, excluding special items in the
second
quarter of
2010
.
"I am pleased to report our fifth consecutive record quarterly adjusted profit, in spite of a nearly 50 percent rise in our economic fuel costs," Chairman and CEO Bill Ayer said. "Passenger revenues improved by
$128 million
, both through higher load factors and fares, covering the increased cost of fuel. I couldn't be more proud of our team for our record-breaking financial and operational performance in such a challenging environment. And we're especially honored that Alaska was awarded its fourth consecutive J.D. Power award. I want to give a huge thanks to our folks who are working hard every day to take care of customers."
The following table reconciles the company's adjusted net income and earnings per diluted share (EPS) during the
second
quarters of
2011
and
2010
to amounts as reported in accordance with GAAP (in millions except per-share amounts):
 
Statistical data, as well as a reconciliation of the reported non-GAAP financial measures, can be found in the accompanying tables. A glossary of financial terms can be found on page 4 of this release.

Note A:
 Pursuant to Regulation G, we are providing disclosure of the reconciliation of reported non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable financial measures reported on a GAAP basis. We believe that consideration of these non-GAAP financial measures may be important to investors for the following reasons:
Note B:
Air Group's operations are treated as an integrated route network intended to maximize the results of the company. However, the Company has historically had two primary operating and reporting segments, consisting of Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air, for which separate financial information is available and regularly evaluated by our chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance.
Alaska operates a fleet of passenger jets ("mainline operations") and contracts with affiliated (Horizon) and non-affiliated third party carriers for regional capacity under which Alaska receives all passenger revenue from those flights. Horizon operates a fleet of turboprop and regional jet aircraft and sells all of its capacity to Alaska pursuant to a capacity purchase arrangement (the Horizon CPA). The Horizon CPA reflects what the Company believes are current market rates received by other regional carriers for similar flying. Amounts paid by Alaska to Horizon are available to pay for various Horizon operating expenses such as crew expenses, maintenance, and aircraft ownership costs.
Effective January 1, 2011, Horizon's business model changed such that 100% of its capacity is sold to Alaska under the Horizon CPA. As is typical for similar arrangements, certain costs such landing fees, selling and distribution costs, and fuel costs directly related to regional flights operated by Horizon are now recorded by Alaska. Because of this change, Horizon's revenues and expenses and Alaska's Regional revenues and expenses have changed significantly on a year over year basis.
All inter-company revenues and expenses are eliminated in consolidated, and these changes have no impact on our consolidated results.

Exhibit 99.2
Investor Update -
July 21, 2011
References in this update to Air Group, Company, we, us, and our refer to Alaska Air Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise specified.
This update includes forecasted operational and financial information for our consolidated and mainline operations. Our disclosure of operating cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel and other items, provides us (and may provide investors) with the ability to measure and monitor our performance without these items. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is total operating expenses per available seat mile. However, due to the large fluctuations in fuel prices, we are unable to predict total operating expenses for any future period with any degree of certainty. In addition, we believe the disclosure of fuel expense on an economic basis is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. Please see the cautionary statement under Forward-Looking Information.
We are providing unaudited information about fuel price movements and the impact of our hedging program on our financial results. Management believes it is useful to compare results between periods on an economic basis.
Economic fuel expense
is defined as the raw or into-plane fuel cost less any cash we receive from hedge counterparties for hedges that settle during the period, offset by the recognition of premiums originally paid for those hedges that settle during the period. Economic fuel expense more closely approximates the net cash outflow associated with purchasing fuel for our operation.
Forward-Looking Information
This update contains forward-looking statements subject to the safe harbor protection provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements relate to future events and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual outcomes to be materially different from those indicated by any forward-looking statements.

All of the forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the risk factors discussed therein. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risk factors emerge from time to time.

Future Financing and Debt Prepayment
In July 2011, we financed six Bombardier Q400 aircraft that were delivered earlier this year, generating $106 million of net proceeds.
We expect to use the proceeds to prepay existing company debt during the remainder of the year. There should be no material incremental debt as a result of these transactions.
Nonoperating Expense
We expect that our consolidated nonoperating expense will be approximately $18 million in the third quarter of 2011. This includes costs of approximately $6 million associated with the prepayment of certain aircraft debt.
Capital Expenditures
Total expected gross capital expenditures for 2011 and 2012 are as follows (in millions): 
Firm Aircraft Commitments
The tables below reflect the current delivery schedules for firm aircraft as of
July 21, 2011
:  
In addition to the firm orders noted above, Air Group has options to acquire 42 additional B737 aircraft and 10 Q400 aircraft.
Projected Fleet Count
Future Fuel Hedge Positions
 
(a)
We use both call options on crude oil futures and swap instruments on LA Jet refining margins to hedge against price volatility of future jet fuel consumption. We have refining margin swaps in place for approximately 50% of our third quarter 2011 estimated jet fuel purchases at an average price of 75 cents per gallon. Our crude oil positions are as follows:
(a)
All of our future oil positions are call options, which are designed to effectively cap the cost of the crude oil component of our jet fuel purchases. With call options, we benefit from a decline in crude oil prices, as there is no cash outlay other than the premiums we pay to enter into the contracts.
Fuel Price Sensitivity
Given our current fuel-hedge portfolio and actual fuel costs through June 30, 2011, the following table depicts the sensitivity of fuel prices under various crude oil and refining margin future prices for the full year 2011:

Investor Update - October 6, 2011
Note to Investors
This abbreviated Investor Update is being provided to communicate certain actual third quarter 2011 mainline and consolidated operating statistics. It includes forecasted mainline and consolidated unit cost (excluding fuel) and passenger unit revenue (PRASM) information, estimated economic fuel cost per gallon for the quarter, and expected consolidated non-operating expense.  
Unit revenue, unit cost and other financial forecasts are estimates only. Actual amounts reported may differ and are dependent on our normal quarter-end closing process.
A full Investor Update with information about fuel hedge positions, planned capital expenditures, fleet information, and share repurchase activity will be provided in connection with our third quarter earnings release scheduled for October 20, 2011.
References in this update to Air Group, Company, we, us, and our refer to Alaska Air Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise specified.
Information about Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
Our disclosure of operating cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel and other items, provides us (and may provide investors) with the ability to measure and monitor our performance without these items. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is total operating expense per available seat mile. However, due to the volatility of fuel prices, we are unable to predict total operating expense for any future period with any degree of certainty. In addition, we believe the disclosure of fuel expense on an economic basis is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. Please see the cautionary statement under Forward-Looking Information.
We are providing expected fuel cost information, including the impact of our hedging program on our financial results. Management believes it is useful to compare results between periods on an economic basis.
Economic fuel expense is defined as the raw or into-plane fuel cost less any cash we receive from hedge counterparties for hedges that settle during the period, offset by the recognition of premiums originally paid for those hedges that settle during the period. Economic fuel expense more closely approximates the net cash outflow associated with purchasing fuel for our operation.
Forward-Looking Information 
This update contains forward-looking statements subject to the safe harbor protection provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements relate to future events and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual outcomes to be materially different from those indicated by any forward-looking statements. For a comprehensive discussion of potential risk factors, see Item 1A of the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010. Some of these risks include general economic conditions, increases in operating costs including fuel, competition, labor costs and relations, our significant indebtedness, inability to meet cost reduction goals, seasonal fluctuations in our financial results, an aircraft accident, and changes in laws and regulations. All of the forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the risk factors discussed therein. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risk factors emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict such new risk factors, nor can it assess the impact, if any, of such new risk factors on our business or events described in any forward-looking statements. We expressly disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date of this report to conform them to actual results.

Note A:
 Pursuant to Regulation G, we are providing disclosure of the reconciliation of reported non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable financial measures reported on a GAAP basis. We believe that consideration of these non-GAAP financial measures may be important to investors for the following reasons:
Note B:
Air Group's operations are treated as an integrated route network intended to maximize the results of the company. However, the Company has historically had two primary operating and reporting segments, consisting of Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air, for which separate financial information is available and regularly evaluated by our chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance.
Alaska operates a fleet of passenger jets ("mainline operations") and contracts with affiliated (Horizon) and non-affiliated third party carriers for regional capacity under which Alaska receives all passenger revenue from those flights. Horizon operates a fleet of turboprop aircraft and sells all of its capacity to Alaska pursuant to a capacity purchase arrangement (the Horizon CPA). The Horizon CPA reflects what the Company believes are current market rates received by other regional carriers for similar flying. Amounts paid by Alaska to Horizon are available to pay for various Horizon operating expenses such as crew expenses, maintenance, and aircraft ownership costs.
Effective January 1, 2011, Horizon's business model changed such that 100% of its capacity is sold to Alaska under the Horizon CPA. As is typical for similar arrangements, certain costs such landing fees, selling and distribution costs, and fuel costs directly related to regional flights operated by Horizon are now recorded by Alaska. Because of this change, Horizon's revenues and expenses and Alaska's Regional revenues and expenses have changed significantly on a year over year basis.
All inter-company revenues and expenses are eliminated in consolidated, and these changes have no impact on our consolidated results.

We use both call options on crude oil futures and swap instruments on LA Jet refining margins to hedge against price volatility of future jet fuel consumption. We have refining margin swaps in place for approximately 50% of our fourth quarter 2011 estimated jet fuel purchases at an average price of 93 cents per gallon. Our crude oil positions are as follows:
(a)
All of our future oil positions are call options, which are designed to effectively cap the cost of the crude oil component of our jet fuel purchases. With call options, we benefit from a decline in crude oil prices, as there is no cash outlay other than the premiums we pay to enter into the contracts.
Fuel Price Sensitivity
Given our current fuel-hedge portfolio and actual fuel costs through September 30, 2011, the following table depicts the sensitivity of fuel prices under various crude oil and refining margin future prices for the full year 2011:

In addition, we believe the disclosure of fuel expense on an economic basis is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. Please see the cautionary statement under Forward-Looking Information.
We are providing unaudited information about fuel price movements and the impact of our hedging program on our financial results. Management believes it is useful to compare results between periods on an economic basis.
Economic fuel expense
is defined as the raw or into-plane fuel cost less any cash we receive from hedge counterparties for hedges that settle during the period, offset by the recognition of premiums originally paid for those hedges that settle during the period. Economic fuel expense more closely approximates the net cash outflow associated with purchasing fuel for our operation.
Forward-Looking Information
This update contains forward-looking statements subject to the safe harbor protection provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements relate to future events and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual outcomes to be materially different from those indicated by any forward-looking statements. For a comprehensive discussion of potential risk factors, see Item 1A of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010. Some of these risks include general economic conditions, increases in operating costs including fuel, competition, labor costs and relations, our significant indebtedness, inability to meet cost reduction goals, seasonal fluctuations in our financial results, an aircraft accident, and changes in laws and regulations. All of the forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the risk factors discussed therein. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risk factors emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict such new risk factors, nor can it assess the impact, if any, of such new risk factors on our business or events described in any forward-looking statements. We expressly disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date of this report to conform them to actual results. Over time, our actual results, performance or achievements will likely differ from the anticipated results, performance or achievements that are expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements, and such differences might be significant and materially adverse.

This update includes forecasted operational and financial information for our consolidated and mainline operations. Our disclosure of operating cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel and other items, provides us (and may provide investors) with the ability to measure and monitor our performance without these items.

Note A:
 Pursuant to Regulation G, we are providing disclosure of the reconciliation of reported non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable financial measures reported on a GAAP basis. We believe that consideration of these non-GAAP financial measures may be important to investors for the following reasons:
Note B:
Air Group's operations are treated as an integrated route network intended to maximize the results of the company. However, the Company has historically had two primary operating and reporting segments, consisting of Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air, for which separate financial information is available and regularly evaluated by our chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance.
Alaska operates a fleet of passenger jets ("mainline operations") and contracts with affiliated (Horizon) and non-affiliated third party carriers for regional capacity under which Alaska receives all passenger revenue from those flights. Horizon operates a fleet of turboprop aircraft and sells all of its capacity to Alaska pursuant to a capacity purchase arrangement (the Horizon CPA). The Horizon CPA reflects what the Company believes are current market rates received by other regional carriers for similar flying. Amounts paid by Alaska to Horizon are for various Horizon operating expenses such as crew expenses, maintenance, and aircraft ownership costs.
Effective January 1, 2011, Horizon's business model changed such that 100% of its capacity is sold to Alaska under the Horizon CPA. As is typical for similar arrangements, certain costs such landing fees, selling and distribution costs, and fuel costs directly related to regional flights operated by Horizon are now recorded by Alaska. Because of this change, Horizon's revenues and expenses and Alaska's Regional revenues and expenses have changed significantly on a year over year basis.
All inter-company revenues and expenses are eliminated in consolidated, and these changes have no impact on our consolidated results.

Exhibit 99.2
Investor Update -
January 26, 2012
References in this update to Air Group, Company, we, us, and our refer to Alaska Air Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise specified.
This update includes forecasted operational and financial information for our consolidated and mainline operations. Our disclosure of operating cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel and other items, provides us (and may provide investors) with the ability to measure and monitor our performance without these items. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is total operating expenses per available seat mile. However, due to the large fluctuations in fuel prices, we are unable to predict total operating expenses for any future period with any degree of certainty. In addition, we believe the disclosure of fuel expense on an economic basis is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. Please see the cautionary statement under Forward-Looking Information.
We are providing information about estimated fuel prices and our hedging program. Management believes it is useful to compare results between periods on an economic basis.
Economic fuel expense
is defined as the raw or into-plane fuel cost less any cash we receive from hedge counterparties for hedges that settle during the period, offset by the recognition of premiums originally paid for those hedges that settle during the period. Economic fuel expense more closely approximates the net cash outflow associated with purchasing fuel for our operation.
Forward-Looking Information
This update contains forward-looking statements subject to the safe harbor protection provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

All of the forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the risk factors discussed therein. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risk factors emerge from time to time.

Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
 
On February 14, 2012, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the Committee) of Alaska Air Group, Inc.(the Company) took the following actions.
The Committee confirmed its philosophy to set base pay for senior-most executive officers below market, with an opportunity to earn market pay through short-term and long-term incentives if the Company performs well.
The Committee set compensation for Chairman and CEO Bill Ayer, who will step down as CEO on May 15, at levels that reflect his anticipated level of service in his continuing role as executive chairman of the board. Mr. Ayer plans to reduce his service to approximately 25 percent of its former level; therefore, the Committee set his salary at $103,000, which represents 25 percent of his 2011 salary. Mr. Ayer received an equity award of 620 restricted stock units, consistent with the value of equity received by the Company's other board members.
Mr. Tilden will succeed Mr. Ayer as CEO of the Company and its airline subsidiaries effective May 15. In connection with Mr. Tilden's promotion, the Committee awarded him a special grant of 22,730 performance stock units. Mr. Tilden's base salary was set at $425,000, and he will participate in the Company's short-term annual cash incentive plan at a rate of 100 percent and in the long-term incentive equity plan at a target rate of 300 percent.
The Committee also set base salaries for the Company's other Named Executive Officers:  President of Horizon Air Industries, Inc. (Horizon) Glenn Johnson, $320,000; Alaska Chief Operating Officer Ben Minicucci,  $317,500; and Alaska Air Group Vice President/Finance and Chief Financial Officer Brandon Pedersen, $280,000.
  
Performance-Based Pay plan (the Company's annual cash incentive plan) participation rates for the 2012 plan year for Messrs. Johnson and Minicucci remain at 75 percent, the same level established by the Committee in 2011. The Committee increased Mr. Pedersen's plan participation rate from 65 percent in 2011 to 75 percent in 2012. Participation rates are expressed as a percentage of base salary for the fiscal year assuming target performance is achieved. The actual amounts paid under the PBP plan may be higher if the performance targets are exceeded or lower (or even 0 percent) if the targets are not met.
 
The Committee also approved grants of stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs) and performance stock units under the  Company's 2008 Performance Incentive Plan (PIP) to each of the Named Executive Officers. The table below presents the  number of shares subject to each of these awards:
Each stock option award was granted with an exercise price of $76.00, the closing price on the New York Stock Exchange of a share of Alaska Air Group common stock on February 14, 2012. The stock options are scheduled to vest in annual installments over a four-year period. The RSUs are scheduled to vest on the third anniversary of the grant date and are payable upon vesting  in shares of Company common stock on a one-for-one basis. The performance units will be eligible to vest based 50 percent
on the Company's total shareholder return (TSR) relative to an airline peer group and 50 percent TSR relative to the S&P 500 companies measured over the three-year period commencing January 1, 2012. The airline peer group was chosen by the Committee on the advice of the Committee's independent compensation consultant. The percentage of the performance units that vest may range from 0 percent to 200 percent, depending on the Company's relative performance during that period. Vested performance units are payable in shares of Company common stock on a one-for-one basis.
The stock options, restricted stock unit awards and performance unit awards are evidenced by applicable forms of award agreement previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Exhibit 99.1
 
Investor Update -
March 13, 2012
References in this update to Air Group, Company, we, us, and our refer to Alaska Air Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise specified.
This update includes forecasted operational and financial information for our consolidated and mainline operations. Our disclosure of operating cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel and other items, provides us (and may provide investors) with the ability to measure and monitor our performance without these items. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is total operating expense per available seat mile. However, due to the large fluctuations in fuel prices, we are unable to predict total operating expense for any future period with any degree of certainty. In addition, we believe the disclosure of fuel expense on an economic basis is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. Please see the cautionary statement under Forward-Looking Information.
We are providing unaudited information about fuel price movements and the impact of our hedging program on our financial results. Management believes it is useful to compare results between periods on an economic basis.
Economic fuel expense
is defined as the raw or into-plane fuel cost less any cash we receive from hedge counterparties for hedges that settle during the period, offset by the recognition of premiums originally paid for those hedges that settle during the period. Economic fuel expense more closely approximates the net cash outflow associated with purchasing fuel for our operation.
Forward-Looking Information
This update contains forward-looking statements subject to the safe harbor protection provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements relate to future events and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual outcomes to be materially different from those indicated by any forward-looking statements. For a comprehensive discussion of potential risk factors, see Item 1A of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2011
. Some of these risks include general economic conditions, increases in operating costs including fuel, competition, labor costs and relations, our significant indebtedness, inability to meet cost reduction goals, seasonal fluctuations in our financial results, an aircraft accident, and changes in laws and regulations. All of the forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the risk factors discussed therein. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risk factors emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict such new risk factors, nor can it assess the impact, if any, of such new risk factors on our business or events described in any forward-looking statements. We expressly disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date of this report to conform them to actual results. Over time, our actual results, performance or achievements will likely differ from the anticipated results, performance or achievements that are expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements, and such differences might be significant and materially adverse.

Operational Results
SEATTLE
-
Alaska Air Group Inc. (NYSE: ALK) today reported
March
operational results for its subsidiaries, Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air, and on a combined basis. Detailed information is provided below.
ALASKA AIRLINES - MAINLINE
Alaska reported a
4.7 percent
increase in traffic on a
3.0 percent
increase in capacity compared to
March 2011
. This resulted in a
1.4
-point increase in load factor to a record
88.8 percent
, the highest load factor of any month in the Company's history. This also contributed to a record first quarter load factor of
85.7 percent
. Alaska reported
85.3 percent
of its flights arrived on time in
March
, compared to the
82.6 percent
reported in
March 2011

HORIZON AIR
Horizon reported a
15.2 percent
decline in March traffic on a
14.3 percent
decline in capacity compared to
March 2011
. This resulted in a
0.8
-point decrease in load factor to
78.3 percent
. Horizon also reported
88.1 percent
of its flights arrived on time in March, compared to the
80.2 percent
reported in
March 2011
. The significant decline in capacity and traffic for Horizon from the prior year is due primarily to the completion of Horizon's transition out of the CRJ-700 regional jet and a corresponding reduction in the size of Horizon's operating fleet from
54
aircraft at
March 31, 2011
, to
48
aircraft at
March 31, 2012
. This transition was completed in June 2011.

2012
, compared to the prior-year periods:

This update includes forecasted operational and financial information for our mainline and consolidated operations. Our disclosure of operating cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel and other items, provides us (and may provide investors) with the ability to measure and monitor our performance without these items.

Note A:
 Pursuant to Regulation G, we are providing disclosure of the reconciliation of reported non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable financial measures reported on a GAAP basis. We believe that consideration of these non-GAAP financial measures may be important to investors for the following reasons:
Note B:
Air Group has two operating airlines - Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air. Each is a regulated airline with separate management teams. To manage the two operating airlines, management views the business in three operating segments. Alaska operates a fleet of passenger jets (Alaska Mainline) and contracts with Horizon, SkyWest Airlines, Inc. (SkyWest), and Peninsula Airways, Inc. (PenAir) for regional capacity under which Alaska receives all passenger revenue from those flights (Alaska Regional). Horizon operates a fleet of turboprop aircraft and sells all of its capacity to Alaska pursuant to a capacity purchase arrangement (Horizon). The Company believes the amounts paid by Alaska to Horizon reflect current market rates received by other regional carriers for similar flying and are available to pay for various Horizon operating expenses such as crew expenses, maintenance, and aircraft ownership costs. All inter-company revenues and expenses between Alaska and Horizon are eliminated in consolidation.
8
Glossary of Terms
Alaska Mainline
- the 737 part of Alaska's business with average stage lengths greater than 1,000 miles.
Alaska Regional
- Alaska's shorter distance network. In this segment, we record actual onboard passenger revenue, less costs such as fuel, distribution costs, and payments made to Horizon, SkyWest and PenAir under Capacity Purchase Agreements (CPA).
Horizon
- Horizon operates regional aircraft. All of Horizon's capacity is sold to Alaska under a CPA. Expenses included those typically borne by regional airlines such as crew costs, ownership costs, and maintenance costs.
RPMs
- revenue passenger miles, or "traffic"; represents the number of seats that were filled with paying passengers; one passenger traveling one mile is one RPM.
ASMs
- available seat miles, or capacity; represents total seats available across the fleet multiplied by the number of miles flown.
Load Factor
- RPMs as a percentage of ASMs; represents the number of available seats that were filled with paying passengers.
Yield
- passenger revenue per RPM; represents the average revenue for flying one passenger one mile.
PRASM
- passenger revenue per ASM; commonly called passenger unit revenue.
RASM
- operating revenue per ASMs, or "unit revenue"; operating revenue includes all passenger revenue, freight and mail, Mileage Plan, and other ancillary revenue; represents the average total revenue for flying one seat one mile.
CASM
- operating costs per ASM, or "unit cost"; represents all operating expenses including fuel and special items.
CASMex
- operating costs excluding fuel and special items per ASM; this metric is used to help track progress toward reduction of non-fuel operating costs since fuel is largely out of our control.
Economic fuel
- best estimate of the cash cost of fuel, net of the impact of our fuel-hedging program.
Aircraft Utilization
- block hours per day; this represents the average number of hours our aircraft are flying.
Aircraft Stage Length
- represents the average miles flown per aircraft departure.
Diluted Earnings per Share
- represents earnings per share using fully diluted shares outstanding.
Diluted Shares -
represents the total number of shares that would be outstanding if all possible sources of conversion, such as stock options, were exercised.
Productivity -
number of revenue passengers per full-time equivalent employee.

However, due to the large fluctuations in fuel prices, we are unable to predict total operating expenses for any future period with any degree of certainty. In addition, we believe the disclosure of fuel expense on an economic basis is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. Please see the cautionary statement under Forward-Looking Information.
We are providing information about estimated fuel prices and our hedging program. Management believes it is useful to compare results between periods on an economic basis.
Economic fuel expense
is defined as the raw or into-plane fuel cost less any cash we receive from hedge counterparties for hedges that settle during the period, offset by the recognition of premiums originally paid for those hedges that settle during the period. Economic fuel expense more closely approximates the net cash outflow associated with purchasing fuel for our operation.

Reclassification of Ancillary Revenues -
May 18, 2012
We have historically reported many ancillary revenues within Passenger Revenue in our consolidated statement of operations. We have, however, analyzed the SEC filings of our competitors and decided to include ancillary revenues in Other-net Revenue in the consolidated statement of operations so that our passenger revenues, passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM), and yield are comparable to others in our industry and to help facilitate better analysis among our peers. We have reclassified ancillary revenues in the current period and all prior periods, with the reclassification having no impact on total revenue for any of the respective periods. The tables below show the effects on Mainline and Consolidated PRASM.

Alaska Air Group Inc. (NYSE: ALK) today reported
June
operational results for its subsidiaries, Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air, and on a combined basis. Detailed information is provided below.
ALASKA AIRLINES - MAINLINE
Alaska reported a
10.6 percent
increase in traffic on a
7.5 percent
increase in capacity compared to
June 2011
. This resulted in a
2.5
-point increase in load factor to a June record
87.9 percent

Exhibit 99.2
 
Investor Update -
July 9, 2012
Note to Investors
This abbreviated Investor Update is being provided to communicate certain actual
second
quarter
2012
mainline and consolidated operating statistics.  It includes forecasted mainline and consolidated unit cost (excluding fuel) and passenger unit revenue (PRASM) information, estimated economic fuel cost per gallon, and expected consolidated non-operating expense.  
Unit revenue, unit cost and other financial forecasts are estimates only. Actual amounts reported may differ and are dependent on our normal quarter-end closing process.
A full Investor Update with information about fuel hedge positions, planned capital expenditures, fleet information, and share repurchase activity will be provided in connection with our
second
quarter earnings release scheduled for
July 26, 2012
.
References in this update to Air Group, Company, we, us, and our refer to Alaska Air Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise specified.
Information about Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
This update includes forecasted operational and financial information for our mainline and consolidated operations. Our disclosure of operating cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel and other items, provides us (and may provide investors) with the ability to measure and monitor our performance without these items. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is total operating expense per available seat mile. However, due to the large fluctuations in fuel prices, we are unable to predict total operating expense for any future period with any degree of certainty. In addition, we believe the disclosure of fuel expense on an economic basis is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. Please see the cautionary statement under Forward-Looking Information.
We are providing unaudited information about fuel price movements and the impact of our hedging program on our financial results. Management believes it is useful to compare results between periods on an economic basis.
Economic fuel expense
is defined as the raw or into-plane fuel cost less any cash we receive from hedge counterparties for hedges that settle during the period, offset by the recognition of premiums originally paid for those hedges that settle during the period. Economic fuel expense more closely approximates the net cash outflow associated with purchasing fuel for our operation.
Forward-Looking Information 
This update contains forward-looking statements subject to the safe harbor protection provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements relate to future events and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual outcomes to be materially different from those indicated by any forward-looking statements. For a comprehensive discussion of potential risk factors, see Item 1A of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011. Some of these risks include general economic conditions, increases in operating costs including fuel, competition, labor costs and relations, our significant indebtedness, inability to meet cost reduction goals, seasonal fluctuations in our financial results, an aircraft accident, and changes in laws and regulations. All of the forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the risk factors discussed therein. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risk factors emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict such new risk factors, nor can it assess the impact, if any, of such new risk factors on our business or events described in any forward-looking statements. We expressly disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date of this report to conform them to actual results. Over time, our actual results, performance or achievements will likely differ from the anticipated results, performance or achievements that are expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements, and such differences might be significant and materially adverse.

Nonoperating Expense
We expect that our consolidated nonoperating expense will be approximately
$7 million
to
$8 million
in the
second
quarter of
2012
.
In our June 14th guidance, we had anticipated some charges associated with the prepayment of
$50 million
of long-term debt. However, we did not actually incur any charges, resulting in nonoperating expenses for the quarter that are lower than the guidance provided in June.

Note A:
 Pursuant to Regulation G, we are providing disclosure of the reconciliation of reported non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable financial measures reported on a GAAP basis. We believe that consideration of these non-GAAP financial measures may be important to investors for the following reasons:
Note B:
Air Group has two operating airlines - Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air. Each is a regulated airline with separate management teams. To manage the two operating airlines, management views the business in three operating segments. Alaska operates a fleet of passenger jets (Alaska Mainline) and contracts with Horizon, SkyWest Airlines, Inc. (SkyWest), and Peninsula Airways, Inc. (PenAir) for regional capacity under which Alaska receives all passenger revenue from those flights (Alaska Regional). Horizon operates a fleet of turboprop aircraft and sells all of its capacity to Alaska pursuant to a capacity purchase arrangement (Horizon). The Company believes the amounts paid by Alaska to Horizon reflect current market rates received by other regional carriers for similar flying and are available to pay for various Horizon operating expenses such as crew expenses, maintenance, and aircraft ownership costs. All inter-company revenues and expenses between Alaska and Horizon are eliminated in consolidation.
10
Glossary of Terms
Alaska Mainline
- the 737 part of Alaska's business with average stage lengths greater than 1,000 miles.
Alaska Regional
- Alaska's shorter distance network. In this segment, we record actual onboard passenger revenue, less costs such as fuel, distribution costs, and payments made to Horizon, SkyWest and PenAir under Capacity Purchase Agreements (CPA).
Horizon
- Horizon operates regional aircraft. All of Horizon's capacity is sold to Alaska under a CPA. Expenses included those typically borne by regional airlines such as crew costs, ownership costs, and maintenance costs.
RPMs
- revenue passenger miles, or "traffic"; represents the number of seats that were filled with paying passengers; one passenger traveling one mile is one RPM.
ASMs
- available seat miles, or capacity; represents total seats available across the fleet multiplied by the number of miles flown.
Load Factor
- RPMs as a percentage of ASMs; represents the number of available seats that were filled with paying passengers.
Yield
- passenger revenue per RPM; represents the average revenue for flying one passenger one mile.
PRASM
- passenger revenue per ASM; commonly called passenger unit revenue.
RASM
- operating revenue per ASMs, or "unit revenue"; operating revenue includes all passenger revenue, freight and mail, Mileage Plan, and other ancillary revenue; represents the average total revenue for flying one seat one mile.
CASM
- operating costs per ASM, or "unit cost"; represents all operating expenses including fuel and special items.
CASMex
- operating costs excluding fuel and special items per ASM; this metric is used to help track progress toward reduction of non-fuel operating costs since fuel is largely out of our control.
Economic fuel
- best estimate of the cash cost of fuel, net of the impact of our fuel-hedging program.
Aircraft Utilization
- block hours per day; this represents the average number of hours our aircraft are flying.
Aircraft Stage Length
- represents the average miles flown per aircraft departure.
Diluted Earnings per Share
- represents earnings per share using fully diluted shares outstanding.
Diluted Shares -
represents the total number of shares that would be outstanding if all possible sources of conversion, such as stock options, were exercised.
Productivity -
number of revenue passengers per full-time equivalent employee.

Exhibit 99.1
 
Investor Update -
September 14, 2012
References in this update to Air Group, Company, we, us, and our refer to Alaska Air Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise specified.
This update includes forecasted operational and financial information for our mainline and consolidated operations. Our disclosure of operating cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel and other items, provides us (and may provide investors) with the ability to measure and monitor our performance without these items. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is total operating expenses per available seat mile. However, due to the large fluctuations in fuel prices, we are unable to predict total operating expenses for any future period with any degree of certainty. In addition, we believe the disclosure of fuel expense on an economic basis is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. Please see the cautionary statement under Forward-Looking Information.
We are providing information about estimated fuel prices and our hedging program. Management believes it is useful to compare results between periods on an economic basis.
Economic fuel expense
is defined as the raw or into-plane fuel cost less any cash we receive from hedge counterparties for hedges that settle during the period, offset by the recognition of premiums originally paid for those hedges that settle during the period. Economic fuel expense more closely approximates the net cash outflow associated with purchasing fuel for our operation.
Forward-Looking Information
This update contains forward-looking statements subject to the safe harbor protection provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements relate to future events and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual outcomes to be materially different from those indicated by any forward-looking statements. For a comprehensive discussion of potential risk factors, see Item 1A of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2011
. Some of these risks include general economic conditions, increases in operating costs including fuel, competition, labor costs and relations, our significant indebtedness, inability to meet cost reduction goals, seasonal fluctuations in our financial results, an aircraft accident, and changes in laws and regulations. All of the forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the risk factors discussed therein. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risk factors emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict such new risk factors, nor can it assess the impact, if any, of such new risk factors on our business or events described in any forward-looking statements. We expressly disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date of this report to conform them to actual results. Over time, our actual results, performance or achievements will likely differ from the anticipated results, performance or achievements that are expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements, and such differences might be significant and materially adverse.

Alaska Air Group Announces
$250 million
Share Repurchase Program
Completes previous

SEATTLE
-
Alaska Air Group (NYSE: ALK) announced today that its board of directors has approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the company to buy up to
$250 million
of its common stock. The program does not have an expiration date, however, Air Group is targeting completion by
Dec 31, 2014
. The company also announced that it will complete its previous
$50 million
buyback program today.
This
$250 million
repurchase authorization by our board is the largest program we have ever announced, representing over 10 percent of the current market capitalization of our company. This action emphasizes our continued commitment to build long-term shareholder value and highlights our confidence in the future of Alaska Air Group, President and CEO Brad Tilden said.
The company intends to finance the stock repurchases with cash on hand. The repurchase program authorizes Air Group to buy its common stock from time to time through open market purchases, negotiated transactions or other means, including accelerated share repurchases and 10b5-1 trading plans in accordance with applicable securities laws.
Alaska Air Group has repurchased
18.1 million
shares of its common stock, on a split-adjusted basis, for
$312 million
through similar programs over the past five years.
The table below illustrates the annual repurchases by the company since 2007.

Investor Update -
October 9, 2012
Note to Investors
This abbreviated Investor Update is being provided to communicate certain actual
third
quarter
2012
mainline and consolidated operating statistics.  It includes forecasted mainline and consolidated unit cost (excluding fuel) and passenger unit revenue (PRASM) information, estimated economic fuel cost per gallon, and expected consolidated non-operating expense.  
Unit revenue, unit cost and other financial forecasts are estimates only. Actual amounts reported may differ and are dependent on our normal quarter-end closing process.
A full Investor Update with information about fuel hedge positions, planned capital expenditures, fleet information, and share repurchase activity will be provided in connection with our
third
quarter earnings release scheduled for
October 25, 2012
.
References in this update to Air Group, Company, we, us, and our refer to Alaska Air Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise specified.
Information about Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
This update includes forecasted operational and financial information for our mainline and consolidated operations. Our disclosure of operating cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel and other items, provides us (and may provide investors) with the ability to measure and monitor our performance without these items. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is total operating expense per available seat mile. However, due to the large fluctuations in fuel prices, we are unable to predict total operating expense for any future period with any degree of certainty. In addition, we believe the disclosure of fuel expense on an economic basis is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. Please see the cautionary statement under Forward-Looking Information.
We are providing unaudited information about fuel price movements and the impact of our hedging program on our financial results. Management believes it is useful to compare results between periods on an economic basis.
Economic fuel expense
is defined as the raw or into-plane fuel cost less any cash we receive from hedge counterparties for hedges that settle during the period, offset by the recognition of premiums originally paid for those hedges that settle during the period. Economic fuel expense more closely approximates the net cash outflow associated with purchasing fuel for our operation.
Forward-Looking Information 
This update contains forward-looking statements subject to the safe harbor protection provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements relate to future events and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual outcomes to be materially different from those indicated by any forward-looking statements. For a comprehensive discussion of potential risk factors, see Item 1A of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011. Some of these risks include general economic conditions, increases in operating costs including fuel, competition, labor costs and relations, our significant indebtedness, inability to meet cost reduction goals, seasonal fluctuations in our financial results, an aircraft accident, and changes in laws and regulations. All of the forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the risk factors discussed therein. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risk factors emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict such new risk factors, nor can it assess the impact, if any, of such new risk factors on our business or events described in any forward-looking statements. We expressly disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date of this report to conform them to actual results.

Exhibit 99.1
 
Alaska Airlines Orders 50 Boeing Aircraft
737 MAX comprises most of orderthe largest in carrier's history
SEATTLE - Alaska Airlines today announced an order for 50 Boeing aircraft, including the 737 MAX-the new engine variant of the world's best-selling airliner. The aircraft, which will be delivered between 2015 and 2022, represent the largest order in Alaska Airlines' history and are worth $5 billion at manufacturer's list prices.
The agreement includes firm orders for 13 Boeing Next-Generation 737-900ERs, 20 737 MAX 8s and 17 737 MAX 9s.
This order positions us for growth and ensures that we'll continue to operate the quietest and most fuel-efficient aircraft available for the foreseeable future. That means our customers will continue to enjoy a comfortable inflight experience, low fares and excellent on-time performance, Alaska Airlines President and CEO Brad Tilden said. We value our longstanding relationship with Boeing and look forward to painting 'Proudly All Boeing' on the nose of our aircraft for many, many years into the future.
Alaska Airlines currently operates 120 Boeing 737s. The new firm aircraft order, plus 25 existing firm delivery positions, give the carrier the flexibility to manage its fleet size to meet air travel demand over the next decade. Two-thirds of the new aircraft are expected to replace older airplanes. The remaining firm orders and options will enable Alaska Airlines to grow assuming sufficient customer demand and that the company continues to achieve its profit and return on invested capital goals.
Existing and new orders for the 737-900ER will be delivered starting in late October 2012 and continue through 2017. The first 737 MAX 8 is scheduled to enter Alaska's fleet in 2018 followed by the first 737 MAX 9 in 2019. Alaska is the third U.S. airline to order the MAX.
The 737 MAX will be a great addition to Alaska Airlines' all-Boeing 737 fleet, said Ray Conner, president and CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes. It will build on the strong record of operational and financial performance that Alaska Airlines has established with the 737 family. This order demonstrates our hometown partner's strong commitment to operate the most fuel-efficient single-aisle airplanes on the market today and in the future.
All of Alaska's new aircraft will feature the Boeing Sky Interior, with overhead bins that provide more storage and passenger headroom, variable ambient cabin lighting and, on the 737-900ER, Recaro leather seats with an innovative design that provides more legroom.
The 737 MAX will be equipped with the new LEAP-1B engine under development by CFM International, a joint venture between GE Aviation in Ohio and France-based Snecma (Safran Group). The MAX will also feature raked dual
feather winglets and a more aerodynamic tail cone. The aircraft is expected to be 13 percent more fuel efficient than today's most fuel-efficient single-aisle aircraft.

Exhibit 99.2
 
Investor Update - Fleet Order -
October 11, 2012
New Order: Firm order allows for fleet renewal. Options provide flexibility for future growth
On
October 10, 2012
, Alaska Airlines (Alaska) entered into a new agreement and modified existing agreements with The Boeing Company (Boeing) to acquire 50 new 737 aircraft, including 37 of Boeing's new 737 MAX aircraft. This order positions Alaska to replace aging aircraft over the next decade, including the phase out of nearly all of its 737-400 aircraft by the end of 2017, and continue to operate one of the most modern, environmentally friendly, comfortable and fuel-efficient fleets in the United States.
With this order, Alaska now has commitments for 75 firm 737 aircraft through 2022 with options to acquire up to 69 additional 737 NextGen (NG) aircraft and MAX aircraft in 2015 through 2024. The options for both NG and MAX aircraft will give Alaska the flexibility (but not the obligation) to grow the fleet assuming profitability and return on invested capital targets can be met.
About the MAX
The 737 MAX is the new engine variant of the world's best selling jet airliner. The MAX will be equipped with the new LEAP-1B engine developed by CFM International which is a joint venture between GE Aviation of Ohio and France-based Snecma. New engine technology, improved winglets and other aerodynamic enhancements are expected to improve fuel efficiency up to 13% compared to the engines flying on Alaska's 737 NG fleet today. These enhancements also promise to reduce carbon emissions for better environmental performance.
Aircraft Delivery Schedule
The table below reflects the current firm mainline aircraft delivery schedule.
Alaska also has 69 options for NG and MAX aircraft between 2015 and 2024. Alaska now expects to dispose of six aircraft in the fourth quarter of 2013, ending the year with 127 Boeing aircraft in the mainline fleet, and expects to phase out of nearly all of its passenger and combi 737-400 aircraft by the end of 2017.
Capital Expenditures
The new agreements will result in increased capital spending over the next ten years, but other than initial deposits upon signing the agreement, will not significantly impact 2012 or 2013.
The table below reflects the full year expectation for total capital expenditures for Alaska Air Group, Inc. (Air Group) and the additional expenditures if options were exercised. These options will be exercised only if we believe return on invested capital targets can be meet.
Aircraft ownership provides for significant flexibility
Air Group owns a large percentage of its current fleet and many of those owned aircraft are unencumbered. As a result, we have a great deal of flexibility to accelerate the retirement of aircraft to moderate growth in (or even shrink) the fleet depending on market conditions. The table below reflects Air Group's current ownership structure of the fleet.

Note A:
 Pursuant to Regulation G, we are providing disclosure of the reconciliation of reported non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable financial measures reported on a GAAP basis. We believe that consideration of these non-GAAP financial measures may be important to investors for the following reasons:
Note B:
Air Group has two operating airlines - Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air. Each is a regulated airline with separate management teams. To manage the two operating airlines, management views the business in three operating segments. Alaska operates a fleet of passenger jets (Alaska Mainline) and contracts with Horizon, SkyWest Airlines, Inc. (SkyWest), and Peninsula Airways, Inc. (PenAir) for regional capacity under which Alaska receives all passenger revenue from those flights (Alaska Regional). Horizon operates a fleet of turboprop aircraft and sells all of its capacity to Alaska pursuant to a capacity purchase arrangement (Horizon). The Company believes the amounts paid by Alaska to Horizon reflect current market rates received by other regional carriers for similar flying and are available to pay for various Horizon operating expenses such as crew expenses, maintenance, and aircraft ownership costs. All inter-company revenues and expenses between Alaska and Horizon are eliminated in consolidation.
9
Glossary of Terms
Alaska Mainline
- the 737 part of Alaska's business with average stage lengths greater than 1,000 miles.
Alaska Regional
- Alaska's shorter distance network. In this segment, we record actual onboard passenger revenue, less costs such as fuel, distribution costs, and payments made to Horizon, SkyWest and PenAir under Capacity Purchase Agreements (CPA).
Horizon
- Horizon operates regional aircraft. All of Horizon's capacity is sold to Alaska under a CPA. Expenses included those typically borne by regional airlines such as crew costs, ownership costs, and maintenance costs.
RPMs
- revenue passenger miles, or "traffic"; represents the number of seats that were filled with paying passengers; one passenger traveling one mile is one RPM.
ASMs
- available seat miles, or capacity; represents total seats available across the fleet multiplied by the number of miles flown.
Load Factor
- RPMs as a percentage of ASMs; represents the number of available seats that were filled with paying passengers.
Yield
- passenger revenue per RPM; represents the average revenue for flying one passenger one mile.
PRASM
- passenger revenue per ASM; commonly called passenger unit revenue.
RASM
- operating revenue per ASMs, or "unit revenue"; operating revenue includes all passenger revenue, freight and mail, Mileage Plan, and other ancillary revenue; represents the average total revenue for flying one seat one mile.
CASM
- operating costs per ASM, or "unit cost"; represents all operating expenses including fuel and special items.
CASMex
- operating costs excluding fuel and special items per ASM; this metric is used to help track progress toward reduction of non-fuel operating costs since fuel is largely out of our control.
Economic fuel
- best estimate of the cash cost of fuel, net of the impact of our fuel-hedging program.
Aircraft Utilization
- block hours per day; this represents the average number of hours our aircraft are flying.
Aircraft Stage Length
- represents the average miles flown per aircraft departure.
Diluted Earnings per Share
- represents earnings per share using fully diluted shares outstanding.
Diluted Shares -
represents the total number of shares that would be outstanding if all possible sources of conversion, such as stock options, were exercised.
Productivity -
number of revenue passengers per full-time equivalent employee.

Exhibit 99.2
Investor Update -
October 25, 2012
References in this update to Air Group, Company, we, us, and our refer to Alaska Air Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise specified.
This update includes forecasted operational and financial information for our mainline and consolidated operations. Our disclosure of operating cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel and other items, provides us (and may provide investors) with the ability to measure and monitor our performance without these items. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is total operating expenses per available seat mile. However, due to the large fluctuations in fuel prices, we are unable to predict total operating expenses for any future period with any degree of certainty. In addition, we believe the disclosure of fuel expense on an economic basis is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. Please see the cautionary statement under Forward-Looking Information.
We are providing information about estimated fuel prices and our hedging program. Management believes it is useful to compare results between periods on an economic basis.
Economic fuel expense
is defined as the raw or into-plane fuel cost less any cash we receive from hedge counterparties for hedges that settle during the period, offset by the recognition of premiums originally paid for those hedges that settle during the period. Economic fuel expense more closely approximates the net cash outflow associated with purchasing fuel for our operation.
Forward-Looking Information
This update contains forward-looking statements subject to the safe harbor protection provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements relate to future events and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual outcomes to be materially different from those indicated by any forward-looking statements. For a comprehensive discussion of potential risk factors, see Item 1A of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2011
. Some of these risks include general economic conditions, increases in operating costs including fuel, competition, labor costs and relations, our significant indebtedness, inability to meet cost reduction goals, seasonal fluctuations in our financial results, an aircraft accident, and changes in laws and regulations. All of the forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the risk factors discussed therein. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risk factors emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict such new risk factors, nor can it assess the impact, if any, of such new risk factors on our business or events described in any forward-looking statements. We expressly disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date of this report to conform them to actual results. Over time, our actual results, performance or achievements will likely differ from the anticipated results, performance or achievements that are expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements, and such differences might be significant and materially adverse.

Eric Yeaman Joins Alaska Air Group Board of Directors
SEATTLE
-
Alaska Air Group's board of directors and Chairman Bill Ayer announced today that Eric Yeaman, president and CEO of Hawaiian Telcom, has been appointed to the board of directors of Alaska Air Group Inc. Yeaman will serve on the board's Audit Committee.
We're delighted that Eric is joining Air Group's board. Along with his deep financial expertise, he'll bring a distinct perspective from Hawaii, a region that represents one-fifth of Alaska Airlines' network, Ayer said. In addition to his impressive career, Eric has an equally impressive community service record that fits well with the Alaska Spirit.
Yeaman, who becomes Air Group's 11
th
board member, joined Hawaiian Telcom in 2008. He successfully reorganized the company, returning it to profitability and reducing its debt by more than $800 million.
Yeaman previously served as financial vice president, treasurer and chief financial officer at Hawaiian Electric Industries before joining its parent company, Hawaiian Electric Co., as senior executive vice president and chief operating officer. He also served as chief operating and financial officer for Kamehameha Schools and was a partner at Arthur Andersen LLP.
Hawaii is known for its vibrant culture, history and aloha spirit, said Yeaman, who was born and raised in Kona, Hawaii. I'm looking forward to serving a company that also comes from such a rich background and contributes significantly to our state's economy and community.
Alaska Airlines, a subsidiary of Alaska Air Group (NYSE: ALK), together with its partner regional airlines, serves 95 cities through an expansive network in Alaska, the Lower 48, Hawaii, Canada and Mexico.

Alaska Air Group Code of Conduct and Ethics iii To: All Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air Employees When I think about what makes me most proud to be part of Alaska Air Group, at the very top of my list is that both Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air are committed to honesty, fairness and ethical behavior. The proof of that commitment is reflected again and again in the actions of individual employees doing the right thing in the right way, every day. The Alaska Air Group Code of Conduct and Ethics is an important tool that summarizes the rules, principles and behaviors that align with our core values. It is designed to promote a culture of open and honest communication and an environment where everyone feels comfortable raising questions or concerns about what constitutes ethical behavior. The expectation I have of myself, our company officers, board of directors and each of you is that we embrace the principles set forth in this document and use them to guide our actions. If uncertain about how a situation should be handled, I expect that you will ask for help  or, if that is not possible, use your best judgment to do the right thing for our customers, suppliers and other employees. And I want each of you to know that when you do that, you can expect the leadership of this company to stand behind you. I hope you are as proud to be identified with our values as I am. Doing business in a way that is consistent with these values has been fundamental to our past success and is foundational to a bright future as we continue to build trust and credibility among ourselves and the communities where we live. Please take a few minutes to review the Code of Conduct and discuss any questions you may have with your supervisor or call the Ethics & Compliance Hotline at (888) 738-1915. Brad Tilden President and CEO
 
1 Alaska Air Group Code of Conduct and Ethics 1. UNDERSTANDING OUR CODE OF CONDUCT AND ETHICS Applicability of the Code The Alaska Air Group Code of Conduct and Ethics (Code) applies to all employees, officers and directors of Alaska Air Group, Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air (the Company). Unless expressly stated otherwise, references to you, employees, or we are meant to include all members of these groups. Responsibility for Compliance Your compliance with the Code is mandatory. Violations may be grounds for discipline, up to and including dismissal. Conduct that violates the Code may also violate the law. This could result in severe civil and/or criminal consequences for you and/or the Company. What is Expected As employees of the Company, we must be committed to observing the highest standards of business and personal ethics, while at all times promoting the best interests of the Company. Read, understand and follow the principles in the Code. Perform your duties in an honest, courteous manner while abiding by all applicable laws, regulations and Company policies. Act with dignity and respect toward others. Avoid situations that may involve, or give the appearance of involving, a conflict between personal interests and the interests of our Company. Additional Expectations for Management. If you manage others, you also have a responsibility to help your employees understand and comply with the Code, and to foster an open and supportive environment where employees feel comfortable asking questions and raising concerns. Managers should be alert to any situation that may violate the Code, Company policy, law or regulation and take prompt action to address such situations. Managers must never engage in or tolerate retaliation against anyone raising concerns or making a report in good faith about an ethical or compliance issue. We have a commitment to our employees, our customers and our shareholders to behave ethically and in compliance with the law.
 
2 Alaska Air Group Code of Conduct and Ethics Speak Up! Asking Questions and Reporting Concerns The principles in our Code are not meant to be exhaustive or address every possible situation, but are provided as a guide to the many laws and key policies that govern doing business in a legal and ethical manner. You may encounter situations where the right choice or course of action is not perfectly clear. You should ask questions and seek clarification if you are ever in doubt. If you have a reasonable concern that there has been a violation of law, regulation, this Code or other Company policy, you have a duty to report it. Who to Contact If you have questions about the Code or have concerns about conduct you believe may violate the Code, Company policy, or any law or regulation, it is important that you raise those questions or concerns through one of the many resources available to you. You are encouraged to contact any of the following to seek guidance or report a concern:  Talk to your supervisor. Your supervisor is the best person to speak to first. Your supervisor should be able to answer your questions and help you determine whether there is an issue, and if so, what steps to take next.  Talk to another member of the management team within your division.  Contact Human Resources.  Contact the department identified in the relevant section of this Code (Corporate Affairs, Internal Audit or the Safety Division, for example).  Contact your division Compliance Representative (C-Team member). Most divisions have an individual(s) tasked with overseeing compliance responsibilities applicable to that division.  Contact the Office of Ethics and Compliance at (206) 392-5021 or AAG.Compliance@AlaskaAir.com. The Ethics and Compliance Hotline is another resource where you can ask questions, seek clarification, or report concerns. The Hotline is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and is independently operated to help ensure confidentiality. Reports can be submitted by calling the toll-free telephone number(s) or by logging on to the secure web page. Reports can be made anonymously, if you wish. Telephone calls and/or online reports are never recorded or traced. All reports will be forwarded to the Company for prompt response. If you are not sure if something raises an ethical issue, one way to give yourself a quick gut-check is to ask yourself the following questions:  Is my decision consistent with our Values?  Would I be comfortable telling my friends, family and coworkers what I did?  Would I feel right if a coworker, vendor or business partner acted this way toward me?  Will this affect my ability or motivation to always act in the best interest of the Company?  Would I like to see my actions - or inaction - described on the evening news or in the newspaper? ETHICS & COMPLIANCE HOTLINE File a Report by Phone Toll-free in the U.S. and Canada: (888) 738-1915 Mexico: 001 (866) 737-6850 (answered in English) Mexico: 001 (800) 840-7907 (answered in Spanish) File a Report Online: www.AAG.ethicspoint.com
 
3 Alaska Air Group Code of Conduct and Ethics When you file a report through the Hotline, your concern will be reviewed promptly and an appropriate inquiry will be initiated. Your concerns will be handled discreetly and information shared only with those who have a need to know, such as those who may be involved in answering your questions or investigating issues you raise. Nothing in this Code prohibits employees from exercising their legal right to contact any governmental agency on a confidential basis when they have reasonable concerns regarding the legal or safety implications of any action taken by employees or any other person acting on behalf of the Company. The Company also encourages employees to bring such concerns to the attention of any member of management (including any member of the Companys Safety Division) in keeping with its open door policy. Such concerns will be treated confidentially whenever possible, and no retaliation or harassment of employees voicing such concerns will be tolerated. If you are an employee whose concern is regulated by a collective bargaining agreement, it is necessary that you follow the procedures and remedies available under that agreement. Retaliation Prohibited The Company does not tolerate retaliation of any kind for raising concerns or making a report in good faith about an ethical or compliance issue. To be made in good faith does not mean you have to be right; however, it does mean you have to provide complete and accurate information and you have to have a reasonable belief that it may be true. Non-punitive Reporting We recognize that no one is perfect, and sometimes mistakes are made. The Companys policy is to encourage people to report compliance issues involving their own conduct. In support of that goal, we have a number of non-punitive, self-reporting programs. They include:  Aviation Safety Action Programs (ASAP)  Alaska Airlines Error Reporting System  Horizon Air Employee Safety Reporting Program (ESRP) Remember that you must meet the standards of a specific non-punitive reporting program to be entitled to its protections. Self reporting is not, by itself, a way of avoiding the consequences of conduct or performance issues that do not meet the criteria of a non-punitive reporting program. If you have questions about the applicability of any of these programs, you should talk to your supervisor, contact the Safety Division, or contact the Office of Ethics and Compliance. Q&A Q. I heard some information about a co-worker that concerns me. The information came from a reliable source, but I dont know if it is true. If it is, I believe my co-worker would be violating company policies. Should I report the situation even if I am not completely sure it is true? A. Yes. We should all be careful to not participate in, or encourage, the spread of rumors about our co-workers. However, employees have an obligation under the Code to report possible violations. As a first step, you should report this to your supervisor. If you have any concerns about discussing this with your local management, contact your division leadership, Human Resources, or the Office of Ethics and Compliance. Either way, your report will be taken seriously and investigated.
 
4 Alaska Air Group Code of Conduct and Ethics FOR MORE INFORMATION:2. COMPLYING WITH INTERNAL POLICIES AND PROCEDURES In addition to laws and regulations, we all have an obligation to understand and follow internal Company policies and procedures that apply to our positions and performance of our duties. Alaska Airlines System Regulations is available online at www.alaskasworld.com. Horizon Air policies are available online at www.onyourhorizon.com. Additionally, operating divisions and many business units have their own manuals covering workgroup-specific policies and procedures. Talk to your supervisor to make sure you have received copies of applicable policies and procedures, know how to access them, and have an opportunity to review them and ask questions. 3. COMPLYING WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS Our business is far-reaching and complex. The airline industry is highly regulated  federal, state and local agencies, as well as the governments of other countries where we do business, regulate us and have jurisdiction over virtually every aspect of our operation, under a wide array of laws and regulations. It is your responsibility to be aware of the laws and regulations that apply to your work for the Company. The sections below are by no means exhaustive, but they cover some of the significant laws and regulations that may affect you. If you are unsure about whether an action you are considering is compliant with the law or applicable regulation, or is otherwise appropriate, you should talk to your supervisor, call the Legal Department or contact the Office of Ethics and Compliance. Regulations Affecting Our Industry Federal Aviation Regulations govern many facets of how we operate and maintain our aircraft, and conduct our ground operations. Department of Homeland Security regulations govern the security and international travel of our passengers, employees, and aircraft. Department of Transportation regulations govern airline consumer protection requirements, such as how we handle delayed, cancelled or overbooked flights, how we accommodate passengers with disabilities, and how we advertise our schedules and fares. These regulations, along with many more, affect nearly every employee within the Company. Particularly affected are those employees in the Flight Operations, Inflight, Maintenance and Engineering, Customer Services, Finance and Marketing divisions. Strict adherence to governmental regulations and Company policy and procedures is key to meeting our primary corporate goal of safety and compliance. Policies/Manuals:  Alaska Airlines System Regulations, and other division specific manuals, are located on alaskasworld.com, under Manuals & Forms.  Horizon Air policies and manuals are located on onyourhorizon.com.
 
5 Alaska Air Group Code of Conduct and Ethics Q&A Accuracy of Financial Reports and Other Public Communications As a publicly traded company, it is critical that we provide complete, accurate, and timely information concerning Alaska Air Group. We communicate this information in a variety of ways, including reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), press releases, webcasts, and industry and financial conferences. Even if you do not directly prepare these reports and communications, you may be involved in the process of recording or gathering the underlying information. Anyone involved in the process of keeping, analyzing, booking, collecting or recording financial information must do so strictly in accordance with applicable accounting rules and Company procedures. If you are asked to perform, or observe someone else performing, one of these functions in a way that you believe to be misleading, fraudulent, or otherwise inconsistent with proper practice, you should refuse to do so, and report the request or observation to one of the many resources available to you. Insider Trading and Securities Laws You may own Alaska Air Group stock through an employee stock purchase plan, your 401(k), or individual investment activities. It is critical that every investor in Alaska Air Group be able to make investment decisions on a level playing field, which means with the same access to material information. We must never trade, or encourage others to trade, in the stock of Alaska Air Group based on material inside information. It is also improper to trade or encourage others to trade in the stock of another entity while having knowledge of material inside information about that entity gained through your employment with the Company. Insider trading may result in disciplinary action and/or civil or criminal sanctions by state or federal authorities. Some of you, by virtue of your position at the Company, may be subject to stock trading windows and blackout periods. You should make sure that you are aware of and abide by any such restrictions. The Companys Regulation FD Policy, as required by the SEC, limits what we can say to brokers, analysts, bankers and other financial professionals without simultaneously disclosing it to the public. You should not disclose any material inside information about the Company unless that information is being broadly disclosed to the public at the same time. If you have any questions about the appropriate course of action, you should contact the General Counsels office for clarification and/or guidance. Q. I have been asked to report and log data in a way that seems to be misleading because it doesnt accurately report the whole picture. I dont want to be responsible for incorrect or misleading reports. What should I do? A. Talk with your manager or someone else in your division leadership. It is important to always report data accurately and correctly. Its also important to follow proper procedure in reporting data. Your manager and/or division leadership should be able to clearly explain the methodology used so that you fully understand how you are complying with the reporting requirements. If you still have concerns or questions, contact the Legal Department or Office of Ethics and Compliance. Q. What exactly is material inside information? A. Inside means not publicly available. Material means information that would be important to a reasonable investor in making a decision to buy or sell Alaska Air Group stock. For example, this could include financial results not yet released, route or schedule information or changes in alliances or partnerships.

6 Alaska Air Group Code of Conduct and Ethics Fair Competition and Antitrust Laws We are committed to conducting our business in compliance with all federal and state antitrust laws. These laws regulate the actions and relationships between and among competitors, suppliers, and customers and prohibit certain conduct deemed to be anti-competitive. Antitrust laws prohibit agreements or understandings with competitors that unreasonably restrain trade. These include agreements to fix prices, divide markets, allocate customers, restrict capacity or refuse to deal with certain customers or suppliers. In addition, exclusive arrangements and preferential treatment of one customer who is a competitor of other customers may present antitrust risks and must be carefully reviewed. You should not engage in any discussion or non-verbal communication (e.g., price signaling) with competitors concerning these or similar subjects without prior approval from the Legal Department. It is sometimes permissible for codeshare partners to discuss and agree upon some of these subjects, but you should check with the Legal Department before engaging in such discussions. Because antitrust laws are exceedingly complex, it is not possible to detail the full scope of these laws. A bedrock principle is that any communication, coordination or agreement (whether verbal or not) that tends to artificially decrease competition or enhance monopoly power is suspect and may be illegal, and should be avoided unless approved by the Legal Department. Anti-Corruption and Anti-Bribery Laws We are committed to complying with the U.S Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and similar foreign anti- corruption laws. In general, these laws prohibit bribes or giving anything of value to any foreign official or anyone else, in order to influence a decision or act, obtain or keep business, or to secure any improper advantage for the Company. These laws apply to the Company and individual employees and carry significant criminal and civil penalties for violations. Compliance with these laws requires strict adherence to Company policy and guidelines. Employees, and all agents working on behalf of the Company, must not directly or indirectly, authorize, offer, or promise to pay or give anything of value -- such as money, gifts or services (which could include waived fees, upgrades, or other business courtesies) -- if the purpose is to gain a business advantage for the Company. Any such offer or payment could be determined to be a bribe under various anti-corruption laws. Rules for conducting business with foreign officials are stricter. The definition of a Foreign Official under these laws is very broad, but can include:  any employee of a foreign national, regional or local government;  any employee of a company that is government-owned or government-controlled;  any employee of a public international organization (such as the United Nations or International Monetary Fund);  any person acting in an official capacity for any government; or  any political party official or candidate. Local customs or business practices do not relieve you, the Company or our agents from complying with U.S. and foreign anti-corruption laws. If there is a conflict between a local law and U.S. law or regulation, contact the Legal Department to determine the appropriate action. For further guidance on anti-corruption compliance, contact the Legal Department. Q&A Q. I represent the company on a committee made up of representatives from multiple airlines. At one of our meetings, a representative from another carrier proposed that we all impose a ticket surcharge to off-set the high cost of fuel. Is this okay? A. No. Antitrust laws strictly prohibit competitors from agreeing upon price or a component of price. If you find yourself in this situation, you should depart the meeting or explicitly state that Alaska cannot discuss rates or fees with its competitors.

7 Alaska Air Group Code of Conduct and Ethics Q&A Health and Safety The safety of our employees and customers is the Companys highest concern. Company policy requires that we comply with all health and safety laws and regulations, provide and require the use of proper safety equipment and procedures, and insist that all work be done in a safe and responsible manner. You will find in many circumstances that Company policy exceeds what is required by law. Every employee has the duty  and authority  to refrain from, or stop, any work activity if safety or hazardous problems are suspected, until those concerns are resolved. A safe work environment also means a workplace free from violence. We must never engage in or tolerate any form of violence. Threats or intimidation of employees, vendors and/or customers will not be tolerated. Employees are prohibited from making threats or engaging in violent activities, such as fighting or intentionally damaging Company property or the property of another employee. Drugs and Alcohol You must report to work free from the influence of any substance that could prevent you from performing your job duties in a safe and effective manner. You must not use or be in possession of illegal/prohibited drugs or unsealed containers of alcohol while at work or on duty. Additionally, employees who perform certain safety-sensitive duties are subject to DOT/FAA drug and alcohol regulations. All employees are responsible for knowing the specific restrictions that apply to their position in the Company. Alcohol served at Company functions is allowed in some circumstances with prior permission. If any alcohol is consumed at a Company event, you must observe pre-duty use rules and are not allowed to return to work that same day. Environmental Protection We are committed to complying with all federal, state and local environmental laws in the applicable jurisdictions in which we operate. We also strive to do much more. We are committed to leading our industry in environmental stewardship. We believe that environmental responsibility is an essential part of being a responsible corporate citizen and is a natural fit with our corporate values and our customers expectations. We are building a culture where sustainable environmental practices are integrated into our business of providing safe, reliable air transportation with the best-in-class service and the best customer experience. We are working to measurably reduce our impact on the environment through waste reduction and recycling, and energy conservation in equipment and facilities. Be familiar with the environmental policies and requirements that are specific to your duties and work location. Q. Company safety policies for our location are more restrictive than what is required by law. I understand safety is our top priority, but isnt following the law enough? A. Safety and Compliance has been, and remains, our number one goal. In many situations we establish policies that exceed the minimum federal, state or local standards. Going the extra mile in an effort to reduce or eliminate risks for our employees is very much in keeping with our values. Q. I have concerns that a co-worker has a substance abuse problem and may be consuming alcohol during work hours. Id rather not get involved. What should I do? A. Employees who observe, are aware of, or have a concern that a co-worker is under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol at work must immediately report this to a supervisor on a confidential basis. If you cannot report this to your supervisor, contact another member of your leadership team or Human Resources.

8 Alaska Air Group Code of Conduct and Ethics Q&A Harassment and Discrimination The Company is an equal opportunity employer. This means we are committed to providing equal consideration in all employment decisions (including, but not limited to, recruiting, hiring, training, promotions, pay practices, benefits, disciplinary actions and terminations) without regard to age, race, color, gender, national origin, religion, marital status, sexual orientation, disability, veteran status or any other classification protected by federal, state, or local laws. We are dedicated to providing a positive, respectful and inclusive work environment where employees feel valued, committed and connected. We will not tolerate any form of discrimination or harassment that encourages or could create an offensive, hostile or intimidating work environment. Harassment can take many forms, such as offensive or derogatory jokes or slurs; unwelcome gestures or physical contact; or displaying or circulating derogatory or offensive materials. The Companys policy prohibiting harassment and discrimination applies to the workplace as well as work-related settings, such as Company-sponsored or authorized events. Acts of discrimination and harassment not only violate our Company values and policies, but may also violate federal, state, and local laws and are strictly prohibited. You are responsible for ensuring your conduct is free from any actions that constitute harassment or discrimination. If you manage others, you are responsible for promoting a work environment where harassment or discrimination is not tolerated. We are an Equal Opportunity Employer that recognizes the value of a diverse workforce. Q. One of my co-workers tells jokes that are offensive to me and others in my work group. I have tried to ignore this hoping it would stop, but is hasnt. What else can I do? A. If you are comfortable talking to your co-worker about this, you should. If not, talk to your supervisor, or contact your HR Field Team representative or the Office of Ethics and Compliance for help in handling this situation.

9 Alaska Air Group Code of Conduct and Ethics Q&A 4. COOPERATION WITH GOVERNMENT AND INTERNAL INVESTIGATIONS The Company is subject to many interactions that are a part of our ordinary relationship with various regulatory agencies (such as the FAA, TSA, IRS and DOT). If you receive a routine request for information as part of an agencys normal oversight of the Company, you should inform your manager and coordinate with your divisions compliance representative. In addition, a regulatory or law enforcement agency may request information and/or documents as part of an investigation of the Company or another firm, individual or Company employee. They may even show up, unannounced, at your workplace. It is our policy to cooperate with such investigations, consistent with our legal rights to defend the Company and its employees. If you receive a subpoena, letter, phone call, personal visit or other request from a government or law enforcement agency for such information, you should contact the Legal Division immediately. Internal Investigations You are also required to cooperate fully with internal investigations concerning possible violations of law or Company policy. Consistent with all investigations, this includes not destroying or altering documents, producing all requested documents, and being forthcoming and truthful in response to questions from authorized Company personnel. Q. I just received a Legal Hold Memo. Can you tell me more about this and what it means? A. When there is a lawsuit pending, or in some other legal matters, the company has an obligation to preserve related documents and ensure they do not get destroyed, deleted or modified. Documents are generally defined very broadly and include data stored in various formats. It is important that you read the hold memo carefully and take the necessary steps to preserve the data identified. This often means retaining documents longer than the Records Management Program stipulates. If it is determined that the company has failed to preserve these documents, severe penalties or adverse rulings may result. Employees may face discipline, up to and including dismissal, for failing to properly preserve documents. You should contact the Legal Department if you have any questions about how to comply.

10 Alaska Air Group Code of Conduct and Ethics FOR MORE INFORMATION: Q&A 5. PROTECTING COMPANY INFORMATION AND ASSETS Protection of Company Assets Company assets include financial assets, physical assets such as buildings, vehicles, office and computing equipment, as well as intangible assets such as computer software and databases, information stored, created, or transmitted on company or personally owned equipment, proprietary information and intellectual property, such as trademarks, copyrights and patents. Preventing the loss, damage, misuse, or theft of the Company's assets and records is the responsibility of every employee. You must use Company assets only for conducting legitimate Company business and not for personal matters. Incidental use of items such as photocopiers, email and telephone is permitted, provided it does not result in a material expense to the Company or distract from the performance of your job. Intellectual Property Protection of the Companys intellectual property, including trademarks, patents, copyrights, trade secrets and business methodologies, is essential to maintaining the Companys competitive advantage. Any intellectual property you create for the Company in the course of your employment belongs to the Company. This is considered work product and includes, without limitation, ideas, inventions, improvements, computer code and other proprietary technology, manuals, trade and service marks, artwork, advertising copy or any works of authorship. This work product is Company property if it is developed or created on company time, as part of your duties or through use of Company resources or information you learned through your employment. You may not, without the express consent of the Company, license, assign or use intellectual property developed in the course of employment at the Company for your own gain or to compete with the Company, and you must treat it with the same care as other confidential information. Likewise, all intellectual property created by contractors or outside consultants employed by the Company should transfer to the benefit of the Company. It is essential that any necessary release or agreement be in place before any work begins. Our trademarks are vital assets and important components of our brand and identity. All employees, as well as our business partners, should help protect them. Anyone wishing to use a Company trademark must first obtain written permission and clearance by the Legal and/or Marketing departments prior to use. We respect the proprietary rights of others. Be sure that you have authorization before you use third-party copyrighted materials or trademarks. You may not use, copy, distribute, or modify trademarks, copyrighted materials or any other intellectual property of third parties unless the Company obtains the prior written consent of the owner. Q. I read an article in a trade publication that is exactly on point to what we are talking about at our next staff meeting. I didnt see any type of copyright notice in the article. Is it alright to make copies to distribute at the meeting? A. Unless there is specific copying approval granted in the article, copyright protections generally prevent further copying for distribution without the permission of the author and/or publisher. Almost all things are copyright protected the moment they are written with no notice required. Check with the Legal Department on how to obtain permission or on how else to share the information properly.

11 Alaska Air Group Code of Conduct and Ethics Confidential Information Through your employment with the Company, you will gain knowledge and information that has not been made public and is proprietary. You may learn of, or gain access to, Confidential Information through verbal discussions, hard-copy or electronic documents, or other data. For purposes of simplicity, we refer to this information collectively as Confidential Information. Confidential Information includes, but is not limited to, personal employee information (such as performance records or payroll information), customer information, financial or operating statistics, existing and future marketing and planning strategies, new products or services in development, internal Company manuals, contracts or other details of business relationships, patent or technological developments, or any other information which, if disclosed, could jeopardize the Companys competitive position or cause harm to an individuals identity. You are responsible for protecting Confidential Information, and for limiting access to those who have a need to know in order to do their jobs. Confidential Information should be used only for legitimate Company purposes and never for personal benefit or in any other inappropriate way. You should never disclose Confidential Information to anyone, internally or outside the Company, unless authorized to do so. Avoid discussing or otherwise transmitting Confidential Information in common areas of your workplace, during travel, or in other public areas. Confidential Information should be stored and disposed of securely. Disclosure of Confidential Information outside the Company should be limited to those situations where there is a legal obligation to do so, or where the receiver has a need to know and has signed a Non-Disclosure Agreement in advance, which has been approved by the Legal Department. You must exercise the same care when in possession of Confidential Information of third parties that the Company has rightfully received under non-disclosure or other agreements.

12 Alaska Air Group Code of Conduct and Ethics Q&A Q. I am on Facebook a lot and like to share information about my job with friends and family. But Im not sure exactly what is okay to share and what is not. How do I know whats okay? A. As a rule of thumb, any information that is publicly available is generally okay to share. For example, we encourage all employees to Like Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air on Facebook to keep current with what company representatives and customers are talking about. This is also a great way to know about - and share - current sales, promotions or new offerings. Whats not okay to share is any confidential or proprietary information about our company, customers, or suppliers. This could include specific work activities or information discussed in business meetings or through other internal- only communications. If you have questions about whether a particular subject is appropriate to discuss online, you should talk it over with your manager. Q. Is it okay to post recommendations about hotels or other travel destinations? A. Yes, it is fine to share your personal opinions. Keep in mind, you should use I statements and make it clear that you are not speaking on behalf of Alaska or Horizon. You can do this by adding a simple disclaimer: These are my personal opinions and do not necessarily reflect those of my employer. Q. I recently saw some negative postings about the company online. Id like to voice my opinion to help set the record straight. Is this okay? A. No. While it is tempting to want to join the conversation and respond immediately, please do not respond to negative postings about the company online. What you can do, however, is forward a link of the conversation to Customer Care and/or Corporate Communications. This will help the company be consistent and timely in our responses and ensure that the correct individuals are involved. Q. I keep a few files relating to a personal business venture on my computer hard drive. Since the folder is marked personal and each file is password protected, this will remain private and only accessible to me, correct? A. No, not necessarily. Any information stored on company-owned equipment (or transmitted through company systems) is considered the property of Alaska or Horizon. The company reserves the right to access and review any information stored on its computing resources at any time, even if it is password protected. FOR MORE INFORMATION: Policies/Manuals:  Technology and Information Security Policy (System Regulations 10.600 and QX Policies/Guidelines)  Guide to Online Etiquette (alaskasworld.com)  News Media Policy (System Regulations 1.400 and QX Policies/Guidelines) Social Media and Other Online Activities You must be mindful to use social media and other online activities in a way that is consistent with our Company policies. You should not disclose confidential or private information about the Company, companies we do business with, our customers or co-workers. If your profile or any posting includes information that may identify you as an employee, be clear that the views posted are your own and not those of the Company. When speaking about the Company, always be truthful and accurate. No Expectation of Privacy When you create, send or store information in Company computers, physical files or other resources, you must not have an expectation of privacy in that information, even if it is password-protected. The Company reserves the right to monitor, store, access and review all email, electronic and physical files and other information created or received by you on our premises or equipment. This could include personal emails, file shares and other information. Consistent with applicable law, we may disclose all such information to law enforcement agencies or other third parties at our discretion for any reason.
 
13 Alaska Air Group Code of Conduct and Ethics Q&A 6. AVOIDING CONFLICTS OF INTEREST A conflict of interest occurs when your personal interests or activities, or those of your immediate family members, interfere with your ability to make sound and objective decisions in the best interest of the Company. You should avoid activities that create  or appear to create  a conflict of interest with the Company. Even with the best of intentions, the appearance of a conflict of interest can damage the Companys reputation, and yours. Investments in Customers, Vendors and Business Partners It is the Companys policy to award business solely on the basis of legitimate business considerations, including quality, service and competitive price. You and your immediate family members should avoid investments or other financial activities that could interfere, or appear to interfere, with your ability to remain objective and loyal to the Company. Likewise, the Companys choice of suppliers, vendors and partners must not be influenced or appear to be influenced by the personal interests or activities of employees or their immediate families. Examples of conflicts of interests, prohibited under the Code, include but are not limited to:  The Company will not transact business (other than the provision of airline services) with another entity as a supplier, customer or vendor when that entity is owned (greater than 1%) by an employee or an immediate family member of an employee, without the prior written consent of the Compliance Officer.  Employees may not own a material interest (1% or more) in a competitor of the Company, without the prior written consent of the Compliance Officer.  Employees may not make a loan to, or receive a loan from, any entity that the Company does, or seeks to do business with, other than with established banking or other lending institutions on terms available to the institutions customers generally. Q. The company recently hired my brother- in-law. No one knows were related and I had nothing to do with his hiring. It turns out well be working together on a new project, but focused on different areas. Do I need to disclose our relationship? A. There is no policy requiring disclosure. However, to avoid even the appearance of nepotism (favoritism shown because of a personal relationship), you should. It is always better to disclose any relationship. That way any potential ill feelings or concerns can be avoided. Q. My wife manages a company that can offer Alaska much better service and lower costs than the vendor were using now for certain uniform pieces. Is it okay for her to approach the company to become a supplier? A. Generally, the company prohibits buying products and services from Alaska or Horizon employees, their immediate families and close relatives. Doing so may put the companys reputation for integrity and fairness at risk. However, if you are not part of the decision making process, and both you and your wife disclose your relationship, she is not prohibited from submitting a bid or business proposal. In these circumstances, if after weighing all considerations, the final decision maker believes it is in the best interest of the company to award the contract to an employee or their relative, he/she may do so after obtaining the prior written consent of the Compliance Officer.
 
14 Alaska Air Group Code of Conduct and Ethics Q&A Receiving Gifts and Other Business Courtesies Accepting gifts or other business courtesies where the receipt of such is in any way related to the fact that you are affiliated with the Company is another situation where your interests may become, or appear to become, conflicted as this could be construed as an attempt to improperly influence your business decisions. Gifts or business courtesies may include such things as discounts, passes, use of equipment/facilities, personal favors, meals, drinks or entertainment, such as tickets to cultural or sporting events. Pass privileges pursuant to interline agreements between Alaska Airlines/ Horizon Air and other air carriers are exempted as are travel industry discount rates at hotels, car rentals and the like that are generally available to persons involved in the travel industry. Since business decisions at the Company must always be made solely on the basis of legitimate business interests, you must be very aware and cautious in any circumstances that include the offer of gifts or business courtesies. Because it is not always clear what gifts and/or business courtesies are acceptable, decisions to accept or decline the offer of a gift or courtesy require the exercise of sound judgment and good business sense. You must therefore make every effort to assure that your decision is appropriate. In some circumstances the exchange of gifts or courtesies is acceptable. Sometimes, for example, sound business strategy dictates the development of a good working relationship with a vendor or supplier. Opportunities to enhance the business relationship through participation in social, cultural or sporting events as the guest of a vendor or supplier may be warranted so long as it is reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances. In your business dealings, you may never accept a gift or gratuity of cash or a cash equivalent (such as credit cards or gift cards). Note: a gift card of minimal value, $25 or less, may be accepted so long as all other guidelines and criteria related to business gifts and courtesies are met. Many decisions are not so clear. Here are some general guidelines and criteria for you to follow:  You and your immediate family may not accept a gift or business courtesy if the acceptance of such a gift could reasonably be seen to influence or limit your ability to make business decisions based solely on the best interest of the Company. If challenged, the determination on reasonableness in the context of this guideline will be made by the Compliance Officer in consultation with the appropriate division officer, Executive Committee member or the Chairperson of the Boards Audit Committee.  You should be particularly cautious in accepting gifts or courtesies where you are involved in, or actively participate in, business decisions to purchase goods or services from the offeror. All offers from entities where you are the decision maker or purchaser from that entity must be disclosed to your division vice president and to the Compliance Officer.  You may only accept a gift or business courtesy if it is within the range of usual and customary gifts and business courtesies that are exchanged in similar circumstances in the industry.  Acceptance of gifts or business courtesies valued at greater than $250 must be disclosed, in writing, to your supervisor. Q. A company vendor is co-sponsoring a trade- show and has invited me to attend as their guest. This is a four day, out of town, event that will give me an opportunity to get to know this and other vendors better, in addition to an opportunity to network and socialize with industry peers. Is it okay to attend this event? A. The decision is best made between you and your division leadership. You should discuss this with your manager and/or division vice president. If the value of this trip is greater than $500, you must obtain approval in writing by your division vice president after consultation with the Compliance Officer.
 
15 Alaska Air Group Code of Conduct and Ethics  Acceptance of gifts or business courtesies valued at greater than $500 must be approved in advance in writing by the division vice president (vice presidents should gain approval from the appropriate Executive Committee member, Executive Committee members need approval from the CEO; and the CEO must seek approval from the Compliance Officer). Determinations for approval of gifts or courtesies under this section must be made in consultation with the Compliance Officer.  You may not solicit gifts or business courtesies from anyone conducting business with the Company, or anyone who seeks to do business with the Company. Certain divisions may, from time to time, set more restrictive policies related to the acceptance and giving of gifts for employees of that division. If you have any hesitation or need guidance on the appropriateness of a gift or business courtesy, you should disclose the offer and discuss it with your supervisor or with the Compliance Officer. Any gift or courtesy that is accepted without proper disclosure or approval and is later determined to be outside of these guidelines may lead to discipline, up to and including dismissal. FOR MORE INFORMATION: Policies/Manuals:  Congressional and Executive Branch Gift Policy (System Regulations 11.500 and QX Policies/Guidelines) Giving Gifts and Other Business Courtesies Gifts and business courtesies offered or given by or on behalf of the Company must support the legitimate business interests of the Company and must be reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances. No gift should be given, no matter how modest, if it could reasonably be construed as an attempt to improperly promote the Companys business. You should also ask about and be sensitive to the gift policy of the firm with which you are doing business. Congressional and Executive Branch Gifts There are strict rules that apply when conducting business with U.S. government officials. Company policy prohibits employees, acting in their professional capacity, from giving any gifts to Members of Congress, their staff or federal Executive Branch officials. This prohibition includes giving gifts of even nominal value (e.g. promotional items, upgrades, waiving fees, etc.). Similar limits exist for gifts to most state and local officials. Although there are limited exceptions, you must obtain prior approval from the Government/Public Affairs Department prior to offering any gift under any such exception.
 
16 Alaska Air Group Code of Conduct and Ethics Outside Employment or Directorship Remember, a conflict of interest exists if your outside business interests can affect  or appear to affect  your ability to make decisions in the best interest of the Company. Therefore, you may not take a second job with an outside organization if such employment would create an actual or perceived conflict of interest such as employment with a supplier, customer or competitor. You may not act as a consultant to any such entity, nor may you engage in your own business, when such business could cause a potential conflict with the Companys interests. While these arrangements are generally discouraged, there may be specific and limited circumstances in which they are approved. Such approval must be granted in writing, and in advance, by your division vice president. Similarly, you must obtain the prior written consent of your division officer (or Executive Committee member, where appropriate; Executive Committee members need approval from the CEO) before establishing other business affiliations, such as serving as an officer or on the board of directors of a supplier, customer or competitor, or any entity with which the Company does business (other than the provision of airline services). In instances where the CEO is offered any such opportunity he/she will seek the approval of the Governance/Nominating Committee of the Board before accepting such an offer. In order to assure consistency, the division officer and/ or Executive Committee member must consult with the Compliance Officer before granting permission for any outside employment or business affiliations as described above. Even when the other entity is not a supplier, customer or competitor, if the opportunity for an outside business affiliation (e.g. board of director position) arises directly out of your affiliation with the Company, you should disclose the opportunity to your supervisor before accepting the position. In all cases, you are prohibited from holding a second job with, or becoming an officer or board member of, any outside entity where such activity distracts from optimum performance of your job at the Company or may reasonably be seen as negatively impacting the Companys image and/ or reputation. Determinations on the propriety of second jobs or business affiliations arising under this paragraph are to be made by the division officer in consultation with the Compliance Officer. Where there is a determination that the FOR MORE INFORMATION: Policies/Manuals:  Employment (Human Resources Guide: System Regulations 2.103)  Corporate Governance Guidelines, online at alaskaair.com second job or outside business affiliation may not be taken out of concern for the Companys image or reputation, the employee may ask to have the Executive Committee review that determination. When outside employment and business affiliations are approved, employees remain subject to all confidentiality agreements and requirements to protect proprietary or confidential information of the Company. If you engage in other gainful employment while on medical leave from the Company without prior written permission from the Company and union, if applicable, except employees on approved special assignments considered to be in the interest of the Company, you will be considered to have resigned from the Company and, if applicable, your name will be removed from the related seniority roster(s). Board Members of the Company may, of course, have outside employment and have other affiliations with business or charitable organizations. All such relationships should be consistent with the Companys Corporate Governance Guidelines. Participation in Civic or Political Activities Participation in public affairs (such as holding an office in local government or voicing your opinion at a city council meeting) and political activities (such as attending a fundraising event for a particular political party or candidate) must be conducted on your own time and in your personal capacity. Your public or political activities must not interfere with your job performance or create an actual or potential conflict of interest for the Company. Elected officers of the Company may authorize public or political contributions on behalf of the Company, subject to the prior approval of the Government/Public Affairs Department or the General Counsel.
 
17 Alaska Air Group Code of Conduct and Ethics 7. CORPORATE OPPORTUNITIES A corporate opportunity is a potential business dealing with a third party that may be beneficial to the Company. We expect that if a corporate opportunity arises in the course of your employment with or service for the Company, you will first present that opportunity to the Company. If the Company declines to take advantage of the opportunity, you may present it to another entity with which you are connected, or pursue on your own. 8. FAIR DEALING It is necessary for our success that we compete vigorously with our competitors and strive for the best possible terms with our vendors and business partners. At the same time, we should deal fairly with others in pursuing these goals. This means demonstrating integrity, honoring our commitments and not taking unfair advantage of others. You should avoid manipulation, misuse of proprietary information, misrepresentation of material facts and other abusive practices. One way to look at this issue is to ask, Are we behaving like a company that we would want to do business with? 9. WAIVERS AND AMENDMENTS No provision of this Code may be waived except by the Compliance Officer, in consultation with the applicable division vice president or Executive Committee member. Waivers involving officers or members of the Board of Directors must be approved by the AAG Audit Committee. The Company will publicly disclose any waiver given to an executive officer or Board Member. The principles and supporting policies referenced in this Code may change from time to time. Employees are responsible for knowing and complying with current laws, regulations, policies and procedures that govern our work. Substantive changes to the Code require approval and adoption by the AAG Audit Committee. The most current version of the Code will be published internally as part of Alaska Airlines System Regulations, Horizon Airs Policies/ Guidelines, and will be available to the public via www.alaskaair.com.

Exhibit 99.1
Investor Update -
November 15, 2012
References in this update to Air Group, Company, we, us, and our refer to Alaska Air Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise specified.
This update includes forecasted operational and financial information for our mainline and consolidated operations. Our disclosure of operating cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel and other items, provides us (and may provide investors) with the ability to measure and monitor our performance without these items. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is total operating expenses per available seat mile. However, due to the large fluctuations in fuel prices, we are unable to predict total operating expenses for any future period with any degree of certainty. In addition, we believe the disclosure of fuel expense on an economic basis is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. Please see the cautionary statement under Forward-Looking Information.
We are providing information about estimated fuel prices and our hedging program. Management believes it is useful to compare results between periods on an economic basis.
Economic fuel expense
is defined as the raw or into-plane fuel cost less any cash we receive from hedge counterparties for hedges that settle during the period, offset by the recognition of premiums originally paid for those hedges that settle during the period. Economic fuel expense more closely approximates the net cash outflow associated with purchasing fuel for our operation.
Forward-Looking Information
This update contains forward-looking statements subject to the safe harbor protection provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements relate to future events and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual outcomes to be materially different from those indicated by any forward-looking statements. For a comprehensive discussion of potential risk factors, see Item 1A of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2011
. Some of these risks include general economic conditions, increases in operating costs including fuel, competition, labor costs and relations, our significant indebtedness, inability to meet cost reduction goals, seasonal fluctuations in our financial results, an aircraft accident, and changes in laws and regulations. All of the forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the risk factors discussed therein. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risk factors emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict such new risk factors, nor can it assess the impact, if any, of such new risk factors on our business or events described in any forward-looking statements. We expressly disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date of this report to conform them to actual results. Over time, our actual results, performance or achievements will likely differ from the anticipated results, performance or achievements that are expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements, and such differences might be significant and materially adverse.

Alaska Air Group Inc. (NYSE: ALK) today reported
December
and year-end operational results for its subsidiaries, Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air, and on a combined basis. Detailed information is provided below.
ALASKA AIRLINES - MAINLINE
Alaska reported an
8.4 percent
increase
in traffic on a
9.9 percent
increase
in capacity compared to
December 2011
. This resulted in a
1.1-point
decrease
in load factor to
86.3 percent
. Alaska also reported
83.3 percent
of its flights arrived on time in
December
, compared to the
85.4 percent
reported in
December 2011
. For the full-year
2012
, Alaska reported a record load factor of
86.6 percent
and carried a record

HORIZON AIR
Horizon reported a
5.3 percent
increase
in December traffic on a
4.6 percent
increase
in capacity compared to
December 2011
. This resulted in a
0.7-point
increase
in load factor to a
December
record of
79.4 percent

78.3 percent
. Horizon also reported
85.2 percent
of its flights arrived on time in

December 2011
.
The following table shows Horizon's operational results for December and full-year
2012
, compared to the prior-year periods:
The year-to-date decline in capacity and traffic for Horizon from the prior year is due primarily to the completion of Horizon's transition out of the CRJ-700 regional jet. This transition was completed in June 2011.
AIR GROUP (including flights operated by third parties)
On a combined basis, Air Group reported an
8.1 percent
increase

Exhibit 99.2
 
Investor Update -
January 10, 2013
Note to Investors
This abbreviated Investor Update is being provided to communicate certain actual
fourth
quarter
2012
mainline and consolidated operating statistics. It includes forecasted mainline and consolidated unit cost (excluding fuel) and passenger unit revenue (PRASM) information, estimated economic fuel cost per gallon for the quarter, and expected consolidated non-operating expense.  
Unit revenue, unit cost and other financial forecasts are estimates only. Actual amounts reported may differ and are dependent on our normal quarter-end closing process.
A full Investor Update with information about fuel hedge positions, planned capital expenditures, fleet information, and share repurchase activity will be provided in connection with our
fourth
quarter earnings release scheduled for
January 24, 2013
.
References in this update to Air Group, Company, we, us, and our refer to Alaska Air Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise specified.
Information about Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
This update includes forecasted operational and financial information for our consolidated and mainline operations. Our disclosure of operating cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel and other items, provides us (and may provide investors) with the ability to measure and monitor our performance without these items. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is total operating expense per available seat mile. However, due to the large fluctuations in fuel prices, we are unable to predict total operating expense for any future period with any degree of certainty. In addition, we believe the disclosure of fuel expense on an economic basis is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. Please see the cautionary statement under Forward-Looking Information.
We are providing unaudited information about fuel price movements and the impact of our hedging program on our financial results. Management believes it is useful to compare results between periods on an economic basis.
Economic fuel expense
is defined as the raw or into-plane fuel cost less any cash we receive from hedge counterparties for hedges that settle during the period, offset by the recognition of premiums originally paid for those hedges that settle during the period. Economic fuel expense more closely approximates the net cash outflow associated with purchasing fuel for our operation.
Forward-Looking Information 
This update contains forward-looking statements subject to the safe harbor protection provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements relate to future events and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual outcomes to be materially different from those indicated by any forward-looking statements. For a comprehensive discussion of potential risk factors, see Item 1A of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2011
. Some of these risks include general economic conditions, increases in operating costs including fuel, competition, labor costs and relations, our significant indebtedness, inability to meet cost reduction goals, seasonal fluctuations in our financial results, an aircraft accident, and changes in laws and regulations. All of the forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the risk factors discussed therein. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risk factors emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict such new risk factors, nor can it assess the impact, if any, of such new risk factors on our business or events described in any forward-looking statements. We expressly disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date of this report to conform them to actual results. Over time, our actual results, performance or achievements will likely differ from the anticipated results, performance or achievements that are expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements, and such differences might be significant and materially adverse.

Note A:
 Pursuant to Regulation G, we are providing disclosure of the reconciliation of reported non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable financial measures reported on a GAAP basis. We believe that consideration of these non-GAAP financial measures may be important to investors for the following reasons:
Note B:
Air Group's operations are treated as an integrated route network intended to maximize the results of the company. However, the Company has historically had two primary operating and reporting segments, consisting of Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air, for which separate financial information is available and regularly evaluated by our chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance.
Alaska operates a fleet of passenger jets ("mainline operations") and contracts with affiliated (Horizon) and non-affiliated third party carriers for regional capacity under which Alaska receives all passenger revenue from those flights. Horizon operates a fleet of turboprop aircraft and sells all of its capacity to Alaska pursuant to a capacity purchase arrangement (the Horizon CPA). The Horizon CPA reflects what the Company believes are current market rates received by other regional carriers for similar flying. Amounts paid by Alaska to Horizon are for various Horizon operating expenses such as crew expenses, maintenance, and aircraft ownership costs.
All inter-company revenues and expenses are eliminated in consolidation.

Exhibit 99.1
Investor Update -
February 21, 2013
References in this update to Air Group, Company, we, us, and our refer to Alaska Air Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise specified.
This update includes forecasted operational and financial information for our mainline and consolidated operations. Our disclosure of operating cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel and other items, provides us (and may provide investors) with the ability to measure and monitor our performance without these items. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is total operating expenses per available seat mile. However, due to the large fluctuations in fuel prices, we are unable to predict total operating expenses for any future period with any degree of certainty. In addition, we believe the disclosure of fuel expense on an economic basis is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. Please see the cautionary statement under Forward-Looking Information.
We are providing information about estimated fuel prices and our hedging program. Management believes it is useful to compare results between periods on an economic basis.
Economic fuel expense
is defined as the raw or into-plane fuel cost less any cash we receive from hedge counterparties for hedges that settle during the period, offset by the recognition of premiums originally paid for those hedges that settle during the period. Economic fuel expense more closely approximates the net cash outflow associated with purchasing fuel for our operation.
Forward-Looking Information
This update contains forward-looking statements subject to the safe harbor protection provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements relate to future events and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual outcomes to be materially different from those indicated by any forward-looking statements. For a comprehensive discussion of potential risk factors, see Item 1A of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2012
. Some of these risks include general economic conditions, increases in operating costs including fuel, competition, labor costs and relations, our significant indebtedness, inability to meet cost reduction goals, seasonal fluctuations in our financial results, an aircraft accident, and changes in laws and regulations. All of the forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the risk factors discussed therein. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risk factors emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict such new risk factors, nor can it assess the impact, if any, of such new risk factors on our business or events described in any forward-looking statements. We expressly disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date of this report to conform them to actual results. Over time, our actual results, performance or achievements will likely differ from the anticipated results, performance or achievements that are expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements, and such differences might be significant and materially adverse.

Investor Update -
April 9, 2013
Note to Investors
This abbreviated Investor Update is being provided to communicate certain actual
first
quarter
2013
mainline and consolidated operating statistics.  It includes forecasted mainline and consolidated unit cost (excluding fuel) and passenger unit revenue (PRASM) information, estimated economic fuel cost per gallon, and expected consolidated non-operating expense.  
Unit revenue, unit cost and other financial forecasts are estimates only. Actual amounts reported may differ and are dependent on our normal quarter-end closing process.
A full Investor Update with information about fuel hedge positions, planned capital expenditures, fleet information, and share repurchase activity will be provided in connection with our
first
quarter earnings release scheduled for
April 25, 2013
.
References in this update to Air Group, Company, we, us, and our refer to Alaska Air Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise specified.
Information about Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
This update includes forecasted operational and financial information for our mainline and consolidated operations. Our disclosure of operating cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel and other items, provides us (and may provide investors) with the ability to measure and monitor our performance without these items. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is total operating expense per available seat mile. However, due to the large fluctuations in fuel prices, we are unable to predict total operating expense for any future period with any degree of certainty. In addition, we believe the disclosure of fuel expense on an economic basis is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. Please see the cautionary statement under Forward-Looking Information.
We are providing unaudited information about fuel price movements and the impact of our hedging program on our financial results. Management believes it is useful to compare results between periods on an economic basis.
Economic fuel expense
is defined as the raw or into-plane fuel cost less any cash we receive from hedge counterparties for hedges that settle during the period, offset by the recognition of premiums originally paid for those hedges that settle during the period. Economic fuel expense more closely approximates the net cash outflow associated with purchasing fuel for our operation.
Forward-Looking Information 
This update contains forward-looking statements subject to the safe harbor protection provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements relate to future events and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual outcomes to be materially different from those indicated by any forward-looking statements. For a comprehensive discussion of potential risk factors, see Item 1A of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2012
. Some of these risks include general economic conditions, increases in operating costs including fuel, competition, labor costs and relations, our significant indebtedness, inability to meet cost reduction goals, seasonal fluctuations in our financial results, an aircraft accident, and changes in laws and regulations. All of the forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the risk factors discussed therein. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risk factors emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict such new risk factors, nor can it assess the impact, if any, of such new risk factors on our business or events described in any forward-looking statements.

per diluted share in

$28 million

Our record performance in what is seasonally our weakest quarter is due to steady demand that kept pace with our growth, and to the many changes we've made to improve our business over the last several years, Alaska Air Group CEO Brad Tilden said. Looking ahead, we're facing increased competition in certain markets, and we will closely monitor the
1
environment and continue to adjust our plans to appropriately address these challenges. Our first quarter results, and our ability to be flexible and adapt to an ever-changing industry landscape, would not be possible without the dedication and determination of our employees at Alaska and Horizon.
The following table reconciles the company's reported GAAP net income and earnings per diluted share (EPS) during the
first
quarters of
2013
and
2012
to adjusted amounts:
 
Statistical data, as well as a reconciliation of the reported non-GAAP financial measures, can be found in the accompanying tables. A glossary of financial terms can be found on the last page of this release.
A conference call regarding the

Note A:
 Pursuant to Regulation G, we are providing disclosure of the reconciliation of reported non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable financial measures reported on a GAAP basis. We believe that consideration of these non-GAAP financial measures may be important to investors for the following reasons:
Note B:
Air Group has two operating airlines - Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air. Each is a regulated airline with separate management teams. To manage the two operating airlines, management views the business in three operating segments. Alaska operates a fleet of passenger jets (Alaska Mainline) and contracts with Horizon, SkyWest Airlines, Inc. (SkyWest), and Peninsula Airways, Inc. (PenAir) for regional capacity under which Alaska receives all passenger revenue from those flights (Alaska Regional). Horizon operates a fleet of turboprop aircraft and sells all of its capacity to Alaska pursuant to a capacity purchase arrangement (Horizon). The Company believes the amounts paid by Alaska to Horizon reflect current market rates received by other regional carriers for similar flying and are available to pay for various Horizon operating expenses such as crew expenses, maintenance, and aircraft ownership costs. All inter-company revenues and expenses between Alaska and Horizon are eliminated in consolidation.

Glossary of Terms
Mainline
- represents flying on Alaska jets and all associated revenues and costs
Regional
- represents operations whereby Horizon, SkyWest, and another small carrier in the state of Alaska fly certain routes for Alaska using Horizon's or the other carrier's fleets
RPMs
- revenue passenger miles, or "traffic"; represents the number of seats that were filled with paying passengers; one passenger traveling one mile is one RPM
ASMs
- available seat miles, or capacity; represents total seats available across the fleet multiplied by the number of miles flown
Load Factor
- RPMs as a percentage of ASMs; represents the number of available seats that were filled with paying passengers
Yield
- passenger revenue per RPM; represents the average revenue for flying one passenger one mile
PRASM
- passenger revenue per ASM; commonly called passenger unit revenue
RASM
- operating revenue per ASMs, or "unit revenue"; operating revenue includes all passenger revenue, freight & mail, Mileage Plan, and other ancillary revenue; represents the average total revenue for flying one seat one mile
CASM
- operating costs per ASM, or "unit cost"; represents all operating expenses including fuel and special items
CASMex
- operating costs excluding fuel and special items per ASM; this metric is used to help track progress toward reduction of non-fuel operating costs since fuel is largely out of our control
Economic Fuel
- best estimate of the cash cost of fuel, net of the impact of our fuel-hedging program
Aircraft Utilization
- block hours per day; this represents the average number of hours our aircraft are flying
Aircraft Stage Length
- represents the average miles flown per aircraft departure
Diluted Earnings per Share
- represents earnings per share using fully diluted shares outstanding
Diluted Shares -
represents the total number of shares that would be outstanding if all possible sources of conversion, such as stock options, were exercised

Exhibit 99.2
Investor Update -
April 25, 2013
References in this update to Air Group, Company, we, us, and our refer to Alaska Air Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise specified.
This update includes forecasted operational and financial information for our mainline and consolidated operations. Our disclosure of operating cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel and other items, provides us (and may provide investors) with the ability to measure and monitor our performance without these items. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is total operating expenses per available seat mile. However, due to the large fluctuations in fuel prices, we are unable to predict total operating expenses for any future period with any degree of certainty. In addition, we believe the disclosure of fuel expense on an economic basis is useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. Please see the cautionary statement under Forward-Looking Information.
We are providing information about estimated fuel prices and our hedging program. Management believes it is useful to compare results between periods on an economic basis.
Economic fuel expense
is defined as the raw or into-plane fuel cost less any cash we receive from hedge counterparties for hedges that settle during the period, offset by the recognition of premiums originally paid for those hedges that settle during the period. Economic fuel expense more closely approximates the net cash outflow associated with purchasing fuel for our operation.
Forward-Looking Information
This update contains forward-looking statements subject to the safe harbor protection provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements relate to future events and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual outcomes to be materially different from those indicated by any forward-looking statements. For a comprehensive discussion of potential risk factors, see Item 1A of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2012
. Some of these risks include general economic conditions, increases in operating costs including fuel, competition, labor costs and relations, our significant indebtedness, inability to meet cost reduction goals, seasonal fluctuations in our financial results, an aircraft accident, and changes in laws and regulations. All of the forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the risk factors discussed therein. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risk factors emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict such new risk factors, nor can it assess the impact, if any, of such new risk factors on our business or events described in any forward-looking statements. We expressly disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date of this report to conform them to actual results. Over time, our actual results, performance or achievements will likely differ from the anticipated results, performance or achievements that are expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements, and such differences might be significant and materially adverse.
