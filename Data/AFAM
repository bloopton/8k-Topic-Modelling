OTHER EVENTS This regulation is being made pursuant to regulation FD. The registrant issued the attached press release today regarding redemption of 210,100 shares of its common stock and the continuation of an issuer repurchase program.

Exhibit 1. Press Release by Almost Family, Inc. dated August 19, 2002. FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE August 19, 2002 Almost Family Buys Back 8.4% Stake from Large Shareholder Continues On-Going Stock Repurchase Program Louisville, KY - Almost Family, Inc. (NASDAQ:AFAM) announced today that it has redeemed 210,100 shares of its common stock held by David T. Russell PhD. The shares redeemed represent 8.4% of the total shares outstanding prior to the transaction. Dr. Russell continues to hold approximately 30,000 shares of AFAM common stock or 1.3% of outstanding shares. The total purchase price for the stock redeemed was approximately $1.525 million, which was paid in cash today with funds available to the Company under its bank credit facility. The price paid per share was $7.25 representing a 13% discount to Friday's closing price and a 30% discount to the average trading price over the last 30 calendar days. Had the transaction been completed at the beginning of the Company's current fiscal year, pro-forma earnings per share for the six months ended June 30, 2002, would have been $0.26 which is $0.01 or 4% higher than the reported $0.25. The Company expects the transaction to be accretive to earnings per share in future periods as well. "This transaction re-emphasizes the confidence management and the Board of Directors have in the Company and in our prospects for the future." said William B. Yarmuth, AFAM's Chairman and CEO, adding "It also allows us, in effect, to acquire a significant amount of cash flow for our existing shareholders at an attractive and accretive price. Furthermore, we will continue our pre-existing repurchase program independent of today's transaction." The redemption of Dr. Russell's shares was approved by the Board of Directors outside of its previously initiated stock repurchase plan. That plan, which is compliant with Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, permits purchases to take place selectively from time to time in open market purchases through a broker or in privately negotiated transactions. Approximately $400,000 remains available for repurchases under that plan. Dr. Russell commented on the share redemption: "This transaction was necessary due to certain unfortunate personal financial circumstances. I continue to believe strongly in the future of AFAM, in the Board of Directors and in management and I continue to hold a personally significant ownership in the Company."

Exhibit 99 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE August 14, 2003 Almost Family Announces Second Quarter Results Louisville, KY - Almost Family, Inc. (NASDAQ:AFAM) today announced its operating results for the three month and six month periods ended June 30, 2003. The Company filed its Form 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission today. Please refer to that filing for additional information. In the information that follows "ADHS" refers to the Company's Adult Day Health Services segment and "VN" refers to the Company's Visiting Nurse segment. Results of operations for the three months ended June 30, 2003 and 2002 are set forth in the table below:
Results for the Quarter William B. Yarmuth, Chairman and CEO commented on the Company's results for the quarter: "We are pleased with the results for the quarter given the difficult reimbursement environment in which we currently operate. We are especially pleased with the strong growth in admissions in our Visiting Nurse segment which increased 16% with the same number of agencies in operation in both periods. This growth in admissions has enabled us to overcome the Medicare rate cuts that amounted to over $450,000 at our revenue and pre-tax income lines. In our ADHS segment we have bounced back from our weather impacted performance in the first quarter. We have also been very happy with the assimilation of the our Ohio acquisition made in the middle of last year which has helped to offset some volume declines in other ADHS business units." Medicaid Program Budget Short-falls The Company noted that throughout the country States have been faced with budget shortfalls and are making significant reductions in their Medicaid budgets in addressing these shortfalls. The Company continues to monitor the impact of the trends in reimbursement in the States in which it operates and may require additional actions to lower operating costs. Yarmuth added "We have weathered some pretty significant reimbursement cuts both from Medicare and Medicaid over the past year. Although we believe this to be an issue driven by the cyclical slowdown in the U.S. economy, if it continues it will likely present challenges for all providers participating in Medicaid programs." The Company noted it is possible that the actions taken by the state Medicaid programs could have a significant unfavorable impact on the Company's results of operations, particularly in its ADHS segment and is advising investors to read the Form 10-Q in its entirety for additional details. Potential Medicare Reimbursement for Adult Day Care Yarmuth also commented on the increasing potential for Medicare reimbursement for adult day care services, "Contained in the Medicare Prescription Drug legislation currently under consideration in the U.S. Congress are two similar provisions that would create a Federal demonstration project impacting medical adult day care. Both provisions authorize a new demonstration project that would pay for home health beneficiaries receiving their treatment in medical adult day care centers. The project would be the first step toward the industry's goal of accessing Medicare reimbursement. This is something we have been working on for a long time that can benefit patients and the Medicare program by generating better patient outcomes at a lower cost. Additionally, the Company believes that if this demonstration project is initiated it will offer significant additional long term development opportunities for adult day care."
Six Month Results Results of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2003 and 2002 are set forth in the table below: As reported in the quarter ended March 31, 2003, decreased attendance in the Company's adult day care centers directly related to snow and ice, particularly during the month of February 2003, reduced net income by approximately $0.05 per diluted share. As described above for the quarter, earnings for the six months ended June 2003 were also adversely impacted by changes in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates but were favorably impacted by the acquisition of Medlink Ohio personal care operations in July 2002.

(NASDAQ:AFAM) today announced its operating results for the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2003. Additionally, the Company announced that it has been awarded a $2.8 million two-year adult day care demonstration project by the state of Florida. The Company filed its Form 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission today. Please refer to that filing for additional information. In the information that follows "ADHS" refers to the Company's Adult Day Health Services segment and "VN" refers to the Company's Visiting Nurse segment. Results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2003 and 2002 are set forth in the table below:
Results for the Quarter William B. Yarmuth, Chairman and CEO commented on the Company's results for the quarter: "The current reimbursement environment remains difficult but we continue our efforts to improve profitability. We are pleased to report that our ADHS segment has achieved its first favorable comparison in several quarters reflecting the positive steps we have taken to reduce operating costs in the face of declining Medicaid unit sales. Our VN segment continues to achieve strong growth in admissions which has helped us to partially offset Medicare rate cuts that amounted to over $430,000 in revenue and pre-tax income." Florida ADC Demonstration Project The Company also announced that it has been awarded a $2.8 million two-year adult day care demonstration project by the state of Florida. "We are very excited that the state of Florida has awarded this very important project to Almost Family after a competitive bidding process. We believe the award recognizes our position as the market leader in adult day care and we are very happy to partner with Florida to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of adult day care as an alternative to nursing home placement. We plan to fulfill the contract by taking care of patients in our Fort Myers and Palm Beach day centers. We are confident that the project will demonstrate that state spending will be significantly lower on these patients than if they were institutionalized." said Yarmuth. The Company noted that it expects the contract to begin to produce revenue in the first quarter of 2004.
Nine Month Results Results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2003 and 2002 are set forth in the table below: As reported in the quarter ended March 31, 2003, decreased attendance in the Company's adult day care centers directly related to snow and ice, particularly during the month of February 2003, reduced net income by approximately $0.05 per diluted share. As described above for the quarter, earnings for the nine months ended September 2003 were also adversely impacted by changes in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates but were favorably impacted by the acquisition of Medlink Ohio personal care operations in July 2002. Unallocated corporate expenses in the nine months ended September 30, 2002 include approximately $816,000, consisting primarily of professional fees, related to the cost of conducting the investigation into the restatement of the Company's financial statements as previously disclosed. Almost Family, Inc. is a health services company providing adult day health care services focused on providing alternatives for seniors and other special needs adults who wish to avoid nursing home and other institutional placement.

Exhibit 99.1 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE March 26, 2004 Almost Family Announces Year End Results, Comments on Business Plan Louisville, KY - Almost Family, Inc. (NASDAQ:AFAM) today announced its operating results for the year ended December 31, 2003. Additionally, the Company announced the extension of its senior credit facility through June 2006 and shared with investors a view on the Company's business plan. The Company filed its Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission today. Please refer to that filing for additional information. In the information that follows "VN" refers to the Company's Visiting Nurse segment and "ADHS" refers to the Company's Adult Day Health Services segment. Operating Results for the Year Net income for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $2,120,197 or $0.84 per diluted share compared to $1,344,913 or $0.49 per diluted share in 2002. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2003 included a one-time income tax credit of $854,146 or $0.34 per diluted share resulting from the reversal of income tax reserves no longer required. Net income from continuing operations was $1,266,051 or $0.50 per diluted share in 2003 as compared to $1,344,913 or $0.49 per diluted share in 2002 in spite of a significant rate reduction from Medicare and significant increases in insurance costs in 2003. Results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 are set forth in the tables below:
William B. Yarmuth, Chairman and CEO commented on the Company's operating results: "Despite a difficult reimbursement environment, our performance was strong enough to enable us to overcome both Medicare rate cuts that reduced 2003 revenue and pre-tax income by over $1 million between years and some very significant cutbacks by the Kentucky Medicaid program. On the positive side, we were able to grow same-store admissions in our Visiting Nurse segment by nearly 7%, and the Medlink acquisition in July 2002 was a significant contributor between years to our 2003 results. Additionally, we are encouraged that Kentucky's new governor recently announced a loosening of the state's Medicaid eligibility requirements, in effect reversing most of the restrictions put in place last year by the previous administration." The Company noted that it is too early to predict the financial impact, if any, of the relaxation of eligibility standards in Kentucky. The Company also announced that its senior lender has extended the terms of its credit facility through June 2006. Operating Results for the Quarter Net income for the quarter ended December 31, 2003 was $1,108,722 or $0.43 per diluted share compared to $376,693 or $0.15 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2002. Net income for the quarter ended December 31, 2003 included a one-time income tax credit of $854,146 or $0.33 per diluted share resulting from the reversal of income tax reserves no longer required. Continuing operations earnings per diluted share were $0.10 compared to $0.15 in the same period last year. Earnings for the quarter ended December 31, 2003 included one-time facility losses totaling $112,076 or $0.03 per diluted share. The tax provision from continuing operations for 2003 included a credit of $116,000 or $0.05 per diluted share related to the elimination of a valuation allowance on certain state tax net operating loss carryforwards. Results of operations for the three months ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 are set forth in the table that follows.
The Company's Business Plan The Company's just-filed 2003 Form 10-K includes a description of its business plan which calls for an increase in emphasis on the Company's Visiting Nurse segment through same store sales growth and acquisitions of other quality providers of Medicare-based home nursing services. Based on its business plan, the Company expects its Visiting Nurse revenues to grow from under one-third of total revenues to about one-half of total revenues sometime in the next three to five years. Yarmuth commented on the business plan as follows: "We believe that our ability to adapt our operations to meet changes in reimbursement as they occur has been an important key to our historical success, and that diversification of payment sources will continue to be important to our success in the future. Therefore, while we plan to increase our focus on our Visiting Nurse operations, we believe that our Adult Day Health Services operations will continue to play an important role in generating cash flow and enable us to maintain a prudent level of diversification. Despite recent strain on the finances of state Medicaid programs, there is a substantial population of adults who require healthcare services. We remain convinced that our ADHS programs represent the most desirable and cost-effective solution available to this large and growing constituency." Readers are encouraged to read the Company's 2003 Form 10-K for a more complete discussion of the Company's business plan. Almost Family, Inc. TM and subsidiaries (collectively "Almost Family") is a leading regional provider of home health nursing services and adult day health services. The Company has operations in Alabama, Connecticut, Florida, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, and Ohio. Contact: William Yarmuth or Steve Guenthner (502) 891-1000.

Exhibit 99.1 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE May 14, 2004 Almost Family Announces First Quarter Results - Net Income Up 26% Over Prior Year Louisville, KY - Almost Family, Inc. (NASDAQ:AFAM) today announced its operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2004. Basic earnings per share were $0.13 in 2004 versus $0.10 in the same quarter of 2003 for an increase of 30%. The Company's VN revenue increased nearly 10%, while overall Home Health Care revenue grew 5.4%. Adult Day Care revenue declined 6% primarily as a result of store closings in late 2003. The Company filed its Form 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission today. Please refer to that filing for additional information. William B. Yarmuth, Chairman and CEO commented on the Company's results for the quarter: "We are very pleased to report a 30% increase in earnings per share as compared to the previous year. Our Visiting Nurse segment turned in strong admissions, revenue and operating income growth. Focusing our attention on the growth prospects of this segment continues to pay off. We have opened two new Florida Medicare agencies in keeping with our plan to emphasize the development of our VN segment. Additionally, the steps we took over the course of 2003 to reduce general and administrative expenses throughout the Company are now evident in our comparisons." The Company also noted that the quarter ending March 31, typically generates lower operating income than in the other quarters as the winter weather tends to temporarily lower ADC in-center attendance. After removing the effect of adult day care centers closed during 2003, all three of the Company's reportable segments generated volume growth in the quarter. Regarding the ADC segment results Yarmuth added: "The condition of the state Medicaid programs continues to present challenges to the adult day care segment. We are, however, beginning to see some encouraging signs of the recognition that cuts over the past few years have been excessive. For example, in a recent case a Federal court ordered Kentucky to reinstate thousands of Medicaid beneficiaries who had been denied services since early in 2003. Ultimately, we believe that Medicaid policy makers will see that home and community based services like adult day care are effective tools in lowering total long-term care spending." The Company added that it expects to see improved earnings from the ADC segment in the June quarter.
Results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2004 and 2003 are set forth in the table below: The Company's 2003 Form 10-K includes a description of its business plan which calls for an increase in emphasis on the Visiting Nurse segment.

(NASDAQ:AFAM) today announced its operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2004. Basic earnings per share for the quarter were $0.18 in 2004 versus $0.12 in the same quarter of 2003. Basic earnings per share for the nine months ended September 30 were $0.48 in 2004 versus $0.44 in the same period of 2003. In the quarter ended September 30, 2004, the Company's VN revenue increased over 9%, while overall Home Health Care revenue grew 7% as compared to the same quarter of 2003. Adult Day Care revenue declined 9.5% as a result of store closings. On a same store basis ADC days sold increased about 3%. William B. Yarmuth, Chairman and CEO commented on the Company's results for the quarter: "This was an outstanding quarter for Almost Family despite the effect of hurricane weather in Florida. We remain very positive on the prospects for our Visiting Nurse Segment. With the significant reduction in our debt over the past two years we are well positioned to pursue growth opportunities through both internal development and acquisitions." Earlier this week, the Company announced plans to acquire an Orlando, FL visiting nurse agency. The Company noted that hurricane weather in Florida, where about 50% of year to date VN revenues have been generated, reduced VN operating income for the September 2004 quarter by an estimated $180,000 and basic EPS by an estimated $0.05. The Company also noted that it has made substantial reductions in its outstanding debt over the course of the past two years. During the quarter ended September 30, 2004 the Company reduced amounts outstanding on its bank credit facility by $3.3 million. Through October 31, 2004, the Company has paid down debt by $6.9 million since December 2003 and by more than $10.6 million since December 2002, when its credit facility balance was over $14 million. The Company will be filing its Form 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission today. Please refer to that filing for additional information.

INDEX TO EXHIBITS Exhibit No. - ----------- 99.1 Press release issued by the Company on March 22, 2005..

Exhibit 99.1 ALMOST FAMILY ANNOUNCES YEAR END RESULTS LOUISVILLE, Ky., March 22 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Almost Family, Inc. (Nasdaq: AFAM) today announced its operating results for the year ended December 31, 2004. In the information that follows "VN" refers to the Company's Visiting Nurse segment, "PC" refers to the Company's Personal Care segment and "ADC" refers to the Company's Adult Day Care segment. Results for the Year AFAM's operating results for the year include the following highlights: - Net Income -- As Reported from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $1,529,897 or $0.60 per diluted share compared to $1,424,724 or $0.56 per diluted share in 2003 - Net Income -- As Adjusted from continuing operations per diluted share increased by 14% to $0.60 in 2004 from $0.52 in 2003 (See "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below for an explanation of "Net Income - As Adjusted" from continuing operations) - Cash flow from operating activities improved 17% to $6.9 million in 2004 from $5.9 million in 2003 - Total debt was reduced by $6.8 million or 56% since December 31, 2003 reducing Company's debt to equity ratio to 0.4:1 in 2004 from 1:1 in 2003 - Revenues in the Company's VN segment grew approximately 10% in 2004 versus 2003 primarily as a result of admissions growth. Net income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2004 also included operating losses from new VN agencies started late in 2004 of ($111,988) or ($0.04) per diluted share. The tax provision from continuing operations for 2003 included a credit of $116,000 or $0.05 per diluted share related to the elimination of a valuation allowance on certain state tax net operating loss carry-forwards. As a result the effective tax rate for 2003 was 34.6% as compared to 39.2% in 2004. Management believes that an annual effective tax rate of 39.2% is more representative of the Company's normalized rate for reporting purposes exclusive of the aforementioned tax credits and, as such, the Company has incorporated this normalized tax rate in its presentation of "Net Income - As Adjusted." Operating business units sold or closed during 2004 have been reclassified to discontinued operations for all periods presented. Net income (loss) from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2004 was a loss of ($338,641) or ($0.13) per diluted share compared to income of $695,473 or $0.27 per diluted share in 2003. Net income from discontinued operations in 2003 included a one-time income tax credit of $854,146 or $0.34 per diluted share resulting from the reversal of income tax reserves no longer required.

Continuing operations 2004 EBITDA included $185,023 of operating losses related to VN operations started late in 2004. William B. Yarmuth, Chairman and CEO commented on the Company's operating results: "We are pleased to report a 15% increase in our pre-tax income from continuing operations, confirming the choices we have made in the pursuit of our strategy. Our free cash flow has enabled us to repay about $7 million or 56% of our outstanding debt. We believe our strong balance sheet position will take us a long way towards our objectives." Yarmuth added: "In addition to our strong earnings and cash flow performance, since our last annual report, we have generated 10% VN revenue growth and completed 2 home health acquisitions. Over the course of the next 2-3 years we will strive to continue our VN revenue growth and will seek additional accretive acquisitions of home health providers." Results for the Quarter AFAM's operating results for the three-months ended December 31, 2004 include the following highlights: - Net Income -- As Reported from continuing operations for the three- months ended December 31, 2004 was $368,958 or $0.14 per diluted share compared to $337,654 or $0.13 per diluted share in 2003 - Net Income -- As Adjusted from continuing operations per diluted share increased by 52% or $0.05 to $0.13 in 2004 from $0.08 in 2003 (See Non- GAAP Financial Measures for an explanation of "Net Income - As Adjusted" from continuing operations) Net income from continuing operations for the three-months ended December 31, 2004 also included operating losses from new VN agencies started late in 2004 of ($104,037) or ($0.04) per diluted share. The tax provision from continuing operations for the three months ended December 2003 included a credit of $116,000 or $0.05 per diluted share related to the elimination of a valuation allowance on certain state tax net operating loss carry-forwards. As a result the effective tax rate for 2003 was 4.4% as compared to 32.0% in 2004. As explained in the above discussion of results for the year, management believes that an annual effective tax rate of 39.2% is more representative of the Company's normalized rate for reporting purposes exclusive of the aforementioned tax credits and, as such, the Company has incorporated this normalized tax rate in its presentation of "Net Income - As Adjusted." Net income (loss) from discontinued operations for the three-months ended December 31, 2004 was a loss of ($278,378) or ($0.11) per diluted share compared to income of $771,068 or $0.30 per diluted share in 2003. Net income from discontinued operations in 2003 included a one-time income tax credit of $854,146 or $0.34 per diluted share resulting from the reversal of income tax reserves no longer required. Excluding that tax credit, net income (loss) from discontinued operations in 2003 was a loss of ($83,078) or ($0.03) per diluted share.
Including discontinued operations and 2003 income tax accounting credits, consolidated net income for the three-months ended December was $90,580 or $0.03 per diluted share in 2004 as compared to $1,108,722 or $0.43 per diluted share in 2003. Results of operations for the three months ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 are set forth in the tables below: Almost Family, Inc. Quarter Ended December 31, 2004 Consolidated

Continuing operations 2004 EBITDA included $171,948 of operating losses related to VN operations started late in 2004. Non-GAAP Financial Measures The information provided in the tables in this release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined under Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules. In accordance with SEC rules, the Company has provided, in the supplemental information and the footnotes to the tables, a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. EBITDA: EBITDA is defined as income before depreciation and amortization, net interest expense and income taxes. EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the items excluded from EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance. Management routinely calculates and communicates EBITDA and believes that it is useful to investors because it is commonly used as an analytical indicator within our industry to evaluate performance, measure leverage capacity and debt service ability, and to estimate current or prospective enterprise value. EBITDA is also used in measurements of borrowing availability and certain covenants contained in our credit agreement. EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance or liquidity under generally accepted accounting principles. It should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income, operating income, cash flows from operating, investing or financial activities, or any other measure calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The items excluded from EBITDA are significant components in understanding and evaluating financial performance and liquidity. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income to EBITDA:
Almost Family, Inc. Year Ended December 31, 2004 EBITDA Reconciliation "Net Income - As Adjusted" from continuing operations: Although "Net Income - As Adjusted" is a non-GAAP financial measure, management believes that the presentation of net income as calculated using normalized tax rates for each period is a useful adjunct to "Net Income - As Reported" under GAAP because it measures the Company's performance in a consistent manner between the results for the fourth quarters and fiscal years 2004 and 2003. Furthermore, due to the lower effective tax rates reflected in the reported results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year of 2003, the presentation of "Net Income - As Adjusted" incorporates an effective tax rate which is more representative of the Company's normalized annual tax rate for reporting purposes. Investors should not view "Net Income - As Adjusted" as an alternative to the GAAP measure of Net Income. The tax provision from continuing operations for the year and quarter ended December 31, 2003 included a credit of $116,000 or $0.05 per diluted share related to the elimination of a valuation allowance on certain state tax net operating loss carry-forwards. As a result, the effective tax rate for the year ended 2003 was 34.6% as compared to 39.2% in 2004, and for the quarter ended December 31, 2003 was 4.4% as compared to 32% for the quarter ended December 31, 2004. As explained in the above discussion of results for the year, management believes that an annual effective tax rate of 39.2% is more representative of the Company's normalized rate for reporting purposes exclusive of the aforementioned tax credits and, as such, the Company has incorporated this normalized tax rate in its presentation of "Net Income - As Adjusted." The Company's 2003 Form 10-K includes a description of its business plan which calls for an increase in emphasis on the Visiting Nurse segment. Almost Family, Inc.(TM) and subsidiaries (collectively "Almost Family") is a leading regional provider of home health nursing services and adult day health services. The Company has service locations in Florida, Kentucky, Ohio, Maryland, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Alabama and Indiana (in order of revenue significance).
All statements, other than statements of historical facts, included in this news release, including the objectives and expectations of management for future operating results, the Company's ability to generate VN revenue growth, the Company's ability to acquire visiting nurse agencies at prices it is willing to pay, the Company's ability to attract investment of additional capital, the Company's ability to generate positive cash flows, and the Company's expectations with regard to market conditions, are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on the Company's current expectations. Although the Company believes that the expectations expressed or implied in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, there can be no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. Because forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, the Company's actual results could differ materially. The potential risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially could include: the impact of further changes in healthcare reimbursement systems, including the ultimate outcome of potential changes to Medicaid reimbursement due to state budget shortfalls; the ability of the Company to maintain its level of operating performance and achieve its cost control objectives; government regulation; health care reform; pricing pressures from Medicare, Medicaid and other third-party payers; changes in laws and interpretations of laws relating to the healthcare industry, and the Company's self-insurance risks. For a more complete discussion regarding these and other factors which could affect the Company's financial performance, refer to the Company's Securities and Exchange Commission filing on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2003, in particular information under the headings "Business" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."

Continuing operations 2005 EBITDA included $229,302 of operating losses related to VN operations started late in 2004 and first quarter 2005. ADC Segment results improved as a result of reductions in operating costs. In the context used in this press release, the Company defines "internally-generated" revenue growth as revenue growth excluding that generated in operations acquired in the most recent twelve months. William B. Yarmuth, Chairman and CEO commented on the Company's operating results: "We are extremely pleased to report a 25% increase in our net income from continuing operations. Our free cash flow has continued to be strong, enabling us to repay about $2 million or 52% of our outstanding debt just in this quarter. We believe our operating momentum and our strong balance sheet position will take us a long way towards our objectives." Yarmuth added: "In addition to our strong earnings and cash flow performance, we have created 16% VN revenue growth, all of it internally-generated, and on April 1, 2005 completed the acquisition of a $3.5 million revenue home health agency. These results confirm that we are on the right track. Over the course of the next 2-3 years we will strive to continue our VN revenue growth and will seek additional accretive acquisitions of home health providers." Non-GAAP Financial Measures The information provided in the tables in this release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined under Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules. In accordance with SEC rules, the Company has provided, in the supplemental information and the footnotes to the tables, a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. EBITDA: EBITDA is defined as income before depreciation and amortization, net interest expense and income taxes. EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. It should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income, operating income, cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities, or any other measure calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The items excluded from EBITDA are significant components in understanding and evaluating financial performance and liquidity. Management routinely calculates and communicates EBITDA and believes that it is useful to investors because it is commonly used as an analytical indicator within our industry to evaluate performance, measure leverage capacity and debt service ability, and to estimate current or prospective enterprise value. EBITDA is also used in measurements of borrowing availability and certain covenants contained in our credit agreement. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income to EBITDA: Quarter Ended March 31, -------------------------- 2005 2004 ----------- ----------- Net Income from continuing operations $ 420,664 $ 337,704 Add back: Interest Expense 91,207 144,843 Income Taxes 280,443 225,136 Depreciation & Amortization 604,491 604,153 Earnings Before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) from continuing operations $ 1,396,805 $ 1,311,836

Almost Family, Inc. (NASDAQ SC:AFAM) announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement for the sale of its Adult Day Care Segment operations to Active Services, Inc. (Active Services) in an asset sale. The purchase price consists of $13.6 million cash plus assumption of approximately $1.4 million of debt. In return, Active Services will acquire substantially all the assets and assume certain working capital liabilities related to Almost Family's 19 medical adult day care centers which generate approximately $21 million in annual revenues. The transaction, which is subject to certain conditions including regulatory approvals and third-party consents, is expected to close by October 1, 2005. Pure Play Home Health Company Approaching $80 Million Revenue Following the transaction, Almost Family will be a pure play home health care company with two operating segments: Caretenders Visiting Nurse (VN) Medicare-certified operations with a current annual revenue run rate of approximately $43 million and its Personal Care (PC) home health operations with a current annual revenue run rate of approximately $35 million. Almost Family has home health operations in Florida, Kentucky, Ohio, Connecticut, Massachusetts and Alabama. $20 Million Capital Available for Home Health Acquisitions Proceeds of the transaction are expected to be used to repay substantially all outstanding debt (excluding certain seller financing) and leave approximately $4 million in cash available. Cash on hand, combined with borrowing capacity on its senior credit facility, will make over $20 million of capital immediately available to fund the Company's acquisition and development activities. The Company expects that amount of capital, plus internally generated growth and free cash flow, to be sufficient to take it to over $100 million in revenues.
Disposition Accretive to EPS The disposition is expected to be immediately accretive to earnings per share. Transaction Gain Expected Subject to final purchase price adjustments, the Company expects to report an after-tax gain of $5-$6 million ($2.20-$2.60 per basic share) on closing of the transaction. Company Commentary William B. Yarmuth, Almost Family's Chairman and CEO commented on this latest development: "As stated in our business plan, Almost Family is continuing to shift its focus to the accelerated development of our home health operations. This transaction frees all our remaining management time and capital to pursue a more aggressive, single-minded pursuit of home health development while also placing our adult day care operations in the hands of a well-capitalized experienced company with a singular focus on adult day care." "While we are pleased with the transaction, we have somewhat mixed emotions. We want to express our sincere gratitude to our ADC segment managers and employees for their tremendous commitment to quality, their many years of service dedicated to the care of their members, and for helping us make our ADC segment what it is today," continued Yarmuth. Yarmuth concluded: "Our next milestone is to take the Company past the $100 million mark in home health care revenues. This management team will continue to build momentum in its acquisition and start-up activities fueled by the availability of some $20 million of available investment capital." The Company has noted in its previous announcements that it is actively pursuing a number of potential acquisitions in Florida and other states and expects that it will be able to complete additional transactions over the course of the next year. The Company's 2004 Form 10-K includes a description of its business plan which calls for an increase in emphasis on the Visiting Nurse segment. Additional Information Next Week The Company's next Form 10Q, to be filed within the next two weeks, will provide a more detailed disclosure and discussion of the financial implications of this transaction.

INDEX TO EXHIBITS Exhibit No. - -------------- 99.1 Press release issued by the Company on August 10, 2005.

Exhibit 99.1 Almost Family Reports Second Quarter Operating Results Net Income from Continuing Operations up 57% Over Prior Year Total Revenues Up 14%, VN Segment Revenues Grew 27% Almost Family today reported its results of operations for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2005. Quarterly Results Net income from continuing operations grew 57% to a record $668,757 ($0.25 per diluted share) for the June 2005 quarter as compared to $424,903 ($0.17 per diluted share) in the June 2004 quarter for an increase of 57%. Revenues grew 14% to $24.8 million in the June 2005 quarter from $21.7 million in the June 2004 quarter. On August 3, 2005, the Company announced plans to divest its adult day care (ADC) segment. Because the Company had not committed to that divestiture until after the end of the quarter, ADC operations are included in continuing operations in the June 2005 quarter. ADC operations will be reported as discontinued operations for all subsequent periods. The Company expects to report an after-tax gain on the sale of between $5 million and $6 million ($1.90 to $2.28 per diluted share) when the transaction closes. If the ADC divestiture had qualified for discontinued operations accounting treatment at June 30, 2005 the Company would have reported growth in net income from continuing operations of 68% to $660,484 ($0.25 per diluted share) for the June 2005 quarter from $392,710 ($0.15 per diluted share) in the June 2004 quarter. It would have reported continuing operations revenue growth of 17.8% to $19.3 million in the June 2005 quarter up from $16.4 million in the June 2004 quarter. These results exclude the effect the use of the net proceeds of the sale of the ADC operations would have had on interest expense (income) net of income tax effect. Revenues in the Company's Caretenders Visiting Nurse (VN) segment grew 27% over the same period last year with about one half of that growth being internally generated. The April 1, 2005 acquisition of Bradenton, FL-based "Florida Home Health" VN operations added approximately $1 million in revenues and $111,000 in net income ($0.04 per diluted share) to operating results in the June 2005 quarter. Net income from continuing operations for the June 2005 quarter included $88,451 ($0.03 per diluted share) of operating losses related to VN operations started late in 2004 and first quarter 2005. Related revenues were approximately $635,000. Net income (loss) from discontinued operations (not related to the sale of the ADC segment) for the quarter ended June 30, 2005 was a loss of ($46,119) or ($0.02) per diluted share compared to a loss of ($30,218) or ($0.01) per diluted share in 2004. Including discontinued operations, consolidated net income increased 58% to $622,638 or $0.24 per diluted share in 2005 from $394,685 or $0.15 per diluted share in 2004.
Results of operations for the quarters ended June 30, 2005 and 2004 are set forth in the tables below:
William B. Yarmuth, Chairman and CEO commented on the operating results: "The fact that we are producing record levels of net income from continuing operations, whether with or without the ADC operations, clearly says we are on the right strategic path. We are very pleased with our results for the quarter which saw accelerated revenue growth rates in all our operating segments. VN leads the way with 27% revenue growth, half of which came from acquisitions and half of which was internally generated. However, our in-home personal care (PC) segment also contributed almost 9% revenue growth all of which was internally generated." "While we are pleased with our results for the quarter, as we said last week we think we can do more. With the divestiture of the ADC segment, all our management time and talent will be turned toward accelerating our growth in our home health operations. With the amount of capital now available to us we will seek to be more aggressive in our approach to acquisitions and startups and we will redouble our efforts to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of our sales and marketing activities," Yarmuth concluded. The Company noted that before considering the purchase price of acquisitions completed, its cash flows resulted in debt reduction of approximately $2.1 million in the quarter ended June 30, 2005 and about $7.9 million in the twelve months ended June 30, 2005. Following completion of the sale of its ADC segment, the Company expects to have about $4 million in cash, no balance then outstanding on its bank credit facility, and approximately $18 million in borrowing capacity under that facility. Year to Date Results Net income from continuing operations grew 43% to $1,089,421 ($0.42 per diluted share) for the six months ended June 2005 as compared to $762,607 ($0.30 per diluted share) in the six months ended June 2004. Revenues grew 12% to $48.3 million in the six months ended June 2005 from $43.2 million in the six months ended June 2004. If the ADC divestiture had qualified for discontinued operations accounting treatment at June 30, 2005 the Company would have reported growth in net income from continuing operations of 25% to $1,218,043 ($0.46 per diluted share) for the six months ended June 2005 from $973,873 ($0.38 per diluted share) in the six months ended June 2004. It would have reported continuing operations revenues growth of 15% to $37.7 million in the six months ended June 2005 up from $32.8 million in the six months ended June 2004. These results exclude the effect the use of the net proceeds of the sale of the ADC operations would have had on interest expense (income) net of income tax effect. Revenues in the Company's Caretenders Visiting Nurse (VN) segment grew 21% over the same period last year with about two-thirds of that growth being internally generated. The April 1, 2005 acquisition of Bradenton, FL-based "Florida Home Health" VN operations added approximately $1 million in revenues and $111,000 in net income ($0.04 per diluted share) to operating results for the six months ended June 2005. Net income from continuing operations for the six months ended June 2005 included $226,564 ($0.09 per diluted share) of operating losses related to VN operations started late in 2004 and first quarter 2005. Related revenues were approximately $914,000. Net income (loss) from discontinued operations (not related to the sale of the ADC segment) for the six months ended June 30, 2005 was a loss of $82,849 ($0.03 per diluted share) compared to a loss of $66,559 ($0.03 per diluted share) in 2004.
Including discontinued operations, consolidated net income increased 45% to $1,006,572 or $0.38 per diluted share in 2005 from $696,047 or $0.27 per diluted share in 2004. Results of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2005 and 2004 are set forth in the tables below:

In accordance with SEC rules, the Company has provided, in the supplemental information and the footnotes to the tables, a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.

EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. It should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income, operating income, cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities, or any other measure calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

INDEX TO EXHIBITS Exhibit No. - -------------- 99.1 Press release issued by the Company on September 30, 2005.

Exhibit 99.1 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE September 30, 2005 Almost Family Completes Sale of Adult Day Care Segment Is Now a Pure Play Home Care Company Approaching $80 Million Revenue Louisville, Ky. Almost Family, Inc. (NASDAQ SC:AFAM) announced that it has completed the sale of its Adult Day Care Segment operations to Active Services, Inc. (Active Services) in an asset sale. As previously announced, the purchase price consists of $13.6 million cash plus assumption of approximately $1.4 million of debt. Pure Play Home Health Company Approaching $80 Million Revenue With the transaction completed, Almost Family is now a pure play home health care company with two operating segments: Caretenders Visiting Nurse (VN) Medicare-certified operations with a current annual revenue run rate of approximately $43 million and its Personal Care (PC) home health operations with a current annual revenue run rate of approximately $35 million. Almost Family has home health operations in Florida, Kentucky, Ohio, Connecticut, Massachusetts and Alabama. $20 Million Capital Available for Home Health Acquisitions Proceeds of the transaction received today were used to repay substantially all outstanding debt (excluding certain seller financing) leaving approximately $4 million in cash available (after setting aside related tax obligations due later this year). Cash on hand, combined with borrowing capacity on its senior credit facility, make over $20 million of capital immediately available to fund the Company's acquisition and development activities. The Company expects that amount of capital, plus internally generated growth and free cash flow, to be sufficient to take it to over $100 million in revenues. The disposition is expected to be immediately accretive to earnings per share.
Company Commentary William B. Yarmuth, Almost Family's Chairman and CEO commented on this latest development: "As we stated in our previous announcement, it is with somewhat mixed emotions that we close this transaction and this chapter in our history. Once again, we want to express our sincere gratitude to our ADC segment managers and employees for their tremendous commitment to quality, their many years of service dedicated to the care of their members, and for helping us make our ADC segment what it is today." Regarding the future, Yarmuth added: "This transaction frees all our remaining management time and capital to pursue a more aggressive, single-minded pursuit of home health development while also placing our adult day care operations in the hands of a well-capitalized experienced company with a singular focus on adult day care." Yarmuth concluded: "We are now embarking on a new stage in the Company's development. We are extremely excited by the prospects for the development and expansion of our home health business and the progress we can make with a sole focus on home health care." The Company has noted in its previous announcements that it is actively pursuing a number of potential acquisitions in Florida and other states and expects that it will be able to complete additional transactions over the course of the next year. The Company's 2004 Form 10-K includes a description of its business plan which calls for an increase in emphasis on the Visiting Nurse segment. Almost Family, Inc.TM and subsidiaries (collectively "Almost Family") is a leading regional provider of home health nursing services. The Company has service locations in Florida, Kentucky, Ohio, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Alabama and Indiana (in order of revenue significance). Contact: William Yarmuth or Steve Guenthner (502) 891-1000. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, included in this news release, including the objectives and expectations of management, the expectation that the divesture will be accretive to earnings per share, future operating results of its home health agencies, the Company's ability to acquire visiting nurse agencies at prices it is willing to pay, the Company's ability to attract investment of additional capital, the Company's ability to generate positive cash flows, and the Company's expectations with regard to market conditions, are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on the Company's current expectations. Although the Company believes that the expectations expressed or implied in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, there can be no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. Because forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, the Company's actual results could differ materially. The potential risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially could include: the impact of further changes in healthcare reimbursement systems, including the ultimate outcome of potential changes to Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement due to government budget shortfalls; the ability of an acquired agency to maintain its level of admissions and operating performance, our ability to integrate acquired agencies into our operations; government regulation; health care reform; pricing pressures from Medicare, Medicaid and other third-party payers; changes in laws and interpretations of laws relating to the healthcare industry, and the potential effect of changes in competition for home health agency admissions. For a more complete discussion regarding these and other factors which could affect the Company's financial performance, refer to the Company's Securities and Exchange Commission filing on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004, in particular information under the headings "Business" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." The Company disclaims any intent or obligation to update its forward-looking statements.

ITEM 2.02. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION On November 14, 2005, Almost Family, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing its financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2005. Attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 99.1 is a copy of such press release. The information in this Item 2.02 of this Current Report on Form 8-K and the Exhibit attached hereto shall not be deemed to be "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section. Such information will not be incorporated by reference into any registration statement filed by the Company under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, unless specifically identified therein as being incorporated by reference. ITEM 4.02. NON-RELIANCE ON PREVIOUSLY FILED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OR A RELATED AUDIT REPORT OR COMPLETED INTERIM REVIEW Upon the recommendation of its Audit Committee, the Board of Directors of the Company determined on November 7, 2005, that the Company should restate its previously issued financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004, and the quarters ended March 31, 2005, and June 30, 2005. The Board of Directors, following consultation with management, concluded that the Company's financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004, and the quarters ended March 31, 2005, and June 30, 2005, should no longer be relied upon. The Company has restated the previously issued financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004, through the filing on November 14, 2005 of an amended Form 10-K, and will amend its financial statements for the quarters ended March 31, 2005, and June 30, 2005, through the filing of an amended Form 10-Q for each of those quarters.
Amendment of Previous Financial Reports Related to Contingent Liability Matters The Company's previous Form 10-K filings for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 disclosed the following three items, all of which, from an accounting perspective, are characterized as contingent liabilities in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5 "Accounting for Contingent Liabilities" (SFAS No. 5): o in April 2003 the Chancery Court of Williamson County, Tennessee, issued a ruling in favor of Franklin Associates L.P. ("Franklin"), awarding damages against the Company in the amount of $984,970; o a Kentucky transportation broker which owes the Company approximately $535,000 for services provided by the Company's adult day care segment (sold in September 2005) entered into bankruptcy proceedings in the fourth quarter of 2002; and o the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations on tax returns related to the Company's 2000 fiscal year, in which it sold its product operations and adopted discontinued operations accounting treatment for its visiting nurse segment (later reversed), resulted in the recording in discontinued operations in the Company's 2003 financial statements of a one-time reduction in estimated tax liabilities of approximately $854,000. The Company received a letter from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission following the SEC staff's routine review of the Company's form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004, which letter commented on, among other items, the accounting treatment of these contingent liability matters. In addition, at the same time, management entered into discussions with Ernst & Young LLP, the Company's independent auditors for the financial statements for each of the three years ended December 31, 2004, relating to the accounting treatment for these litigation matters. Management believed there was a reasonable basis for its original accounting (which was agreed to by Ernst & Young). Following detailed discussions with the auditors and the SEC staff, and with the concurrence of the auditors, the Company has amended the financial statements for the following non-cash items in order to account for these items as set forth below. Note that the lawsuit in question is still being aggressively appealed and the receivable in question is still being pursued for collection: o With respect to the Franklin litigation, provision of approximately $1,154,000 (for which there is no related income tax benefit) has been made as of April 2003 ($984,000 for award of damages) and as of September 2003 ($170,000 for estimated post-judgment interest). As previously disclosed, the Company did not record a loss in the period in which it suffered the trial court loss on the grounds, among others, that the Company's litigation counsel advised the Company that its prospects on appeal were strong. The Company's accounting for this case now follows the principle that any loss at a trial court level creates a de-facto satisfaction of the "probable of loss" criteria of SFAS No. 5. o With respect to the Kentucky transportation receivable, provision of approximately $535,000 has been made as of November 2002 of an additional allowance for uncollectible accounts for the Kentucky transportation receivable, and the provision of approximately $106,000 previously recorded in 2004 has been reversed. Thus the net income effect of this matter is $266,000 after related income tax benefit. As previously disclosed, the Company did not record a loss in the period in which the broker filed for bankruptcy on the basis of management's view that, considering all facts and circum- stances of the receivable, including other avenues for recovery, it was not "probable" that the Company had incurred a loss. The Company's accounting for this matter now follows the principle that bankruptcy of a contractual obligor creates a de-facto satisfaction of the "probable of loss" criteria of SFAS No. 5 without regard to other avenues of collection of the receivable. o The one-time reduction in estimated tax liabilities has been removed from fiscal 2003 and treated as a reduction in estimated tax liabilities that should have been recorded instead in fiscal 2000. In effect the Company has determined that it should have reversed an excessive reserve for tax liabilities in 2000, rather than in 2003. The excessive reserve for tax liabilities arose principally from
differences in the estimated income tax provision recorded in fiscal 2000 and prior and the actual tax liabilities resulting from the ultimate filing and settlement of the tax returns for those periods. The restatement has the effect of increasing beginning retained earnings at January 1, 2002 in the amended December 31, 2004 Form 10-K/A. In making this restatement, the Company concluded that its general concern about the adequacy of its reserve for tax liabilities in 2000 (resulting from complex tax issues arising from the dispositions in 2000) was inadequately specific and measurable to justify the maintenance of the reserve. All related disclosures have been revised to give effect to the new accounting treatment for these matters. These changes have no effect on previously reported cash flows. In the event the Company is able to collect a portion of the Kentucky receivable it would record a gain in the period in which payment is received. In the event the Company prevails on appeal in the Franklin litigation (and no further appeal is available), the Company would record a gain in the period in which the Company prevails. For a more detailed discussion of these contingencies, refer to the Form 10-K/A filed today. The following table summarizes changes in reported net income and earnings per share for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004 as a result of these changes: The Company's loan agreement provides that the provision of a loss for the above litigation cases will be excluded from financial results for purposes of calculating borrowing availability or financial covenant compliance. Management and the Company's Audit Committee discussed with Ernst & Young LLP, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, the matters disclosed above in this Item 4.02(a) of this Current Report on Form 8-K.

INDEX TO EXHIBITS Exhibit No. - -------------- 99.1 Press release issued by the Company on November 14, 2005.

Exhibit 99.1 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE November 14, 2005 Almost Family Announces Quarterly Results and Other Matters Louisville, KY - Almost Family, Inc. (NASDAQ:AFAM) today announced the following news items: o For the quarter ended September 30, 2005, the Company reported earnings from continuing operations per diluted share of $0.15 as compared to $0.10 for the quarter ended September 30, 2004. o The Company reported a gain of $1.90 per diluted share on the previously announced sale of its adult day care segment. o In a separate release, the Company announced the acquisition of a St. Augustine FL based home health agency, the Company's fourth such acquisition since October 2004. o Also in a separate report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC, the Company has reported the amendment of its previously filed 2004 Form 10-K. The amendment follows a routine review of the filing by the SEC Staff after which the Company was asked to reconsider its accounting for certain contingent liability matters. The revisions to the report are non-cash and relate to previously disclosed matters arising in 2003 and prior fiscal years. Refer to the Form 8-K and related Form 10-K/A amendment also filed today for additional information. Quarterly Earnings Release Net income from continuing operations grew 54% to $397,457 or $0.15 per diluted share for the September 2005 quarter as compared to $258,537 or $0.10 per diluted share in the September 2004 quarter. Revenues grew 15% to $18.5 million in the September 2005 quarter from $16 million in the September 2004 quarter. Net Income including discontinued operations, was $5,378,860 or $2.04 per diluted share including a gain on the sale of the adult day care segment of $5,003,485 in the quarter ended September 30, 2005 and $404,628 or $0.16 per diluted share in 2004. Revenues in the Company's Caretenders Visiting Nurse (VN) segment grew 28% over the same period last year. The April 1, 2005 acquisition of a Bradenton, FL VN agency added approximately $900,000 in revenues and $95,000 in net income or $0.04 per diluted share to operating results in the September 2005 quarter. Net income from continuing operations for the September 2005 quarter included net of tax operating losses of $32,000 or $0.01 per diluted share related to VN startup operations opened or acquired late in 2004 and first quarter 2005. Related revenues were approximately $830,000.
William B. Yarmuth, AFAM's Chairman and CEO commented on the quarterly results: "We are pleased with our operating results for this quarter which is seasonally our lowest performing quarter. Our VN segment operations generated 28% revenue growth on an overall basis, primarily due to our acquisition and startup activities. The completion of the ADC sale, along with the large gain on the sale, and the substantial amount of cash received will enable us to improve our focus on our strategic growth objectives. The acquisition of the St. Augustine agency provides early evidence of that improved focus. Our development activities have created a nice pipeline of acquisition opportunities and we expect to bring additional transactions to fruition over the course of the next year." Results of operations for the quarters ended September 30, 2005 and 2004 are set forth in the tables below:
Year to Date Results Net income from continuing operations grew 28% to $1,603,766 or $0.61 per diluted share for the nine months ended September 2005 as compared to $1,257,453 or $0.49 per diluted share in the nine months ended September 2004. Revenues grew 15% to $56.2 million in the nine months ended September 2005 from $48.8 million in the nine months ended September 2004. Net Income including discontinued operations, was $6,385,432 or $2.43 per diluted share including a gain on the sale of the adult day care segment of $5,003,485 in the nine months ended September 30, 2005 and $1,100,779 or $0.43 per diluted share in 2004. Revenues in the VN segment grew 24% over the same period last year. The April 1, 2005 acquisition of a Bradenton, FL VN agency added approximately $1.9 million in revenues and $227,000 in net income or $0.09 per diluted share to operating results for the nine months ended September 2005. Net income from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 2005 included net of tax operating losses of $279,000 or $0.11 per diluted share related to VN startup operations opened or acquired late in 2004 and first quarter 2005. Related revenues were approximately $1.7 million. Results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 and 2004 are set forth in the tables below:
Non-GAAP Financial Measure The information provided in the tables in this release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined under Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules. In accordance with SEC rules, the Company has provided, in the supplemental information and the footnotes to the tables, a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. EBITDA: EBITDA is defined as income before depreciation and amortization, net interest expense and income taxes. EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. It should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income, operating income, cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities, or any other measure calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The items excluded from EBITDA are significant components in understanding and evaluating financial performance and liquidity. Management routinely calculates and communicates EBITDA and believes that it is useful to investors because it is commonly used as an analytical indicator within our industry to evaluate performance, measure leverage capacity and debt service ability, and to estimate current or prospective enterprise value. EBITDA is also used in measurements of borrowing availability and certain covenants contained in our credit agreement. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income to EBITDA:
Gain on Sale of ADC Segment and Reclassification of ADC Operations On September 30, 2005 the Company completed the previously announced sale of its ADC operating segment for $13.6 million in cash plus assumption of certain liabilities. The transaction resulted in the reporting of an after tax gain of approximately $5 million or $1.90 per diluted share reported in the quarter and nine month periods ended September 30, 2005. The reported gain is subject to change following the completion of the final purchase price adjustment between the parties and potentially further refinement of the estimated income tax provision by the end of the Company's fiscal year. As of September 30, 2005, the Company's balance sheet reflects cash of approximately $10 million ($1 million restricted) of which approximately $5 million will be used to fund retained liabilities (primarily income taxes) related to the transactions. The Company expects the balance of the retained liabilities to be less than $1 million as December 31, 2005. Almost Family, Inc. TM and subsidiaries (collectively "Almost Family") is a leading regional provider of home health services. The Company has service locations in Florida, Kentucky, Ohio, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Alabama and Indiana (in order of revenue significance). Contact: William Yarmuth or Steve Guenthner (502) 891-1000. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, included in this news release, including the objectives and expectations of management for future operating results, the Company's ability to accelerate growth in its home health operations, the Company's ability to generate VN revenue growth, the Company's ability to acquire visiting nurse agencies at prices it is willing to pay, the Company's ability to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of its sales and marketing efforts, the Company's ability to generate positive cash flows, and the Company's expectations with regard to market conditions, are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on the Company's current expectations. Although the Company believes that the expectations expressed or implied in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, there can be no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. Because forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, the Company's actual results could differ materially. The potential risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially could include: regulatory approvals or third party consents may not be obtained, the impact of further changes in healthcare reimbursement systems, including the ultimate outcome of potential changes to Medicaid reimbursement due to state budget shortfalls; the ability of the Company to maintain its level of operating performance and achieve its cost control objectives; government regulation; health care reform; pricing pressures from Medicare, Medicaid and other third-party payers; changes in laws and interpretations of laws relating to the
healthcare industry, and the Company's self-insurance risks. For a more complete discussion regarding these and other factors which could affect the Company's financial performance, refer to the Company's Securities and Exchange Commission filing on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004, in particular information under the headings "Business" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."

(Exact name of registrant as specified in its charter) Delaware 1-09848 06-1153720 (State or other jurisdiction (Commission File No.) (IRS Employer of incorporation) Identification No.) 9510 Ormsby Station Road, Suite 300 Louisville, Kentucky 40223 (Address of principal executive offices) (Zip Code) (502) 891-1000 (Registrant's telephone number, including area code) N/A (Former name or former address, if changed since last report.) Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions: [ ] Written communications pursuant to Rule 425 under the Securities Act (17 CFR 230.425) [ ] Soliciting material pursuant to Rule 14a-12 under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.14a-12) [ ] Pre-commencement communications pursuant to Rule 14d-2(b) under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.14d-2(b)) [ ] Pre-commencement communications pursuant to Rule 13e-4(c) under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.13e-4(c))
ITEM 8.01. OTHER EVENTS As previously disclosed in the Registrant's periodic filings, in April 2003 the Chancery Court of Williamson County, Tennessee, issued a ruling in favor of Franklin Associates L.P. ("Franklin") awarding damages against the Registrant in the amount of $984,970. The Registrant appealed the Chancery Court's judgment on its finding of liability and on its determination of the amount of damages. Franklin appealed the Chancery Court's decision to apply a blockage discount to the damages calculation and not to award Franklin pre-judgment interest. On November 29, 2005, the Court of Appeals of Tennessee affirmed the Chancery Court ruling except that it reduced the damages awarded to Franklin to $658,886.50, plus post-judgment interest. As a part of the appeal, the Registrant was required to post cash of $1,154,241 (consisting of $984,970 in damages and $169,271 of estimated post-judgment interest) in an escrow account with the Tennessee Courts. As disclosed in the Form 8-K dated November 7, 2005, the Registrant has made an accounting provision of approximately $1,154,241 for this loss. The Registrant and Franklin may still seek a re-hearing by the Court of Appeals of Tennessee or seek an appeal to the Tennessee Supreme Court of the decision of the Court of Appeals of Tennessee. If the case were ultimately resolved consistent with the decision of the Court of Appeals, the Registrant estimates that the actual loss incurred, including post-judgment interest, would be approximately $831,000 as of the date of this report. There can be no assurance that any amounts ultimately paid to Franklin in connection with this litigation will not be greater than this estimate or the escrowed amount. SIGNATURE Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.

William B. Yarmuth, AFAM's Chairman and CEO commented on the results:
"We are very pleased with our operating results for the quarter and our many accomplishments for the year. During 2005 we were able to dramatically improve our earnings per share and EBITDA, complete acquisitions with a combined annual revenue run rate of over $5 million, generate meaningful internal revenue growth, dispose of non-core operations at a substantial financial gain, pay-off substantially all our debt, and exit the year with $5 million of cash and $20 million in borrowing capacity to fuel our future growth." "As we move forward into 2006 and beyond we do so as a pure-play home health platform with a strengthened and reorganized management team, improved operating and information system infrastructure and a robust acquisition pipeline. Combining these elements with the strongest balance sheet in the history of our Company, we think we are exceptionally well-positioned to continue to generate outstanding performance." "I want to take this opportunity to express my personal thanks and appreciation to our employees, our loyal customers and referring physicians and all those who have made our internal growth, our newly acquired operations and our start-up operations such a success in 2005." Quarterly Discussion Net Income From Continuing Operations - As Reported grew 252.5% to $1,279,522 or $0.48 per diluted share (including a net gain on litigation settlement of $267,426 or $0.10 per diluted share and the effect of revised state income tax valuation allowances of $152,671 or $0.06 per diluted share) for the December 2005 quarter as compared to $362,994 or $0.14 per diluted share in the December 2004 quarter. Revenues grew 14.7% to $19.4 million in the December 2005 quarter from $16.9 million in the December 2004 quarter. Revenues in the Company's "Caretenders" Visiting Nurse (VN) segment grew 29% over the same period last year. Acquired operations contributed approximately $1.1 million of that revenue growth while also contributing $0.06 per diluted share to operating results in the December 2005 quarter. The balance of the Company's revenue and earnings increase came from internal growth. In December 2005, the Tennessee Court of Appeals issued its ruling in the Franklin Litigation, a long contested contract case dating back to 1994. The court partially overturned the findings of the trial court thus lowering the amount of damages previously assessed to and recorded by the Company. The Company and the plaintiff subsequently entered into a settlement agreement on this case which resulted in a one-time net of tax gain of $267,426 or $0.10 per diluted share being recorded in the Company's results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2005. Additionally, the Company's income tax provision for the fourth quarter of 2005 included a one-time reduction of $152,671 or $0.06 per diluted share resulting from changes in state income tax valuation allowances relating to the anticipated realization of net operating loss carry-forwards. Net income including discontinued operations, was $1,483,036 or $0.56 per diluted share in the quarter ended December 31, 2005 and $156,196 or $0.06 per diluted share in 2004.
Results of operations for the quarters ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 are set forth in the tables below:
Year End Results Net Income From Continuing Operations - As Reported grew 78% to $2,883,288 or $1.11 per diluted share for the year ended December 2005 (including a net gain on litigation settlement of $267,426 or $0.10 per diluted share and the effect of revised state income tax valuation allowances of $152,671 or $0.06 per diluted share) as compared to $1,620,448 or $0.63 per diluted share in 2004. Revenues grew 15% to $75.6 million in 2005 from $65.8 million in 2004. Revenues in the VN segment grew 25% over the same period last year. Acquired operations contributed approximately $3.1 million of that revenue growth while also contributing $0.16 per diluted share to operating results in 2005. The balance of the Company's revenue and earnings increase came from internal growth. Net income including discontinued operations, was $7,868,468 or $3.02 per diluted share (including a gain on the sale of the adult day care segment of $5,205,698 or $2.00 per diluted share) in the year ended December 31, 2005 and $1,256,976 or $0.49 per diluted share in 2004.
Results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 are set forth in the tables below:
Non-GAAP Financial Measure The information provided in the tables in this release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined under Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules. In accordance with SEC rules, the Company has provided, in the supplemental information and the footnotes to the tables, a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Net Income From Continuing Operations -- As Adjusted Although "Net Income From Continuing Operations - As Adjusted" is a non-GAAP financial measure, management believes that the presentation of net income as calculated using a normalized tax rate, which excludes the nonrecurring tax benefits as described in Note 1, and excluding the litigation settlement gain as described in Note 2, is a useful adjunct to "Net Income From Continuing Operations - As Reported" under GAAP because it measures the Company's financial performance in a consistent manner between the results for the fourth quarters and fiscal years 2005 and 2004 and since these adjustments represent special or non-recurring items. For these reasons, management believes that "Net Income From Continuing Operations - As Adjusted" is useful to investors. Investors should not view "Net Income From Continuing Operations - As Adjusted" as an alternative to the GAAP measure of net income. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of Net Income From Continuing Operations -- As Reported to Net Income From Continuing Operations -- As Adjusted: Note 1: The Company's income tax provision for 2005 included a one-time reduction of $152,671 or $0.06 per diluted share resulting from changes in state income tax valuation allowances relating to the anticipated realization of net operating loss carry-forwards. Note 2: In December 2005, the Tennessee Court of Appeals issued its ruling in the Franklin Litigation, a long contested contract case dating back to 1994. The court partially overturned the findings of the trial court thus lowering the amount of damages previously assessed to and recorded by the Company. The Company and the plaintiff subsequently entered into a settlement agreement on this case which resulted in a one-time net of tax gain of $267,426 or $0.10 per diluted share being recorded in the Company's results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2005.
EBITDA: EBITDA is defined as income before depreciation and amortization, net interest expense and income taxes. EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. It should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income, operating income, cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities, or any other measure calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The items excluded from EBITDA are significant components in understanding and evaluating financial performance and liquidity. Management routinely calculates and communicates EBITDA and believes that it is useful to investors because it is commonly used as an analytical indicator within our industry to evaluate performance, measure leverage capacity and debt service ability, and to estimate current or prospective enterprise value. EBITDA is also used in measurements of borrowing availability and certain covenants contained in our credit agreement. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of Continuing Operations Net Income -- As Adjusted to EBITDA: Sale of ADC Operations On September 30, 2005 the Company completed the previously announced sale of its ADC operating segment for $13.6 million in cash plus assumption of certain liabilities. The transaction resulted in the reporting of an after tax gain of approximately $5.2 million or $2.00 per diluted share reported in the year ended December 31, 2005. Almost Family, Inc. TM and subsidiaries (collectively "Almost Family") is a leading regional provider of home health services. The Company has service locations in Florida, Kentucky, Ohio, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Indiana and Alabama (in order of revenue significance). Contact: William Yarmuth or Steve Guenthner (502) 891-1000. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, included in this news release, including the objectives and expectations of management for future operating results, the Company's ability to accelerate growth in its home health operations, the Company's ability to generate VN revenue growth, the Company's ability to acquire visiting nurse agencies at prices it is willing to pay, the Company's ability to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of its sales and marketing efforts, the Company's ability to attract investment of additional capital, the Company's ability to generate positive cash flows, and the Company's expectations with regard to market conditions, are forward-looking
statements. These forward-looking statements are based on the Company's current expectations. Although the Company believes that the expectations expressed or implied in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, there can be no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. Because forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, the Company's actual results could differ materially. The potential risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially could include: regulatory approvals or third party consents may not be obtained, the impact of further changes in healthcare reimbursement systems, including the ultimate outcome of potential changes to Medicaid reimbursement due to state budget shortfalls; the ability of the Company to maintain its level of operating performance and achieve its cost control objectives; government regulation; health care reform; pricing pressures from Medicare, Medicaid and other third-party payers; changes in laws and interpretations of laws relating to the healthcare industry, and the Company's self-insurance risks.

INDEX TO EXHIBITS Exhibit No. - -------------- 99.1 Press release issued by the Company on May 8, 2006.

Exhibit 99.1 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE May 8, 2006 Almost Family Announces Quarterly Results First Quarter 2006 EPS from Continuing Operations up 61% over 2005 Louisville, KY - Almost Family, Inc. (NASDAQ:AFAM) today announced its operating results for the quarter ending March 31, 2006. First Quarter Financial Highlights o Net Income From Continuing Operations -- As Reported was $911,740 or $0.34 per diluted share in the quarter ended March 31, 2006 as compared to $559,062 or $0.21 per diluted share in the same quarter of 2005. o Consolidated revenues increased approximately 14% over the same quarter last year o The Company's VN segment revenues grew 25% over the same quarter last year. William B. Yarmuth, AFAM's Chairman and CEO commented on the results: "We are very pleased with our operating results for the first quarter, continuing the strong performance we exhibited in 2005. VN revenue continued to grow at a 25% rate including acquisitions and startups, and grew 8% on a same store basis. Our strong EPS growth continues to reflect the successful execution of our strategic plan. Consistent with that plan, our VN segment is now generating 57% of consolidated revenues and our operating margin has increased to 7.0% in 2006 as compared to 5.4% in 2005." "We remain optimistic about the prospects for our future growth and development." Last month we completed and announced the acquisition of a $1.7 million revenue Ocala FL based home health agency marking our fifth transaction in about a year and half. Our development efforts continue to provide us with a very nice supply of VN acquisition candidates at good prices and we hope to complete additional transactions in 2006." Quarterly Discussion Net Income From Continuing Operations - As Reported grew 63% to $911,740 or $0.34 per diluted share for the March 2006 quarter as compared to $559,062 or $0.21 per diluted share in the March 2005 quarter. Revenues grew 14% to $20.8 million in the March 2006 quarter from $18.3 million in the March 2005 quarter. Revenues in the Company's "Caretenders" Visiting Nurse (VN) segment grew 25% over the same period last year. Acquired operations contributed approximately
$1.5 million of that revenue growth while also contributing $0.08 per diluted share to operating results in the March 2006 quarter. The balance of the Company's revenue and earnings increase came from internal growth. Net income including discontinued operations, was $845,662 or $0.32 per diluted share in the quarter ended March 31, 2006 and $383,934 or $0.15 per diluted share in 2005.

As noted in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005, our Visiting Nurse segment operations located in Florida normally experience higher admissions during the March quarter than in the other quarters due to seasonal population fluctuations.

Our development efforts continue to provide us with a very nice supply of VN acquisition candidates at attractive prices and we hope to complete additional transactions in 2006.

Non-GAAP Financial Measure The information provided in the tables in this release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined under Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules. In accordance with SEC rules, the Company has provided, in the supplemental information and the footnotes to the tables, a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. EBITDA: EBITDA is defined as income before depreciation and amortization, net interest expense and income taxes. EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. It should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income, operating income, cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities, or any other measure calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The items excluded from EBITDA are significant components in understanding and evaluating financial performance and liquidity. Management routinely calculates and communicates EBITDA and believes that it is useful to investors because it is commonly used as an analytical indicator within our industry to evaluate performance, measure leverage capacity and debt service ability, and to estimate current or prospective enterprise value. EBITDA is also used in measurements of borrowing availability and certain covenants contained in our credit agreement. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of Continuing Operations Net Income -- As Reported to EBITDA: Almost Family, Inc. and subsidiaries (collectively "Almost Family") is a leading regional provider of home health services. The Company has service locations in Florida, Kentucky, Ohio, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Indiana and Alabama (in order of revenue significance).

Exhibit 99.1
LOUISVILLE, Ky., Nov. 6 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Almost Family, Inc. (Nasdaq: AFAM) today announced its operating results, including record revenue growth, for the three and nine months ending September 30, 2006.
          Quarter Financial Highlights
          Year to Date Financial Highlights
William B. Yarmuth, AFAM's Chairman and CEO commented on the results for the quarter as compared to the same quarter of 2005:
"We are extremely pleased to report that our VN operations are producing unprecedented 43% growth all of which is driven by increases in patient volume. All three prongs of our growth strategy: 1) same store sales growth, 2) startups and 3) acquisitions contributed significantly to the quarter's successful results. At the anniversary of the sale of our adult day care segment, our results reflect the singularity of our focus on home health care and come in large part from the redeployment of capital, the geographic expansion of our service territory, and the consistent quality of our services which leads to satisfied patients and referral sources. We firmly believe that the increased return on our shareholders' investment is a direct result of our employees' commitment to only the highest level of patient outcomes."
Regarding business development, Yarmuth continued: "As we noted in our comments regarding last quarter's operating results, we remain very optimistic about the prospects for our future growth and development. We are seeing an increase in the number of home health agencies being offered for sale, we believe as a result of the difficulties smaller providers have competing with larger regional and national providers in today's complex Medicare environment. This, plus our strong operating infrastructure and financial condition, will allow us to be appropriately selective in our acquisition activities."
The Company noted that it completed one acquisition during the quarter: a $1.8 million annualized Medicare revenue South FL based home health agency with branches in Sunrise and Delray beach effective late September. The quarter also included the results the acquisition of a $1.7 million annualized Medicare revenue Birmingham AL based home health agency effective the end of June.

Net income including discontinued operations, was $2,770,379 or $1.04 per diluted share for the nine months ended September 30, 2006 and $6,385,432 or $2.43 per diluted share in 2005 with $1.90 per share being generated from the sale of the Company's adult day care operating segment.
Results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2006 and 2005 are set forth in the tables below:
          Non-GAAP Financial Measure
The information provided in the tables in this release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined under Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules. In accordance with SEC rules, the Company has provided, in the supplemental information and the footnotes to the tables, a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.
EBITDA:
EBITDA is defined as income before depreciation and amortization, net interest expense and income taxes. EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. It should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income, operating income, cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities, or any other measure calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The items excluded from EBITDA are significant components in understanding and evaluating financial performance and liquidity. Management routinely calculates and communicates EBITDA and believes that it is useful to investors because it is commonly used as an analytical indicator within our industry to evaluate performance, measure leverage capacity and debt service ability, and to estimate current or prospective enterprise value. EBITDA is also used in measurements of borrowing availability and certain covenants contained in our credit agreement.
The following table sets forth a reconciliation of Continuing Operations Net Income to EBITDA:

SIGNATURE Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized. ALMOST FAMILY, INC. Date: November 17, 2006 By /s/ C. Steven Guenthner ------------------------------- C. Steven Guenthner Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Exhibit 99.1 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE November 16, 2006 Almost Family Announces Acquisition of Mederi, Inc.'s Home Health Agencies Louisville, KY - LOUISVILLE, Ky., Nov. 16 -- Almost Family, Inc. (NASDAQ: AFAM) today announced an agreement to acquire the assets of all the Medicare-certified home health agencies owned and operated by Mederi, Inc., one of Florida's oldest and best-known home health care organizations. Coconut Grove, Fl.-based Mederi operates 21 agency locations in Florida (16), Missouri (2) and Illinois (3). Company Comments on Acquisition "We are very pleased to welcome the employees and patients of Mederi, and we are extremely excited about this acquisition" said William B. Yarmuth, chairman and chief executive officer of Almost Family. "Mederi has a three decade long history of stability and high-quality patient care. Combining Mederi with our Caretenders Visiting Nurse (VN) operations will bring the best of both companies to the communities we serve." Strategic Achievements Yarmuth continued: "This transaction marks several strategic achievements for Almost Family. With this acquisition we are passing the $100 million revenue mark. Our VN segment on a combined pro-forma basis would account for two-thirds of our consolidated revenue which we have previously stated is one of our strategic objectives. Finally, we have substantially increased our presence in Florida, where we believe we are one of the largest home health providers in the state, and added Missouri and Illinois to our geographic footprint. On a combined basis following integration of the transaction we expect to be operating in 73 branch locations in 9 states." Terms of the Transaction The agreement calls for an initial purchase price of approximately $19 million consisting of $13 million cash, $4 million in a note payable and 100,000 shares of Almost Family common stock (restricted). Additional consideration of up to $5.5 million in cash may be paid to the seller contingent primarily upon the achievement of certain revenue targets in the two years following the closing. The cash portion of the transaction will be funded from borrowings available on the Company's existing senior credit facility with JP Morgan Chase Bank, NA. Subject to usual and customary closing conditions, the transaction is expected to close Dec. 3, 2006.
Financial Implications In the 12 months ended September 30, 2006, the agencies being acquired reported $24.6 million in revenue and $3.5 million in pre-tax agency-level operating income (unaudited, before corporate overhead). Based upon its integration plan which calls for the combination of 8 Mederi locations with Caretenders locations in overlapping service territories, the Company expects to eliminate approximately $850,000 of agency level costs, net of additional corporate management costs annually. Based on current interest rates, the interest cost on funds used to finance the transaction would total $1.5 million annually. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2006, Almost Family has reported $84.8 million in revenue, $6.1 million in pretax income and $3.9 million in net income from continuing operations. During that period, the Company had 2.662 million average shares outstanding for diluted earnings purposes and reported $1.46 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations. Almost Family's reported results for the twelve months ended included only partial results for previously announced acquisitions of home health agencies in April 2006 (Ocala FL), June 2006 (Birmingham AL) and September 2006 (Ft. Lauderdale FL). About Mederi Home Health Care Mederi, a Medicare certified home health agency, was founded in 1973 to provide more advanced health care to homebound patients. Recognized as one of the first home health care agencies in the state of Florida, Mederi has grown into a network of 16 community-based offices in Florida and five branches in Missouri and Illinois. Mederi offers physician-referred patients comprehensive home health care services such as: registered nursing, specialty nursing, physical therapy, speech therapy, occupational therapy, nutritional guidance and home health aide services. About Almost Family Almost Family, Inc., founded in 1976, is a leading regional provider of home health nursing services, with branch locations in Florida, Kentucky, Ohio, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Alabama and Indiana (in order of revenue significance). Almost Family, Inc. and its subsidiaries operate a Medicare-certified division under the Caretenders trade name and a personal care division under the Almost Family name. Altogether, Almost Family operates 60 branch locations in 7 U.S. states. Contact: William Yarmuth or Steve Guenthner (502) 891-1000. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, included in this news release, including the objectives and expectations of management for future operating results, the Company's ability to accelerate growth in its home health operations, the Company's ability to achieve expected cost savings net of incremental overhead post-acquisition, the ultimate outcome of the Company's allocation of purchase price to amortizable intangible assets, the Company's ability to generate positive cash flows, and the Company's expectations with regard to market conditions, are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on the Company's current expectations. Although the Company believes that the expectations expressed or implied in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, there can be no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct.
Because forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, the Company's actual results could differ materially. The potential risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially include: regulatory approvals or third party consents may not be obtained, the impact of further changes in healthcare reimbursement systems, including the ultimate outcome of potential changes to Medicaid reimbursement due to state budget shortfalls; the ability of the Company to maintain its level of operating performance and achieve its cost control objectives; changes in our relationships with referral sources; the ability of the Company to integrate acquired operations; government regulation; health care reform; pricing pressures from Medicare, Medicaid and other third-party payers; changes in laws and interpretations of laws relating to the healthcare industry, and the Company's self-insurance risks. For a more complete discussion regarding these and other factors which could affect the Company's financial performance, refer to the Company's Securities and Exchange Commission filing on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005, in particular information under the headings "Special Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" and "Risk Factors."

Maker shall have the right to withhold and set-off against any amount due hereunder the amount of any claim for indemnification or payment of damages to which Maker may be entitled under the Agreement, and the exercise of such right shall not be an Event of Default hereunder.

Upon the request of each Holder given within twenty (20) days after such notice is given by the Company, the Company shall, subject to the provisions of Section 2.2, cause to be registered all of the Registrable Securities that each such Holder has requested to be included in such registration. The Company shall have the right to terminate or withdraw any registration initiated by it under this Section 2.1 before the effective date of such registration, whether or not any Holder has elected to include Registrable Securities in such registration. The expenses of such withdrawn registration shall be borne by the Company in accordance with Section 2.5. Underwriting Requirements. In connection with any offering involving an underwriting of shares of the Company's capital stock pursuant to Section 2.1, the Company shall not be required to include any of the Holder's Registrable Securities in such underwriting unless the Holder accepts the terms of the underwriting as agreed upon between the Company and its underwriters, and then only in such quantity as the underwriters in their sole discretion determine will not jeopardize the success of the offering by the Company. If the total number of securities, including Registrable Securities, requested by stockholders to be included in such offering exceeds the number of securities to be sold (other than by the Company) that the underwriters in their reasonable discretion determine is compatible with the success of the offering, then the Company shall be required to include in the offering only that number of such securities, including Registrable Securities, which the underwriters and the Company in their sole discretion determine will not jeopardize the success of the offering. In no event shall any Registrable Securities be excluded from such offering unless all other stockholders' securities have been first excluded. If the underwriters determine that less than all of the Registrable Securities requested to be registered can be included in such offering, then the Registrable Securities that are included in such offering shall be apportioned pro rata among the selling Holder based on the number of Registrable Securities held by all selling Holder or in such other proportions as shall mutually be agreed to by all such selling Holder. For purposes of the provision in this Section 2.2 concerning apportionment, for any selling stockholder that is a Holder and a partnership, limited liability company, or corporation, the partners, members, retired partners, retired members, stockholders, and
Affiliates of such Holder, or the estates and Immediate Family Members of any such partners, retired partners, members, and retired members and any trusts for the benefit of any of the foregoing Persons, shall be deemed to be a single "selling Holder," and any pro rata reduction with respect to such "selling Holder" shall be based upon the aggregate number of Registrable Securities owned by all Persons included in such "selling Holder," as defined in this sentence. Obligations of the Company. Whenever required under this Section 2 to effect the registration of any Registrable Securities, the Company shall, as expeditiously as reasonably possible: prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement with respect to such Registrable Securities and use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such registration statement to become and remain effective upon the Company's determination in its sole discretion; prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and supplements to such registration statement, and the prospectus used in connection with such registration statement, as may be necessary to comply with the Securities Act in order to enable the disposition of all securities covered by such registration statement; furnish to the selling Holder such numbers of copies of a prospectus, including a preliminary prospectus, as required by the Securities Act, and such other documents as the Holder may reasonably request in order to facilitate its disposition of their Registrable Securities; use its commercially reasonable efforts to register and qualify the securities covered by such registration statement under such other securities or blue-sky laws of such jurisdictions as shall be reasonably requested by the selling Holder; provided that the Company shall not be required to qualify to do business or to file a general consent to service of process in any such states or jurisdictions, unless the Company is already subject to service in such jurisdiction and except as may be required by the Securities Act; in the event of any underwritten public offering, enter into and perform its obligations under an underwriting agreement, in usual and customary form, with the managing underwriter of such offering; use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause all such Registrable Securities covered by such registration statement to be listed on a national securities exchange or trading system and each securities exchange and trading system (if any) on which similar securities issued by the Company are then listed; promptly make available for inspection by the selling Holder, any managing underwriter participating in any disposition pursuant to such registration statement, and any attorney or accountant or other agent retained by any such underwriter or selected by the selling Holder, all financial and other records, pertinent corporate documents, and properties of the Company, and cause the Company's officers, directors, employees, and independent accountants to supply all information reasonably requested by any such seller, underwriter, attorney, accountant, or agent in connection with any such registration statement;
notify each selling Holder, promptly after the Company receives notice thereof, of the time when such registration statement has been declared effective or a supplement to any prospectus forming a part of such registration statement has been filed; and after such registration statement becomes effective, notify each selling Holder of any request by the SEC that the Company amend or supplement such registration statement or prospectus. Furnish Information. It shall be a condition precedent to the obligations of the Company to take any action pursuant to this Section 2 with respect to the Registrable Securities of any selling Holder that such Holder shall furnish to the Company such information regarding itself, the Registrable Securities held by it, and the intended method of disposition of such securities as is reasonably required to effect the registration of such Holder's Registrable Securities. Expenses of Registration. All expenses (other than Selling Expenses) incurred in connection with registrations, filings, or qualifications pursuant to Section 2, including all registration, filing, and qualification fees; printers' and accounting fees; fees and disbursements of counsel for the Company, shall be borne and paid by the Company. All Selling Expenses relating to Registrable Securities registered pursuant to this Section 2 shall be borne and paid by the Holder pro rata on the basis of the number of Registrable Securities registered on their behalf. Delay of Registration. No Holder shall have any right to obtain or seek an injunction restraining or otherwise delaying any registration contemplated in this Agreement as the result of any controversy that might arise with respect to the interpretation or implementation of this Section 2. Indemnification. If any Registrable Securities are included in a registration statement under this Section 2: To the extent permitted by law, the Company will indemnify and hold harmless each selling Holder, and the partners, members, officers, directors, and stockholders of each such Holder; legal counsel and accountants for each such Holder; any underwriter (as defined in the Securities Act) for each such Holder; and each Person, if any, who controls such Holder or underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, against any Damages, and the Company will pay to each such Holder, underwriter, controlling Person, or other aforementioned Person any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred thereby in connection with investigating any matter or defending any proceeding from which Damages may result, as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 2.7(a) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such investigation or proceeding if such settlement is effected without the consent of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, nor shall the Company be liable for any Damages to the extent that they arise out of or are based upon actions or omissions made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished by or on behalf of any such Holder, underwriter, controlling Person, or other aforementioned Person expressly for use in connection with such registration.
To the extent permitted by law, each selling Holder, severally and not jointly, will indemnify and hold harmless the Company, and each of its directors, each of its officers who has signed the registration statement, each Person (if any), who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act, legal counsel and accountants for the Company, any underwriter (as defined in the Securities Act), any other Holder selling securities in such registration statement, and any controlling Person of any such underwriter or other Holder, against any Damages, in each case only to the extent that such Damages arise out of or are based upon actions or omissions made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished by or on behalf of such selling Holder expressly for use in connection with such registration; and each such selling Holder will pay to the Company and each other aforementioned Person any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred thereby in connection with investigating any investigation or defending any proceeding from which Damages may result, as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 2.7(b) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such investigation or proceeding if such settlement is effected without the consent of the Holder, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; and provided further that in no event shall any indemnity under this Section 2.7(b) exceed the proceeds from the offering (net of any Selling Expenses) received by such Holder, except in the case of fraud or willful misconduct by such Holder. Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 2.7 of notice of the commencement of any action (including any governmental action) for which a party may be entitled to indemnification hereunder, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against any indemnifying party under this Section 2.7, give the indemnifying party notice of the commencement thereof. The indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in such action and, to the extent the indemnifying party so desires, participate jointly with any other indemnifying party to which notice has been given, and to assume the defense thereof with counsel mutually satisfactory to the parties; provided, however, that an indemnified party (together with all other indemnified parties that may be represented without conflict by one counsel) shall have the right to retain one separate counsel, with the fees and expenses to be paid by the indemnifying party, if representation of such indemnified party by the counsel retained by the indemnifying party would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between such indemnified party and any other party represented by such counsel in such action. The foregoing indemnity agreements of the Company and the selling Holder is subject to the condition that, insofar as they relate to any Damages arising from any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in, or omission or alleged omission of a material fact from, a preliminary prospectus (or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading) that has been corrected in the form of prospectus included in the registration statement at the time it becomes effective, or any amendment or supplement thereto filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act (the "Final Prospectus"), such indemnity agreement shall not inure to the benefit of any Person if a copy of the Final Prospectus was furnished to the indemnified party and such indemnified party failed to deliver, at or before the confirmation of the sale of the shares registered in such offering, a copy of the Final Prospectus to the Person asserting the loss, liability, claim, or damage in any case in which such delivery was required by the Securities Act.
To provide for just and equitable contribution to joint liability under the Securities Act in any case in which either (i) any party otherwise entitled to indemnification hereunder makes a claim for indemnification pursuant to this Section 2.7 but it is judicially determined (by the entry of a final judgment or decree by a court of competent jurisdiction and the expiration of time to appeal or the denial of the, last right of appeal) that such indemnification may not be enforced in such case, notwithstanding the fact that this Section 2.7 provides for indemnification in such case, or (ii) contribution under the Securities Act may be required on the part of any party hereto for which indemnification is provided under this Section 2.7, then, and in each such case, such parties will contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages, liabilities, or expenses to which they may be subject (after contribution from others) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the each of indemnifying party and the indemnified party in connection with the statements, omissions, or other actions that resulted in such loss, claim, damage, liability, or expense, as well as to reflect any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the indemnifying party and of the indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or allegedly untrue statement of a material fact, or the omission or alleged omission of a material fact, relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or by the indemnified party and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information, and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission; provided, however, that, in any such case, (x) no Holder will be required to contribute any amount in excess of the public offering price of all such Registrable Securities offered and sold by such Holder pursuant to such registration statement, and (y) no Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the Securities Act) will be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation; and provided further that in no event shall a Holder's liability pursuant to this Section 2.7(e), when combined with the amounts paid or payable by such Holder pursuant to Section 2.7(b), exceed the proceeds from the offering (net of any Selling Expenses) received by such Holder, except in the case of willful misconduct or fraud by such Holder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that the provisions on indemnification and contribution contained in the underwriting agreement entered into in connection with the underwritten public offering are in conflict with the foregoing provisions, the provisions in the underwriting agreement shall control. Unless otherwise superseded by an underwriting agreement entered into in connection with theunderwritten public offering, the obligations of the Company and Holder under this Section 2.7 shall survive the completion of any offering of Registrable Securities in a registration under this Section 2, and otherwise shall survive the termination of this Agreement. Limitations on Subsequent Registration Rights. From and after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of the Holder of sixty five percent (65%) of the Registrable Securities then outstanding, enter into any agreement with any holder or prospective holder of any securities of the Company that would allow such holder or prospective holder (i) to include such securities in any registration unless, under the terms of such agreement, such holder or prospective holder may include such securities in any such registration only to the extent that the inclusion of such securities will not reduce the number of the Registrable Securities of the Holder that are included or (ii) to demand registration of any securities held by such holder or prospective holder.
Assignment of Registration Rights. The rights to cause the Company to register Registrable Securities pursuant to this Section 2 may be assigned (but only with all related obligations) by a Holder to a transferee of such Registrable Securities that (i) is an Affiliate, partner, member, limited partner, retired partner, retired member, or stockholder of a Holder; or (ii) is a Holder's Immediate Family Member or trust for the benefit of an individual Holder or one or more of such Holder's Immediate Family Members; provided, however, that (x) the Company is, within a reasonable time after such transfer, furnished with written notice of the name and address of such transferee and the Registrable Securities with respect to which such registration rights are being transferred, and (y) such transferee agrees in writing to be bound by and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Restrictions on Transfer. The Registrable Securities shall not be sold, pledged, or otherwise transferred, and the Company shall not recognize any such sale, pledge, or transfer, except upon the conditions specified in this Agreement and as contemplated in the Asset Purchase Agreement, which conditions are intended to ensure compliance with the provisions of the Securities Act; provided, however, that, subject to the conditions specified in the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Registrable Securities may be sold, pledged, or otherwise transferred (i) in any transaction in compliance with Rule 144 or (ii) in any transaction in which the Registrable Securities, as applicable, are sold, pledged or otherwise transferred to an Affiliate for no consideration. A transferring Holder will cause any proposed purchaser, pledgee, or transferee of the Registrable Securities held by such Holder to agree to take and hold such securities subject to the provisions and upon the conditions specified in this Agreement. Each certificate representing (i) the Registrable Securities, and (ii) any other securities issued in respect of such securities, upon any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, or similar event, shall (unless otherwise permitted by the provisions of Section 2.10(c)) be stamped or otherwise imprinted with a legend substantially in the following form: THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED FOR INVESTMENT AND HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933. SUCH SHARES MAY NOT BE SOLD, PLEDGED, OR TRANSFERRED IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH REGISTRATION OR A VALID EXEMPTION FROM THE REGISTRATION AND PROSPECTUS DELIVERY REQUIREMENTS OF SAID ACT. The Holder consents to the Company making a notation in its records and giving instructions to any transfer agent of the Restricted Securities in order to implement the restrictions on transfer set forth in this Section 2.10. The holder of each certificate representing Restricted Securities, by acceptance thereof, agrees to comply in all respects with the provisions of this Section 2. Before any proposed sale, pledge, or transfer of any Restricted Securities, unless there is in effect a registration statement under the Securities Act covering the proposed transaction, the Holder thereof shall give notice to the Company of
such Holder's intention to effect such sale, pledge, or transfer. Each such notice shall describe the manner and circumstances of the proposed sale, pledge, or transfer in sufficient detail and, if reasonably requested by the Company, shall be accompanied at such Holder's expense by either (i) a written opinion of legal counsel who shall, and whose legal opinion shall, be reasonably satisfactory to the Company, addressed to the Company, to the effect that the proposed transaction may be effected without registration under the Securities Act; (ii) a "no action" letter from the SEC to the effect that the proposed sale, pledge, or transfer of such Restricted Securities without registration will not result in a recommendation by the staff of the SEC that action be taken with respect thereto; or (iii) any other evidence reasonably satisfactory to counsel to the Company to the effect that the proposed sale, pledge, or transfer of the Restricted Securities may be effected without registration under the Securities Act, whereupon the Holder of such Restricted Securities shall be entitled to sell, pledge, or transfer such Restricted Securities in accordance with the terms of the notice given by the Holder to the Company. The Company will not require such a legal opinion or "no action" letter (x) in any transaction in compliance with Rule 144 or (y) in any transaction in which such Holder distributes Restricted Securities to an Affiliate of such Holder for no consideration; provided that each transferee agrees in writing to be subject to the terms of this Section 2.10(c). Each certificate evidencing the Restricted Securities transferred as above provided shall bear, except if such transfer is made pursuant to Rule 144, the appropriate restrictive legend set forth in Section 2.10(b), except that such certificate shall not bear such restrictive legend if, in the opinion of counsel for such Holder and the Company, such legend is not required in order to establish compliance with any provisions of the Securities Act. Termination of Registration Rights. The right of any Holder to request inclusion of Registrable Securities in any registration pursuant to Section 2.1 shall terminate upon the date when all of such Holder's Registrable Securities could be sold without restriction under SEC Rule 144(k). Confidentiality. Each Holder agrees that such Holder will keep confidential and will not disclose, divulge, or use for any purpose (other than to monitor its investment in the Company) any confidential information obtained from the Company pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (including notice of the Company's intention to file a registration statement), unless such confidential information (a) is known or becomes known to the public in general (other than as a result of a breach of this Section 2.12 by such Holder), (b) is or has been independently developed or conceived by the Holder without use of the Company's confidential information, or (c) is or has been made known or disclosed to the Holder by a third party without a breach of any obligation of confidentiality such third party may have to the Company; provided, however, that a Holder may disclose confidential information (i) to its attorneys, accountants, consultants, and other professionals to the extent necessary to obtain their services in connection with monitoring its investment in the Company; (ii) to any prospective purchaser of any Registrable Securities from such Holder, if such prospective purchaser agrees to be bound by the provisions of this Section 2.12; (iii) to any Affiliate, partner, member, stockholder, or wholly owned subsidiary of such Holder in the ordinary course of business, provided that such Holder informs such Person that such information is confidential and directs such Person to maintain the confidentiality of such information; or (iv) as may otherwise be required by law, provided that the Holder promptly notifies the Company of such disclosure and takes reasonable steps to minimize the extent of any such required disclosure.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement may not be amended or terminated and the observance of any term hereof may not be waived with
respect to any Holder without the written consent of such Holder, unless such amendment, termination, or waiver applies to the Holder in the same fashion. The Company shall give prompt notice of any amendment or termination hereof or waiver hereunder to any party hereto that did not consent in writing to such amendment, termination, or waiver.

THE PARTIES, INTENDING TO BE LEGALLY BOUND, AGREE AS FOLLOWS: Article 1 - Indemnification 1.1 Indemnification of the Buyer Indemnified Parties (a) General. The Selling Parties, jointly and severally, agree to indemnify, defend and hold the Buyer and any affiliated entity assigned purchase rights under this Agreement, and their respective officers, directors, shareholders, agents and attorneys (collectively, "Buyer Indemnified Parties") harmless from and against, and reimburse the Buyer Indemnified Parties on demand for, any damage, loss, cost or expense (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by an Buyer Indemnified Party resulting from, or in any way related to, any of the following: (i) any breach of the Sellers' representations, warranties or covenants in the Purchase Agreement, or from any misrepresentation in, or omission by the Sellers under the Purchase Agreement;
(ii) any brokerage or similar fee due to any agent of any Selling Party; and (iii) any liability of the Sellers or liability with respect to which the Purchased Assets are subject to, or obligation under the Assumed Contracts or Assumed Leases (except for any liabilities that result in a Purchase Price adjustment) accruing prior to the Closing. (b) Audits, Investigations, Refund Obligations and Other Pre-Closing Liabilities; Taxes. Subject to the limitations described within this paragraph 1.1 and its subparts, the Selling Parties, jointly and severally, agree to indemnify, defend and hold Buyer Indemnified Parties harmless from and against, and reimburse Buyer Indemnified Parties on demand for, any actual damage, loss, cost, refund obligation, or expense (including reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in defending any claim for such damage, loss, cost or expense) resulting from, or in any way related to, any of the following: (i) medical malpractice claims or any audit or investigation by Medicaid or federal Medicare authorities or third party payors concerning the operation of the Business before the Closing or any amounts paid with respect to the operation of the Business before Closing; (ii) any assessment, adjustments, suspensions or offsets made against the Business, a Buyer Indemnified Party or the Purchased Assets as a result of such an audit or investigation regarding the operation of the Business before Closing; (iii) any costs of defense of, and any judgment against a Buyer Indemnified Party with respect to, any litigation relating to the operation of the Business before Closing; (iv) any mortgage, security interest, lease, obligation, claim, liability, debt, lien, charge or encumbrance relating to matters prior to Closing asserted against the Purchased Assets; (v) any other personal liability, property damage, personal injury, cost, claim, expense or assessment asserted against the Business, a Buyer Indemnified Party or the Purchased Assets as a result of, or with respect to, the operation of the Business or the ownership of the Purchased Assets before the Closing, excluding obligations arising after the Closing under the Assumed Contracts and Assumed Leases; (vi) any federal, state or local tax liability or obligation arising with respect to the Sellers or the operation of the Business prior to the Closing; and (vii) the Sellers' pending litigation with the Provider Reimbursement Review Board.
(c) Limitations on Indemnification Obligations. (i) The Selling Parties' indemnification obligations shall be limited in the aggregate to the aggregate of the Purchase Price in the Purchase Agreements and shall survive for a period of 36 months after the Closing Date, except for claims brought prior to such date, and except that the Selling Parties' indemnification obligation with respect to a breach of paragraphs 4.4 and 4.16 (taxes) of the Purchase Agreements and paragraph 4.10 (healthcare) of the Purchase Agreements shall survive for the greater of 36 months or the statute of limitations applicable to such claims, and the Selling Parties' indemnification obligation with respect to a breach of paragraph 4.5 (title) of the Purchase Agreements shall survive the Closing Date without any time limitation. (ii) The Selling Parties' indemnification obligations in paragraph 1.1(b) above shall survive the Closing for the greater of 36 months or the statute of limitations for the making of such claims against the Seller, except for claims brought by the Buyer prior to such date, and such indemnification obligation shall not be capped or otherwise limited as to amount. (iii) Subject to paragraph 1.1(c)(i), the Selling Parties shall not be required to make any indemnification payment with respect to any breach of the Selling Parties' representations and warranties in paragraph 1.1(a)(i) until such time as the total amount of all damages have been directly or indirectly suffered or incurred by any one or more of the Buyer Indemnified Parties, or to which any one or more of the Buyer Indemnified Parties has or have otherwise become subject, exceeds one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00). If the total amount of such damages exceeds $100,000.00, the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to be indemnified against and compensated and reimbursed for the amount of such damages, exceeding $100,000.00. However, this paragraph 1.1(c)(iii) will not apply to any breach of any of the Selling Parties' representations and warranties of which any Selling Party had knowledge at any time prior to the date on which such representation and warranty is made or any intentional breach by any Selling Party of any covenant or obligation, and the Selling Parties will be jointly and severally liable for all damages with respect to such breaches. (iv) The right to indemnification based on the representations and warranties will not be affected by any investigation conducted with respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before or after execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of such representation and warranty, except that the Buyer will be charged with knowledge of any information disclosed on the Financial Statements or in the schedules delivered upon execution of the Purchase Agreements. 1.2 Indemnification of the Seller Indemnified Parties. The Buyer and Almost Family, jointly and severally, agree to indemnify, defend and hold the Selling Parties and its officers, directors, partners, shareholders, agents and attorneys (collectively, "Seller Indemnified Parties") harmless from and against, and reimburse the Seller Indemnified Parties on demand for, any damage, loss, cost or expense (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by a
Seller Indemnified Party resulting from, or in any way related to, any of the following: (i) any breach of the Buyer's representations, warranties or covenants in this Agreement, or from any misrepresentation in, or omission by the Buyer under this Agreement; (ii) any brokerage or similar fee due to any agent of the Buyer; (iii) any federal, state or local tax liability or obligation arising with respect to the Buyer or the operation of the Business after the Closing; (iv) any liability of the Buyer or liability with respect to which the Purchased Assets are subject to, or obligation under the Assumed Contracts or Assumed Leases in each case accruing after the Closing; and (v) Buyer's operation of the Business after the Closing. The indemnification obligations of the Seller Indemnified Parties shall be limited to the Purchase Price and shall survive for a 36 month period after Closing, except for claims brought prior to such date. 1.3 Procedure for Indemnification. The following procedure shall apply with respect to any claims or proceedings covered by the indemnification obligations in this Article 1. (a) The party who is seeking indemnification (the "Claimant") shall give written notice to the party from whom indemnification is sought (the "Indemnitor") promptly, but in no event greater than 10 business days, after the Claimant learns of the claim or proceeding; provided that the failure to give such notice shall not relieve the Indemnitor of its obligations hereunder if the Claimant uses its best efforts to mitigate Claimant's damages, except to the extent it is actually damaged thereby. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in the event that a Claimant gives notice to the Indemnitor within such 10 business day time period set forth above, the Claimant shall have no obligation to mitigate Claimant's damages under this paragraph 1.3(a). (b) With respect to any third-party claims or proceedings as to which the Claimant is entitled to indemnification, the Indemnitor shall have the right to select and employ counsel of its own choosing to defend against any such claim or proceeding, to assume control of the defense of such claim or proceeding, and to compromise, settle or otherwise dispose of the same, if the Indemnitor deems it advisable to do so, all at the expense of the Indemnitor; provided, however that the Claimant may employ counsel, of its own choosing, at its sole expense. The parties will fully cooperate in any such action, and shall make available to each other any books or records useful for the defense of any such claim or proceeding. The Claimant may elect to participate in the defense of any such third party claim, and may, at its sole expense, retain separate counsel in connection therewith. Subject to the foregoing the Claimant shall not settle or compromise any such third party claim without the prior consent of the Indemnitor, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. 1.4 Right of Setoff. (a) Upon notice to the Sellers specifying in reasonable detail the basis therefor, the Buyer may set off any amount to which it may be entitled under this Article 1 against amounts otherwise payable under the Purchase Note and against the shares of Almost Family, Inc. stock pledged pursuant to the Pledge Agreement between the Sellers and the Buyer, a copy of which is attached as Attachment A (the "Pledge Agreement"). The exercise of such right of setoff by the Buyer in good faith, whether or not ultimately determined to be
justified, will not constitute an event of default under the Purchase Note. Health Management Consultants, Inc., Almost Family, Inc. and John B. Gallagher, Esq. shall enter into an Escrow Agreement at the Closing, a copy of which is attached as Attachment B (the "Escrow Agreement"). (b) Neither the exercise of nor the failure to exercise such right of setoff will constitute an election of remedies or limit the Buyer in any manner in the enforcement of any other remedies that may be available to it. (c) In the event a set off is appropriate, the Buyer shall set off against accrued and payable amounts of Contingent Consideration, the Purchase Note and the AFAM Shares in order of priority based on the amounts next payable to the Sellers. Article 2 - Other Provisions 2.1 Further Assurances. The parties agree to execute and deliver any and all papers and documents which may be reasonably necessary to carry out the terms of this Agreement. 2.2 Entire Agreement; Amendment. All schedules to this Agreement are deemed to be incorporated into and made part of this Agreement.

This Agreement may not be amended or revised except by a writing signed by both parties hereto. 2.3 Binding Effect; Assignment. This Agreement is binding upon and inures to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and assigns; provided, however, that other than an assignment by the Buyer of its rights under this Agreement to an affiliate of the Buyer which does not relieve the Buyer of its obligations under this Agreement, neither this Agreement nor any rights hereunder are assignable nor transferable without the prior written consent of the other party. This Agreement is not intended and must not be construed to create any rights in any parties other than the Buyer and the Seller and no person may assert any rights as a third party beneficiary. 2.4 Separate Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in several identical counterparts, all of which when taken together constitutes but one instrument, and it will not be necessary in any court of law to introduce more than one executed counterpart in proving this Agreement. This Agreement may be executed and delivered by fax counterpart signatures, and upon exchange of fax counterpart signatures, this Agreement will be binding upon the parties. 2.5 Notices.

THE PARTIES, INTENDING TO BE LEGALLY BOUND, AGREE AS FOLLOWS: 1. Grant of Security Interest. (a) As security for the faithful performance of the terms of this Agreement and to ensure the availability for delivery of the Pledged Shares (as defined below) upon exercise of the right to possession of the Pledged Shares upon an Event of Default as herein defined, Pledgor agrees to deliver to and deposit with John B.

Said documents are to be held by the Escrow Agent and delivered by the Escrow Agent only as directed and agreed in the Escrow Agreement attached hereto as Attachment B and which is hereby incorporated into this Agreement by reference (the "Escrow Agreement"). (b) The Pledgor hereby grants to the Secured Party a security interest in all of their right, title and interest in and to 100,000 shares of the common stock of Almost Family, Inc.

If the Pledgor receives additional property of such nature, they shall immediately deliver such property to the Escrow Agent to be held by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. (c) The Pledgor grants a further security interest to the Secured Party in the proceeds or products of any sale or other disposition of the Pledged Shares. 2. Obligations Secured. The security interest created hereby secures payment and performance of the indemnification obligations of the Seller and Shareholders that are set for forth in the Indemnification Agreement (the "Secured Obligations"). 3. Representations and Warranties. To induce the Secured Party to enter into this Agreement, the Pledgor represents and warrants as follows: (a) The Pledgor has full power and authority to enter into and perform this Agreement and this Agreement has been duly entered into and delivered and constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Pledgor enforceable in accordance with its terms. (b) The Pledgor has good title to the Pledged Shares, and the Pledged Shares are not subject to any lien, charge, pledge, encumbrance, claim or security interest. (c) The Pledgor has not entered into any stock restriction or purchase agreement with respect to the Pledged Shares which would in any way restrict the sale, pledge or other transfer of the Pledged Shares or of any interest in or to the Pledged Shares. 4. Duration of Security Interest. The Secured Party, and its successors and assigns, shall hold the security interest created hereby pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and this security interest shall continue until

Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, subject to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, including without limitation, notification of the Secured Party of the existence of a pending sale transaction, after December 3, 2007, the Seller may sell Pledged Shares not subject to an indemnification claim free from the pledge established pursuant to this Agreement. 5. Maintaining Freedom from Liens. The Pledgor shall keep the Pledged Shares free and clear of liens and shall pay all amounts, including taxes, assessments or charges, which might result in a lien against the Pledged Shares if left unpaid, unless the Pledgor at its own expense are contesting such amount in good faith by an appropriate proceeding timely instituted which shall operate to prevent the collection or satisfaction of the lien or amount so contested. If the Pledgor fails to pay such amounts and are not contesting the validity or amount thereof in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence, the Secured Party may, but are not obligated to, pay such amounts, and such payment shall be conclusive evidence of the legality or validity thereof.

Certain Rights Respecting Pledged Shares. (a) The Pledgor shall continue to be the owners of the Pledged Shares so long as no Event of Default (as defined below) under the Secured Obligations or this Agreement has occurred and is continuing and may collect and retain all distributions now or hereafter payable on or on account of the Pledged Shares, and, so long as no Event of Default has occurred may exercise their voting rights with respect to the Pledged Shares. (b) The Pledgor shall not sell, transfer or encumber, or attempt to sell, transfer or encumber, the Pledged Shares, or any part thereof or interest therein, without the prior express written consent of the Secured Party. Any such consent of theirs shall not constitute the release by the Secured Party of its interest in the Pledged Interest, and any such sale, transfer or encumbrance consented to shall be so sold, transferred, or encumbered subject to the security interest of the Secured Party. (c) The Secured Party at its option upon the occurrence of any Event of Default and so long as such Event of Default exists may exercise all voting rights and privileges whatsoever with respect to the Pledged Shares, including, without limitation, the right to receive distributions.

The Selling Parties, jointly and severally, agree to indemnify, defend and hold the Buyer and any affiliated entity assigned purchase rights under this Agreement, and their respective officers, directors, shareholders, agents and attorneys (collectively, "Buyer Indemnified Parties") harmless from and against, and reimburse the Buyer Indemnified Parties on demand for, any damage, loss, cost or expense (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by an Buyer Indemnified Party resulting from, or in any way related to, any of the following: (i) any breach of the Sellers' representations, warranties or covenants in the Purchase Agreement, or from any misrepresentation in, or omission by the Sellers under the Purchase Agreement;
(ii) any brokerage or similar fee due to any agent of any Selling Party; and (iii) any liability of the Sellers or liability with respect to which the Purchased Assets are subject to, or obligation under the Assumed Contracts or Assumed Leases (except for any liabilities that result in a Purchase Price adjustment) accruing prior to the Closing. (b) Audits, Investigations, Refund Obligations and Other Pre-Closing Liabilities; Taxes. Subject to the limitations described within this paragraph 1.1 and its subparts, the Selling Parties, jointly and severally, agree to indemnify, defend and hold Buyer Indemnified Parties harmless from and against, and reimburse Buyer Indemnified Parties on demand for, any actual damage, loss, cost, refund obligation, or expense (including reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in defending any claim for such damage, loss, cost or expense) resulting from, or in any way related to, any of the following: (i) medical malpractice claims or any audit or investigation by Medicaid or federal Medicare authorities or third party payors concerning the operation of the Business before the Closing or any amounts paid with respect to the operation of the Business before Closing; (ii) any assessment, adjustments, suspensions or offsets made against the Business, a Buyer Indemnified Party or the Purchased Assets as a result of such an audit or investigation regarding the operation of the Business before Closing; (iii) any costs of defense of, and any judgment against a Buyer Indemnified Party with respect to, any litigation relating to the operation of the Business before Closing; (iv) any mortgage, security interest, lease, obligation, claim, liability, debt, lien, charge or encumbrance relating to matters prior to Closing asserted against the Purchased Assets; (v) any other personal liability, property damage, personal injury, cost, claim, expense or assessment asserted against the Business, a Buyer Indemnified Party or the Purchased Assets as a result of, or with respect to, the operation of the Business or the ownership of the Purchased Assets before the Closing, excluding obligations arising after the Closing under the Assumed Contracts and Assumed Leases; (vi) any federal, state or local tax liability or obligation arising with respect to the Sellers or the operation of the Business prior to the Closing; and (vii) the Sellers' pending litigation with the Provider Reimbursement Review Board.
(c) Limitations on Indemnification Obligations. (i) The Selling Parties' indemnification obligations shall be limited in the aggregate to the aggregate of the Purchase Price in the Purchase Agreements and shall survive for a period of 36 months after the Closing Date, except for claims brought prior to such date, and except that the Selling Parties' indemnification obligation with respect to a breach of paragraphs 4.4 and 4.16 (taxes) of the Purchase Agreements and paragraph 4.10 (healthcare) of the Purchase Agreements shall survive for the greater of 36 months or the statute of limitations applicable to such claims, and the Selling parties' indemnification obligation with respect to a breach of paragraph 4.5 (title) of the Purchase Agreements shall survive the Closing Date without any time limitation. (ii) The Selling Parties' indemnification obligations in paragraph 1.1(b) above shall survive the Closing for the greater of 36 months or the statute of limitations for the making of such claims against the Seller, except for claims brought by the Buyer prior to such date, and such indemnification obligation shall not be capped or otherwise limited as to amount. (iii) Subject to paragraph 1.1(c)(i), the Selling Parties shall not be required to make any indemnification payment with respect to any breach of the Selling Parties' representations and warranties in paragraph 1.1(a)(i) until such time as the total amount of all damages have been directly or indirectly suffered or incurred by any one or more of the Buyer Indemnified Parties, or to which any one or more of the Buyer Indemnified Parties has or have otherwise become subject, exceeds one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00). If the total amount of such damages exceeds $100,000.00, the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to be indemnified against and compensated and reimbursed for the amount of such damages, exceeding $100,000.00. However, this paragraph 1.1(c)(iii) will not apply to any breach of any of the Selling Parties' representations and warranties of which any Selling Party had knowledge at any time prior to the date on which such representation and warranty is made or any intentional breach by any Selling Party of any covenant or obligation, and the Selling Parties will be jointly and severally liable for all damages with respect to such breaches. (iv) The right to indemnification based on the representations and warranties will not be affected by any investigation conducted with respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before or after execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of such representation and warranty, except that the Buyer will be charged with knowledge of any information disclosed on the Financial Statements or in the schedules delivered upon execution of the Purchase Agreements. 1.2 Indemnification of the Seller Indemnified Parties. The Buyer and Almost Family, jointly and severally, agree to indemnify, defend and hold the Selling Parties and its officers, directors, partners, shareholders, agents and attorneys (collectively, "Seller Indemnified Parties") harmless from and against, and reimburse the Seller Indemnified Parties on demand for, any damage, loss, cost or expense (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by a Seller Indemnified Party resulting from, or in any way related to, any of the
following: (i) any breach of the Buyer's representations, warranties or covenants in this Agreement, or from any misrepresentation in, or omission by the Buyer under this Agreement; (ii) any brokerage or similar fee due to any agent of the Buyer; (iii) any federal, state or local tax liability or obligation arising with respect to the Buyer or the operation of the Business after the Closing; (iv) any liability of the Buyer or liability with respect to which the Purchased Assets are subject to, or obligation under the Assumed Contracts or Assumed Leases in each case accruing after the Closing; and (v) Buyer's operation of the Business after the Closing. The indemnification obligations of the Seller Indemnified Parties shall be limited to the Purchase Price and shall survive for a 36 month period after Closing, except for claims brought prior to such date. 1.3 Procedure for Indemnification. The following procedure shall apply with respect to any claims or proceedings covered by the indemnification obligations in this Article 1. (a) The party who is seeking indemnification (the "Claimant") shall give written notice to the party from whom indemnification is sought (the "Indemnitor") promptly, but in no event greater than 10 business days, after the Claimant learns of the claim or proceeding; provided that the failure to give such notice shall not relieve the Indemnitor of its obligations hereunder if the Claimant uses its best efforts to mitigate Claimant's damages, except to the extent it is actually damaged thereby. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in the event that a Claimant gives notice to the Indemnitor within such 10 business day time period set forth above, the Claimant shall have no obligation to mitigate Claimant's damages under this paragraph 1.3(a). (b) With respect to any third-party claims or proceedings as to which the Claimant is entitled to indemnification, the Indemnitor shall have the right to select and employ counsel of its own choosing to defend against any such claim or proceeding, to assume control of the defense of such claim or proceeding, and to compromise, settle or otherwise dispose of the same, if the Indemnitor deems it advisable to do so, all at the expense of the Indemnitor; provided, however that the Claimant may employ counsel, of its own choosing, at its sole expense. The parties will fully cooperate in any such action, and shall make available to each other any books or records useful for the defense of any such claim or proceeding. The Claimant may elect to participate in the defense of any such third party claim, and may, at its sole expense, retain separate counsel in connection therewith. Subject to the foregoing the Claimant shall not settle or compromise any such third party claim without the prior consent of the Indemnitor, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. 1.4 Right of Setoff. (a) Upon notice to the Sellers specifying in reasonable detail the basis therefor, the Buyer may set off any amount to which it may be entitled under this Article 1 against amounts otherwise payable under the Purchase Note and against the shares of Almost Family, Inc. stock pledged pursuant to the Pledge Agreement between the Sellers and the Buyer, a copy of which is attached as Attachment A (the "Pledge Agreement"). The exercise of such right of setoff by the Buyer in good faith, whether or not ultimately determined to be justified, will not constitute an event of default under the Purchase Note. Health Management Consultants, Inc., Almost Family, Inc. and John B. Gallagher, Esq. shall enter into an Escrow Agreement at the Closing, a copy of which is attached as Attachment B (the "Escrow Agreement").
(b) Neither the exercise of nor the failure to exercise such right of setoff will constitute an election of remedies or limit the Buyer in any manner in the enforcement of any other remedies that may be available to it. (c) In the event a set off is appropriate, the Buyer shall set off against accrued and payable amounts of Contingent Consideration, the Purchase Note and the AFAM Shares in order of priority based on the amounts next payable to the Sellers.

THE PARTIES, INTENDING TO BE LEGALLY BOUND, AGREE AS FOLLOWS: 1. Grant of Security Interest. (a) As security for the faithful performance of the terms of this Agreement and to ensure the availability for delivery of the Pledged Shares (as defined below) upon exercise of the right to possession of the Pledged Shares upon an Event of Default as herein defined, Pledgor agrees to deliver to and deposit with John B.

Said documents are to be held by the Escrow Agent and delivered by the Escrow Agent only as directed and agreed in the Escrow Agreement attached hereto as Attachment B and which is hereby incorporated into this Agreement by reference (the "Escrow Agreement"). (b) The Pledgor hereby grants to the Secured Party a security interest in all of their right, title and interest in and to 100,000 shares of the common stock of Almost Family, Inc.

(b) The Pledgor has good title to the Pledged Shares, and the Pledged Shares are not subject to any lien, charge, pledge, encumbrance, claim or security interest. (c) The Pledgor has not entered into any stock restriction or purchase agreement with respect to the Pledged Shares which would in any way restrict the sale, pledge or other transfer of the Pledged Shares or of any interest in or to the Pledged Shares. 4. Duration of Security Interest. The Secured Party, and its successors and assigns, shall hold the security interest created hereby pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and this security interest shall continue until December 3, 2008, unless the Secured Party provides a written notice of Default

Maintaining Freedom from Liens. The Pledgor shall keep the Pledged Shares free and clear of liens and shall pay all amounts, including taxes, assessments or charges, which might result in a lien against the Pledged Shares if left unpaid, unless the Pledgor at its own expense are contesting such amount in good faith by an appropriate proceeding timely instituted which shall operate to prevent the collection or satisfaction of the lien or amount so contested. If the Pledgor fails to pay such amounts and are not contesting the validity or amount thereof in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence, the Secured Party may, but are not obligated to, pay such amounts, and such payment shall be conclusive evidence of the legality or validity thereof.

Certain Rights Respecting Pledged Shares. (a) The Pledgor shall continue to be the owners of the Pledged Shares so long as no Event of Default (as defined below) under the Secured Obligations or this Agreement has occurred and is continuing and may collect and retain all distributions now or hereafter payable on or on account of the Pledged Shares, and, so long as no Event of Default has occurred may exercise their voting rights with respect to the Pledged Shares. (b) The Pledgor shall not sell, transfer or encumber, or attempt to sell, transfer or encumber, the Pledged Shares, or any part thereof or interest therein, without the prior express written consent of the Secured Party. Any such consent of theirs shall not constitute the release by the Secured Party of its interest in the Pledged Interest, and any such sale, transfer or encumbrance consented to shall be so sold, transferred, or encumbered subject to the security interest of the Secured Party. (c) The Secured Party at its option upon the occurrence of any Event of Default and so long as such Event of Default exists may exercise all voting rights and privileges whatsoever with respect to the Pledged Shares, including, without limitation, the right to receive distributions. To that end, the Pledgor hereby grants the Secured Party a proxy and appoint the Secured Party as its attorney-in-fact for all purposes of voting the Pledged Shares at any annual regular or special meeting of the Company and this appointment shall be deemed coupled with an interest and is and shall be irrevocable until all of the Secured Obligations have been fully paid and terminated, and all persons whatsoever shall be conclusively entitled to rely upon oral or written certification of the Secured Party that it is entitled to vote the Pledged Shares hereunder.

The Secured Party acknowledges that it will not exercise any rights granted pursuant to this paragraph 6(c) unless an Event of Default has occurred and only so long as the Event of Default continues to exist.
7. Events of Default. At the option of the Secured Party, the happening of any of the following events shall constitute a default under this Agreement (each an "Event of Default"): (a) Failure of the Pledgor to pay any indemnity due the Secured Party pursuant to the Indemnification Agreement, which failure has not been fully corrected within thirty (30) days from the date of written notice given to the Pledgor of such failure; or (b) The creation of any lien in the Pledged Shares, without the prior written consent of the Secured Party; or (c) The sale or transfer of the Pledged Shares, or any part thereof or interest therein, without the prior written consent of the Secured Party. 8. Remedies. (a) Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, the Secured Party may at its option declare that part of the Pledged Shares, as is necessary to remedy the Default, to be immediately due and payable, and, in addition to exercising all other rights or remedies, proceed to exercise with respect to the Pledged Shares all rights, options and remedies of a secured party upon default as provided for under the Uniform Commercial Code as then adopted in the State of Florida. (b) The rights of the Secured Party upon the occurrence of an Event of Default shall include, without limitation, the following: (i) The right to request possession of Pledged Shares not then in the possession of the Secured Party, from the Escrow Agent, by the provisions set forth in the Escrow Agreement; and (ii) The right, after it obtains procession of the Pledged Shares under the Escrow Agreement, to sell the Pledged Shares at public or private sale in one or more lots.

(v) The right, after it obtains procession of the Pledged Shares under the Escrow Agreement, to transfer the Pledged Interest into the name of the Secured Party to facilitate its exercise of other rights or remedies with respect to them. 9. Exercise of Remedies.

Exhibit 99.2 INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT Board of Directors and Shareholders Mederi, Inc. and Subsidiaries Miami, Florida We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Mederi, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of June 30, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity (deficit) and cash flows for each of the three years ended June 30, 2006. The consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit includes consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Mederi, Inc. and Subsidiaries, as of June 30, 2006 and 2005, and the results of their operations and cash flows for each of the three years ended June 30, 2006 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 of notes to consolidated financial statements, the Company has reported working capital deficiency ($4,198,200) and equity deficiency ($3,450,000), and has experienced a net loss for the year ended June 30, 2006 of $760,800. The Company's current loss from operations and limited capital resources raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans concerning these matters are also described in Note 3 of notes to consolidated financial statements. The Company's ability to achieve the elements of its business plan, which may be necessary to permit the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course of business, is uncertain. To date the Company has been dependent on a major lender for debt financing. The Company's principal source of cash flows has been from net borrowings under the credit facility ($2,378,100). In addition, the Company is in default of it financing arrangements and its restrictive covenant. There is no assurance that this debtor would continue as a source of funds. No assurances can be given to the continued ability to obtain short or long-term borrowings to maintain the Company's present cash flow requirements. All these conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties. /S/ Hixson, Marin, DeSanctis & Company, P.A. North Miami Beach, Florida November 7, 2006, except for Note 11, subsequent event, the date is November 16, 2006
Basis of accounting: Mederi, Inc. and Subsidiaries prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. This basis of accounting involves the application of accrual accounting; consequently, revenues and gains are recognized when earned, and expenses and losses are recognized when incurred. Financial statement items are recorded at historical cost and often involve the utilization of estimates. Consequently, financial statement items do not necessarily represent current values. Management estimates: The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Certain amounts included in the consolidated financial statements are estimated based on currently available information and management's judgment as to the outcome of future conditions and circumstances. Changes in the status of certain facts or circumstances could result in material changes to the estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions. Every effort is made to ensure the integrity of such estimates. Fair value of financial instruments: The carrying amounts of cash and equivalents, receivables, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, loans and notes payable approximate their fair values because of the short duration of these instruments. Impairment of long-lived assets: Long-lived assets used by the Company are reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Principals of consolidation: The consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of Mederi, Inc. and all material subsidiaries under common control. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has issued an interpretation of FASB 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (VIE). The FASB has re-defined entities which are to be included in a consolidation. Those additional types of enterprises would include a VIE that has equity that is insufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordination financial support from other parties, through either debt or equity. Under this definition, the Company has included all related entities as part of these consolidated financial statements to conform with the Interpretation of FASB 46, an interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) 51. Revenue recognition: The Company has agreements with Medicare and other health insurers whereby services are rendered at established rates. Under the agreements, the Company is paid through a prospective payment system (PPS) for services rendered based on an episode or continuing episodes. The PPS episode includes a sixty-(60) day period, with a split payment at the beginning of the episode based on anticipated levels of service to be provided, and the final payment after completion of the episode, adjusted for actual service provided. The per episode payment rates vary depending on the patient's clinical severity, functional status and service utilization. Revenues earned under PPS are recognized ratably over the defined episode period. Ancillary charges are not earned separately, but are included with the defined episode. All other revenues are recognized as earned, less adjustments.
Revenue recognition (continued): During the cycle of patient care (which includes the sixty (60) day term of the episode and until the time that the final payment is received), if the initially anticipated care differs from the actual care provided, contractual allowances known as Low Utilization Payment Adjustment (LUPA) are made to both the patient receivable and revenues, based on the difference between anticipated charges and actual charges. Subsequent to the sixty (60)-day term of the episode after final patient reports are submitted, other adjustments may occur, which may result in a Partial Episode Payment (PEP). PEP's occur when a patient is discharged before they completed the full episode, and prior to expiration of the sixty (60)-day episode terms, they are admitted for a new episode. Medicare detects that the new episode overlaps the prior, and charges back for the unfulfilled portion of the original episode. Since final payment has already been made, Medicare offsets the amount of the adjustment against other payments being made to the client at the time of the PEP, at which point adjustment is made to revenues to reflect the decrease. Since PEPs occur after the 60-day episode revenue recognition cycle, annual provisions are made for anticipated PEPs, based on the historical experience of the Company. The Medicare billing process allows for future review and adjustments to payments due and/or payments made. It is reasonable to expect that Medicare will make adjustments in subsequent periods, which will have an impact on revenues. Any adjustments to revenues resulting from these subsequent reviews by Medicare will be charged or credited to revenues when they occur. Cash and equivalents: The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an initial maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Inventories: Inventories of medical supplies are stated at the lower of cost (first-in; first-out) or market. Furniture, fixtures, equipment and depreciation: Furniture, fixtures and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is being provided by the use of the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets ranging from seven (7) to ten (10) years. Repairs and maintenance are charged to operations as incurred, and expenditures for significant betterments and renewals are capitalized. The cost of fixed assets retired or sold, together with the related accumulated depreciation, are removed from the appropriate asset and depreciation accounts, and the resulting gain or loss is included in the consolidated statements of operations and deficit. Profit sharing plan: The Company maintains a discretionary profit sharing plan covering all eligible employees. The Company funds pension costs as accrued. Advertising: Costs of advertising are charged to operations as incurred. Intangible: Loan origination costs are capitalized and amortized to operations, on the straight-line method over the life of the loan of five (5) years.
Income taxes: The Parent Company (Mederi, Inc.) and a majority of its subsidiaries are regular C type corporations. Accordingly, Mederi, Inc. and a majority of its subsidiaries account for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards Number 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" (SFAS 109). SFAS 109 utilizes an asset and liability approach, and deferred taxes are determined based on the estimated future tax effect of differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted rates. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enacting rate. A valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized. The Company has other subsidiaries which have elected to be treated as an `S' corporation under the Internal Revenue Code and, accordingly, the shareholders have consented to include their pro rata share of income or loss and any tax credits on their U.S. Individual Income Tax Return. For income tax purposes, the Company uses accelerated methods of depreciation. Accounting pronouncements: The Company has adopted various new standards as promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) through the issuance of Statements of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS). The Company also adopted various new Statements of Position (SOP) issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Except for the impact of FASB 46, adoption of these various new FASB's and SOP's did not have an impact on the Company's combined financial statements.
1. Organization and business: Mederi, Inc. was organized and incorporated under the laws of the State of Florida on March 2, 1982. The majority of its subsidiaries were also incorporated under the laws of the State of Florida in various years between 1982 and 2004. The Company has other subsidiaries, which were incorporated in the States of Illinois and Missouri in the years 1984 and 1995. The Company operates under the trade names "Mederi Home Health Care" and "United Home Health Services". Approximately 81% of the consolidated revenues are generated within the State of Florida and the balance between the States of Illinois and Missouri. The Company is a home health care provider. The Company provides, through employed and contracted arrangements for the services of Registered Nurses, Licensed Practical Nurses, Physical Therapists, Speech Language Pathologists, Occupational Therapists, Medical Social Workers and Home Health Aides. For financial statement purposes, the Company maintains it books and records with a fiscal year ending June 30. For income tax purposes, certain subsidiaries report on a calendar year basis ending on December 31. Accordingly, the Company annually records memorandum entries to convert the reporting period from December to June. During the year 2000, the Company and its subsidiaries filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. The Company filed, as debtor in possession and through the succeeding months was successful in its plan of reorganization, and emerged from Chapter 11 during the later part of the year 2000. Through the emergence of the filing, the Company entered into a Settlement Agreement with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (Medicare) regarding "Determined Overpayments" made by Medicare to the Company. Total overpayments claimed by Medicare amounted to approximately $2.415 million. In addition, any "Additional Overpayments" detected subsequent to the date of the Settlement Agreement relating to Medicare services provided prior to October 1, 2000, would also be subject to the Settlement Agreement, so long as the Additional Overpayments does not exceed a cap of $2.0million. Under the terms of the Settlement Agreement the Company agreed to reimburse Medicare $936,000for the first year and $1,040,000per annum thereafter for the "Determined Overpayments". The Company has satisfied the Settlement Agreement regarding "Determined Overpayments" of approximately $2.415 million with final payment being made in March 2003. In accordance with the Settlement Agreement, Medicare has subsequently determined "Additional Overpayments" in the net amount of approximately $1.893 million. On June 20, 2005, the company began making weekly payments of $10,000(including interest) towards the Additional Overpayments, and at year end (June 30, 2006) the obligation had been reduced to approximately $1.575 million. The Company is presently in negotiations with Medicare to arrive at a discounted lump-sum payoff amount. Recent memoranda from Medicare indicate Medicare's willingness to accept a discounted lump-sum payoff amount, however no final determination of a reduced amount has yet been agreed upon. Regardless of the possible reduction, the Company recorded Medicare's determined amount of "Additional Overpayments" at the full amount of approximately $1.893 million. If a settlement were reached, operations would be credited for any reduction in the proposed settlement.
1. Organization and business (continued): The Company emerged from bankruptcy protection during October 2000. In the initial settlement of Determined Overpayments of $2.415 million, which has been fully liquidated in 2003, the Company was not charged the full interest by Medicare. The amount of any unpaid interest on the original Determined Overpayments has not been determined or accrued in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Medicare finalized the final determination of the Additional Overpayments in June 2005. In that final report, Medicare realized the outstanding balance due from that date forward. In its report, Medicare did not accrue any interest from the date of the Additional Overpayments to June 2005, the commencement date of the new amortization of the Additional Overpayments. From June 2005 interest on the outstanding balance due Medicare has been accrued. No interest has been accrued to June 2005 in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The Company may be contingently liable for the outstanding interest in an amount, which has not been determined for the Determined and Additional Overpayments. 2. Discontinued operations: During the year ended June 30, 2006, the Company closed a few of its offices, located in Florida. Due to a proposed sale of the Company assets (read Note 11 on subsequent event), management has elected to reflect the closed units as discontinued operations. Below is a table summarizing the net (loss) income resulting from the discontinued units for each of the three years ended June 30, 2006:
3. Going concern, liquidity/ working capital: The Company has a working capital deficiency of approximately $4,198,200as of June 30, 2006, which represented an increase in the working capital deficiency of $1,436,400from 2005. The working capital deficiency increased $1,140,400from 2004 to 2005. The working capital deficiency results primarily from deferred revenues, which are amortized to the succeeding year. The shareholders' equity deficiency is also impacted by the amount of deferred revenues and by the amount of dividends and distributions made to the shareholders. During the year ended June 30, 2006, cash flow used in operations exceeded $1,319,700. During the years ended June 30, 2005 and 2004, the Company had cash flows from operations of $873,200for 2005 and $1,534,900for 2004. During the year ended June 30, 2006, the principal source of cash flows has been through financing activities. As of June 30, 2006, the Company is non-compliant with the fixed charge coverage ratio. The minimum fixed charge coverage ratio is 1.25:1. At June 30, 2006, the fixed charge coverage ratio was a negative 2.21:1, which included the credit facility. Therefore, the Company is in default under the Credit Facility. Under existing circumstances, there is no assurance that current operations would improve and there are no assurances that the primary lender would continue to fund under the current financing agreement. While the lender has not ceased its funding while in default, during the subsequent period, there is no assurance that the Credit Facility would not be called and funding stopped. Management will institute plans to improve its operating costs in order to improve its operations. Those plans include closing certain loss locations, reducing overhead and home office expenses. To date the Company has closed a few locations. There are no assurances that the plans of management would be successful. Under these circumstances, there is substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. 4. Concentration of credit risk and dependency: Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and receivables. During the year, the Company's account balance with financial institutions exceeded federally insured limits of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and other agencies. While the Company's cash deposits are in excess of federally insured limits as of June 30, 2006 and 2005, management regularly monitors their balances and attempts to keep this potential risk to a minimum by maintaining their accounts with financial institutions they believe are of good quality. The Company has a concentration of credit risk with respect to patient receivables, as 95.5% are due from Medicare. The Company is not allowed to accept any collateral from its customers. The Company maintains an allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable based upon expected collectibility of all accounts receivable. In addition, the Company provides annual provisions for PEP's. During the year ended June 30, 2005, Medicare determined additional PEP adjustments for the years 2005, 2004 and earlier. These catch-up adjustments determined by Medicare have been recorded in the appropriate periods. It is the opinion of management that historical PEP adjustments have been recorded and have stabilized. Based on the historical experience of the Company the provision has not changed. Therefore, no additional credit losses beyond amounts provided for collection losses are believed inherent in the Company's accounts receivable.

5. Details of financial statement components (continued): Accrued liabilities: 2006 2005 ------------------- ------------------ Compensation $ 629,700 $ 619,600 Employee benefit programs 536,200 555,700 PEP Reserves 150,000 150,000 ------------------- ------------------ $ 1,315,900 $ 1,325,300 =================== ================== 6. Credit facility: On October 18, 2005, the Company and all of its subsidiaries and affiliates entered into a financing commitment with a financial institution. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company entered into a Revolving Line of Credit (Credit Facility) of $4 million. The Credit Facility has a term of five (5) years from closing maturing in October 2010. The Credit Facility is collateralized by a first priority perfected security interest in all the accounts and other collateral of the Company. No liens, other than those approved by the lender will be permitted on the collateral. Interest under the Credit Facility is the Wall Street Journal Prime (8.25% at June 30, 2006) plus two and one half percent (2.5%). If any event of default occurs and continues an additional default rate of 3% shall be added to the interest rate until the event of default is cured or waived. The effective rate will be adjusted weekly in accordance with changes in the prime. Total interest charged to operations amounted to $205,800for the year ended June 30, 2006. The effective interest rate charged during the current period, which includes the default rate and unused line fee was about 14.7% on an annualized basis. No waivers have been granted. During the first year, interest shall be computed based on a floor of $1.5 million advance or the actual amount outstanding over the floor; for the second year the floor lowers to $1.0million advance and thereafter it will be computed on the actual amount outstanding. Additional interest for the Unused Credit Facility line fee of one-half of one percent (1/2%) will be charged on a monthly basis. The Unused Credit Facility is the difference between the Revolving Loan Commitment and the greater of (i) the average daily outstanding balance during each month, or (ii) the minimum balance of $1.5 million. Unused Credit Facility line fee charged to operations for the year ended June 30, 2006 was about $7,200. Should the Credit Facility be terminated by the Company or the lender after the occurrence of an Event of Default, the Company shall unconditionally pay a termination fee of 3% of the Revolving Loan Commitment ($4 million), if the early termination occurs on or prior to the first anniversary (October 18, 2006); 2% for the second anniversary date and 1/2% thereafter. While the Company is in default of the Credit Facility, the lender has not terminated the Facility due to the Event of Default and the Termination Fee of $120,000has not been accrued for the year ended June 30, 2006. Subsequent to the balance sheet date, the lender continues to fund under the terms of the Credit Facility. Proceeds from the Credit Facility should have been used to terminate all credit facilities secured by any of the collateral. Thereafter, the Facility will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. The borrowing minimum base is $1.5 million, with a maximum of $4.0 million. Collections of all receivables shall be made to a demand deposit bank account and swept daily to the lender (lock box). The lending base amount is determined at eighty-five percent (85%) of qualified receivables. The Company has paid a commitment fee of 1% ($40,000) in addition to various other costs. Total origination costs of the Credit Facility amounted to approximately $186,900. The borrower will reimburse the lender all costs associated with annual verifications of the collateral.
6. Credit facility (continued): The Company will be required to meet various affirmative and negative covenants. Financial covenants will include the following: 1. Fixed charge coverage ratio. On a quarterly basis, the fixed charge coverage ratio shall not be less than 1.25:1.00. Fixed charge coverage ratio is defined as the ratio of EBITDA less withdrawals over the sum of interest, current maturities of long-term debt and capitalized leases. This ratio shall commence with the quarter ending December 31, 2005. Each quarter thereafter shall be rolling with the preceding quarter until the September 2006 when the measurement period will be on a four quarter rolling basis. EBITDA is equal to the sum of net income (loss) plus interest, income taxes (excluding deferred taxes), depreciation and amortization. Withdrawals include dividends, distributions, payments of subordinated debt and advances and loans to officers and affiliates. 2. Other covenants shall include: A. Prohibition on the change of business; B. Prohibition on the change of shareholders; C. Prohibition of additional liens without lender approval; D. Prohibition on declaring or paying withdrawals, which would result in an event of default; E. Cross collateralization to all indebtedness; F. Limitation on additional debt, including contingencies, without approval of the lender; G. Restrictions on mergers and acquisitions without lender approval; H. Restrictions on any asset disposition, other than in the normal course of business; I. Annual reviewed financial statements no later than October 31 of each year in accordance with generally accepted principles of accounting. This would include quarterly compiled financial statements and annual projected financial statements. 3. The shareholders shall enter into a subordination agreement. 7. Due to Medicare: Under the previous Medicare program, which ended in 2000, the Company was entitled to reimbursements of reasonable costs as defined in the applicable regulations and contract of services rendered to patients. At June 30, 2005, cumulative payments received from Medicare exceeded prior cost reimbursements submitted in accordance with those regulations and agreements in existence in the past. It is management's opinion that the amounts reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets would not be materially different from those finally determined, with the exception of a possible lump sum payoff discount. The amounts due the Medicare Program are still outstanding and are being repaid under an approved repayment plan of $10,000 per week, which includes interest at approximately 12.0%. Total principal payments to Medicare amount to $298,400for the year ended June 30, 2006 and $20,000 for the year ended June 30, 2005. Interest charged to operations as a result of the Medicare payments amounted to $211,600 for the year ended June 30, 2006. There was no interest charged to operations for Medicare payments for the year ended June 30, 2005. Amounts due Medicare are deemed current, irrespective of any payment plan presently existing. As disclosed in Note 1, the Company may be contingently liable for possible outstanding interest in an amount, which has not been determined for Determined Overpayments to 2003 and for Additional Overpayments from 2003 to 2005.
Maturities of long-term debt subsequent to June 30, 2006 are as follows: Years Ended June 30, Amount 2007 $ 472,700 2008 226,900 ------------------ $ 699,600 ================== 9. Income taxes: The Company files a consolidated tax return of all "C" type corporations. The accompanying provisions and allowances for income taxes, both current and deferred, are based upon the operations of the "C" type corporations only. No provisions or allowance for income taxes are determined on those "S" type corporations, as the shareholders have consented to include those gains on their personal income tax returns. At June 30, 2006, the Company had available federal net operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income of approximately $2,474,100, which expires in 2021. These net operating loss carryforwards can only and are only being utilized by the "C" type corporations. A valuation allowance would have been provided when it is more likely than not that the tax benefit may not be realized. As disclosed under subsequent event, the pending sale of assets would result in the full utilization of the deferred tax asset; therefore, a valuation allowance is not required.
9. Income taxes (continued): 10. Profit sharing plan: The Company maintains qualified retirement plans known as the Mederi Small Corp Profit Sharing Plan, Mederi of Palm Beach City Profit Sharing Plan, and Mederi of Broward Profit Sharing Plan. The employer contributes to the plan annually, on a discretionary basis. Qualified employees may participate after completion of one (1) year of service (defined as 1,000hours), with vesting occurring between 3 and 7 years of service on a graduating rate from 20% after year 3 to 100% after year 7. Annual contributions are allocated among participants eligible to share in the contribution for that plan year. The last contribution made by the employer was on June 30, 1998. The plan assets are held by a financial institution, in three accounts under the names of each plan. Total plan assets at June 30, 2006 are approximately $3,839,600and the total plan assets at June 30, 2005 were $3,747,800, and are invested in various securities in the bank's pooled asset funds. There are presently 218 present and former employees covered by the plans. There were no contributions to the plan for the years 2006, 2005 and 2004. For the year ended June 30, 2006, the Plans earned $277,400, incurred investment and administrative fee of $32,700and made distributions of $152,900. The Plan assets are not included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 11. Subsequent event, commitments and contingencies: Sale of Company assets: On November 15, 2006, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Almost Family, Inc. for the sale of all the assets of the Company used in its business (the purchased assets). They include, but are not limited to certain assumed leases, tangible personal property, goodwill, all accounts receivable and unbilled work in process and other various types of intangibles. Certain leases within the State of Florida will not be assumed which leases will be terminated by January 31, 2007. From the date of closing to January 31, 2007 the purchaser, will reimburse the Company the cost of occupancy. The sale price ranges from $19 million to about $24.5 million. Under the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Company will receive cash at closing of $12.2 million; a promissory note of $4 million and 100,000common shares of Almost Family, Inc. The Promissory Note will consist of two (2) notes. One for $1 million and the second for $3 million. The Notes bear interest at 6%, with interest payable quarterly. The principal amounts and all accrued interest shall be paid in full on May 15, 2009. Almost Family, Inc. is the guarantor to the Promissory Notes. The shares shall be unregistered shares, shall be restricted securities under Rule 144, and must satisfy the Rule 144 holding period requirement of twelve (12) months before being tradable upon satisfaction of all Rule 144 requirements. The market value of the restricted shares on November 15, 2006 the closing price of $27.22 per share or a fair value of $2,722,000. The number of common shares to be issued, at closing, shall be adjusted as follows: (a) if the price of the shares fall between $22 and $26 then 100,000common shares will be issued; (b) if the common share price falls below $22 then 109,091 shares will be issued; (c) if the price of the shares is greater than $26 then 92,308 shares will be issued. Share value will be determined based on the average closing for the five trading days preceding the announcement of the transaction. In addition, the Company will be entitled to contingent consideration with respect to three (3) separate earn out categories based on the satisfaction of certain benchmarks. The total contingent consideration could range in the area of $5,475,000. The benchmarks for the contingent consideration include (1) a one year integration, (2) a one year employee retention and (3) revenue earn outs for the years 2007 and 2008, with 2006 calendar year as the base for 2007 and 2007 as the base for 2008. The closing is scheduled for December 3, 2006. Third party rate adjustments: Current laws and regulations governing the Medicare program are extremely complex and subject to interpretation. As a result, there is at least a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates may change by material amounts in the near future. These changes result from detected differences in billing amounts based on anticipated services as compared to the actual services provided (Medicare adjustments); subsequent review and re-evaluation of charges to detect the possible under/over billings by the Company to Medicare (internal procedures). In the opinion of management, the Company has adequately provided for these third party adjustments.
11. Subsequent event, commitments and contingencies (continued): Commitments: The Company leases various facilities in Florida, Illinois and Missouri under non-cancelable operating leases having terms expiring between 2006 and 2011. The facilities have renewal options, exercisable at the option of the Company and do not contain provisions for contingent rentals based upon a percentage of gross revenues. The basic rent is adjusted annually for the increase in the Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers for certain leases. The Company also leases various equipment, which are non-capitalized leases and are on a month-to-month basis. Future minimum lease payments on the non-cancelable leases, excluding sales tax, for the years subsequent to 2006 are as follows: Years Ending Other June 30, Total Florida States --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2007 $ 611,600 $ 518,500 $ 93,100 2008 343,400 255,800 87,600 2009 198,700 155,900 42,800 2010 50,600 48,300 2,300 2011 15,000 15,000 - ----------------------------------------------------- $ 1,219,300 $ 993,500 $ 225,800 ===================================================== Litigation: From time to time, the Company is a defendant in proceedings concerning various medical and employment matters.

Exhibit 99.3 UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONSOLDIATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION The unaudited pro forma consolidated statements of income for the nine months ended September 30, 2006 and the year ended December 31, 2005 give effect to Almost Family, Inc.'s (the Company) acquisition of the home health assets of Mederi, Inc. (Mederi) in an asset acquisition completed December 3, 2006, as if the transaction had occurred at the beginning of the periods presented. The unaudited pro forma consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2006, gives effect to the acquisition as if the transaction had occurred on September 30, 2006. The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information should be read in conjunction with the Company's historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information may not necessarily reflect the financial position or results of operations which would have been obtained if these transactions had been consummated on the dates indicated in the unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information. The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial data are based on preliminary estimates and assumptions set forth in the notes to such information that we believe are reasonable. Pro forma adjustments are necessary to reflect the estimated purchase price and changes in our capital structure and to adjust amounts related to Mederi's assets and liabilities to a preliminary estimate of their fair values. Pro forma adjustments are also necessary to reflect interest expense and the income tax effects related to the pro forma adjustments. The pro forma adjustments and allocation of purchase price are preliminary and are based on management's estimates of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The final purchase price allocation will be completed after asset and liability valuations are finalized. This final valuation will be based on the actual assets and liabilities of Mederi that exist as of the date of the completion of the transaction. Any final adjustments may change the allocation of purchase price which could affect the fair value assigned to the assets and liabilities and could result in a change to the unaudited pro forma consolidated financial data. In addition, the impact of integration activities could cause material differences in the information presented. The unaudited pro forma financial information is presented for informational purposes only and are based on certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable and do not purport to represent our financial condition or our results of operations had the business combination occurred on or as of the dates noted above nor are they necessarily indicative of future consolidated financial position or results of operations.

ALMOST FAMILY, INC. UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME For the Year Ended December 31, 2005
ALMOST FAMILY, INC. NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION NOTE 1 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION The accompanying unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information is presented on a basis consistent with the Company's historical consolidated financial statements. NOTE 2 - PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS The following pro forma adjustments are reflected in the accompanying unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information: (a) To record the pro forma interest expense on funds borrowed to finance the acquisition. (b) To record the pro forma provision for income taxes based on pro forma pretax income (loss) based upon each period's consolidated combined state and Federal effective tax rate. (c) To reflect shares of the Company's common stock issued to the sellers. (d) To remove assets retained by the seller. (e) To record anticipated intangible assets based on the Company's preliminary purchase price allocation. The purchase price has not been allocated to specific intangible assets in the unaudited pro forma consolidated balance sheet (and there is no corresponding amortization expense recorded) because the company is in the process of determining the fair vale of such assets. The final purchase price allocation will be completed after asset and liability valuations are finalized. (f) To record estimated transaction costs and fees incurred in completion of the transaction. (g) To remove specific debt instruments not assumed by the buyer. (h) To record advances made on the Company's revolving credit facility to fund the cash portion of the purchase price. (i) To record the issuance of notes payable to the seller. (j) To eliminate the shareholders equity section of the sellers' balance sheet.
NOTE 3 - ADDITIONAL INFORMATION The pro forma adjustments reflected in the accompanying unaudited pro forma financial information and outlined in Note 2 reflect only those permissible under the rules and regulation of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. As previously disclosed by the Company when the transaction was announced, the Company's plans for integrating the acquired operations are as follows: o combination of eight Mederi locations with Almost Family locations in overlapping service territories; and o elimination of substantially all of Mederi's Miami FL corporate office overhead with relatively small corresponding additions to Almost Family's Louisville KY corporate office overhead. With these two steps, the Company expects to eliminate approximately $850,000 of operating expenses net of additional corporate management expenses annually. As indicated in Note 12 to the accompanying audited financial statements of Mederi, Inc., Mederi's corporate overhead expenses, exclusive of interest expense were approximately $3.1 million and $2.4 million for the years ended June 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Additional consideration of up to $5.5 million in cash may be paid to the seller contingent primarily upon the achievement of certain revenue targets in the two years following the closing. No accrual has been provided in the unaudited pro forma financial information.

Exhibit 99.1 ALMOST FAMILY ANNOUNCES QUARTERLY AND YEAR END RESULTS FY 2006 EPS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS UP 67% OVER 2005, EXCLUDING ONE-TIME ITEMS LOUISVILLE, Ky., March 12 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Almost Family, Inc. (Nasdaq: AFAM) today announced its operating results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2006.

William B. Yarmuth, AFAM's Chairman and CEO commented on the results: "We are extremely pleased to report our fourth quarter results. Excluding 2005 one-time items our diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 63%. All three prongs of our growth strategy: 1) same store sales growth, 2) startups and 3) acquisitions continue to contribute significantly to our performance. In 2006 we were once again able to dramatically improve our earnings per share and EBITDA, complete acquisitions with a combined annual revenue run rate of over $30 million, generate meaningful internal revenue growth and still exit the year with substantial financial capacity to fuel continued future growth." "In 2006 our shareholders saw an unprecedented increase in the value of their investment. This is a direct result of the continued commitment and dedication of all our employees, and I thank them sincerely for their outstanding efforts." Quarterly Discussion Net Income From Continuing Operations -- As Reported grew 10% to $1,395,586 or $0.26 per diluted share for the December 2006 quarter as compared to $1,272,396 or $0.24 per diluted share in the December 2005 quarter (which including a net gain on litigation settlement of $267,426 or $0.05 per diluted share and the effect of revised state income tax valuation allowances of $152,671 or $0.03 per diluted share). Revenues grew 36% to $26.2 million in the December 2006 quarter from $19.2 million in the December 2005 quarter. The quarter ended December 2006 included approximately $2 million of revenue from the Mederi acquisition completed December 3, 2006.
Revenues in the Company's "Caretenders" Visiting Nurse (VN) segment grew 63% over the same period last year. Acquired operations contributed approximately $3.7 million of that revenue growth. The $2.8 million balance of the VN revenue increase came from internal growth. Net income including discontinued operations, was $1,469,065 or $0.27 per diluted share in the quarter ended December 31, 2006 and $1,483,036 or $0.28 per diluted share in 2005. Results of operations for the quarters ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 are set forth in the tables below:
Year End Results Net Income From Continuing Operations -- As Reported grew 45% to $4,273,526 or $0.80 per diluted share for the year ended December 2006 as compared to $2,950,607 or $0.57 per diluted share in 2005 (which included a net gain on litigation settlement of $267,426 or $0.05 per diluted share and the effect of revised state income tax valuation allowances of $152,671 or $0.03 per diluted share). Revenues grew 22% to $91.8 million in 2006 from $75.1 million in 2005. Revenues in the VN segment grew 39% over the same period last year. Acquired operations contributed approximately $6.1 million of that revenue growth. The $9.4 million balance of the VN revenue increase came from internal growth. Net income including discontinued operations, was $4,239,444 or $0.80 per diluted share in the year ended December 31, 2006 and $7,868,468 or $1.51 per diluted share (including a gain on the sale of the adult day care segment of $5,205,698 or $2.00 per diluted share) in 2005. Results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 are set forth in the tables below:
Non-GAAP Financial Measure The information provided in the tables in this release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined under Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules. In accordance with SEC rules, the Company has provided, in the supplemental information and the footnotes to the tables, a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Net Income From Continuing Operations -- As Adjusted Although "Net Income From Continuing Operations -- As Adjusted" is a non- GAAP financial measure, management believes that the presentation of net income as calculated using a normalized tax rate, which, for 2005, excludes the nonrecurring tax benefits as described in Note 1, and excluding the litigation settlement gain as described in Note 2, is a useful adjunct to "Net Income From Continuing Operations -- As Reported" under GAAP because it measures the Company's financial performance in a consistent manner between the results for the fourth quarters and fiscal years 2006 and 2005 and since these adjustments represent special or non-recurring items. For these reasons, management believes that "Net Income From Continuing Operations -- As Adjusted" is useful to investors. Investors should not view "Net Income From Continuing Operations -- As Adjusted" as an alternative to the GAAP measure of net income. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of Net Income From Continuing Operations -- As Reported to Net Income From Continuing Operations -- As Adjusted:
Note 1: The Company's income tax provision for 2005 included a one-time reduction of $152,671 or $0.03 per diluted share resulting from changes in state income tax valuation allowances relating to the anticipated realization of net operating loss carry-forwards. Note 2: In December 2005, the Tennessee Court of Appeals issued its ruling in the Franklin Litigation, a long contested contract case dating back to 1994. The court partially overturned the findings of the trial court thus lowering the amount of damages previously assessed to and recorded by the Company. The Company and the plaintiff subsequently entered into a settlement agreement on this case which resulted in a one-time net of tax gain of $267,426 or $0.05 per diluted share being recorded in the Company's results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2005.
EBITDA: EBITDA is defined as income before depreciation and amortization, net interest expense and income taxes. EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. It should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income, operating income, cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities, or any other measure calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The items excluded from EBITDA are significant components in understanding and evaluating financial performance and liquidity. Management routinely calculates and communicates EBITDA and believes that it is useful to investors because it is commonly used as an analytical indicator within our industry to evaluate performance, measure leverage capacity and debt service ability, and to estimate current or prospective enterprise value. EBITDA is also used in measurements of borrowing availability and certain covenants contained in our credit agreement. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of Continuing Operations Net Income -- As Adjusted to EBITDA - As Adjusted:
Sale of ADC Operations On September 30, 2005 the Company sold its ADC operating segment resulting in an after tax gain of approximately $5.1 million or $0.97 per diluted share reported in the year ended December 31, 2005. Almost Family, Inc. TM and subsidiaries (collectively "Almost Family") is a leading regional provider of home health services. The Company has service locations in Florida, Kentucky, Ohio, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Missouri, Alabama, Illinois and Indiana and (in order of revenue significance). Contact: William Yarmuth or Steve Guenthner (502) 891-1000. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, included in this news release, including the objectives and expectations of management for future operating results, the Company's ability to accelerate growth in its home health operations, the Company's ability to achieve expected cost savings net of incremental overhead post-acquisition, the ultimate outcome of the Company's allocation of purchase price to amortizable intangible assets, the Company's ability to generate positive cash flows, and the Company's expectations with regard to market conditions, are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on the Company's current expectations. Although the Company believes that the expectations expressed or implied in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, there can be no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. Because forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, the Company's actual results could differ materially. The potential risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially include: regulatory approvals or third party consents may not be obtained, the impact of further changes in healthcare reimbursement systems, including the ultimate outcome of potential changes to Medicaid reimbursement due to state budget shortfalls; the ability of the Company to maintain its level of operating performance and achieve its cost control objectives; changes in our relationships with referral sources; the ability of the Company to integrate acquired operations; government regulation; health care reform; pricing pressures from Medicare, Medicaid and other third-party payers; changes in laws and interpretations of laws relating to the healthcare industry, and the Company's self-insurance risks. For a more complete discussion regarding these and other factors which could affect the Company's financial performance, refer to the Company's Securities and Exchange Commission filing on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005, in particular information under the headings "Special Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" and "Risk Factors." The Company disclaims any intent or obligation to update its forward-looking statements.

Almost Family Announces Record First Quarter 2007 Results
EPS from Continuing Operations up 74% over 2006, Net Income up 97%
 
Louisville, KY  Almost Family, Inc. (NASDAQ:AFAM) today announced its operating results for the quarter ended March 31, 2007.
 
First Quarter 2007 Highlights
 
William B. Yarmuth, AFAM's Chairman and CEO commented on the results:
 
"We are extremely pleased to report our first quarter results in which continuing EPS increased by 74%. This is the first full quarter including the Mederi operations acquired in early December 2006. We've been very happy with the commitment and loyalty demonstrated by all our employees and our referral sources as we transition the largest acquisition, so far, in the history of our Company. Our integration work is on track and the acquisition has more than met our expectations for first quarter performance. Perhaps more exciting than our acquisition results, our same store revenues grew 27% from last year which we take as a reflection of the market's affirmation of our high level of quality care."
 
The Company noted that the quarter's results also include the operations of a Jacksonville, FL home health agency acquired in mid-January. Additionally, in January 2007, the Company completed a 2-for-1 stock split. All share and per share information included in this release has been adjusted to give effect to the split for all periods presented. The number of weighted average shares outstanding for purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share increased 6% between periods.
 
On April 27, 2007 the Federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) published proposed regulations for Medicare reimbursement for home health services for 2008. CMS is seeking public comment and will consider those comments along with other information prior to publishing final regulations later this year. The Company noted in its May 1, 2007 release on this topic that the proposed regulations are extensive and it will take some time for its staff to analyze them and estimate, if enacted in their current form, the impact these changes would have on its home health agencies.
 
 
 
 
Quarterly Discussion
 
Net Income From Continuing Operations grew 85% to $1,716,168 or $0.30 per diluted share for the March 2007 quarter as compared to $927,650 or $0.18 per diluted share in the March 2006 quarter. Revenues grew 56% to $31.9 million in the March 2007 quarter from $20.5 million in the March 2006 quarter. Revenues in the Company's "Caretenders" Visiting Nurse (VN) segment grew 94% over the same period last year.
 
VN Revenue Comparison
Due to the significant impact of acquisition activities on VN revenue growth, the following tables are presented comparing revenue growth by market type for the quarters ended March 31, 2007 and 2006:
 
 
VN revenues grew approximately $11.2 million between years of which 58% came from newly acquired markets, 18% came in markets with in-market acquisitions and 24% came from markets with no acquisition impact.
 
The following table provides a comparison of revenues related specifically to the Mederi acquisition (excludes all markets not impacted by the Mederi acquisition):
 
 
Markets with acquisitions not related to Mederi generated $1,408,224 of revenue in the quarter ended March 31, 2007 as compared to $465,199 in 2006.
 
As noted in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006, our Visiting Nurse segment operations located in Florida normally experience higher admissions during the March quarter than in the other quarters due to seasonal population fluctuations.
 
 
 
 
Results of operations for the quarters ended March 31, 2007 and 2006 are set forth in the tables below:
 
(1) shares adjusted to give effect to 2-for-1 share split completed in January 2007
 
Net income including discontinued operations, was $1,666,292 or $0.30 per diluted share in the quarter ended March 31, 2007 and $845,663 or $0.16 per diluted share in 2006. During the quarter ended March 31, 2007, the Company closed its personal care operations in Cincinnati OH and Ft. Myers FL and reclassified the results of those operations to discontinued operations for all periods presented. Revenues from discontinued operations were approximately $164,000 and $283,000 in the quarters ended March 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
 
Non-GAAP Financial Measure
The information provided in the tables in this release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined under Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules. In accordance with SEC rules, the Company has provided, in the supplemental information and the footnotes to the tables, a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.

The potential risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially include: regulatory approvals or third party consents may not be obtained, the impact of further changes in healthcare reimbursement systems, including the ultimate outcome of potential changes to Medicaid reimbursement due to state budget shortfalls; the ability of the Company to maintain its level of operating performance and achieve its cost control objectives; changes in our relationships with referral sources; the ability of the Company to integrate acquired operations; government regulation; health care reform; pricing pressures from Medicare, Medicaid and other third-party payers; changes in laws and interpretations of laws relating to the healthcare industry; and the Company's self-insurance risks. For a more complete discussion regarding these and other factors which could affect the Company's financial performance, refer to the Company's various filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its filing on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006, in particular information under the headings "Special Caution Regarding Forward-

Year-to-date 2007 Highlights
 
William B. Yarmuth, AFAMs Chairman and CEO commented on the results:
 
We are extremely pleased to report our second quarter results in which continuing EPS more than doubled from the same period last year. Our same store revenues grew 27% clearly reflecting the high quality of care and service that we provide to our patients. In addition to continuing our intense focus on same store sales growth, with our strong balance sheet and the integration of the Mederi acquisition proceeding nicely, we are very well positioned to continue our growth in the form of both start-up locations and additional acquisitions.

Net Income From Continuing Operations grew 114% to $1,984,854 or $0.35 per diluted share for the June 2007 quarter as compared to $928,881 or $0.17 per diluted share in the June 2006 quarter.

Non-GAAP Financial Measure
The information provided in the tables in this release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined under Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules. In accordance with SEC rules, the Company has provided, in the supplemental information and the footnotes to the tables, a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.
 
EBITDA:
EBITDA is defined as income before depreciation and amortization, net interest expense and income taxes. EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. It should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income, operating income, cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities, or any other measure calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The items excluded from EBITDA are significant components in understanding and evaluating financial performance and liquidity. Management routinely calculates and communicates EBITDA and believes that it is useful to investors because it is commonly used as an analytical indicator within our industry to evaluate performance, measure leverage capacity and debt service ability, and to estimate current or prospective enterprise value. EBITDA is also used in measurements of borrowing availability and certain covenants contained in our credit agreement.
 
The following table sets forth a reconciliation of Continuing Operations Net Income to EBITDA:

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On October 23, 2007, in connection with the proposed acquisition of the assets of all the Medicare-certified home health agencies owned and operated by Quality of Life Holdings, Inc., Almost Family, Inc. (the "
Registrant
"), entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement dated as of October 23, 2007 (the "
Agreement
"), among (i) the Registrant, Caretenders Visiting Services of Hernando County, LLC, Caretenders Visiting Services of Pinellas County, LLC, and Mederi Caretenders VS of Tampa, LLC, (ii) Quality of Life Holdings, Inc., Quality of Life Home Health Services, Inc., Quality of Life Home Health Services of Hillsborough, Inc., and Quality of Life Homecare of Hernando, Inc., (collectively, "
Sellers
"), and (iii) Michael Moses, James Heenan and Rosalind M. Heenan.
 
The Agreement calls for an initial purchase price of $10 million, consisting of $8 million cash and $2 million (or approximately 100,000 shares) of Registrant common stock. Additional consideration of up to $6.9 million in cash (80%) and common stock (20%) may be paid to the Sellers contingent primarily upon the achievement of certain development targets within four years following the closing. The per share value of all common stock to be issued will be the average closing price of the Registrant's common stock as reported on Nasdaq for the 20 trading days immediately before the closing date. The cash portion of the transaction paid at closing will be funded from borrowings available on the Registrant's existing senior credit facility with JP Morgan Chase Bank, NA.
 
The common stock is "restricted stock" as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, (the "
Securities Act
"). The common stock issued at the initial closing is subject to piggyback registration rights. The Registrant is relying on an exemption from registration provided under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act, which exemption the Registrant believes is available due to the closely held nature of the Sellers' common stock and the status of each recipient of the shares as an "accredited investor" as defined in Regulation D under the Securities Act.
 
Consummation of the transaction is subject to usual and customary closing conditions, including absence of any legal prohibition on consummation of the transaction, obtaining required governmental and third-party consents, the material accuracy of the representations and warranties and material performance of all covenants and the delivery of customary legal opinions. The Agreement contains certain termination rights for the Registrant and the other parties. The transaction is expected to close by October 31, 2007.

Almost Family Announces Acquisition of
Quality of Life Home Health Care
 
Louisville, KY  Oct. 24 -- Almost Family, Inc. (NASDAQ: AFAM) today announced an agreement to acquire the assets of all the Medicare-certified home health agencies owned and operated by Quality of Life Holdings, Inc. (Quality of Life). Largo, FL-based Quality of Life operates 4 agency locations in Florida in the Tampa Bay area.
 
Company Comments on Acquisition
We are very pleased to welcome the employees and patients of Quality of Life to our family of home health providers, and we are extremely excited about this acquisition said William B. Yarmuth, chairman and chief executive officer of Almost Family. Weve been familiar with Quality of Life for some years now and we are particularly excited about adding Quality of Lifes highly specialized program for providing home health care in group living environments to our growing list of specialty home health programs.
 
Formed in 1996, Quality of Life operates home health branches in Largo, Tampa, New Port Richey and Brooksville FL serving a daily census of nearly 600 Medicare patients. The company currently attends to patients residing primarily in group living settings such as assisted living facilities, independent living facilities, senior retirement communities, HUD-sponsored apartments for the elderly and disabled, and public housing facilities. Mr. Michael Moses, CEO and founder of Quality of Life, will join Almost Family as Vice President of Group Living Programs. He will continue to operate the Quality of Life branches and will be responsible for expanding Quality of Lifes specialized program throughout Almost Familys service areas. In twelve months ended December 31, 2006 Quality of Life generated Medicare revenues of $7.9 million. In the twelve months ended September 30, 2007 Quality of Life generated Medicare revenues of $9.4 million.
 
Regarding Mr. Moses, Yarmuth concluded: We are especially happy to welcome Michael to our management team and are anticipating the contributions we know he will make in the pursuit of our strategic growth plan.
 
Moses made the following comments regarding joining the Almost Family team: Ive undergone a long and very thorough process prior to entering into this transaction. After considering many different companies to combine with I selected Almost Family to entrust my operations and my future with. I am extremely excited to join the Almost Family management team. I am really looking forward to playing a
leadership role in expanding Quality of Lifes special brand of home health care throughout the Almost Family network.
 
Financial Implications
The agreement calls for an initial purchase price of $10 million, consisting of $8 million cash, and $2 million (or approximately 100,000 shares) of Almost Family common stock (restricted). Additional consideration of up to $6.9 million may be paid contingent primarily upon the achievement of certain development targets following the closing. The cash portion of the transaction will be funded from borrowings available on the Companys existing senior credit facility with JP Morgan Chase Bank, NA. Subject to usual and customary closing conditions, the transaction is expected to close before the end of October, 2007. The transaction is not expected to add materially to 2007 earnings but is expected to be accretive to earnings in 2008.

At least three business days prior to Closing, Sellers agree to provide Buyers with a schedule setting forth a list of software for which the necessary licenses are not held and will not be assigned to Buyers at Closing and an estimate of the cost of obtaining such licenses.

Attachment A
, Buyers agree to assume those trade payables (each a 
Trade Payable
, and collectively, 
Trade Payables
) incurred in the ordinary course of the Business, as determined by Buyers in their sole discretion, in an amount not to exceed $540,000 in the aggregate, and excluding those liabilities described in paragraph 1.2(b). Buyers shall not be deemed to have assumed any specific Trade Payable until Buyers add such Trade Payable to

Buyers agreement to assume the Trade Payables is conditioned upon Sellers' agreement to pay its trade payables in the ordinary course of business through the Closing Date. Trade Payables assumed pursuant to this paragraph 1.2 shall be defined as 
Assumed Liabilities
).
 
(b)       The parties acknowledge and agree that Buyers are not assuming, and Trade Payables do not include, liabilities or other obligations of Selling Parties for (i) borrowed money, (ii) capital leases for leased equipment and other tangible personal property, or (iii) amounts due to any governmental agency or instrumentality, whether federal, state or local, relating to Medicare/Medicaid reimbursements or similar reimbursement obligations relating to the Business, (iv) federal, state or local taxes, including without limitation, income, sales or use, franchise, or withholding taxes, or (v) amounts payable to any Seller Affiliates or entities or individuals affiliated with any Selling Party.
 
(c)       Sellers acknowledge and agree that they shall retain all liabilities, whether known or unknown, arising out of or relating to the operation of the Business through the Closing Date or arising out of or with respect to the Purchased Assets, including the ownership or leasing thereof, through the Closing Date, and that Buyers are not assuming any liabilities of Sellers of any nature, except for (i) obligations accruing after Closing under the Assumed Contracts and Assumed Leases, (ii) any real property lease expenses offsetting the Purchase Price pursuant to paragraph 1.3, (iii) any accrued personal leave assumed pursuant to paragraph 1.4, (iv) any additional liabilities or accrued expenses mutually agreed upon by Sellers and

(b)         Buyers agree to assume Sellers' obligations arising after the Closing Date with respect to the equipment leases and real estate leases set forth on
Schedule 1.3(b)
(the "
Assumed Leases
"), provided that any accrued rent, fees, taxes, expenses or other amounts payable as of the Closing Date and/or relating to the period through the Closing Date (collectively, "
Lease Liabilities
") shall be offset against the Purchase Price. At the Closing, Sellers shall deliver to Buyers landlord consent and estoppel certificates for each Assumed Lease for real property, each in a form reasonably satisfactory to Buyers confirming the landlord's consent to assignment and further confirming among other customary matters that the Assumed Lease is not in default and that there are no accrued and unpaid amounts due the landlord for the period through Closing, which certificates may be delivered post-Closing, as necessary and with Buyers consent. Buyers shall have the right to require as a condition to Buyers obligation to close, a renegotiation of the terms of any related-party lease.
 
 
(a)       Selling Parties acknowledge that Buyers are not purchasing, recognizing, assuming or otherwise acquiring any rights, obligations, assets or liabilities under, arising from or resulting from any employment agreement or arrangement in existence between any Seller and any employee, or any person employed to consult with or perform services for Sellers.

Article 2 -
Purchase Price and Payments
 
 
(a)       In consideration of the transfer of the Purchased Assets and the Business, Buyers agree to pay for the Purchased Assets (the "
Purchase Price
"), consideration in the form of the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities, and the cash and shares of Almost Family, Inc. common stock (

(ii)       $2,000,000 in the form of Almost Family, Inc. common stock ("
Closing AFAM Shares
"). The number of Closing AFAM Shares shall be fixed as of the Closing Date by dividing $2,000,000 by the average closing price of AFAM Shares as reported on NASDAQ for the 20 trading days immediately prior to the Closing Date. Closing AFAM Shares shall be issued among Selling Parties in the percentages set forth on
Schedule 2.1(a)(ii)
.
 
(iii)      up to $6,900,000 in contingent consideration ("

(b)       The cash portion of the Purchase Price payable at Closing pursuant to paragraph 2.1(a)(i) shall be increased or decreased, as applicable, to account for any proration of expense items relating to the Business. The parties agree to enter into a closing statement at Closing setting forth the determination of the cash portion of the Purchase Price payable at Closing.

5
 
 
(c)       Buyers shall have the right to satisfy directly out of the cash consideration payable at Closing the liabilities of Sellers identified on
Schedule 2.1(c)
.
 
(d)       The parties acknowledge that Selling Parties have engaged The Braff Group (
Braff
) to act as their broker or agent in connection with the transactions described in this Agreement. Any compensation payable to Braff shall be the sole responsibility of Selling Parties, and Buyers shall under no circumstance be liable for payment of any such compensation. The closing statement shall set forth the amount of compensation to be paid directly to Braff out of the cash portion of the Purchase Price payable at Closing.
 
 
(a)       The amount of Contingent Consideration payable to Sellers shall be calculated using two components, as follows:
 
(i)        
Contingent Consideration Component #1 (CCC#1)
. Up to $3,500,000 of Contingent Consideration may be earned by Sellers based on the net revenues generated directly by activities of the Business in any of the following counties in the State of Florida: Pinellas, Hillsborough, Pasco, Hernando and Polk (collectively, 
Territory #1
).
 
(ii)       
Contingent Consideration Component #2 (CCC#2)
. Up to $3,400,000 of Contingent Consideration may be earned by Sellers based on the net revenues generated directly by the activities of the Business in any territory outside of Territory #1 (
Territory #2
).
 
(b)       
Determination of CCC#1
. The determination of the amount of Contingent Consideration ultimately payable for CCC#1 (up to a maximum of $3,500,000) shall be based on total revenues generated directly by the activities in the Business in Territory #1 for a trailing consecutive 12 month (
TTM
) within the first full 18 month period following the Closing Date
minus
$10,000,000 (
CCC#1 Actual Revenues
). The CCC#1 Revenue Target shall be $4,000,000. The CCC#1 Minimum Revenue Threshold shall be $2,000,000. The amount payable under CCC#1 shall be based on the following table:
 
 
 
6
 
 
(i)        If CCC#1 Actual Revenues are greater than or equal to the CCC#1 Minimum Revenue Threshold and less than the CCC#1 Revenue Target and agency level contribution to corporate and regional overhead as a percent of revenue is greater than 19% then: CCC#1 Actual Revenues
divided
by CCC#1 Revenue Target
multiplied
by $3,000,000 shall be the amount payable, subject to a cap of $3,000,000.
Schedule 2.2(b)(ii)
sets forth the calculation which will be used to determine the corporate and regional overhead contribution.
 
(ii)       A determination of the amount of CCC#1 ultimately payable shall be made no later than 90 days following the end of the TTM period in which the goal has been reached but in no event beyond the first full 18 month period following the Closing Date and shall be paid no later than 30 days after the determination is made.
 
(iii)      The CCC#1 payout shall be made 80% in cash and 20% in AFAM Shares. The value of each AFAM Share to be issued pursuant to this paragraph 2.2(b) shall be fixed as of the Closing Date by dividing the amount of CCC#1 payable by the average closing price of AFAM Shares as reported on NASDAQ for the 20 trading days immediately prior to the Closing Date. For example, if the value of an AFAM Share as determined pursuant to the preceding sentence is $25, then if the dollar amount of Contingent Consideration to be issued after the Closing is $1,000,000, then Selling Parties would be issued 8,000 AFAM Shares (20% of $1,000,000 is $200,000 and $200,000 divided by 25 is 8,000), regardless of the trading price of AFAM Shares at such later date. AFAM Shares to be issued pursuant to this paragraph 2.2(b) shall be issued in the percentages set forth on
Schedule 2.1(a)(ii)
.
 
(c)       
Determination of CCC#2
. The determination of the amount of Contingent Consideration ultimately payable for CCC#2 (up to a maximum of $3,400,000) shall be based on the trailing 12 months revenues generated directly by the activities of the Business in Territory #2 during the four full years following the Closing Date (
Attributable CCC#2 Revenues
). The CCC#2 Revenue Target shall be $16,000,000. The CCC#2 Minimum Revenue Threshold shall be $4,000,000. For each full increment of $4,000,000 of Attributable CCC#2 Revenues an incremental $850,000 of Contingent Consideration shall be deemed to have been earned according to the following formula:
 
(i)        At the end of each of the four consecutive full 12 month periods following the Closing Date a calculation would be made of revenues directly attributable to the activities of the Business (
Attributable CCC#2 Revenues
) and compared against same calculation for the full 12 month period ending one year earlier to determine the amount payable (or returnable). The calculations shall begin starting with the first full 12 month period following the Closing Date and shall end with the fourth consecutive full 12 month period following the Closing Date. The following outlines the calculation to be made:
 
7
 
 
(A)      
Step 1
: determine Attributable CCC#2 Revenues for the trailing 12 month period then ended
 
(B)      
Step 2
: Look up the Attributable CCC#2 Revenues in the following table to arrive at the Cumulative Payout Amount:
 
 
 
(C)      
Step 3
: Subtract the previous 12 month periods Cumulative Payout Amount from the current 12 month periods Cumulative Payout Amount to arrive at the Current 12 Month Period Payout (Payback) Amount. If the Current 12 Month Period Payout (Payback) Amount is positive it shall be paid by Buyers to Sellers; if negative it shall be paid by Sellers to Buyers.
 
(ii)       If at any of the four 12 month periods for which a calculation is made, the actual Attributable CCC#2 Revenues for the 12 months then ended shall equal or exceed $16,000,000, the entire $3,400,000 amount of CCC#2 shall have been fully earned and there shall be no more calculations made from that point forward.
 
(iii)      The payment of each Current 12 Month Payout (Payback) Amount shall be made 80% in cash and 20% in AFAM Shares. The value of each AFAM Share to be issued pursuant to this paragraph 2.2(b) shall be fixed as of the Closing Date by dividing the amount of CCC#1 payable by the average closing price of AFAM Shares as reported on NASDAQ for the 20 trading days immediately prior to the Closing Date. AFAM Shares to be issued pursuant to this paragraph 2.2(c) shall be issued in the percentages set forth on
Schedule 2.1(a)(ii)
.
 
(iv)      In order for revenues to quality as CCC#2 Revenues for purpose of this paragraph 2.2(c), (i) the markets for CCC#2 must be identified and approved by Buyer senior management prior to initiation of selling activities by Buyers representatives, and (ii) the group living facilities must execute acknowledgement forms, in a form mutually satisfactory to Sellers and Buyers, indicating that such facility is participating in the applicable program.
 
(d)       The Contingent Consideration shall be paid, if due, within 10 business days after the final determination of Net Revenue for the Determination Period.

(g)       Buyers agree to provide Sellers' independent accountants reasonable access to Buyers management and the financial records of Buyers during the Determination Period for the sole purpose of verifying Net Revenue. It shall be a condition to the provision of any information pursuant to this paragraph 2.2 that Sellers and their independent auditor sign a confidentiality agreement reasonably satisfactory to Buyers with respect to any information so provided.
 
(h)       In no event later than 50 days immediately following the Determination Period, Buyers shall have prepared and delivered to Sellers a statement of Buyers calculation of Net Revenue for the Determination Period (a "
Determination Statement
"). If, (x) after the parties are unable to mutually agree upon such calculation of Net Revenue or (y) after receiving the Determination Statement and prior to 90 days immediately following the receipt of such statement, Sellers notify Buyers in writing (a "
Revenue Dispute Notice
") that it disputes the amount of Net Revenue as calculated by Buyers (and in such Revenue Dispute Notice states the nature of the dispute in reasonable detail, including, without limitation, Sellers' determination of Net Revenue, and if Sellers and Buyers are unable to resolve such dispute within three (3) days after receipt of the Revenue Dispute Notice by Buyers, they shall submit the dispute to a nationally recognized independent accounting firm mutually agreeable to them, which firm shall not have had a material relationship with either party, or any of their respective affiliates, within four (4) years preceding the appointment of such firm (the "
Adjustment Arbitrator
"). The Adjustment Arbitrator shall be instructed to arbitrate the disputed Net Revenue, and determine whether the Contingent Consideration is payable within 60 days from the date such Adjustment Arbitrator is selected. If Sellers and Buyers cannot agree on the selection of the independent accounting firm to act as the Adjustment Arbitrator, they shall request Buyer's independent accounting firm to appoint such an independent accounting firm and such appointment shall be conclusive and binding on the parties. In determining Net Revenue, the Adjustment Arbitrator shall be bound by the provisions of this Agreement and may not assign a value to any adjustment or item greater than the greatest value for such adjustment or item claimed by Sellers or Buyers (as applicable) or less than the smallest value for such adjustment or item claimed by Sellers or Buyers (as applicable). The resolution of disputes by the Adjustment Arbitrator shall be set forth in writing and shall be conclusive and binding on the parties, and the determination of Net Revenue shall become final upon the date of such resolution, and may be entered as a final judgment in any court of proper jurisdiction. Whether any dispute is resolved by agreement between Sellers and Buyers or by the Adjustment Arbitrator, changes to the Determination Statement shall be made hereunder only for items as to which Sellers have taken exception as provided herein. The fees and expenses of the Adjustment Arbitrator, if required hereunder, shall be apportioned between Sellers and Buyers to reflect the relative differences between the position asserted by Sellers and Buyers with respect to each disputed adjustment or item referred to the Adjustment Arbitrator, and the resolution reached by such Adjustment Arbitrator with the party that is further from such resolution bearing a proportionately greater share of such fees and expenses.

Claimant
") shall give written notice to the party from whom indemnification is sought (the "
Indemnitor
"), specifying the basis on which indemnification is south and such other information known to the Claimant regarding the indemnification claim, promptly, but in no event greater than 10 business days, after the Claimant learns of the claim or proceeding; provided that the failure to give such notice shall not relieve the Indemnitor of its obligations hereunder if the Claimant uses its best efforts to mitigate Claimant's damages, except to the extent Indemnitor is actually prejudiced. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in the event that a Claimant gives notice to the Indemnitor within such 10 business day time period set forth above, the Claimant shall have no obligation to mitigate Claimant's damages under this paragraph 11.4(a).
 
(b)       With respect to any third-party claims or proceedings as to which the Claimant is entitled to indemnification, the Indemnitor shall have the right to select and employ counsel of its own choosing reasonably satisfactory to the Claimant to defend against any such claim or proceeding, to assume control of the defense of such claim or proceeding, and to compromise, settle or otherwise dispose of the same, if the Indemnitor deems it advisable to do so, all at the expense of the Indemnitor; provided, that the Indemnitor conducts the defense actively and diligently and in a manner to minimize the risk of the Claimant becoming subject to any liability for any other material matter. Further, the Indemnitor shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any compromise or settlement with respect any third-party claim without the prior written consent of the Claimant unless such judgment, compromise or settlement (a) provides for the payment by the Indemnitor of money as sole relief for the
 
30
 
 
claimant, (b) results in the full and general release of Buyer Indemnified Persons or Seller Indemnified Persons, as applicable, from all liabilities arising or relating to, or in connection with, the third-party claim and (c) involves no finding or admission of any violation of laws, rules or regulations or the rights of any person and has no effect on any other claims that may be made against the Claimant. The Claimant may elect to participate in the defense of any such third party claim, and may, at its sole expense, retain separate counsel in connection therewith. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if in the reasonable opinion of the Claimant, any such claim or the litigation or resolution of any such claim involves an issue or matter that could have a material adverse effect on the on the business, operations, condition (financial or otherwise), assets or earnings of the Claimant, the Claimant shall have the right to control the defense or settlement of any such claim or demand and its reasonably costs and expenses shall be included as part of the indemnification obligation of the Indemnitor. The Claimant shall not settle or compromise any such third party claim without the prior consent of the Indemnitor, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The parties will fully cooperate in any such action, and shall make available to each other any books or records useful for the defense of any such claim or proceeding.
 
 
(a)       Upon notice to Sellers specifying in reasonable detail the basis therefor, Buyers may set off any amount to which it may be entitled under this Article 11 against amounts otherwise payable under this Agreement, including without limitation, Contingent Consideration. The exercise of such right of setoff by Buyers in good faith, whether or not ultimately determined to be justified, will not constitute an event of default under this Agreement.
 
(b)       Selling Parties agree to pledge their AFAM Shares to Buyers pursuant to the terms of a pledge agreement, the form of which is attached as
Attachment C
(the "
Stock Pledge Agreement
"), to secure Selling Parties' indemnification obligations under this Agreement.
 
(c)       Neither the exercise of nor the failure to exercise such right of setoff will constitute an election of remedies or limit Buyers in any manner in the enforcement of any other remedies that may be available to it.

Company Registration
.

Upon the written request of each Holder given within twenty (20) days after such notice is given by Company, Company shall, subject to the provisions of paragraph 2.1, cause to be registered all of the Registrable Securities that each such Holder has requested to be included in such registration. Company shall have the absolute right in its sole discretion to postpone, terminate or withdraw any registration initiated by it under this paragraph 2.1, whether or not any Holder has elected to include Registrable Securities in such registration.

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) to the extent Registrable Securities are included in a registration statement to be offered on a delayed or continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act, no Holder may actually sell any Registrable Securities unless Company is also concurrently selling shares of Common Stock pursuant to such registration statement, and (ii) Holder may include its Registrable Securities in any registration statement only to the extent that the inclusion of such securities will not reduce the number of the Health Management Registrable Securities that may be included in such registration.
2.2       
Underwriting Requirements
. In connection with any offering involving an underwriting of shares of Company's capital stock pursuant to paragraph 2.1, Company shall not be required to include any of Holder's Registrable Securities in such underwriting unless Holder accepts the terms of the underwriting as agreed upon between Company and its underwriters, and then only in such quantity as the underwriters in their sole discretion determine will not jeopardize the success of the offering by Company. If the total number of securities, including Registrable Securities, requested by stockholders to be included in such offering exceeds the
number of securities to be sold (other than by Company) that the underwriters in their reasonable discretion determine is compatible with the success of the offering, then Company shall be required to include in the offering only that number of such securities, including Registrable Securities, which the underwriters and Company in their sole discretion determine will not jeopardize the success of the offering. If the number of securities to be sold in the registration is so limited, the number of shares that are entitled to be included in the registration will be allocated in the following priority: (i) first, securities to be sold by Company, (ii) second, securities to be sold which are Health Management Registrable Securities, and (iii) third, securities to be sold which are Registrable Securities and all other securities with registration rights
pari passu
with Registrable Securities ("
Third Category
"). If the underwriters determine that less than all of the securities in Third Category requested to be registered can be included in such offering, then Registrable Securities that are included in such offering shall be apportioned pro rata among the selling holders based on the number of shares held on the date of Company's notice of registration in accordance with paragraph 2.1 by all Third Category selling holders or in such other proportions as shall mutually be agreed to by all such selling holders. For purposes of the provision in this paragraph 2.2 concerning apportionment, for any selling stockholder that is a partnership, limited liability company, or corporation, the partners, retired partners, members, retired members, stockholders, and Affiliates of such holder, or the estates and Immediate Family Members of any such partners, retired partners, members, retired members, stockholders and Affiliates, and any trusts for the benefit of any of the foregoing Persons, shall be deemed to be a single "selling holder," and any pro rata reduction with respect to such "selling holder" shall be based upon the aggregate number of shares owned by all Persons included in such "selling holder," as defined in this sentence.
2.3       
Obligations of Company
. Whenever required under this paragraph 2 to effect the registration of any Registrable Securities, Company shall, as expeditiously as reasonably possible:
(a)       prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement with respect to such Registrable Securities and use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such registration statement to become and remain effective upon Company's determination in its sole discretion;
(b)       prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and supplements to such registration statement, and the prospectus used in connection with such registration statement, as may be necessary to comply with the Securities Act in order to enable the disposition of all securities covered by such registration statement;
(c)       furnish to the selling Holder such numbers of copies of a prospectus, including a preliminary prospectus, as required by the Securities Act, and such other documents as Holder may reasonably request in order to facilitate its disposition of their Registrable Securities;
(d)       use its commercially reasonable efforts to register and qualify the securities covered by such registration statement under such other securities or blue-sky laws of such jurisdictions as shall be reasonably requested by the selling Holder;
provided that
Company shall not be required to qualify to do business or to file a general consent to service of process in any such states or jurisdictions, unless Company is already subject to service in such jurisdiction and except as may be required by the Securities Act;
(e)       in the event of any underwritten public offering, enter into and perform its obligations under an underwriting agreement, in usual and customary form, with the managing underwriter of such offering;
(f)        use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause all such Registrable Securities covered by such registration statement to be listed on a national securities exchange or trading system and each securities exchange and trading system (if any) on which similar securities issued by Company are then listed;
(g)       promptly make available for inspection by the selling Holder, any managing underwriter participating in any disposition pursuant to such registration statement, and any attorney or accountant or other agent retained by any such underwriter or selected by the selling Holder, all financial and other records, pertinent corporate documents, and properties of Company, and cause Company's officers, directors, employees, and independent accountants to supply all information reasonably requested by any such seller, underwriter, attorney, accountant, or agent in connection with any such registration statement;
(h)       notify each selling Holder, promptly after Company receives notice thereof, of the time when such registration statement has been declared effective or a supplement to any prospectus forming a part of such registration statement has been filed; and
(i)        after such registration statement becomes effective, notify each selling Holder of any request by the SEC that Company amend or supplement such registration statement or prospectus.
2.4       
Furnish Information
. It shall be a condition precedent to the obligations of Company to take any action pursuant to this paragraph 2 with respect to the Registrable Securities of any selling Holder that such Holder shall furnish to Company such information regarding itself, the Registrable Securities held by it, and the intended method of disposition of such securities as is reasonably required to effect the registration of such Holder's Registrable Securities. Any selling Holder shall promptly notify Company of any changes in the information set forth in the registration statement regarding such Holder or its plan of distribution.
2.5       
Expenses of Registration
. All expenses (other than Selling Expenses) incurred in connection with registrations, filings, or qualifications pursuant to paragraph 2, including all registration, filing, and qualification fees; printers' and accounting fees; fees and disbursements of counsel for Company, shall be borne and paid by Company. All Selling Expenses relating to Registrable Securities registered pursuant to this paragraph 2 shall be borne and paid by Holder pro rata on the basis of the number of Registrable Securities registered on their behalf.
2.6       
Delay of Registration
. No Holder shall have any right to obtain or seek an injunction restraining or otherwise delaying any registration contemplated in this Agreement as the result of any controversy that might arise with respect to the interpretation or implementation of this paragraph 2.
2.7       
Indemnification
. If any Registrable Securities are included in a registration statement under this paragraph 2:
(a)       To the extent permitted by law, Company will indemnify and hold harmless each selling Holder, and the partners, members, officers, directors, and stockholders of each such Holder; legal counsel and accountants for each such Holder; any underwriter (as defined in the Securities Act) for each such Holder; and each Person, if any, who controls such Holder or underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, against any Damages, and Company will pay to each such Holder, underwriter, controlling Person, or other aforementioned Person any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred thereby in connection with investigating any matter or defending any proceeding from which Damages may result, as such expenses are incurred;
provided, however
, that the indemnity agreement contained in this paragraph 2.7(a) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such investigation or proceeding if such settlement is effected without the consent of Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, nor shall Company be liable for any Damages to the extent that they arise out of or are based upon actions or omissions made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished by or on behalf of any such Holder, underwriter, controlling Person, or other aforementioned Person expressly for use in connection with such registration.
(b)       To the extent permitted by law, each selling Holder, severally and not jointly, will indemnify and hold harmless Company, and each of its directors, each of its officers who has signed the registration statement, each Person (if any), who controls Company within the meaning of the Securities Act, legal counsel and accountants for Company, any underwriter (as defined in the Securities Act), any other Holder selling securities in such registration statement, and any controlling Person of any such underwriter or other Holder, against any Damages, in each case only to the extent that such Damages arise out of or are based upon actions or omissions made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished by or on behalf of such selling Holder expressly for use in connection with such registration; and each such selling Holder will pay to Company and each other aforementioned Person any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred thereby in connection with investigating any investigation or defending any proceeding from which Damages may result, as such expenses are incurred;
provided, however
, that the indemnity agreement contained in this paragraph 2.7(b) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such investigation or proceeding if such settlement is effected without the consent of Holder, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; and
provided further
that in no event shall any indemnity under this paragraph 2.7(b) exceed the proceeds from the offering (net of any Selling Expenses) received by such Holder, except in the case of fraud or willful misconduct by such Holder.
(c)       Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this paragraph 2.7 of notice of the commencement of any action (including any governmental action) for which a party may be entitled to indemnification hereunder, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against any indemnifying party under this paragraph 2.7, give the indemnifying party notice of the commencement thereof. The indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in such action and, to the extent the indemnifying party so desires, participate jointly with any other indemnifying party to which notice has been given, and to assume the defense thereof with counsel mutually satisfactory to the parties;
provided, however
, that an indemnified party (together with all other indemnified parties that may be represented without conflict by one counsel) shall have the right to retain one separate counsel, with the fees and expenses to be paid by the indemnifying party, if representation of such indemnified party by the counsel retained by the indemnifying party would be inappropriate due to actual or potential
differing interests between such indemnified party and any other party represented by such counsel in such action.
(d)       The foregoing indemnity agreements of Company and the selling Holder are subject to the condition that, insofar as they relate to any Damages arising from any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in, or omission or alleged omission of a material fact from, a preliminary prospectus (or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading) that has been corrected in the form of prospectus included in the registration statement at the time it becomes effective, or any amendment or supplement thereto filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act ("

"), such indemnity agreement shall not inure to the benefit of any Person if a copy of the Final Prospectus was furnished to the indemnified party and such indemnified party failed to deliver, at or before the confirmation of the sale of the shares registered in such offering, a copy of the Final Prospectus to the Person asserting the loss, liability, claim, or damage in any case in which such delivery was required by the Securities Act.
(e)       To provide for just and equitable contribution to joint liability under the Securities Act in any case in which either (i) any party otherwise entitled to indemnification hereunder makes a claim for indemnification pursuant to this paragraph 2.7 but it is judicially determined (by the entry of a final judgment or decree by a court of competent jurisdiction and the expiration of time to appeal or the denial of the last right of appeal) that such indemnification may not be enforced in such case, notwithstanding the fact that this paragraph 2.7 provides for indemnification in such case, or (ii) contribution under the Securities Act may be required on the part of any party hereto for which indemnification is provided under this paragraph 2.7, then, and in each such case, such parties will contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages, liabilities, or expenses to which they may be subject (after contribution from others) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the each of indemnifying party and the indemnified party in connection with the statements, omissions, or other actions that resulted in such loss, claim, damage, liability, or expense, as well as to reflect any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the indemnifying party and of the indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or allegedly untrue statement of a material fact, or the omission or alleged omission of a material fact, relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or by the indemnified party and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information, and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission; provided, however, that, in any such case, (x) no Holder will be required to contribute any amount in excess of the public offering price of all such Registrable Securities offered and sold by such Holder pursuant to such registration statement, and (y) no Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the Securities Act) will be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation; and
provided further
that in no event shall a Holder's liability pursuant to this paragraph 2.7(e), when combined with the amounts paid or payable by such Holder pursuant to paragraph 2.7(b), exceed the proceeds from the offering (net of any Selling Expenses) received by such Holder, except in the case of willful misconduct or fraud by such Holder.
(f)        Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that the provisions on indemnification and contribution contained in the underwriting agreement entered into in
connection with the underwritten public offering are in conflict with the foregoing provisions, the provisions in the underwriting agreement shall control.
(g)       Unless otherwise superseded by an underwriting agreement entered into in connection with the underwritten public offering, the obligations of Company and Holder under this paragraph 2.7 shall survive the completion of any offering of Registrable Securities in a registration under this paragraph 2, and otherwise shall survive the termination of this Agreement.
2.8       
Subsequent Registration Rights
. From and after the date of this Agreement, Company may grant registration rights to other Persons without the prior consent of any Holder upon substantially the same terms as set forth herein. These registration rights will be

with those contained herein for the Registrable Securities.
2.9       
Assignment of Registration Rights
. The rights to cause Company to register Registrable Securities pursuant to this paragraph 2 may be assigned (but only with all related obligations) by a Holder to a transferee of such Registrable Securities that (i) is an Affiliate, partner, member, limited partner, retired partner, retired member, or stockholder of a Holder; or (ii) is a Holder's Immediate Family Member or trust for the benefit of an individual Holder or one or more of such Holder's Immediate Family Members; provided, however, that (x) Company is, within a reasonable time after such transfer, furnished with written notice of the name and address of such transferee and the Registrable Securities with respect to which such registration rights are being transferred, and (y) such transferee agrees in writing to be bound by and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
(a)       The Registrable Securities shall not be sold, pledged, or otherwise transferred, and Company shall not recognize any such sale, pledge, or transfer, except upon the conditions specified in this Agreement and as contemplated in the Purchase Agreement, which conditions are intended to ensure compliance with the provisions of the Securities Act; provided, however, that, subject to the conditions specified in the Purchase Agreement, the Registrable Securities may be sold, pledged, or otherwise transferred (i) in any transaction in compliance with Rule 144 or (ii) in any transaction in which the Registrable Securities, as applicable, are sold, pledged or otherwise transferred to an Affiliate for no consideration. A transferring Holder will cause any proposed purchaser, pledgee, or transferee of the Registrable Securities held by such Holder to agree to take and hold such securities subject to the provisions and upon the conditions specified in this Agreement.
(b)       Each certificate representing (i) the Registrable Securities, and (ii) any other securities issued in respect of such securities, upon any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, or similar event, shall (unless otherwise permitted by the provisions of paragraph 2.10(c)) be stamped or otherwise imprinted with a legend substantially in the following form:
THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED FOR INVESTMENT AND HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES
ACT OF 1933 OR ANY STATE SECURITIES LAWS. SUCH SHARES MAY NOT BE SOLD, PLEDGED, OR TRANSFERRED IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH REGISTRATION OR A VALID EXEMPTION FROM THE REGISTRATION AND PROSPECTUS DELIVERY REQUIREMENTS OF SAID ACT AND ANY APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAW, OR OTHER EVIDENCE SATISFACTORY TO THE COMPANY THAT SUCH REGISTRATION IS NOT REQUIRED.
 
Holder consents to Company making a notation in its records and giving instructions to any transfer agent of the Restricted Securities in order to implement the restrictions on transfer set forth in this paragraph 2.10.
(c)       The holder of each certificate representing Restricted Securities, by acceptance thereof, agrees to comply in all respects with the provisions of this paragraph 2. Before any proposed sale, pledge, or transfer of any Restricted Securities, unless there is in effect a registration statement under the Securities Act covering the proposed transaction, Holder thereof shall give notice to Company of such Holder's intention to effect such sale, pledge, or transfer. Each such notice shall describe the manner and circumstances of the proposed sale, pledge, or transfer in sufficient detail and, if reasonably requested by Company, shall be accompanied at such Holder's expense by either (i) a written opinion of legal counsel who shall, and whose legal opinion shall, be reasonably satisfactory to Company, addressed to Company, to the effect that the proposed transaction may be effected without registration under the Securities Act; (ii) a "no action" letter from the SEC to the effect that the proposed sale, pledge, or transfer of such Restricted Securities without registration will not result in a recommendation by the staff of the SEC that action be taken with respect thereto; or (iii) any other evidence reasonably satisfactory to counsel to Company to the effect that the proposed sale, pledge, or transfer of the Restricted Securities may be effected without registration under the Securities Act, whereupon Holder of such Restricted Securities shall be entitled to sell, pledge, or transfer such Restricted Securities in accordance with the terms of the notice given by Holder to Company. Each certificate evidencing the Restricted Securities transferred as above provided shall bear the appropriate restrictive legend set forth in paragraph 2.10(b), except that such certificate shall not bear such restrictive legend if, in the opinion of counsel for such Holder and Company, such legend is not required in order to establish compliance with any provisions of the Securities Act.
2.11     
Termination of Registration Rights
. The right of any Holder to request inclusion of Registrable Securities in any registration pursuant to paragraph 2.1 shall terminate (i) upon the date when all of such Holder's Registrable Securities could be sold without restriction under SEC Rule 144(k) or (ii) if Company effects any merger, consolidation or reorganization in which Company is not the surviving corporation, then upon the date of consummation of such transaction if Holder of Registrable Securities is entitled to receive in exchange therefor (a) cash or (b) securities of the acquiring entity which may be immediately sold to the public without registration under the Securities Act.

Each Holder agrees that such Holder will keep confidential and will not disclose, divulge, or use for any purpose (other than to monitor its investment in Company) any confidential information obtained from Company pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (including notice of Company's intention to file a registration statement), unless such confidential information (a) is known or becomes known to the public in general (other than as a
result of a breach of this paragraph 2.12 by such Holder), (b) is or has been independently developed or conceived by Holder without use of Company's confidential information, or (c) is or has been made known or disclosed to Holder by a third party without a breach of any obligation of confidentiality such third party may have to Company; provided, however, that a Holder may disclose confidential information (i) to its attorneys, accountants, consultants, and other professionals to the extent necessary to obtain their services in connection with monitoring its investment in Company; (ii) to any prospective purchaser of any Registrable Securities from such Holder, if such prospective purchaser agrees to be bound by the provisions of this paragraph 2.12; (iii) to any Affiliate, partner, member, stockholder, or wholly owned subsidiary of such Holder in the ordinary course of business, provided that such Holder informs such Person that such information is confidential and directs such Person to maintain the confidentiality of such information; or (iv) as may otherwise be required by law, provided that Holder promptly notifies Company of such disclosure and takes reasonable steps to minimize the extent of any such required disclosure.

Non-GAAP Financial Measure
The information provided in the tables in this release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined under Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules. In accordance with SEC rules, the Company has provided, in the supplemental information and the footnotes to the tables, a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.
 
EBITDA:
EBITDA is defined as income before depreciation and amortization, net interest expense and income taxes. EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. It should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income, operating income, cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities, or any other measure calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The items excluded from EBITDA are significant components in understanding and evaluating financial performance and liquidity. Management routinely calculates and communicates EBITDA and believes that it is useful to investors because it is commonly used as an analytical indicator within our industry to evaluate performance, measure leverage capacity and debt service ability, and to estimate current or prospective enterprise value. EBITDA is also used in measurements of borrowing availability and certain covenants contained in our credit agreement.
 
The following table sets forth a reconciliation of Continuing Operations Net Income to EBITDA:

FISCAL
YEAR.
The fiscal year of the Corporation shall be determined by resolution of the Board.
(a)
       The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation) by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such person's conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of
nolo contendere
or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that such person's conduct was unlawful.
(b)
       The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation and except that no indemnification shall be made in respect to any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable for negligence or misconduct in the performance of such person's duty to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court or Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability, but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and
 
-10-
reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court or Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.
(c)
       To the extent that a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in Subsections (a) and (b) and in defense of any claim, issue, or matter therein, such director, officer, employee or agent shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith.
9.2
       
Procedure for Indemnification.
Any indemnification under Subsections (a) and (b) (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon determination that indemnification of the director, officer, employee or agent is proper in the circumstances because such person has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Subsections (a) and (b). Such determination shall be made (1) by the Board by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, or (2) if such quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable a quorum of disinterested directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (3) by the stockholders.
9.3
       
Advances for Expenses.
Expenses incurred in defending a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding as authorized by the Board in the specific case upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the director, officer, employee or agent to repay such amount. Such director, officer, employee or agent shall not repay the amount if it shall be ultimately determined that such person is entitled to be indemnified by this section.
9.4
       
Other Rights; Continuation of Right to Indemnification.
The indemnification provided by this section shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification may be entitled under any By-Law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in such person's official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person. For purposes of this section, references to "the Corporation" shall include, in addition to the Corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors, officers, and employees or agents, so that any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of such constituent corporation, or is or was serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Section 9, with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation, as such person would if such person had served the resulting or surviving corporation in the same capacity.
9.5
       
Insurance.
The Corporation is authorized, according to the discretion of the Board, to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the
 
-11-
Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against such person and incurred by such person in any such capacity, or arising out of such person's status as such, whether or not the Corporation must indemnify such person against such liability under the provisions of this section.
10
.
       
AMENDMENTS.
These By-Laws may be amended or repealed or new by-laws adopted by (a) the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80% of the voting power of all shares of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class or (b) by action of the Board at a regular or special meeting thereof.

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On December 4, 2007, Almost Family, Inc. (the "Registrant") entered into the Fifth Amendment to the Registrant's credit facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. As amended, the credit facility has an expiration date of June 30, 2010. The credit facility bears interest at the bank's prime rate plus a margin (ranging from -1.50% to -0.25%) dependent upon total leverage. Borrowings are secured by substantially all of the Registrant's assets and the stock of the Registrant's subsidiaries.  The Registrant pays a commitment fee of between 0.25%, and 0.35% per annum on the unused facility balance. Subject to the outstanding balance in the credit facility at no time exceeding $40,000,000 in the aggregate, borrowings are available equal to the greater of: a) a multiple of 3.50 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") or b) an asset based formula, primarily based on accounts receivable. EBITDA of acquired operations may be included in the availability calculations up to an amount not to exceed 75% of the Registrant's historical EBITDA. Borrowings under the facility may be used for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, development and growth of the business and other corporate purposes. The description of the Fifth Amendment is qualified in its entirety by the copy thereof which is attached as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.

ARTICLE I.
 
Amendments to Loan Agreement
Borrowers, Agent, and Lenders agree that, effective as of November 30, 2007 in each case, the Loan Agreement shall be modified as follows:
A.

The aggregate amount of all Revolving Loan Commitments shall not exceed at any time $40,000,000, as reduced pursuant to the Section of this Agreement entitled Mandatory Prepayments. Amounts borrowed under this
Section 2.1A
may be repaid and reborrowed at any time prior to the earlier of (i) the termination of the Revolving Loan Commitment pursuant to any acceleration of the Obligations as provided hereinafter or (ii) the Termination Date. Except as otherwise provided herein, no Lender shall have any obligation to make a Revolving Advance to the extent such Revolving Advance would cause the Revolving Loan (after giving effect to any immediate application of the proceeds thereof) to exceed the Maximum Revolving Loan Amount.
[1]       
Maximum Revolving Loan Amount
means, as of any date of determination, the lesser of (a) the Revolving Loan Commitment(s) of all Lenders

For purposes of determining Asset Availability pursuant to clauses [i] and [ii] above, any otherwise Eligible Account not billed within 30 days after the services giving rise to same were rendered or goods were shipped nevertheless shall be deemed to have been billed, and the related invoice dated, as of such thirtieth day.
[4]       
Borrowing Base EBITDA Availability

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
 
Board of Directors and Stockholders
Quality of Life Holdings, Inc., Subsidiaries, and Affiliate
 
We have audited the consolidated balance sheet of Quality of Life Holdings, Inc., Subsidiaries, and Affiliate (collectively, the Company) as of December 31, 2006, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders' equity, and cash flows for the year then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.
 
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Quality of Life Holdings, Inc., Subsidiaries, and Affiliate as of December 31, 2006, and the results of its operations, changes in stockholders equity, and its cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

NOTE A - DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
A description of the business and a summary of the significant accounting policies consistently applied in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements follow:
 
 
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Quality of Life Holdings, Inc. (a Florida corporation incorporated in 2004), its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and its affiliate, GSADL, Inc. (collectively the Company). All material inter-company transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation.
 
The wholly-owned subsidiaries of Quality of Life Holdings, Inc. are as follows:
 
 
GSADL, Inc. (GSADL) is an affiliated company through common ownership that was formed in 2006. GSADL is in a development stage to provide similar services as the wholly-owned subsidiaries of Quality of Life Holdings, Inc. During the year ended December 31, 2006, GSADL had no revenues and approximately $36,000 in expenses.
 
 
The Company is a Medicare-certified home health agency providing skilled nursing, rehabilitation therapy (PT/OT/ST), medical social work services and home health aides. Beyond Medicares traditional home-based services, the Companys focus is providing lifestyle and wellness programs for residents of group living (assisted living facilities, independent living facilities, mobile home parks, HUD subsidized housing, public housing, etc.).
 
Headquartered in Largo, Florida with three additional office locations, 13 wellness center locations and 20 additional wellness programs, the Company currently serves 4 counties in Western Florida with the potential to expand to a total of 24 counties within the currently licensed districts.
NOTE A - DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - Continued
 
As part of that expansion, the Company entered into a lease on June 1, 2007 for office space in Lakeland, Florida, to be used as a Drop Site for clinicians visiting patients. Management anticipates filing an application with the State of Florida for licensure to establish a formal home health care office at this location. The opening of the new office will expand the Companys current operation into a fifth county.
 
 
 
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed using accelerated methods over the estimated useful lives. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the improvements or the lease-term, whichever is shorter.
 
The estimated useful lives of depreciable assets are as follows:
 
 
 
SFAS 144,
Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets
, specifies circumstances in which certain long-lived assets must be reviewed for impairment. Application of this standard for 2006 has resulted in no impairment.
 
 
Maintenance, repairs and minor replacements are charged to expense as incurred. Major renovations and replacements are capitalized to appropriate property and equipment accounts. Upon sale or retirement of property, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts, and the related gain or loss is recognized.
 
 
Patients covered by Medicare are billed under a 60 day treatment period by which the Company bills at the beginning of a treatment plan the full amount expected to be received. At any financial reporting period, the Company calculates the amount of revenue earned based on the number of days of treatment provided to the patient. Any amount billed in excess of the revenue earned is treated as unearned revenue and recorded as deferred revenue in the Companys consolidated balance sheet.
Quality of Life Holdings, Inc., Subsidiaries, and Affiliate
 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
December 31, 2006
 
NOTE A - DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - Continued
 
 
The Company is paid for its services primarily by governmental third-party reimbursement programs, commercial insurance companies, and patients. Revenues are recorded at established rates in the period during which the services are rendered. Appropriate allowances to give recognition to third party payment arrangements are recorded when the services are rendered.
 
Laws and regulations governing the Medicare program are extremely complex and subject to interpretation. It is common for issues to arise related to: 1) the determination of cost-reimbursed revenues, 2) medical coding, particularly with respect to Medicare, 3) patient eligibility, and 4) other reasons unrelated to credit risk, all of which may result in adjustments to recorded revenue amounts.
 
Management continuously evaluates the potential for revenue adjustments and when appropriate makes adjustments for losses based upon the best available information. There is at least a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates could change by material amounts in the near term. Approximately 99% of the Company's revenues are earned on a "fee for service basis.
 
Concentrations in the Companys accounts receivable were as follows at December 31, 2006:
 
 
The ability of payors to meet their obligations depends upon their financial stability, future legislation, and regulatory actions. The Company does not believe there are any significant credit risks associated with receivables from governmental third-party reimbursement programs.
 
The allowance for doubtful accounts principally consists of managements estimate of amounts that may prove uncollectible for coverage, eligibility, and technical reasons and approximated $14,000 at December 31, 2006.
NOTE A - DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  Continued
 
 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Refer also to Net Revenues above and to Note B - Healthcare Reform Legislation, Regulations, and Market Conditions.
 
 
The Companys financial instruments consist of cash, accounts receivable, payables, and debt instruments. The book values of cash, accounts receivable, and payables are considered representative of their respective fair values. The fair value of the Companys debt instruments approximates their carrying values as substantially all of such debt has rates which fluctuate with changes in market rates.
 
 
The Company expenses the costs of advertising as incurred. Advertising expense was $37,834 for the year ended December 31, 2006.
 
NOTE B - HEALTHCARE REFORM LEGISLATION, REGULATIONS, AND MARKET CONDITIONS
 
The healthcare industry has experienced and is expected to continue to experience extensive and dynamic change. In addition to economic forces and regulatory influences, continuing political debate is subjecting the healthcare industry to significant reform. Healthcare reforms have been enacted and proposals for additional changes are continuously formulated by departments of the federal government, congress, and state legislatures.
 
Government officials can be expected to continue to review and assess alternative healthcare delivery systems and payment methodologies. Changes in the law or new interpretations of existing laws may have a dramatic effect on the definition of permissible or impermissible activities, the relative cost of doing business, and the methods and amounts of payments for medical care by both governmental and other payors. Legislative changes to balance the budget and slow the annual rate of growth of expenditures are expected to continue. Such future changes may further impact reimbursement. There can be no assurance that future legislation or regulatory changes will not have a material adverse effect on the operations of the Company.
NOTE B - HEALTHCARE REFORM LEGISLATION, REGULATIONS, AND MARKET CONDITIONS- Continued
 
The Company cannot predict what additional government regulations may be enacted in the future affecting its business or how existing or future laws and regulations might be interpreted or whether the Company will be able to comply with such laws and regulations in its existing or future markets.

The agreement requires the Company to make monthly payments of $25,000 which includes additional penalties and interest, as well as requiring the Company to make all payroll tax deposits related to current payroll on a timely basis. As the Company also became delinquent on its 2006 payroll taxes, as noted below, the entire balance of the 2004 taxes, penalties and interest are shown as current liabilities. The Internal Revenue Service has a lien for the unpaid 2004 taxes, penalties and interest.
 
In addition to the 2004 payroll tax liability noted above, the Companys payroll tax liability at December 31, 2006 includes approximately $751,000 of delinquent 2006 payroll taxes, penalties and interest (the 2006 taxes). See subsequent events for settlement of the 2006 taxes.

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONSOLDIATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION
 
The unaudited pro forma consolidated statements of income for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 and the year ended December 31, 2006 give effect to Almost Family, Inc.s (the Company) acquisition of the Medicare-certified home health assets of Quality of Life, Inc. (Quality of Life) in an asset acquisition completed October 27, 2007, as if the transaction had occurred at the beginning of the periods presented.
 
The unaudited pro forma consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2007, gives effect to the acquisition as if the transaction had occurred on September 30, 2007.
 
The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information should be read in conjunction with the Companys historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in the Company's periodic reports previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, along with the historial financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 8-K/A. The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information may not necessarily reflect the financial position or results of operations which would have been obtained if these transactions had been consummated on the dates indicated in the unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information.
 
The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial data are based on preliminary estimates and assumptions set forth in the notes to such information that we believe are reasonable. Pro forma adjustments are necessary to reflect the estimated purchase price and changes in our capital structure and to adjust amounts related to Quality of Lifes assets and liabilities to a preliminary estimate of their fair values. Pro forma adjustments are also necessary to reflect interest expense and the income tax effects related to the pro forma adjustments.
 
The pro forma adjustments and allocation of purchase price are preliminary and are based on managements estimates of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The final purchase price allocation will be completed after asset and liability valuations are finalized. This final valuation will be based on the actual assets and liabilities of Quality of Life that exist as of the date of the completion of the transaction. Any final adjustments may change the allocation of purchase price which could affect the fair value assigned to the assets and liabilities and could result in a change to the unaudited pro forma consolidated financial data. In addition, the impact of integration activities could cause material differences in the information presented.
 
The unaudited pro forma financial information is presented for informational purposes only and is based on certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable and does not purport to represent our financial condition or our results of operations had the business combination occurred on or as of the dates noted above nor is the financial information necessarily indicative of future consolidated financial position or results of operations.

Almost Family Announces Record Quarterly and Year End Results
FY 2007 EPS from Continuing Operations up 72% over 2006
 
Louisville, KY  Almost Family, Inc. (NASDAQ:AFAM) today announced its operating results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2007 with record performance reported for both periods.
 
Fourth Quarter Financial Highlights
 
Fiscal Year Financial 2007 Highlights
William B. Yarmuth, AFAMs Chairman and CEO commented on the results:
 
We are extremely pleased to report our record operating performance for the quarter and the year ended December 2007. During the year we continued to generate strong internally generated revenue growth while also expanding our footprint with significant acquisitions. Also during the year we successfully integrated 20 branches acquired from Mederi in December 2006. Finally, during the quarter we were able to complete the acquisition of Quality of Life which, to date has met all our expectations.
 
Yarmuth concluded: All of this success can be attributed to the quality of service to our patients and referral sources, which in turn can be attributed only to the quality and outstanding performance of our loyal employees and I want to take this opportunity to sincerely thank them for their fine efforts throughout 2007.
 
Quarterly Discussion
Net Income From Continuing Operations grew 41% to $2,075,903 or $0.37 per diluted share for the December 2007 quarter as compared to $1,412,988 or $0.26 per diluted share in the December 2006 quarter. Revenues grew 38% to $35.9 million in the December 2007 quarter from $26.0 million in the December 2006 quarter. The quarter ended December 2007 included approximately $2.3 million of revenue from the Quality of Life acquisition completed October 27, 2007.
 
Revenues in the Companys Caretenders Visiting Nurse (VN) segment grew 58% over the same period last year.
Acquired operations contributed approximately $6.7 million of that revenue growth. The $3.1 million balance of the VN revenue increase came from internal growth.
 
Net income including discontinued operations, was $2,069,916 or $0.37 per diluted share in the quarter ended December 31, 2007 and $1,469,065 or $0.27 per diluted share in 2006.
 
The number of weighted average shares outstanding for purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share increased 5% between periods.
 
VN Revenue Comparison for the Quarter
Due to the significant impact of acquisition activities on VN revenue growth, the following tables are presented comparing revenue growth by market type for the quarters ended December 31, 2007 and 2006:
 
 
VN revenues grew approximately $9.8 million between years of which 61% came from newly acquired markets,
7% came in markets with in-market acquisitions and 32% came from markets with no acquisition impact.

Non-GAAP Financial Measure
The information provided in the tables in this release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined under Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules. In accordance with SEC rules, the Company has provided, in the supplemental information and the footnotes to the tables, a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.
 
EBITDA:
EBITDA is defined as income before depreciation and amortization, net interest expense and income taxes. EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. It should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income, operating income, cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities, or any other measure calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The items excluded from EBITDA are significant components in understanding and evaluating financial performance and liquidity. Management routinely calculates and communicates EBITDA and believes that it is useful to investors because it is commonly used as an analytical indicator within our industry to evaluate performance, measure leverage capacity and debt service ability, and to estimate current or prospective enterprise value. EBITDA is also used in measurements of borrowing availability and certain covenants contained in our credit agreement.
 
The following table sets forth a reconciliation of Continuing Operations Net Income to EBITDA:

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
The information set forth in response to Item 2.01 is incorporated by reference herein.
 
In connection with the execution of the asset purchase agreements described in Item 2.01, on March 24, 2008, Almost Family, Inc. ( the "
Registrant
") entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the "
Agreement
") among (i) Caretenders Mobile Medical Services, LLC, (ii) the Registrant, (iii) Apex House Call Doctors, LLC, (the "
Seller
"), and (iv) Nancy Ralston, James Spriggs, III, Lorrie Snyder, Robert G. Young, Joann Sorensen and James Spriggs, Jr. The Agreement relates to the proposed acquisition of the assets of the visiting physician service owned by the Seller in northeast Florida.
 
The Agreement calls for an initial purchase price of $250,000, which amount will be paid in a promissory note guaranteed by the Registrant upon the closing of the transaction. The $250,000 will be increased or decreased, as applicable, to account for Seller's paid-days-off liability and any proration of expense items relating to the business.
 
Consummation of the transaction is subject to usual and customary closing conditions, including absence of any legal prohibition on consummation of the transaction, obtaining required governmental and third-party consents, the material accuracy of the representations and warranties and material performance of all covenants and the delivery of customary legal opinions. The Agreement contains certain termination rights for the Registrant and the other parties. The parties to this Agreement expect the transaction to close on the first business day after approval of the change in control of the Health Care Clinic license by the Health Care Administration of the State of Florida. The Agreement and the transactions contemplated therein may be terminated if a closing does not occur on or before June 15, 2008.
 
Item 2.01. Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
 
On March 26, 2008, the Registrant completed the acquisition of the assets of all the home health agencies owned by Apex Home Healthcare Services, L.L.C. ("
Apex Home Healthcare
"), the assets of the healthcare rehabilitation business owned by Apex Health and Rehab Center L.L.C., and the assets of the healthcare staffing business owned by Apex Healthcare Solutions, L.L.C. pursuant to (A) an Asset Purchase Agreement dated as of March 24, 2008 among (i) Caretenders of Jacksonville, LLC, (ii) the Registrant, (iii) Apex Home Healthcare and Apex Health and Rehab Center L.L.C., and (iv) Nancy Ralston, James Spriggs, III, Robert G. Young, Lorrie Snyder, Joann Sorensen and James Spriggs, Jr., and (B) an Asset Purchase Agreement dated as of March 24, 2008 among (i) Caretenders Visiting Services of St. Augustine, LLC, (ii) the Registrant, (iii) Apex Healthcare Solutions, L.L.C., and (iv) Nancy Ralston, James Spriggs, III, Lorrie Snyder and David Bathalter. The operations are located in Jacksonville, Florida and Ormond, Florida.
 
 
 
These Agreements provided for an aggregate initial purchase price of $15.85 million, consisting of $12.1 million in cash, a $2.75 million promissory note and $1 million in value of Registrant common stock, i.e., 47,619 shares. The per share value of the common stock issued was based on the average closing price of the Registrant's common stock as reported on Nasdaq for the 20 trading days immediately before the closing date of March 26, 2008. The cash portion of the transaction paid at closing was funded from borrowings available on the Registrant's existing senior credit facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.
 
The common stock is "restricted stock" as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, (the "
Securities Act
"). The common stock issued at the closing is subject to piggyback registration rights, following a two-year contractual holding period. The Registrant is relying on an exemption from registration provided under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act, which exemption the Registrant believes is available due to the closely held nature of Apex Home Healthcare's common stock and the status of Apex Home Healthcare as an "accredited investor" as defined in Regulation D under the Securities Act.

(c)
Notifications and Other Indemnification Procedures. Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 9 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party under this Section 9, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof, but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party for contribution or otherwise than under the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 9 or to the extent it is not prejudiced as a proximate result of such failure. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party and such indemnified party seeks or intends to seek indemnity from an indemnifying party, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate in, and, to the extent that it shall elect, jointly with all other indemnifying parties similarly notified, by written notice delivered to the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party; provided, however, if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that a conflict may arise between the positions of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party in conducting the defense of any such action or that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to assume such legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties. Upon receipt of notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of such indemnifying partys election so to assume the defense of such action and approval by the indemnified party of counsel, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 9 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof unless (i) the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in accordance with the proviso to the preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate counsel (together with local counsel),
 
24
representing the indemnified parties who are parties to such action), which counsel (together with any local counsel) for the indemnified parties shall be selected by Jefferies (in the case of counsel for the indemnified parties referred to in Section 9(a) above) or by the Company (in the case of counsel for the indemnified parties referred to in Section 9(b) above)) (ii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of commencement of the action or (iii) the indemnifying party has authorized in writing the employment of counsel for the indemnified party at the expense of the indemnifying party, in each of which cases the fees and expenses of counsel shall be at the expense of the indemnifying party and shall be paid as they are incurred.
(d)
Settlements. The indemnifying party under this Section 9 shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by Section 9(c) hereof, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement, compromise or consent to the entry of judgment in any pending or threatened action, suit or proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity was or could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such action, suit or proceeding.
Section 10. Contribution
. If the indemnification provided for in Section 9 is for any reason held to be unavailable to or otherwise insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount paid or payable by such indemnified party, as incurred, as a result of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriter, on the other hand, from the offering of the Offered Shares pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriter, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriter, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Offered Shares pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Offered Shares pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company, and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriter, in each case as set forth on the front cover page of the Prospectus bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of the Offered Shares as set forth on such cover. The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriter, on the other hand, shall
 
25
 
be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company, on the one hand, or the Underwriter, on the other hand, and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 9(c), any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim. The provisions set forth in Section 9(c) with respect to notice of commencement of any action shall apply if a claim for contribution is to be made under this Section 10;
provided, however,
that no additional notice shall be required with respect to any action for which notice has been given under Section 9(c) for purposes of indemnification.
The Company and the Underwriter agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 10 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriter were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 10.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 10, the Underwriter shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Offered Shares underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which the Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 10, each officer and employee of the Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls the Underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Underwriter, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company with the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company.

Non-GAAP Financial Measure
The information provided in the tables in this release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined under Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules. In accordance with SEC rules, the Company has provided, in the supplemental information and the footnotes to the tables, a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.
EBITDA:
EBITDA is defined as income before depreciation and amortization, net interest expense and income taxes. EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. It should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income, operating income, cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities, or any other measure calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The items excluded from EBITDA are significant components in understanding and evaluating financial performance and liquidity. Management routinely calculates and communicates EBITDA and believes that it is useful to investors because it is commonly used as an analytical indicator within our industry to evaluate performance, measure leverage capacity and debt service ability, and to estimate current or prospective enterprise value. EBITDA is also used in measurements of borrowing availability and certain covenants contained in our credit agreement.
The following table sets forth a reconciliation of Continuing Operations Net Income to EBITDA:

Independent Auditor's Report
 
We have audited the accompanying combined balance sheet of Apex Home Healthcare Services, LLC, and combined entities (the Company) as of December 31, 2007 and the related combined statements of income, members equity, and cash flows for the year then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.
 
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the combined financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
In our opinion, the combined financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Apex Home Healthcare Services, LLC and combined entities as of December 31, 2007, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
 
Nature of Business:
 
Apex Home Healthcare Services, LLC and combined entities (the "Company") is committed to offering the finest healthcare services that are high quality, effective and convenient. These services are provided in the Florida Counties of Duval, St Johns, Clay, Nassau, Flagler, Baker and Volusia.
 
Apex Home Healthcare Services, LLC (the "Company") was incorporated on November 17, 2003 under the laws of the State of Florida. The Company is a Medicare-certified home healthcare agency providing homecare companion services, personal care services, skilled clinical services and a behavioral healthcare program.
 
Apex Health and Rehab Center, LLC (the "Company") was incorporated on April 24, 2006 under the laws of the State of Florida. The Company is a Medicare-certified therapy agency.
 
Apex House Call Doctors, LLC (the "Company") was incorporated on October 10, 2005 under the laws of the State of Florida. The Company is a Medicare-certified visiting physician practice.
 
Apex Healthcare Solutions, LLC (the "Company") was incorporated on September 17, 2002 under the laws of the State of Florida. The Company is a healthcare staffing agency providing supplemental healthcare staff to facilities.
 
Cash and Cash Equivalents:
 
The Company considers all liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
 
Property and Equipment:

NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
 
Net Service Revenue:
 
The Company is paid for its services primarily by governmental third-party reimbursement programs (Medicare), commercial insurance companies and patients. Revenues are recorded at established rates in the period during which the services are rendered. Appropriate allowances to give recognition to third party payment arrangements are recorded when the services are rendered.
 
Laws and regulations governing the Medicare program are extremely complex and subject to interpretation. It is common for issues to arise related to the following: determination of cost-reimbursed services, medical coding, particularly with respect to Medicare, patient eligibility and other reasons unrelated to credit risk, all of which may result in adjustments to recorded revenue amounts.
 
The Company has agreements with third-party payors that provide for payments to the Company at amounts different from its established rates. Payment arrangements include prospectively determined rates per discharge, reimbursed costs, discounted charges and per diem payments. Net service revenue is reported at the estimated net realizable amounts from patients, third-party payors, and others for services rendered, including estimated retroactive adjustments under reimbursement agreements with third-party payors. Retroactive adjustments are accrued on an estimated basis in the period the related services are rendered and adjusted in future periods as final settlements are determined.
 
Management continuously evaluates the potential for revenue adjustments and when appropriate makes adjustments for losses based upon the best available information. There is at least a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates could change by material amounts in the near term.
 
Financial Statement Estimates:
 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. For additional disclosure on estimates see Net Revenues above and Note 2  Healthcare Reform Legislation, Regulations, and Market Conditions.
 
 
 
 
Page 7
 
NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
 
The healthcare industry has experienced and is expected to continue to experience extensive and dynamic change. In addition to economic forces and regulatory influences, continuing political debate is subjecting the healthcare industry to significant reform. Healthcare reforms have been enacted and proposals for additional changes are continuously formulated by departments of the federal government, congress, and state legislatures.
 
Government officials can be expected to continue to review and assess alternative healthcare delivery systems and payment methodologies. Changes in the law or new interpretations of existing laws may have a dramatic effect on the definition of permissible or impermissible activities, the relative cost of doing business, and the methods and amounts of payments for medical care by both governmental and other payors. Legislative changes to "balance the budget" and slow the annual rate of growth of expenditures are expected to continue. Such future changes may further impact reimbursement. There can be no assurance that future legislation or regulatory changes will not have a material adverse effect on the operations of the Company.
 
The Company cannot predict what additional government regulations may be enacted in the future affecting its business or who existing and future laws and regulations might be interpreted or whether the Company will be able to comply with such laws and regulations in its existing or future markets.
 
 
Notes payable consist of the following:
 
The Company has a $100,000 line of credit with a bank. The note is due on demand with interest payable at prime plus 1% (effective rate of 8.25% at December 31, 2007). This line of credit was paid in full on January 18, 2008.
                                                             
                                                                                                                                      20,667
 
The Company has a note payable with a bank payable in monthly payments of $1,292 with an applicable interest rate of 9% for a term of three years, payable in full on January 4, 2009.

Instead, the members are liable for individual income taxes on their respective share of the Companys taxable income.
 
 
From inception, the Company has routinely engaged in transactions with various companies related through common ownership. These transactions include cash advances, allocable expenses, purchase of contract services and real estate leases.
 
To take advantage of cost-savings discounts, the Company pays various combined expenses such as insurance, employee benefits and supplies. The costs allocable to the other companies have been recorded as inter-company receivables. In addition, cash advances to those companies have been also charged to inter-company receivables.

  1,487,383

Net Service Revenue:
 
Concentrations in the Company's net service revenue were as follows at December 31, 2007:
 
 15,965,749
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
 
The Company is currently involved in certain legal proceedings and other disputes with third parties that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The Company has reviewed these issues to determine if reserves are required for losses that are probable to materialize and reasonably estimate such amounts in accordance with SFAS No. 5, . After consulting with outside legal counsel, the Company does not feel that they can reasonably estimate a potential loss as a result of the legal proceedings
Accounting for Contingencies

Exhibit 99.2
 
UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION
 
The unaudited pro forma consolidated statements of income for the three months ended March 31, 2008 and the year ended December 31, 2007 give effect to Almost Family, Inc.s (the Company) acquisition of the assets of all of the home health agencies owned by Apex Home Healthcare Services, L.L.C. (Apex Home Healthcare), the assets of the healthcare rehabilitation business owned by Apex Health and Rehab Center, L.L.C., the assets of the healthcare staffing business owned by Apex Healthcare Solutions, L.L.C. and the assets of the visiting physician service owned by Apex House Call Doctors, L.L.C. in an asset acquisition completed March 26, 2008, as if the transaction had occurred at the beginning of the periods presented.
 
The unaudited pro forma consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2007, gives effect to the acquisition as if the transaction had occurred on December 31, 2007.
 
The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information should be read in conjunction with the Companys historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in the Companys periodic reports previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, along with the historical financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 8-K/A. The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information may not necessarily reflect the financial position or results of operations which would have been obtained if these transactions had been consummated on the dates indicated in the unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information.
 
The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial data are based on preliminary estimates and assumptions set forth in the notes to such information that we believe are reasonable. Pro forma adjustments are necessary to reflect the estimated purchase price and changes in our capital structure and to adjust amounts related to Apex Home Healthcares assets and liabilities to a preliminary estimate of their fair values. Pro forma adjustments are also necessary to reflect interest expense and the income tax effects related to the pro forma adjustments.
 
The pro forma adjustments and allocation of purchase price are preliminary and are based on managements estimates of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The final purchase price allocation will be completed after asset and liability valuations are finalized. This final valuation will be based on the actual assets and liabilities of Apex Home Healthcare that exist as of the date of the completion of the transaction. Any final adjustments may change the allocation of purchase price which could affect the fair value assigned to the assets and liabilities and could result in a change to the unaudited pro forma consolidated financial data. In addition, the impact of integration activities could cause material differences in the information presented.
 
The unaudited pro forma financial information is presented for informational purposes only and is based on certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable and does not purport to represent our financial condition or our results of operations had the business combination occurred on or as of the dates noted above nor is the financial information necessarily indicative of future consolidated financial position or results of operations.

Agreement
"), among (i) the Registrant, (ii) PCI Holding Corp. and (iii) National Home Care, Inc.

Additionally, the Company will assume approximately $1.3 million in capital lease obligations. The cash portion of the transaction paid at closing is expected to be funded from the Registrant's existing cash and borrowings available on the Registrant's existing senior credit facility with JP Morgan Chase Bank, NA.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
Almost Family, Inc. Signs Definitive Agreement to Acquire Patient Care, Inc.
 
New Jersey, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania -
 
Louisville, KY, June 19, 2008
 Almost Family, Inc. (Nasdaq: AFAM), a leading regional provider of home health nursing services, today announced that it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire the stock of Patient Care, Inc. This acquisition, the Company's largest to date, expands Almost Family's presence in the Northeast with three locations in New Jersey, one in Pennsylvania, and four in Connecticut. With this acquisition, Almost Family will operate almost 90 branches across 11 states.
 
William B. Yarmuth, President and CEO of Almost Family, Inc., noted, "We are extremely pleased with the acquisition of Patient Care and the opportunity to expand significantly in our Northeast region. Patient Care gives us a strong presence in New Jersey, strengthens our presence in Connecticut and provides us an entry into Pennsylvania. Patient Care has long standing franchise value in its brand name and we intend to continue our practice of maintaining acquired brands in the local markets. We are very excited to have the employees, patients and referral sources of Patient Care join our growing family of home care companies."
 
Bob Nixon, President and CEO of Patient Care, stated, "We carefully evaluated a number of options before choosing Almost Family as our partner for growth. The similarities in our cultures and our values make Almost Family the perfect merger partner and we can rest assured that the future of Patient Care is in the right hands. Almost Family's industry-leading qualities, in particular its tradition of being an advocate for the needs of its patients, are an excellent match for Patient Care's patients, employees and referral sources. We will be better positioned to build upon the strength of our branch network to expand our market presence."
 
 
 
 
Established in 1975, Patient Care operates Medicare-certified home health agency locations in three Northeast states. Patient Care is the largest for-profit home health provider in New Jersey serving four densely populated counties; is one of the largest providers in Connecticut; and operates one branch in eastern Pennsylvania. With a total of eight branch locations, Patient Care generated 2007 annual revenues of approximately $47 million. Ray Rasa, Senior Vice President of Patient Care, will join Almost Family as its senior home care manager in the Northeast region.
 
With this acquisition, Almost Family's annual net revenue run rate will surpass the $200 million mark. The Company noted that it reached the $100 million milestone just 18 months ago. The Patient Care transaction furthers the Company's objective of balancing its geographic coverage. In combination with its existing operations, the Company's Northeast region should generate over $60 million in annual revenues.
 
The total purchase price for the stock is $45.2 million, subject to a working capital adjustment. Additionally, the Company will assume approximately $1.3 million in capital lease obligations. The transaction will be funded from Almost Family's existing cash and borrowings from its senior secured revolving credit facility. Almost Family expects the transaction to be completed during the third quarter, subject to regulatory approvals. Due to transition, wind down costs and the timing of the close, the acquisition is not expected to contribute significantly to earnings in 2008 but is expected to be accretive to EPS in 2009.

Item 1.01
      
Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On July 15, 2008, Almost Family, Inc. (the "Company") entered into a $75,000,000 three-year senior secured revolving credit agreement (the "Agreement") with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Fifth Third Bank, as Syndication Agent, and certain other lenders party thereto. J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. acted as Sole Bookrunner and Sole Lead Arranger under the Agreement. Amounts available under the Agreement are for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions.
 
The Company terminated its existing credit agreement, initially dated as of August 3, 1999, and subsequently amended, with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as lender, concurrently with the effectiveness of the Agreement. The terminated credit agreement was due to mature on November 30, 2010, and was limited to aggregate borrowings thereunder of $40 million. No material termination fees or penalties were incurred by the Company in connection with the termination of the credit agreement.
 
Under the Agreement, which will mature on July 15, 2011, the Company and the lenders may enter into revolving loans, swingline loans, and issuances of letters of credit subject to certain amount limitations, in an amount up to $75 million in the aggregate outstanding at any time prior to maturity. The Agreement also contains an accordion feature which permits the Company to request from the Administrative Agent an increase of the total commitments under the Agreement to $100 million. Borrowings (other than letters of credit) under the credit facility generally will bear interest at a rate varying from Libor plus 1.60% to Libor plus 2.60%, depending on leverage. The Company is required to pay a quarterly commitment fee on the average daily unused amount of the commitment, which fee varies depending on the Company's leverage ratio. Letters of credit issued under the Agreement are subject to a letter of credit fee and related fronting fees. Borrowings under the Agreement will be secured by a first priority perfected security interest in all tangible and intangible assets of the Company, and all existing and future direct and indirect subsidiaries of the Company as guarantors.
 
The Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, customary events of default, and customary affirmative and negative covenants, including (among others) restrictions on indebtedness, liens, transactions with affiliates, acquisitions, investments, consolidations, mergers and asset sales. The agreement contains three financial covenants relating to: (i) the adjusted fixed charge coverage ratio, (ii) the leverage ratio and (iii) net worth.
 
There are no material relationships between the Company or its affiliates and any of the lenders, other than as described above.
 
The foregoing description of the Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
 
 
 
 
The information with respect to the termination of our previous credit agreement is set forth in Item 1.01 and is hereby incorporated in this Item 1.02 by reference.
 
 
The information set forth in Item 1.01 is hereby incorporated in this Item 2.03 by reference.

connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the Issuing Bank;
provided
that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the Issuing Bank from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Borrower that are caused by the Issuing Bank's failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or wilful misconduct on the part of the Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), the Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.
 
(g)
Disbursement Procedures.
The Issuing Bank shall, promptly following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. The Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether the Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder;
provided
that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse the Issuing Bank and the Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement.
 
(h)  
Interim Interest.
If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement, then, unless the Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the Borrower reimburses such LC Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Revolving Loans;
provided
that, if the Borrower fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section, then Section 2.13(d) shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of the Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section to reimburse the Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent of such payment.
 
(i)
Replacement of the Issuing Bank.
The Issuing Bank may be replaced at any time by written agreement among the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the replaced Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement of the Issuing Bank. At the time any such replacement shall become effective, the Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.12(b). From and after the effective date of any such replacement, (i) the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of the Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term "Issuing Bank" shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require. After the replacement of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this
 
 
22
 
 
 
 
Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit.
 
(j)
Cash Collateralization.
If any Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, on the Business Day that the Borrower receives notice from the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated, Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure) demanding the deposit of cash collateral pursuant to this paragraph, the Borrower shall deposit in an account with the Administrative Agent, in the name of the Administrative Agent and for the benefit of the Lenders, an amount in cash equal to the LC Exposure as of such date plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon;
provided
that the obligation to deposit such cash collateral shall become effective immediately, and such deposit shall become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to the Borrower described in clause (h) or (i) of Article VII. Such deposit shall be held by the Administrative Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement. The Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account. Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made at the option and sole discretion of the Administrative Agent and at the Borrower's risk and expense, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such account shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse the Issuing Bank for LC Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Borrower for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure), be applied to satisfy other obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement. If the Borrower is required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Borrower within three Business Days after all Events of Default have been cured or waived.
 
SECTION 2.07.
Funding of Borrowings.
(a) Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds by 12:00 noon, New York City time, to the account of the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders;
provided
that Swingline Loans shall be made as provided in Section 2.05. The Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to the Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to an account of the Borrower maintained with the Administrative Agent in New York City and designated by the Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request;
provided
that ABR Revolving Loans made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.06(e) shall be remitted by the Administrative Agent to the Issuing Bank.
 
(b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to ABR Loans. If such
 
 
23
 
 
 
 
Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in such Borrowing.
 
SECTION 2.08.
Interest Elections.
(a) Each Revolving Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of a Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request. Thereafter, the Borrower may elect to convert such Borrowing to a different Type or to continue such Borrowing and, in the case of a Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section. The Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing. This Section shall not apply to Swingline Borrowings, which may not be converted or continued.
 
(b) To make an election pursuant to this Section, the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if the Borrower were requesting a Revolving Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such election. Each such telephonic Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest Election Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by the Borrower.
 
(c) Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:
 
(i) the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing);
 
(ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;
 
(iii) whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurodollar Borrowing; and
 
(iv) if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurodollar Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term "Interest Period".
 
If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month's duration.
 
(d) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such Lender's portion of each resulting Borrowing.
 
(e) If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so
 
 
24
 
 
 
 
notifies the Borrower, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Revolving Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto.
 
SECTION 2.09.
Termination and Reduction of Commitments.
(a) Unless previously terminated, the Commitments shall terminate on the Maturity Date.
 
(b)  The Borrower may at any time terminate, or from time to time reduce, the Commitments;
provided
that (i) each reduction of the Commitments shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $5,000,000 and (ii) the Borrower shall not terminate or reduce the Commitments if, after giving effect to any concurrent prepayment of the Loans in accordance with Section 2.11, the sum of the Revolving Credit Exposures would exceed the total Commitments.
 
(c) The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election to terminate or reduce the Commitments under paragraph (b) of this Section at least three Business Days prior to the effective date of such termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date thereof. Promptly following receipt of any notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by the Borrower pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable;
provided
that a notice of termination of the Commitments delivered by the Borrower may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied. Any termination or reduction of the Commitments shall be permanent. Each reduction of the Commitments shall be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments.
 
SECTION 2.10.
Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt.
(a) The Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Revolving Loan on the Maturity Date, and (ii) to the Swingline Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Swingline Loan on the earlier of the Maturity Date and the first date after such Swingline Loan is made that is the 15th or last day of a calendar month and is at least two Business Days after such Swingline Loan is made;
provided
that on each date that a Revolving Borrowing is made, the Borrower shall repay all Swingline Loans then outstanding.
 
(b)  Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.
 
(c)  The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Class and Type thereof and the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lender's share thereof.
 
(d)  The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this Section shall be
prima
facie
evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein;
provided
that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
 
 
25
 
 
 
 
(e) Any Lender may request that Loans made by it be evidenced by a promissory note. In such event, the Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to the order of such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns) and in a form approved by the Administrative Agent. Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 9.04) be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable to the order of the payee named therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its registered assigns).
 
SECTION 2.11.
Prepayment of Loans.
(a)  The Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to time to prepay any Borrowing in whole or in part, subject to prior notice in accordance with paragraph (b) of this Section.
 
(b) The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent (and, in the case of prepayment of a Swingline Loan, the Swingline Lender) by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of any prepayment hereunder (i) in the case of prepayment of a Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, three Business Days before the date of prepayment, (ii) in the case of prepayment of an ABR Revolving Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, one Business Day before the date of prepayment or (iii) in the case of prepayment of a Swingline Loan, not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date of prepayment. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date and the principal amount of each Borrowing or portion thereof to be prepaid;
provided
that, if a notice of prepayment is given in connection with a conditional notice of termination of the Commitments as contemplated by Section 2.09, then such notice of prepayment may be revoked if such notice of termination is revoked in accordance with Section 2.09. Promptly following receipt of any such notice relating to a Revolving Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each partial prepayment of any Revolving Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be permitted in the case of an advance of a Revolving Borrowing of the same Type as provided in Section 2.02. Each prepayment of a Revolving Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing. Prepayments shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the extent required by Section 2.13.
 
SECTION 2.12.
Fees.
(a)  The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a Commitment Fee, which shall accrue at the Applicable Rate on the average daily unused amount of the Commitment of such Lender during the period from and including the date of Closing to but excluding the date on which such Commitment terminates;
provided
that, if such Lender continues to have any Revolving Credit Exposure after its Commitment terminates, then such Commitment Fee shall continue to accrue on the daily amount of such Lender's Revolving Credit Exposure from and including the date on which its Commitment terminates to but excluding the date on which such Lender ceases to have any Revolving Credit Exposure. Accrued Commitment Fees shall be payable in arrears on the last day of March, June, September and December of each year and on the date on which the Commitments terminate, commencing on the first such date to occur after the date hereof;
provided
that any Commitment Fees accruing after the date on which the Commitments terminate shall be payable on demand. All Commitment Fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).
 
(b) The Borrower agrees to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a participation fee with respect to its participations in Letters of Credit, which shall accrue at the same Applicable Rate used to determine the interest rate applicable to Eurodollar Revolving Loans on the average daily amount of such Lender's LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the later of the date on which such Lender's Commitment terminates and the date on which such Lender ceases to have any LC Exposure, and (ii) to the Issuing Bank a fronting fee, which shall
 
 
26
 
 
 
 
accrue at the rate of 0.25% per annum on the average daily amount of the LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the later of the date of termination of the Commitments and the date on which there ceases to be any LC Exposure, as well as the Issuing Bank's standard fees with respect to the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or processing of drawings thereunder. Participation fees and fronting fees accrued through and including the last day of March, June, September and December of each year shall be payable on the third Business Day following such last day, commencing on the first such date to occur after the Effective Date;
provided
that all such fees shall be payable on the date on which the Commitments terminate and any such fees accruing after the date on which the Commitments terminate shall be payable on demand. Any other fees payable to the Issuing Bank pursuant to this paragraph shall be payable within 10 days after demand. All participation fees and fronting fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).
 
(c)  At Closing, the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a fee calculated in basis points applied to the aggregate amount of the Commitment, with the basis points applied estimated to be that specified in a separate letter agreement among Administrative Agent, Arranger and Borrower, but acknowledged therein as being subject to variations determined by market conditions.
 
(d)  The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for its own account, fees payable in the amounts and at the times separately agreed upon between the Borrower and the Administrative Agent.
 
(e) All fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the dates due, in immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent (or to the Issuing Bank, in the case of fees payable to it) for distribution, in the case of facility fees and participation fees, to the Lenders. Fees paid shall not be refundable under any circumstances.
 
SECTION 2.13.
Interest.
(a) The Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing (including each Swingline Loan) shall bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate.
 
(b)  The Loans comprising each Eurodollar Borrowing shall bear interest at the Applicable Rate with respect thereto.
 
 
(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest on any Loan or any fee or other amount payable by the Borrower hereunder is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, such overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue principal of any Loan, 2% plus the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided in the preceding paragraphs of this Section or (ii) in the case of any other amount, 2% plus the rate applicable to ABR Loans as provided in paragraph (a) of this Section.
 
(e) Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date for such Loan and, in the case of Revolving Loans, upon termination of the Commitments;
provided
that (i) interest accrued pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Section shall be payable on demand, (ii) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than a prepayment of an ABR Revolving Loan prior to the end of the Availability Period), accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment and (iii) in the event of any conversion of
 
 
27
 
 
 
 
any Eurodollar Revolving Loan prior to the end of the current Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion.
 
(f) All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, except that interest computed by reference to the Alternate Base Rate at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and in each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). The applicable Alternate Base Rate, Adjusted LIBO Rate or LIBO Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
 
SECTION 2.14.
Alternate Rate of Interest.
If prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Borrowing:
 
(a) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the LIBO Rate, as applicable, for such Interest Period; or
 
(b) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the LIBO Rate, as applicable, for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (or Lender) of making or maintaining their Loans (or its Loan) included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;
 
then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Revolving Borrowing to, or continuation of any Revolving Borrowing as, a Eurodollar Borrowing shall be ineffective, and (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing,
provided
that if the circumstances giving rise to such notice affect only one Type of Borrowings, then the other Type of Borrowings shall be permitted.
 
 
(i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate) or the Issuing Bank; or
 
(ii) impose on any Lender or the Issuing Bank or the London interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;
 
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the cost to such Lender or the Issuing Bank of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or the Issuing Bank hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the Borrower will pay to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
 
 
28
 
 
 
 
(b)  If any Lender or the Issuing Bank determines that any Change in Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's capital or on the capital of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by the Issuing Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's policies and the policies of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company for any such reduction suffered.
 
(c)  A certificate of a Lender or the Issuing Bank setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.
 
 
(e)  Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's right to demand such compensation;
provided
that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or the Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 270 days prior to the date that such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's intention to claim compensation therefor;
provided
further
that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 270-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.
 
SECTION 2.16.
Break Funding Payments.
In the event of (a) the payment of any principal of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default), (b) the conversion of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Eurodollar Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice may be revoked under Section 2.11(b) and is revoked in accordance therewith), or (d) the assignment of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.19, then, in any such event, the Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense attributable to such event. In the case of a Eurodollar Loan, such loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest which would have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such event not occurred, at the Adjusted LIBO Rate that would have been applicable to such Loan, for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have been the Interest Period for such Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest which would accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest rate which such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for dollar deposits of a comparable amount and period from other banks in the eurodollar market. A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.
 
 
29
 
 
 
 
 
SECTION 2.17.
Taxes.
(a)  Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower hereunder shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes;
provided
that if the Borrower shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent, Lender or Issuing Bank (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
 
(b)  In addition, the Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
 
(c)  The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Lender and the Issuing Bank, within 10 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, on or with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower hereunder (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender or the Issuing Bank, or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or the Issuing Bank, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
 
(d)  As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
 
(e)  Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which the Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate.
 
(f) If the Administrative Agent or a Lender determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.17, it shall pay over such refund to the Borrower (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section 2.17 with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent or such Lender and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); provided, that the Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. This Section shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available
 
 
30
 
 
 
 
its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes which it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person.
 
SECTION 2.18.
Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs.
(a) The Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees or reimbursement of LC Disbursements, or of amounts payable under Section 2.15, 2.16 or 2.17, or otherwise) prior to 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without set-off or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its offices at 270 Park Avenue, New York, New York, except payments to be made directly to the Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender as expressly provided herein and except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments hereunder shall be made in dollars.
 
(b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties.
 
(c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Revolving Loans or participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans;
provided
that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.
 
(d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the
 
 
31
 
 
 
 
Issuing Bank hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.
 
(e) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.05(c), 2.06(d) or (e), 2.07(b), 2.18(d) or 9.03(c), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.
 
SECTION 2.19.
Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.
(a)  If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.17, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.
 
(b) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, or if any Lender defaults in its obligation to fund Loans hereunder, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment);
provided
that (i) the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent (and if a Commitment is being assigned, the Issuing Bank), which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.15 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.17, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.
 
 
(a)
Request for Increase
. The Borrower may, at any time and from time to time (but in no event more than once during each fiscal year of Borrower), request, by notice to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agents approval of an increase of the total Commitments (a 
Commitment
 
 
 
32
 
 
 
 
Increase
) within the limitations hereafter described, which request shall set forth the amount of each such requested Commitment Increase. Within twenty (20) days of such request, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Borrower of its approval or disapproval of such request; failure to so advise the Borrower shall constitute disapproval. If the Administrative Agent approves any such Commitment Increase, then the total Commitment may be so increased (up to the amount of such approved Commitment Increase) by having one or more New Lenders increase the amount of their then existing Commitments or become Lenders, provided however that approval by the Administrative Agent is not a commitment by the Administrative Agent to increase its Commitment or to find New Lenders. Any Commitment Increase shall be subject to the following limitations and conditions: (i) any increase (in the aggregate) in the total Commitment and the amount (in the aggregate) of any new Commitment and/or any amount (in the aggregate) of any increase in the Commitment of any New Lender, shall not be less than $1,000,000 (and shall be in integral multiples of $500,000 if in excess thereof); (ii) no Commitment Increase pursuant to this Section 2.20 shall increase the total Commitment to an amount in excess of $100,000,000; (iii) the Borrower and each New Lender shall have executed and delivered a Commitment and Acceptance and the Administrative Agent shall have accepted and executed the same; (iv) the Borrower shall have executed and delivered to the Administrative Agent such Note or Notes as any such New Lender shall request to reflect such Commitment Increase; (v) the Borrower shall have delivered to the Administrative Agent opinions of counsel (substantially similar to the form of opinion provided for in Section 4.01, modified to apply to the Commitment Increase and each Note and Commitment and Acceptance executed and delivered in connection therewith); (vi) all Guarantors shall have consented in writing to the Commitment Increase and shall have agreed that their Guaranties continue in full force and effect; and (vii) the Borrower and each New Lender shall otherwise have executed and delivered such other instruments and documents, including but not limited to modifications of the Mortgages, Security Agreement, Pledge of Equity Interests to, among other things reflect the Commitment Increase, as the Administrative Agent shall have reasonably requested in connection with such Commitment Increase. The form and substance of the documents required under
clauses (iii)
through
(vii)
above shall be acceptable to the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall provide written notice to all of the Lenders hereunder of any Commitment Increase.
 
(b)         
Revolving Loans by New Lenders
. Upon the effective date of any increase in the total Commitment pursuant to the provisions hereof, which effective date shall be mutually agreed upon by the Borrower, each New Lender and the Administrative Agent, each New Lender shall make a payment to the Administrative Agent in an amount sufficient, upon the application of such payments by all New Lenders to the reduction of the outstanding Revolving Loan held by the Lenders, to cause the principal amount outstanding under the Revolving Loans made by each Lender (including any New Lender) to be in the amount of its Applicable Percentage (upon the effective date of such increase) of all outstanding Revolving Loans. The Borrower hereby irrevocably authorizes each New Lender to fund to the Administrative Agent the payment required to be made pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence for application to the reduction of the outstanding Revolving Loans held by the other Lenders hereunder. If, as a result of the repayment of the Revolving Loan provided for in this Section 2.20(b), any payment of a Eurodollar Advance occurs on a day that is not the last day of the applicable Interest Period, the Borrower will pay to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of any of the Lenders holding a Eurodollar Loan any loss or cost incurred by such Lender resulting therefrom in accordance with Section 3.04. Upon the effective date of such increase in the total Commitment, all Revolving Loans outstanding hereunder (including any Revolving Loans made by the New Lenders on such date) shall be ABR Loans, subject to the Borrowers right to convert the same to Eurodollar Loans on or after such date in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.07.
 
(c)          
New Lenders Participation in Letters of Credit
. Upon the effective date of any increase in the total Commitment and the making of the Revolving Loans by the New Lenders in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.17(b), each New Lender also shall be deemed irrevocably and
 
 
33
 
 
 
 
unconditionally to have purchased and received, without recourse or warranty, from the Lenders party to this Agreement immediately prior to the effective date of such increase, an undivided interest and participation in any Letter of Credit then outstanding, ratably, such that each Lender (including each New Lender) holds a participation interest in each such Letter of Credit in proportion to the ratio that such Lenders Commitment (upon the effective date of such increase in the total Commitment) bears to the total Commitment as so increased.
 
(d)         
No Obligation to Increase Commitment
. Nothing contained herein shall constitute, or otherwise be deemed to be, a commitment or agreement on the part of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to give or grant any Lender the right to increase its Commitment hereunder at any time or a commitment or agreement on the part of any Lender to increase its Commitment hereunder at any time, and no Commitment of a Lender shall be increased without its prior written approval.

The bank serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and such bank and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent hereunder.
 
The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby
 
 
46
 
 
 
 
that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise in writing as directed by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 9.02), and (c) except as expressly set forth herein, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by the bank serving as Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 9.02) or in the absence of its own gross negligence or wilful misconduct. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower or a Lender, and the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or in connection herewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.
 
The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.
 
The Administrative Agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of the preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.
 
Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Administrative Agent as provided in this paragraph, the Administrative Agent may resign at any time by notifying the Lenders, the Issuing Bank and the Borrower. Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with the Borrower, to appoint a successor. If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Bank, appoint a successor Administrative Agent which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of any such bank.

47
 
 
 
 
respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was acting as Administrative Agent.
 
Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.
 
Lenders hereby irrevocably authorize Administrative Agent, at its option and in its discretion, to release any Lien granted to or held by Administrative Agent upon any Collateral (i) upon termination of the Commitments and upon final and indefeasible payment in full in cash and satisfaction of all Obligations and termination of this Agreement; (ii) constituting property being sold or disposed of in accordance with the Loan Documents; or (iii) constituting property leased to an Obligor under a lease that has expired or been terminated in a transaction permitted under this Agreement or is about to expire and which has not been, and is not intended by the applicable Obligor to be, renewed or extended.
 
Administrative Agent shall have no obligation whatsoever to any Lender or any other Person to assure that the property covered by this Agreement or the other Loan Documents exists or is owned by an Obligor or is cared for, protected or insured or has been encumbered or that the Liens granted to Administrative Agent on behalf of Lenders herein or pursuant hereto have been properly or sufficiently or lawfully created, perfected, protected or enforced or are entitled to any particular priority, or to exercise at all or in any particular manner or under any duty of care, disclosure or fidelity, or to continue exercising, any of the rights, authorities and powers granted or available to Administrative Agent in this Agreement or in any of the Loan Documents, it being understood and agreed that in respect of the property covered by this Agreement or the Loan Documents or any act, omission or event related thereto, Administrative Agent may act in any manner it may deem appropriate, in its discretion, given Administrative Agents own interest in property covered by this Agreement or the Loan Documents as one of the Lenders and that Administrative Agent shall have no duty or liability in that regard whatsoever to any of the other Lenders.
 
Each Lender hereby appoints each other Lender as agent for the purpose of perfecting Lenders security interest in Collateral which, in accordance with
Article 9
of the Uniform Commercial Code in any applicable jurisdiction, can be perfected only by possession. Should any Lender (other than Administrative Agent) obtain possession of any such Collateral following an Event of Default, such Lender shall notify Administrative Agent thereof, and, promptly upon Administrative Agents request therefor, shall deliver such Collateral to Administrative Agent or in accordance with Administrative Agents instructions. The Administrative Agent may file such proofs of claim or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, their respective agents, financial advisors and counsel), allowed in any judicial proceedings relative to any Obligor, or any of their respective creditors or property, and shall be entitled and empowered to collect, receive and distribute any monies, securities or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims. Any custodian in any judicial proceedings relative to any Obligor is hereby authorized by each Lender to make payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Lenders, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Administrative Agent, its agents, financial advisors and counsel, and any other amounts due the Administrative Agent. Nothing contained in this Agreement or the other Loan Documents shall
 
 
48
 
 
 
 
be deemed to authorize the Administrative Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Loans, or the rights of any holder thereof, or to authorize the Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender in any such proceeding, except as specifically permitted herein.
 
Each Lender agrees that, except as to Collateral in which a security interest may be perfected by possession, it will not have any right individually to enforce or seek to enforce this Agreement or any other Loan Document or to realize upon any Collateral for the benefit of the Lenders, it being understood and agreed that such rights and remedies may be exercised only by Administrative Agent.

SECTION 9.02.
Waivers; Amendments.
(a)  No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or consent to any departure by the Borrower therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan or issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Issuing Bank may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time.
 
(b) Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Borrower and the Required Lenders or by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders;
provided
that no such agreement shall (i) increase the Commitment of any Lender without the written consent of such Lender, (ii) reduce the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement or reduce the rate of interest thereon, or reduce any fees payable hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (iii) postpone the scheduled date of payment of the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement, or any interest thereon, or any fees payable hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment, or postpone the scheduled date of expiration of any Commitment, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby, except that all Lenders Commitments may be reduced pro rata if the Borrower reduces Commitments pursuant to Section 2.09(a) hereof, (iv) change Section 2.18(b) or (c) in a manner that would alter the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby, without the written consent of each Lender, or (v) change any of the provisions of this Section or the definition of "Required Lenders" or any other provision hereof specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend or modify any rights hereunder or make any determination or grant any consent hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender;
provided
further
that no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender hereunder without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, as the case may be.
 
SECTION 9.03.
Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver.

50
 
 
 
 
(b) The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and each Lender, and each Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an "
Indemnitee
") against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses, including the fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee, incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of this Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the performance by the parties hereto of their respective obligations hereunder or the consummation of the Transactions or any other transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds therefrom (including any refusal by the Issuing Bank to honor a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit if the documents presented in connection with such demand do not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit), (iii) any actual or alleged presence or release of Hazardous Materials on or from any property owned or operated by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Environmental Liability related in any way to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iv) any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto;
provided
that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses [are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have] resulted from the gross negligence or wilful misconduct of such Indemnitee.
 
(c) To the extent that the Borrower fails to pay any amount required to be paid by it to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, as the case may be, such Lender's Applicable Percentage (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount;
provided
that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender in its capacity as such.
 
(d) To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrower shall not assert, and hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the Transactions, any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof.
 
(e) All amounts due under this Section shall be payable not later than three (3) Business Days after written demand therefor.
 
SECTION 9.04.
Successors and Assigns.
(a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of the Issuing Bank that issues any Letter of Credit), except that (i) the Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender (and any attempted assignment or transfer by the Borrower without such consent shall be null and void) and (ii) no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer its rights or obligations hereunder except in accordance with this Section. Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of the Issuing Bank that issues any Letter of Credit), Participants (to the extent provided in paragraph (c) of this Section) and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.

(A) the Borrower,
provided
that no consent of the Borrower shall be required for an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender, an Approved Fund or, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, any other assignee;
 
(B) the Administrative Agent,
provided
that no consent of the Administrative Agent shall be required for an assignment of [(x)] any Commitment to an assignee that is a Lender with a Commitment immediately prior to giving effect to such; and
 
 
 
(A) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lenders Commitment or Loans of any Class, the amount of the Commitment or Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than $5,000,000 unless each of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent otherwise consent,
provided
that no such consent of the Borrower shall be required if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing;
 
(B) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement,
provided
that this clause shall not be construed to prohibit the assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lenders rights and obligations in respect of one Class of Commitments or Loans;
 
(C) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500; and
 
(D) the assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire in which the assignee designates one or more Credit Contacts to whom all syndicate-level information (which may contain material non-public information about the Borrower, the other Obligors and their related parties or their respective securities) will be made available and who may receive such information in accordance with the assignees compliance procedures and applicable laws, including Federal and state securities laws.

52
 
 
 
 
(iii) Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to paragraph (b)(iv) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03). Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section 9.04 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (c) of this Section.
 
(iv) The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitment of, and principal amount of the Loans and LC Disbursements owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "
Register
"). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower, the Issuing Bank and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.
 
(v) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Assumption executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignee's completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section and any written consent to such assignment required by paragraph (b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the information contained therein in the Register;
provided
that if either the assigning Lender or the assignee shall have failed to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.05(c), 2.06(d) or (e), 2.07(b), 2.18(d) or 9.03(c), the Administrative Agent shall have no obligation to accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the information therein in the Register unless and until such payment shall have been made in full, together with all accrued interest thereon. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph.
 
(c)(i) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities (a "
Participant
") in all or a portion of such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans owing to it);
provided
that (A) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (C) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement;
provided
that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in the first proviso to Section 9.02(b) that affects such Participant. Subject to paragraph (c)(ii) of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16 and 2.17 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be
 
 
53
 
 
 
 
entitled to the benefits of Section 9.08 as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.18(c) as though it were a Lender.
 
(ii) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.15 or 2.17 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower's prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.17 unless the Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with Section 2.17(e) as though it were a Lender.
 
(d)  Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including without limitation any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest;
provided
that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.
 
SECTION 9.05.
Survival.
All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by the Borrower herein and in the certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement shall be considered to have been relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the making of any Loans and issuance of any Letters of Credit, regardless of any investigation made by any such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as the principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any other amount payable under this Agreement is outstanding and unpaid or any Letter of Credit is outstanding and so long as the Commitments have not expired or terminated. The provisions of Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03 and Article VIII shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Loans, the expiration or termination of the Letters of Credit and the Commitments or the termination of this Agreement or any provision hereof.
 
SECTION 9.06.
Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness.
This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement and any separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable to the Administrative Agent constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. Except as provided in Section 4.01, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof which, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto, and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by telecopy shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.
 
SECTION 9.07.
Severability.
Any provision of this Agreement held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction.
 
 
54

The rights of each Lender under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) which such Lender may have.
 
SECTION 9.09.
Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process.
(a) This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the law of the Commonwealth of Kentucky.

Almost Family Reports Record Second Quarter 2008 Results
 
Recent Corporate Highlights:
 
 
Louisville, KY, August 5, 2008
 Almost Family, Inc. (Nasdaq: AFAM), a leading regional provider of home health nursing services, announced today its financial results for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2008.
 
William B. Yarmuth, Chairman and CEO, commented, By all measures, 2008 has been a period of outstanding accomplishments by Almost Family. Were reporting record revenues and earnings, a continuation of our aggressive growth strategy and the achievement of numerous capital market milestones. I couldnt be more pleased with our financial report for the second quarter, in particular with our 33% organic revenue growth rate in our VN segment. Total revenue growth in the VN segment, where we focus most of our effort, was 66% over the same quarter last year and 30% over the first quarter of 2008. All of this serves as further validation that we are on the right track as we move forward into the second half of the year.
 
Second Quarter Financial Results
 
Almost Family reported second quarter 2008 net service revenues of $48.7 million, a 50% increase from $32.5 million in the second quarter of 2007. Operating income for the second quarter of 2008 increased to 14% of net service revenues versus 11% for the second quarter of 2007.
 
 
 
Net income for the second quarter of 2008 was $3.9 million, or $0.50 per diluted share, compared to $2.0 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2007. The weighted average shares outstanding for purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share increased 39% between periods as the Company completed a common stock offering, of 2,512,500 shares in the second quarter of 2008.
 
The number of days sales outstanding in accounts receivable, or DSO, for the three months ended June 30, 2008, decreased to 47 days, compared to 51 days for the three months ended March 31, 2008. The decline in DSO was attributable to resolved billing issues related to Medicare claims, partially offset by rapid growth from acquisitions and organic initiatives.
 
Second Quarter Segment Results
 
Net revenues in the Visiting Nurse segment for the second quarter of 2008 were $38.9 million, a 66% increase from $23.5 million in the second quarter of 2007. The total revenue growth of $15.4 million came from a 33% organic growth rate plus $7.6 million from acquired operations. Operating income before corporate expense in the VN segment for the second quarter 2008 was $8.6 million, an 88% increase from $4.6 million in the second quarter 2007.
 
Net revenues in the Personal Care (PC) segment for the second quarter of 2008 were $9.8 million, a 9% increase from $9.0 million in the second quarter of 2007. Operating income before corporate expense in the PC segment for the second quarter of 2008 was $821,000.
 
Six Month Period Ended June 30, 2008
 
Almost Family reported net service revenues for the six month period ended June 30, 2008 of $87.7 million, a 37% increase from $64.3 million in the same period last year. Operating income for the six month period increased to 13% of net service revenues versus 11% for the prior year period.
 
Net income for the six month period was $6.4 million, or $0.95 per diluted share, compared to $3.6 million, or $0.65 per diluted share, in the prior year period. The weighted average shares outstanding for purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share increased 21% between periods.
 
Six Month Period Segment Results
 
Net revenues in the Visiting Nurse (VN) segment for the six month period of 2008 were $68.7 million, a 48% increase from $46.5 million in the same period last year. The total revenue growth of $22.2 million came from a 25% organic growth rate plus $10.6 million from acquired operations. The six month results included results from the Quality of Life acquisition completed in late October of 2007 and results from the Apex Home Healthcare acquisition completed in late March 2008. Operating income before corporate expense in the VN segment for the six month period was $14.0 million, a 58% increase from $8.9 million in the same period last year.
 
 
 
Net revenues in the Personal Care (PC) segment for the six month period were $19.0 million, a 7% increase from $17.8 million in the same period last year. Operating income before corporate expense in the PC segment for the six month period was $1.6 million, a 9% decrease from $1.7 million in the same period last year.
 
Recent Corporate Developments
 
On April 16, 2008, Almost Family completed a common stock offering of 2,250,000 shares at $17.75 per share, which generated net proceeds of $37.3 million.
 
On May 9, 2008, Almost Family announced that the underwriter of the public offering exercised its over-allotment option in part and purchased 262,500 additional shares of common stock at the public offering price of $17.75 per share.
 
On June 16, 2008, Almost Family was named one of Fortune Small Business 100 fastest-growing small public companies.
 
On June 27, 2008, Almost Family was added to the Russell 2000 Index.
 
On July 15, 2008, Almost Family established a new $75.0 million senior secured multi-bank credit facility replacing its previous facility.
 
On August 1, 2008, Almost Family completed the acquisition of Patient Care for $45.2 million, subject to a working capital adjustment. The acquisition was previously under a definitive agreement signed on June 18, 2008. The acquisition added $47 million in annual revenues and eight locations in New Jersey, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania. Due to the transition, wind down costs and the timing of the close, the acquisition is not expected to contribute significantly to earnings in 2008 but is expected to be accretive to EPS in 2009.

Non-GAAP Financial Measure
The information provided in the tables in this release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined under Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules. In accordance with SEC rules, the Company has provided, in the supplemental information and the footnotes to the tables, a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.
 
EBITDA:
EBITDA is defined as income before depreciation and amortization, net interest expense and income taxes. EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. It should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income, operating income, cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities, or any other measure calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The items excluded from EBITDA are significant components in understanding and evaluating financial performance and liquidity. Management routinely calculates and communicates EBITDA and believes that it is useful to investors because it is commonly used as an analytical indicator within our industry to evaluate performance, measure leverage capacity and debt service ability, and to estimate current or prospective enterprise value. EBITDA is also used in certain covenants contained in our credit agreement.
 
The following tables set forth a reconciliation of Continuing Operations Net Income to EBITDA:

Report of Independent Auditors
To the Shareholders of PCI Holding Corp.
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders deficit, and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of PCI Holding Corp. (the Company) and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

PCI Holding Corp. (the Company) provides home healthcare and hospice services primarily in certain markets in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Connecticut. Services provided include skilled nursing, home health aide, physical, speech and occupational therapy and medical social work.
Basis of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, all of which are wholly owned. The effect of intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Stock-based Compensation Plan
Prior to January 1, 2006, the Company accounted for equity-based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB 25), and related interpretations. Under this approach, the imputed cost of stock option grants is disclosed, based on the vesting provisions of the individual grants, but not charged to expense.
Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the fair value method of accounting for equity-based compensation arrangements in accordance with SFAS 123(R). Under the provisions of SFAS 123(R), the estimated fair value of share based awards granted under the Companys equity-based compensation plans is recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period of the award. The Company used the modified prospective method of transition under which compensation expense is recognized for all share-based payments (i) granted after the effective date of adoption and (ii) granted prior to the effective date of adoption and that remain unvested on the date of adoption. In accordance with the modified prospective method of transition to SFAS 123(R), the Company has not restated prior period financial statements to reflect compensation expense under SFAS 123(R). The Company's stock compensation plan is described more fully in Note 3.
Revenue Recognition and Related Costs
Revenues and related costs, including labor, payroll taxes, fringe benefits, products and supplies and contractor costs are recognized in the period in which the services and products are provided or delivered. The Companys customers primarily include individuals who contract directly with the Company for the provision of home care services. The Company bills for services to patients under commercial insurance agreements and under government programs (Medicare and Medicaid).
Revenues are recorded based on estimated net realizable amounts to be received from the Companys various payors under fee-for-service arrangements for services rendered during the period. Under the Prospective Payment System (PPS) for Medicare reimbursement, net revenues are recorded based on a reimbursement rate which varies based on the severity of the patients condition, service needs and certain other factors; revenue is recognized ratably over the period in which services are provided. Revenue is subject to adjustment during this period if there are significant changes in the patients condition during the treatment period or if the patient is discharged but readmitted to another agency within the same 60-day episode period. Medicare billings under PPS are initially recognized as deferred revenue and are subsequently amortized

PCI Holding Corp.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
December 31, 2007 and 2006
(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)
 
into revenue over the episodic period. The process for recognizing revenue under the Medicare program is based on certain assumptions and judgments, including the appropriateness of the clinical assessment of each patient at the time of certification and the level of adjustments to the fixed reimbursement rate relating to patients who receive a limited number of visits, have significant changes in condition or are subject to certain other factors during the episode. Deferred revenue of approximately $1,968 and $2,274 relating to the Medicare PPS program is included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
Revenue adjustments result from differences between estimated and actual reimbursement amounts, an inability to obtain appropriate billing documentation or authorizations acceptable to the payor, and other reasons unrelated to credit risk. Revenue adjustments are deducted from gross accounts receivable. These revenue adjustments are based on significant assumptions and judgments which are determined by Company management based on historical trends. Third party settlements resulting in recoveries are recognized as net revenues in the period in which the funds are received.
Collectibility of Accounts Receivable
The process of estimating the ultimate collection of receivables, particularly with respect to fee-for-service arrangements, involves significant assumptions and judgments. In this regard, the Company has implemented a standardized approach to estimate and review the collectibility of its receivables based on accounts receivable aging trends. Historical collection and payer reimbursement experience is an integral part of the estimation process related to determining the allowance for doubtful accounts. In addition, the Company assesses the current state of its billing functions in order to identify any known collection or reimbursement issues to determine the impact, if any, on its reserve estimates, which involve judgment. Revisions in reserve estimates are recorded as an adjustment to the provision for doubtful accounts which is reflected in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company believes that its collection and reserve processes, along with the monitoring of its billing processes, help to reduce the risk associated with material revisions to reserve estimates resulting from adverse changes in collection, reimbursement experience and billing functions.
Depreciation of Property and Equipment
Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from 3 to 7 years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the life of the lease or the life of the improvements. Expenditures for maintenance, repairs, renewals and betterments that do not materially prolong the useful lives of the assets are expensed as incurred. The cost of property retired or sold and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and the resulting gain or loss is reflected currently in operations. Internal use software is capitalized in accordance with Statement of Position No. 98-1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software for Internal Use.
Liability for Insurance Obligations
The Company is self-insured for workers compensation insurance claims, subject to a stop-loss policy with a maximum per-occurrence limit of $250. In addition, the Company carries a claims-made policy with $75 per claim deductible relating to its professional liability program. The Company recognizes its obligations associated with these programs in the period the claim is incurred. The cost of both reported claims and claims incurred but not reported, up to specified deductible limits, have generally been estimated based on historical data, industry statistics, the Companys own home health specific historical claims experience, current enrollment statistics and

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
December 31, 2007 and 2006
(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)
 
other information. Such estimates and the resulting reserves are reviewed and updated periodically. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company has recorded a liability for these insurance obligations of approximately $4,455 and $4,450, respectively.
Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. The most significant estimates relate to revenue recognition, the collectibility of accounts receivable and related reserves and obligations under workers compensation insurance program. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Reclassifications
Certain 2006 amounts have been reclassified to conform with 2007 financial statement presentation.
Cash
Substantially all of the Companys cash is deposited with three financial institutions at December 31, 2007 and 2006. Included in cash is amounts on deposit with financial institutions in excess of $100, which is the maximum amount insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Management believes that any risk of loss is remote.
Income Taxes
The Company uses the asset and liability approach to account for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period which the change is enacted. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
SFAS No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142), requires the use of a non-amortization approach to account for purchased goodwill and certain intangibles. Under a non-amortization approach, goodwill and certain intangibles are not amortized into results of operations, but instead are reviewed for impairment, and an impairment charge is recorded in the periods in which the recorded carrying value of goodwill and the certain intangibles is more than its estimated fair value.
The provisions of SFAS 142 also requires that the goodwill impairment test be performed annually or on the occasion of other events that indicate a potential impairment. The annual impairment analysis was performed for fiscal 2007 indicating no impairment of goodwill.

The gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization of each category of other identifiable intangible assets excluding goodwill as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 were as follows:
 
 
Accounting for Impairment and Disposal of Long-Lived Assets
The Company reviews the recoverability of its long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. Evaluation of possible impairment is based on the Companys ability to recover the asset from the expected future pretax cash flow (undiscounted and without interest charges) of the related operations which estimates fair value. If the expected undiscounted pretax cash flows are less than the carrying amount of such asset, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the estimated fair value and carrying amount of the asset.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The fair value of a financial instrument represents the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced sale or liquidation. Significant differences can arise between the fair value and carrying amount of financial instruments that are recognized at historical cost amounts.
The carrying amounts of the Companys accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses and debt approximate fair value.
New Accounting Standards
In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes - an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109." This interpretation was issued to clarify the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements by prescribing a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and

measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting FIN 48 on its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements" (SFAS 157). The standard defines fair value, outlines a framework for measuring fair value, and details the required disclosures about fair value measurements. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. In February 2008, the FASB decided to issue a final Staff Position to allow a one-year deferral of adoption of SFAS 157 for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis. The FASB also decided to amend SFAS 157 to exclude FASB Statement No. 13 and its related interpretive accounting pronouncements that address leasing transactions. Management does not believe the adoption of SFAS 157 will have a material impact on the financial statements.
In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 159, "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities" (SFAS 159). The standard permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. Management does not believe the adoption of SFAS 159 will have a material impact on the financial statements.
During 2002, the Company adopted the 2002 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (2002 Plan) under which 829,412 shares of common stock were reserved for issuance to employees, directors and consultants for restricted stock and for issuance upon exercise of options thereunder. During 2002, 706,803 shares of restricted stock were issued and no stock options were issued under the 2002 Plan. During 2003, options to purchase 166,800 shares of common stock were granted under the 2002 Plan, of which options to purchase 1,600 shares were forfeited. During 2005, the shares available under the 2002 Plan were increased by 332,403 shares.
During 2004, the Company issued 83,634 shares of restricted stock and no options were granted. The Company repurchased 55,225 shares of restricted stock at a total cost of approximately $1. In addition, options to purchase 51,750 shares were forfeited by terminated employees. Options to purchase 3,500 shares were exercised during 2004. As of December 31, 2004, the Company had 104,751 shares available for issuance under the 2002 Plan.
During 2005 the Company issued 655,889 shares of restricted stock and granted options to purchase 69,000 shares of stock. During 2005, 350,669 restricted shares and options to purchase 84,264 shares were forfeited by terminated employees. Options to purchase 21,165 shares were exercised during 2005. As of December 31, 2005, the Company had 147,198 shares available for issuance under the 2002 Plan.
During 2006, the Company repurchased 56,423 shares of restricted stock at a total of $1, and issued 59,946 shares of restricted stock. No options were granted in 2006, however, 2,438 options were forfeited by terminated employees.
During 2007, the Company issued 59,946 shares of restricted stock. No options were granted in 2007.

The weighted average fair value of the Company's stock options equaled the exercise price at the date of grant and carry an average remaining contracted life of 5.5 years. As of December 31, 2007, the Company had 86,167 shares available for issuance under the 2002 plan.
The restricted shares issued during 2007 and 2006 were determined to have no value.
The Company has adopted the fair value method of accounting for equity-based compensation arrangements in accordance with SFAS 123(R). Under the provisions of SFAS 123(R), the estimated fair value of share based awards granted under the Companys equity-based compensation plans is recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period of the award.
The impact of SFAS No. 123(R) does not have a material impact on compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006.
Concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is mitigated to a certain extent by the diversity of the Companys customers. While the Company has receivables due from federal and state governmental agencies, the Company does not believe that such receivables represent a credit risk, since the related healthcare programs are funded by federal and state governments, and payment is primarily dependent on submitting appropriate documentation.
Balances due from various state Medicaid programs (combined) and Medicare accounted for the following percentages of the Companys total consolidated accounts receivable balances:
 
Net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 consists of the following:
 
No other single customer accounted for more than 10% of the Companys consolidated revenues or accounts receivable balance.
Management monitors accounts receivable balances and has established policies regarding the extension of credit. The Company historically has experienced a low level of losses on the collection of its receivables.

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109 Accounting for Income Taxes -(SFAS 109) requires that a valuation allowance be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. A review of all available positive and negative evidence needs to be considered, including a companys performance, the market environment in which the company operates, the utilization of post tax credits, length of carryback and carryforward periods, existing contracts or sales backlog that will result in future profits.
It further states that forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed is difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years. Therefore, cumulative losses weigh heavily in the overall assessment. As a result of the review undertaken at December 31, 2004, the Company concluded that it was appropriate to establish a full valuation allowance for its net deferred tax assets. Since 2004, the Company established valuation allowances for future tax benefits for most of the net deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance for federal and state deferred tax assets decreased from $16,457 at December 31, 2006, to $12,139 at December 31, 2007. In addition, the Company expects to provide a valuation allowance on future tax benefits until it can sustain a level of profitability that demonstrates its ability to utilize the assets.
The difference between the effective tax rate and the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate is explained as follows:
 
At December 31, 2007, the Company has a Federal net operating loss carryforwards of $6,694 which starts to expire in 2022. The Company has State net operating loss carryforwards of $19,825 which begin to expire in 2009.
 
Some of the Companys net operating losses are subject to a limitation under Internal Revenue Code Section 382. The limitation is determined based upon the value of those affiliates experiencing an ownership change and the federal long term tax exempt interest rate at December 31, 2003. This limitation is not anticipated to have a material effect on the use of this tax benefit by the Company.

Secured Receivables Credit Facility
During 2002, the Company completed a receivable backed financing transaction (the secured receivables credit facility) making available a $30,000 line of credit less any obligations from time to time under the Term Loan described below and limited to 85% of eligible account receivable. The secured receivables credit facility was provided by PNC Bank and originally expired in October 2007. On March 2, 2007 PNC sold the Companys loan to Steel City Capital Financing (Steel City). On March 21, 2007 the Company amended its loan agreement with Steel City, whereby the covenants became less restrictive and the credit facility was reduced to $27,350. Interest on the secured receivable credit facility is variable and is based on either PNCs base commercial lending rate plus 1.25% or a 30, 60 or 90 day Eurodollar rate plus 3.0% at the election of the Company. As a result of lockbox requirements and a material adverse change clause, borrowings outstanding under the secured receivables credit facility are classified as a current liability. The amount of the unused line of credit, available subject to the terms of the agreement, at December 31, 2007 and 2006 was approximately $11,500 and $1,200, respectively.
The interest rate on the secured receivables credit facility at December 31, 2007 and 2006 ranged from 9% to 9.75% and 8.50% to 9.75%, respectively.
In addition, the Company has an outstanding letter of credit in the amount of $4,733 relating to its workers compensation program. Approximately $4,970 of the Companys cash is restricted as to use and is the collateral for the letter of credit. Fees relating to the letter of credit ranged from 2.25% to 2.50%, per annum for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. There were no borrowings under the letter of credit at December 31, 2007 and 2006.
Term Loans
The term loan outstanding at December 31, 2007 and 2006 was $0 and $3,000, respectively. The interest rate on the term loan at December 31, 2006 was 8.8%. The term loan is a variable rate loan with interest based on either PNCs base commercial lending rate plus 1.25% or a 30, 60 or 90 day Eurodollar rate plus 3.3% depending on the election of the Company.
The secured receivables credit facility and term loan include various affirmative covenants, the most restrictive of which is the minimum EBITDA requirement. In addition, the Company and Steel City agreed to amend the credit agreement to extend the facility to June 2009. In connection therewith, Steel City provided an additional $2 million term loan for working capital purposes. As of December 31, 2007, the $2 million was repaid.
As of December 31, 2007, the Company was not in compliance with certain financial covenants. Subsequent to December 31, 2007, the Company received a waiver for all covenant violations through the date of the amended loan agreement (See note 12).
Capital Lease Obligations
During 2007, the Company entered into a number of leases for computer equipment and related items. All leases that qualified as capital leases have a term of 48 months or less.
Chemed Note
In connection with the 2002 Patient Care acquisition, the Company borrowed $12,500 from Chemed Corporation (Chemed) and issued 112,845 warrants to purchase common stock of Patient Care. Interest payments are paid quarterly on the last business day of March, June, September, and December. The principal balance was originally due in total on October 11, 2007.

Interest will be paid on the principal balance remaining at the rate of 7.5% per year from the period of October 11, 2002 through September 30, 2004; 8.5% per year from October 1, 2004 through September 30, 2005 and; 9.5% per year from October 1, 2005 through October 11, 2007. In connection with the 2006 settlement of the lawsuit with Chemed, the Company converted $2.2 million of accrued liabilities into a note due October 2007, and recorded a gain on the settlement of $813, net of $263 of expenses. In March, 2007, the Company revised the note agreement to extend the maturity date to October 10, 2009, increase the interest rate to 11.50%, and provide for additional payments to be made ranging from $750 to $1.5 million. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, notes payable to Chemed was $9,701 and $14,701, respectively.
The value of the warrants was determined not to be material and no value was assigned to them.
Future principal payments on the Companys debt are as follows:
 
 
On October 11, 2002, the Company authorized and issued 47,000 shares of Series A Redeemable Preferred Stock with a par value of $1,000 per share. During 2003, an additional 200 shares were authorized and issued. No shares were issued since 2003.
The holders of the preferred stock are entitled to receive dividends at a rate of $100 per share annually, however, such dividends shall be cumulative and shall be payable only upon a liquidating event (as defined in the preferred stock purchase agreement) or redemption.
During 2007, the Company amended its charter to reflect that the preferred stock may be redeemed at the option of the holder upon written notice ("Redemption Request") of 55% of the holders of the preferred stock after October 31, 2009. The Company is required to redeem one-third of the remaining outstanding preferred stock within forty-five days from the Redemption Request and one-half within one year of the Redemption Request in an amount equal to $1,000 per share plus unpaid dividends.
During 2007, the Company and certain of its stockholders entered into an agreement pursuant to which those stockholders committed to purchase shares of the Company's Series A-1 Redeemable Preferred Stock and Common Stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $2,000 upon

PCI Holding Corp. (the Company) provides home healthcare and hospice services primarily in certain markets in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Connecticut. Services provided include skilled nursing, home health aide, physical, speech and occupational therapy and medical social work.
Basis of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, all of which are wholly owned. The effect of intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
The Company adopted the fair value method of accounting for equity-based compensation arrangements in accordance with SFAS 123(R). Under the provisions of SFAS 123(R), the estimated fair value of share based awards granted under the Companys equity-based compensation plans is recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period of the award. The Company used the modified prospective method of transition under which compensation expense is recognized for all share-based payments (i) granted after the effective date of adoption and (ii) granted prior to the effective date of adoption and that remain unvested on the date of adoption. In accordance with the modified prospective method of transition to SFAS 123(R), the Company has not restated prior period financial statements to reflect compensation expense under SFAS 123(R). The Company's stock compensation plan is described more fully in Note 3.
Revenue Recognition and Related Costs
Revenues and related costs, including labor, payroll taxes, fringe benefits, products and supplies and contractor costs are recognized in the period in which the services and products are provided or delivered. The Companys customers primarily include individuals who contract directly with the Company for the provision of home care services. The Company bills for services to patients under commercial insurance agreements and under government programs (Medicare and Medicaid).
Revenues are recorded based on estimated net realizable amounts to be received from the Companys various payors under fee-for-service arrangements for services rendered during the period. Under the Prospective Payment System (PPS) for Medicare reimbursement, net revenues are recorded based on a reimbursement rate which varies based on the severity of the patients condition, service needs and certain other factors; revenue is recognized ratably over the period in which services are provided. Revenue is subject to adjustment during this period if there are significant changes in the patients condition during the treatment period or if the patient is discharged but readmitted to another agency within the same 60-day episode period. Medicare billings under PPS are initially recognized as deferred revenue and are subsequently amortized into revenue over the episodic period. The process for recognizing revenue under the Medicare program is based on certain assumptions and judgments, including the appropriateness of the clinical assessment of each patient at the time of certification and the level of adjustments to the fixed reimbursement rate relating to patients who receive a limited number of visits, have significant changes in condition or are subject to certain other factors during the episode. Deferred revenue of approximately $2,077 and $1,968 relating to the Medicare PPS program is included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at June 30, 2008 and December 31, 2007, respectively.

Revenue adjustments result from differences between estimated and actual reimbursement amounts, an inability to obtain appropriate billing documentation or authorizations acceptable to the payor, and other reasons unrelated to credit risk. Revenue adjustments are deducted from gross accounts receivable. These revenue adjustments are based on significant assumptions and judgments which are determined by Company management based on historical trends. Third party settlements resulting in recoveries are recognized as net revenues in the period in which the funds are received.
Collectibility of Accounts Receivable
The process of estimating the ultimate collection of receivables, particularly with respect to fee-for-service arrangements, involves significant assumptions and judgments. In this regard, the Company has implemented a standardized approach to estimate and review the collectibility of its receivables based on accounts receivable aging trends. Historical collection and payer reimbursement experience is an integral part of the estimation process related to determining the allowance for doubtful accounts. In addition, the Company assesses the current state of its billing functions in order to identify any known collection or reimbursement issues to determine the impact, if any, on its reserve estimates, which involve judgment. Revisions in reserve estimates are recorded as an adjustment to the provision for doubtful accounts which is reflected in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company believes that its collection and reserve processes, along with the monitoring of its billing processes, help to reduce the risk associated with material revisions to reserve estimates resulting from adverse changes in collection, reimbursement experience and billing functions.
Depreciation of Property and Equipment
Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from 3 to 7 years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the life of the lease or the life of the improvements. Expenditures for maintenance, repairs, renewals and betterments that do not materially prolong the useful lives of the assets are expensed as incurred. The cost of property retired or sold and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and the resulting gain or loss is reflected currently in operations. Internal use software is capitalized in accordance with Statement of Position No. 98-1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software for Internal Use.
Liability for Insurance Obligations
The Company is self-insured for workers compensation insurance claims, subject to a stop-loss policy with a maximum per-occurrence limit of $250. In addition, the Company carries a claims-made policy with $75 per claim deductible relating to its professional liability program. The Company recognizes its obligations associated with these programs in the period the claim is incurred. The cost of both reported claims and claims incurred but not reported, up to specified deductible limits, have generally been estimated based on historical data, industry statistics, the Companys own home health specific historical claims experience, current enrollment statistics and other information. Such estimates and the resulting reserves are reviewed and updated periodically. At June 30, 2008 and December 31, 2007, the Company has recorded a liability for these insurance obligations of approximately $4,017 and $4,455, respectively.
Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. The most significant estimates relate to revenue recognition, the collectibility of accounts receivable and related reserves and

(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)
 
obligations under workers compensation insurance program. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cash
Substantially all of the Companys cash is deposited with three financial institutions at June 30, 2008 and December 31, 2007. Included in cash is amounts on deposit with financial institutions in excess of $100, which is the maximum amount insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Management believes that any risk of loss is remote.
Income Taxes
The Company uses the asset and liability approach to account for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period which the change is enacted. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
SFAS No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142), requires the use of a non-amortization approach to account for purchased goodwill and certain intangibles. Under a non-amortization approach, goodwill and certain intangibles are not amortized into results of operations, but instead are reviewed for impairment, and an impairment charge is recorded in the periods in which the recorded carrying value of goodwill and the certain intangibles is more than its estimated fair value.
The provisions of SFAS 142 also requires that the goodwill impairment test be performed annually or on the occasion of other events that indicate a potential impairment. The annual impairment analysis was performed for fiscal 2007 indicating no impairment of goodwill.
The gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization of each category of other identifiable intangible assets excluding goodwill as of June 30, 2008 and December 31, 2007 were as follows:

Accounting for Impairment and Disposal of Long-Lived Assets
The Company reviews the recoverability of its long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. Evaluation of possible impairment is based on the Companys ability to recover the asset from the expected future pretax cash flow (undiscounted and without interest charges) of the related operations which estimates fair value. If the expected undiscounted pretax cash flows are less than the carrying amount of such asset, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the estimated fair value and carrying amount of the asset.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The fair value of a financial instrument represents the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced sale or liquidation. Significant differences can arise between the fair value and carrying amount of financial instruments that are recognized at historical cost amounts.
The carrying amounts of the Companys accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses and debt approximate fair value.
New Accounting Standards
In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes - an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109." This interpretation was issued to clarify the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements by prescribing a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting FIN 48 on its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements" (SFAS 157). The standard defines fair value, outlines a framework for measuring fair value, and details the required disclosures about fair value measurements. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. In February 2008, the FASB decided to issue a final Staff Position to allow a one-year deferral of adoption of SFAS 157 for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis. The FASB also decided to amend SFAS 157 to exclude FASB Statement No. 13 and its related interpretive accounting pronouncements that address leasing transactions. The adoption of SFAS 157 did not have a material impact on the financial statements.
In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 159, "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities" (SFAS 159). The standard permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. Management does not believe the adoption of SFAS 159 did not have a material impact on the financial statements.
During 2002, the Company adopted the 2002 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (2002 Plan) under which 829,412 shares of common stock were reserved for issuance to employees, directors and consultants for restricted stock and for issuance upon exercise of options thereunder. During 2002,

706,803 shares of restricted stock were issued and no stock options were issued under the 2002 Plan. During 2003, options to purchase 166,800 shares of common stock were granted under the 2002 Plan, of which options to purchase 1,600 shares were forfeited.

In addition, options to purchase 51,750 shares were forfeited by terminated employees. Options to purchase 3,500 shares were exercised during 2004. As of December 31, 2004, the Company had 104,751 shares available for issuance under the 2002 Plan.
During 2005 the Company issued 655,889 shares of restricted stock and granted options to purchase 69,000 shares of stock. During 2005, 350,669 restricted shares and options to purchase 84,264 shares were forfeited by terminated employees. Options to purchase 21,165 shares were exercised during 2005. As of December 31, 2005, the Company had 147,198 shares available for issuance under the 2002 Plan.
During 2006, the Company repurchased 56,423 shares of restricted stock at a total of $1, and issued 59,946 shares of restricted stock. No options were granted in 2006, however, 2,438 options were forfeited by terminated employees.
During 2007, the Company issued 59,946 shares of restricted stock. No options were granted during 2007 and for the six months ended June 30, 2008.
The weighted average fair value of the Company's stock options equaled the exercise price at the date of grant and carry an average remaining contracted life of 5 years. As of June 30, 2008, the Company had 86,167 shares available for issuance under the 2002 plan.
The restricted shares issued during 2007 and 2006 were determined to have no value.
The Company has adopted the fair value method of accounting for equity-based compensation arrangements in accordance with SFAS 123(R). Under the provisions of SFAS 123(R), the estimated fair value of share based awards granted under the Companys equity-based compensation plans is recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period of the award.
The impact of SFAS No. 123(R) does not have a material impact on compensation expense for the six months ended June 30, 2008 and the year ended December 31, 2007.

Secured Receivables Credit Facility
During 2002, the Company completed a receivable backed financing transaction (the secured receivables credit facility) making available a $30,000 line of credit less any obligations from time to time under the Term Loan described below and limited to 85% of eligible account receivable. The secured receivables credit facility was provided by PNC Bank and originally expired in October 2007. On March 2, 2007 PNC sold the Companys loan to Steel City Capital Financing (Steel City). On March 21, 2007 the Company amended its loan agreement with Steel City, whereby the covenants became less restrictive and the credit facility was reduced to $27,350. Interest on the secured receivable credit facility is variable and is based on either PNCs base commercial lending rate plus 1.25% or a 30, 60 or 90 day Eurodollar rate plus 3.0% at the election of the Company. As a result of lockbox requirements and a material adverse change clause, borrowings outstanding under the secured receivables credit facility are classified as a current liability. The amount of the unused line of credit, available subject to the terms of the agreement, at June 30, 2008 and December 31, 2007 was approximately $3,800 and $11,500, respectively.

The interest rate on the secured receivables credit facility at June 30, 2008 and December 31, 2007 ranged from 9% to 9.75%, respectively.
In addition, the Company has an outstanding letter of credit in the amount of $4,733 relating to its workers compensation program. Approximately $4,970 of the Companys cash is restricted as to use and is the collateral for the letter of credit. Fees relating to the letter of credit ranged from 2.25% to 2.25%, per annum for the six months ended June 30, 2008 and 2007, respectively. There were no borrowings under the letter of credit at June 30, 2008 and December 31, 2007.
Term Loans
The secured receivables credit facility and term loan include various affirmative covenants, the most restrictive of which is the minimum EBITDA requirement. In addition, the Company and Steel City agreed to amend the credit agreement to extend the facility to June 2009. In connection therewith, during 2007 Steel City provided an additional $2 million term loan for working capital purposes. As of December 31, 2007, the $2 million was repaid.
As of December 31, 2007, the Company was not in compliance with certain financial covenants. In March 2008, the Company received a waiver for all covenant violations through the date of the amended loan agreement.
Capital Lease Obligations
During 2008, the Company entered into a number of leases for computer equipment and related items. All leases that qualified as capital leases have a term of 48 months or less.
Chemed Note
In connection with the 2002 Patient Care acquisition, the Company borrowed $12,500 from Chemed Corporation (Chemed) and issued 112,845 warrants to purchase common stock of Patient Care. Interest payments are paid quarterly on the last business day of March, June, September, and December. The principal balance was originally due in total on October 11, 2007. Interest will be paid on the principal balance remaining at the rate of 7.5% per year from the period of October 11, 2002 through September 30, 2004; 8.5% per year from October 1, 2004 through September 30, 2005 and; 9.5% per year from October 1, 2005 through October 11, 2007. In connection with the 2006 settlement of the lawsuit with Chemed, the Company converted $2.2 million of accrued liabilities into a note due October 2007, and recorded a gain on the settlement of $813, net of $263 of expenses. In March, 2007, the Company revised the note agreement to extend the maturity date to October 10, 2009, increase the interest rate to 11.50%, and provide for additional payments to be made ranging from $750 to $1.5 million. As of June 30, 2008 and December 31, 2007, notes payable to Chemed was $0 and $9,701, respectively.

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION
 
The unaudited pro forma consolidated statements of income for the six months ended June 30, 2008 and the year ended December 31, 2007 give effect to Almost Family, Inc.s (the Company) August 1, 2008 acquisition of Patient Care, Inc. (Patient Care) as if the acquisition had been completed on January 1, 2007.
 
The unaudited pro forma consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2008, gives effect to the acquisition as if the transaction had occurred on June 30, 2008.
 
The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information should be read in conjunction with the Companys historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in the Companys periodic reports previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, along with the historical financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 8-K/A. The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information may not necessarily reflect the financial position or results of operations which would have been obtained if these transactions had been consummated on the dates indicated in the unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information.
 
The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial data are based on preliminary estimates and assumptions set forth in the notes to such information that we believe are reasonable. Pro forma adjustments are necessary to reflect the estimated purchase price and changes in our capital structure and to adjust amounts related to Patient Care assets and liabilities to a preliminary estimate of their fair values. Pro forma adjustments are also necessary to reflect interest expense and the income tax effects related to the pro forma adjustments.

On August 1, 2008, Almost Family completed the acquisition of Patient Care for $45.2 million, subject to a working capital adjustment. The acquisition was previously under a definitive agreement signed on June 18, 2008. The acquisition added $47 million in annual revenues and eight locations in New Jersey, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania. Due to the transition, wind down costs and the timing of the close, the acquisition is not expected to contribute significantly to earnings in 2008 but is expected to be accretive to EPS in 2009.
 
On October 14, 2008, Almost Family announced that it had been ranked No. 24 in Forbes' 2008 listing of the 200 Best Small Companies in America, rising from its No. 77 ranking in 2007.

The registration statement on Form S-3 has not yet become effective. Securities may not be sold nor may offers to buy be accepted prior to the time that the registration statement becomes effective. This news release does not constitute an offer to sell, or the solicitation of an offer to buy securities, nor shall there be any sale of securities in any state in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification of the securities under the securities laws of that state.

Non-GAAP Financial Measure
The information provided in the tables in this release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined under Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules. In accordance with SEC rules, the Company has provided, in the supplemental information and the footnotes to the tables, a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.
 
EBITDA:
EBITDA is defined as income before depreciation and amortization, net interest expense and income taxes. EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. It should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income, operating income, cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities, or any other measure calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The items excluded from EBITDA are significant components in understanding and evaluating financial performance and liquidity. Management routinely calculates and communicates EBITDA and believes that it is useful to investors because it is commonly used as an analytical indicator within our industry to evaluate performance, measure leverage capacity and debt service ability, and to estimate current or prospective enterprise value. EBITDA is also used in certain covenants contained in our credit agreement.
 
The following tables set forth a reconciliation of Continuing Operations Net Income to EBITDA:

EBITDA:
EBITDA is defined as income before depreciation and amortization, net interest expense and income taxes. EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. It should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income, operating income, cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities, or any other measure calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The items excluded from EBITDA are significant components in understanding and evaluating financial performance and liquidity. Management routinely calculates and communicates EBITDA and believes that it is useful to investors because it is commonly used as an analytical indicator within our industry to evaluate performance, measure leverage capacity and debt service ability, and to estimate current or prospective enterprise value. EBITDA is also used in certain covenants contained in our credit agreement.

(1) places the patient, including family members and other informal caregivers, at the center of the care team;
(2) focuses on in-person contact with beneficiaries;
(3) maintains a close relationship between care coordinators and primary care physicians; and
(4) relies on a team-based approach to interventions such as comprehensive care assessments, care planning  and self-management coaching.

Reimbursement Uncertainty WHAT is going on?
Presidents Feb 2009 budget proposal set everything spinning
Follows MedPac -- 5.5% cut in 2010, then rebasing in 2011
Proposing post-acute bundling phase-in that could begin in 2015
Obamas need for speed and absence of any other voice puts all the emphasis on MedPacs recommendations
Senate and House resolutions do NOT reflect cuts to home health reimbursement
Political Process at work  you count on:
Continuous annual reconsideration of rates
Long term downward pressure on margins
Ups and Downs in expectations until Federal budget cycle is done
23
Reimbursement Uncertainty  How do we deal with it?
Make sure Home Health has a seat at the table
Collaborate with NAHC and AHHQI to educate and inform
Research, grassroots, CEO time in DC
Deal with long term margin shrink:
#1 Organic admissions growth
#2 Excel at the operational fundamentals
#3 Be a consolidator and densify geographic span of control
Deal with short term uncertainty
:
Manage debt levels more conservatively
Value acquisitions more conservatively,
Pace ourselves until we know more
24
Same store sales growth (including post-acquisition)
10%-15% same store volume growth
Incremental 30%-40% same store revenue margin (subject to change with rates)
Favorable acquisition economics
Agency contribution 20%-25% of revenue, paying 4x-5x (subject to change with rates)
Incremental overhead 2%-3% of revenue
Strong ROI, accretive investments
Follow-on startups enhance returns
Margin implications
Volume-based incremental margin largely offsets rate cuts (case-mix creep adj)
Continue emphasis on efficiency of operations, improved clinical outcomes
EPS implications
Conditions remain for long-term EPS growth as a consolidator
Investment Thesis Remains:
  
Long-Term EPS Growth as Low Cost Provider
25
Investment Highlights
Annual revenue run rate now over $275 million
Leading regional home health provider
40+% three year revenue CAGR
Decentralized operating model
Strong capital position
$50 million available for future growth
Disciplined approach to acquisitions driven by seasoned   management
Growing force in consolidating home health care market
13 acquisitions in three years
Three geographic clusters: Northeast, Southeast and Midwest

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On August 5, 2009, Almost Family, Inc. (the "Company") entered into a Distribution Agreement with J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. ("JPMS") pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell from time to time through JPMS, as the Company's distribution agent, up to 1,600,000 shares of the Company's common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $50,000,000. The shares will be issued and sold pursuant to the Company's shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-155051), which became effective on December 12, 2008 (the "Registration Statement").
 
Under the Distribution Agreement, the Company will designate the minimum price and maximum number of shares to be sold through JPMS on any given trading day or over a specified period of trading days, and JPMS will use commercially reasonable efforts to sell such shares on such days, subject to certain conditions. Sales of the shares, if any, will be made by means of ordinary brokers' transaction on the NASDAQ Global Market at market prices or as otherwise agreed with JPMS. The Company may also offer to sell shares directly to JPMS, as principal for its own account, in which case the Company and JPMS will enter into a separate agreement containing the terms agreed to by the parties relating to such sale. JPMS will receive from the Company a commission equal to 2.5% of the gross sales price per share for any shares sold through it as distribution agent under the Distribution Agreement.
 
The Company is not obligated to sell and JPMS is not obligated to buy or sell any of the shares under the Distribution Agreement. No assurance can be given that the Company will sell any of the shares under the Distribution Agreement, or, if it does, as to the price or amount of common stock that it sells, or the dates when such sales will take place.
 
The Distribution Agreement is filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K, and the above description of certain terms of the Distribution Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to such exhibit. For a more detailed description of the Distribution Agreement, see the disclosure under the caption "Plan of distribution" contained in the Company's prospectus supplement dated August 5, 2009 to the prospectus dated December 12, 2008, which has been filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
 
In the ordinary course of their business, JPMS and/or their affiliates have in the past performed, and may continue to perform, investment banking, broker dealer, financial advisory or other services for us for which they have received, or may receive, separate fees. Under our credit agreement, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is administrative agent and JPMS is sole bookrunner and sole lead arranger. To the extent proceeds from the sale of our common stock under the Distribution Agreement are used to repay borrowings under our credit agreement, JPMorgan Chase Bank will receive a portion of such proceeds.

Basic Prospectus means the prospectus dated December 12, 2008, filed as part of the Registration Statement, including the documents incorporated by reference therein as of the date of such prospectus; Prospectus Supplement means the most recent prospectus supplement relating to the Shares, to be filed by the Company with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act on or before the second business day after the date of its first use in connection with a public offering or sale of Shares pursuant hereto (or such earlier time as may be required under the Act), in the form furnished by the Company to JPMS in connection with the offering of the Shares; Prospectus means the Prospectus Supplement (and any additional prospectus supplement prepared in accordance with the provisions of Sections 4(b) or 4(g) of this Agreement and filed in accordance with the provisions of Rule 424(b)) together with the Basic Prospectus attached to or used with the Prospectus Supplement; and Permitted Free Writing Prospectuses has the meaning set forth in

The Company and JPMS agree as follows:

Transactions entered into hereunder. JPMS will use commercially reasonable efforts to sell such Shares in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof and of the applicable Transaction Notice (as defined below). Neither the Company nor JPMS shall have any obligation to enter into an Agency Transaction. The Company shall be obligated to issue and sell through JPMS, and JPMS shall be obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts, as provided herein and in the applicable Transaction Notice, to place Shares issued by the Company only if and when a Transaction Notice related to such an Agency Transaction has been delivered by JPMS and accepted by the Company as provided in Section 2 below.

Provided that JPMS confirms to the Company the number of Shares sold in accordance with Section 1(d) above, the Company shall have responsibility for maintaining records with respect to the aggregate dollar amount of Shares sold, or for otherwise monitoring the availability of Shares for sale under the Registration Statement.

(confirmed promptly by e-mail or facsimile), suspend the offering of the Shares for any reason;
provided
,
however
, that such suspension or termination shall not affect or impair the parties respective obligations with respect to the Shares sold hereunder prior to the giving of such notice.

          Subsequent to the relevant Time of Acceptance, (A) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded any securities of or guaranteed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries by any nationally recognized statistical rating organization, as such term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Act and (B) no such organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, or has changed its outlook with respect to, its rating of any securities of or guaranteed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries (other than an announcement with positive implications of a possible upgrading) in each case that has not been described in any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus issued prior to any related Time of Sale.
          The Shares to be issued pursuant to the Transaction Notice or pursuant to a Terms Agreement, as applicable, shall have been submitted for listing on the Exchange.

          (A) No order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement shall be in effect, no proceeding for such purpose or pursuant to Section 8A of the Act shall be pending before or threatened by the Commission and no notice of objection of the Commission to the use of the Registration Statement pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) under the Act shall have been received by the Company; (B) the Prospectus and each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus shall have been timely filed with the Commission under the Act (in the case of any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, to the extent required by Rule 433 under the Act); (C) all requests by the Commission for additional information shall have been complied with to the satisfaction of JPMS; and (D) no suspension of the

(ii) In the case of any purchase by JPMS pursuant to a Terms Agreement, the obligations of JPMS pursuant to such Terms Agreement shall be subject to termination at any time prior to or at the Principal Settlement Date, if, (A) since the time of execution of the Terms Agreement or the respective dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, (i) trading generally shall have been
 
29
 
materially suspended or materially limited on or by, as the case may be, any of the NYSE, the American Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ Global Select Market, (ii) trading of any securities of the Company shall have been suspended on any exchange or in any over-the counter market, (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities in New York shall have been declared by either federal or New York state authorities, (iv) there shall have occurred any attack on, or outbreak or escalation of hostilities or act of terrorism involving, the United States, or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis that, in each case, in JPMSs judgment, is material and adverse or (v) there shall have occurred any material disruption of settlements of securities or clearance services in the United States that would materially impair settlement and clearance with respect to the Shares and (B) in the case of any of the events specified in clauses (A)(i) through (v), such event singly or together with any other such event specified in clauses (A)(i) through (v) makes it, in JPMSs judgment, impracticable to market the Shares on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus. If JPMS elects to terminate its obligations pursuant to this Section 8(b)(ii), the Company shall be notified promptly in writing.
 
30
 
therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, not misleading or (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in each case except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to JPMS furnished to the Company in writing by JPMS expressly for use therein, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by JPMS consists of the information described as such in subsection (b) below.
 
31
 
proceeding, as incurred. In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless (i) the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the contrary; (ii) the Indemnifying Person has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person; (iii) the Indemnified Person shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to the Indemnifying Person; or (iv) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) included both the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood and agreed that the Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that all such fees and expenses shall be paid or reimbursed as they are incurred. Any such separate firm for JPMS, its affiliates, directors and officers and any control persons of JPMS shall be designated in writing by JPMS and any such separate firm for the Company, its directors, its officers who signed the Registration Statement and any control persons of the Company shall be designated in writing by the Company. The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify each Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No Indemnifying Person shall, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an Indemnified Person shall have requested an Indemnifying Person to reimburse the Indemnified Person for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by this Section 9(c), the Indemnifying Person agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 60 days after receipt by such Indemnifying Person of the aforesaid request, (ii) such Indemnifying Person shall have received notice of the terms of the proposed settlement at least 30 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) such Indemnifying Person shall not have reimbursed the Indemnified Person in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement; provided, however, that an Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any such settlement entered into without its consent if such Indemnifying Person,
 
32
 
prior to the date of such settlement (1) reimburses such Indemnified Person in accordance with the applicable request for the amount of the requested fees and expenses and (2) provides written notice to the Indemnified Person that the Indemnifying Person disputes in good faith its obligation hereunder to reimburse such costs and expenses.

Miscellaneous
. JPMS, an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase & Co., is not a bank and is separate from any affiliated bank, including any U.S. branch or agency of JPMorgan Chase Bank.

Securities sold, offered or recommended by JPMS are not deposits, are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, are not guaranteed by a branch or agency of JPMorgan Chase Bank, and are not otherwise an obligation or responsibility of a branch or agency of JPMorgan Chase Bank.
A lending affiliate of JPMS may have lending relationships with issuers of securities underwritten or privately placed by JPMS. To the extent required under the securities laws, prospectuses and other disclosure documents for securities underwritten or privately placed by JPMS will disclose the existence of any such lending relationships and whether the proceeds of the issue will be used to repay debts owed to affiliates of JPMS.
JPMS and one or more of its affiliates may make markets in the Common Stock or other securities of the Company, in connection with which they may buy and sell, as agent or principal, for long or short account, shares of the Common Stock or other securities of the Company, at the same time that JPMS is acting as agent pursuant to this Agreement; provided that JPMS acknowledges and agrees that any such transactions are not being, and shall not be deemed to have been, undertaken at the request or direction of, or for the account of, the Company, and that the Company has and shall have no control over any decision by JPMS and its affiliates to enter into any such transactions.
In the event the Company, during the period commencing on the date hereof and ending on June 30, 2010, commences any public or private offering of equity or equity-linked securities, the Company shall offer JPMorgan the bona fide right to act as exclusive solicitation agent, exclusive dealer manager and/or sole book-runner and sole lead underwriter, sole lead initial purchaser or sole lead placement agent in any such transactions. If JPMS agrees to act in any such capacity, any such agreement would be set forth in an underwriting agreement, purchase agreement, placement agency agreement or other form of agreement, as applicable, to be entered into by the Company and JPMS which will be in JPMSs customary form and contain mutually acceptable terms and conditions, including JPMorgans compensation or other appropriate financial terms and an indemnification of JPMorgan.

On August 5, 2009 Almost Family, Inc. (the "Company") filed a prospectus supplement and a distribution agreement with J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. ("J.P.Morgan"), relating to shares of our common stock, par value $0.10 per share.
 
Under the distribution agreement, we may offer and sell up to 1,600,000 shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $50 million from time to time through J.P Morgan, as our distribution agent. Sales of the shares, if any, will be made by means of ordinary brokers' transactions on the NASDAQ Global Market at market prices or as otherwise agreed by us and J.P Morgan. Additionally, the Company from time to time may issue shares under its employee and director stock option plans and its employee stock purchase plan.
 
In connection with these stock offerings, the Company is making the following disclosure:
 
As we have previously disclosed, our strategic business plan calls for the expansion of our VN segment by selectively acquiring other Medicare-certified home health agencies. We routinely identify and evaluate potential acquisition targets and at any given time, may be in discussions to acquire one or more companies. We have historically entered into non-binding letters of intent with the target home health agencies to set forth the basic business terms of a potential acquisition, which are usually subject to various closing conditions, including due diligence, the negotiation of definitive acquisition documents, regulatory consents and other customary matters.
 
Since 2004, we have completed 15 transactions involving targets ranging from start-up companies with no revenue to annual revenues of $47 million, with valuations ranging from 0.5 times revenue to 1.2 times revenue. We typically target companies that have annual revenue ranging from $1 million to $60 million
,
with expected purchase prices within the valuation range previously paid by us. Additionally, from time to time we may consider acquisitions of significantly larger companies.
 
On September 14, 2009, we entered into a letter of intent reflecting our proposal to acquire all of the ownership interests of a target operating certain Medicare-certified home health agencies owned by the target. The letter of intent is nonbinding and subject to various closing conditions, including due diligence and the negotiation of definitive acquisition documents. Any closing of the transaction would be subject to regulatory approvals and other customary conditions set forth in a definitive acquisition agreement. The letter of intent contemplates consideration of cash, notes payable and shares of our common stock. The purchase price in the letter of intent entered into on September 14, 2009 is in the upper quintile of the range described in the immediately preceding paragraph.
 
We anticipate that we would finance the cash portion of the acquisition either through use of our existing cash on hand and available borrowing capacity or with proceeds from the issuance of equity securities, or a combination of both, depending on available capital and market conditions existing at the time of execution of definitive documentation.
 
 
 
 
We cannot readily predict the timing, size, and success of our acquisition efforts and the associated capital commitments.  We cannot provide any assurance that any preliminary discussions or letters of intent will result in the execution of definitive documentation, nor that the execution of definitive documentation will lead to the successful completion of an acquisition.

EBITDA:
activities, or any other measure calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The items excluded from EBITDA are significant components in understanding and evaluating financial performance and liquidity. Management routinely calculates and communicates EBITDA and believes that it is useful to investors because it is commonly used as an analytical indicator within our industry to evaluate performance, measure leverage capacity and debt service ability, and to estimate current or prospective enterprise value. EBITDA is also used in certain covenants contained in our credit agreement.
EBITDA is defined as income before depreciation and amortization, net interest expense and income taxes. EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. It should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income,  operating income,  cash flows from operating, investing or financing

On September 15, 2009, Almost Family, Inc. (the Company) filed a Current Report on Form 8-K (the Original Report).  This Current Report on Form 8-K/A amends the Original Report to update to the extent set forth in this filing the information contained in the Original Report with respect to a letter of intent entered into by the Company on September 14, 2009.
   
 
 
Item 8.01 Other Events
   
 As we have previously disclosed, our strategic business plan calls for the expansion of our VN segment by selectively acquiring other Medicare-certified home health agencies. We routinely identify and evaluate potential acquisition targets and at any given time, may be in discussions to acquire one or more companies. We have historically entered into non-binding letters of intent with the target home health agencies to set forth the basic business terms of a potential acquisition, which are usually subject to various closing conditions, including due diligence, the negotiation of definitive acquisition documents, regulatory consents and other customary matters.
   
 
 Since 2004, we have completed 15 transactions involving targets ranging from start-up companies with no revenue to annual revenues of $47 million, with valuations ranging from 0.5 times revenue to 1.2 times revenue. We typically target companies that have annual revenue ranging from $1 million to $60 million, with expected purchase prices within the valuation range previously paid by us. Additionally, from time to time we may consider acquisitions of significantly larger companies.
   
 
 As previously announced, on September 14, 2009, we entered into a letter of intent reflecting our proposal to acquire all of the ownership interests of a target operating certain Medicare-certified home health agencies owned by the target, the proposed purchase price of which was in the upper quintile of the range described in the immediately preceding paragraph.
   
   
 By mutual agreement, the Company and the target terminated the letter of intent on November 19, 2009.
   
 
   
Although we do not currently have other similarly sized transactions under letter of intent, we continue to pursue and consider transactions of such size or larger, individually or in the aggregate.
 
We cannot readily predict the time, size, and success of our acquisition efforts and the associated capital commitments.  We cannot provide any assurance that any preliminary discussions or letters of intent will result in the execution of definitive documentation, or that the execution of definitive documentation will lead to the successful completion of an acquisition.  In the ordinary course of business, we have entered into several non-binding letters of intent involving targets with a wide range of revenue which have not resulted in the successful completion of an acquisition.

The information provided in the tables in this release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined under Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules.  In accordance with SEC rules, the Company has provided, in the supplemental information and the footnotes to the tables, a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.
EBITDA:
EBITDA is defined as income before depreciation and amortization, net interest expense and income taxes. EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. It should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income, operating income, cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities, or any other measure calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The items excluded from EBITDA are significant components in understanding and evaluating financial performance and liquidity. Management routinely calculates and communicates EBITDA and believes that it is useful to investors because it is commonly used as an analytical indicator within our industry to evaluate performance, measure leverage capacity and debt service ability, and to estimate current or prospective enterprise value. EBITDA is also used in certain covenants contained in our credit agreement.

Item 1.01                      Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
Effective as of December 2, 2010, Almost Family, Inc. (the "Company") entered into a $125,000,000 five-year senior secured revolving credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Bank of America, N.A., as Syndication Agent, and certain other lenders party thereto.  CitiBank, N.A. and Fifth Third Bank acted as Documentation Agents and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC acted as Sole Bookrunner and Sole Lead Arranger under the Credit Agreement.  Amounts available under the Credit Agreement are available for general corporate purposes including acquisitions.
Concurrently with the effectiveness of the Credit Agreement, the Company terminated its existing credit agreement dated as of July 15, 2008, with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Fifth Third Bank, as Syndication Agent, and certain other lenders party thereto (the Prior Agreement).  The Prior Agreement was due to mature on July 15, 2011, and was limited to aggregate borrowings thereunder of up to $75 million.  No material termination fees or penalties were incurred by the Company in connection with the termination of the Prior Agreement.  Other than amounts reserved for letters of credit as replaced by the Credit Agreement, no amounts were outstanding under the Prior Agreement at the time of its termination.
Under the Credit Agreement, which will mature on December 2, 2015, the Company and the lenders may enter into revolving loans, swingline loans, and issuances of letters of credit subject to certain amount limitations, in an amount up to $125 million in the aggregate outstanding at any time prior to maturity.  The Credit Agreement also contains an accordion feature which permits the Company to request from the Administrative Agent an increase of the total commitments under the Credit Agreement to $175 million.  Borrowings (other than letters of credit) under the Credit Agreement generally will bear interest at a rate varying from LIBO rate plus 2.25% to LIBO rate plus 3.25%, depending on leverage.  The Company is required to pay a quarterly commitment fee on the average daily unused amount of the commitment, which fee varies depending on the Company's leverage ratio.  Letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement are subject to a participation fee and related fronting fees.  Borrowings under the Credit Agreement will be secured by a first priority perfected security interest in all tangible and intangible assets of the Company and all existing and future direct and indirect subsidiaries of the Company, as guarantors.
The Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, customary events of default, and customary affirmative and negative covenants, including (among others) restrictions on indebtedness, liens, transactions with affiliates, acquisitions, investments, consolidations, mergers and asset sales.  The Credit Agreement contains three financial covenants relating to: (i) the adjusted fixed charge coverage ratio, (ii) the leverage ratio and (iii) net worth.
There are no material relationships between the Company or its affiliates and any of the lenders, other than as described above.
 
 
 
The foregoing description of the Credit Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Credit Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference.

Any payment made by a Lender pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement (other than the funding of ABR Revolving Loans or a Swingline Loan as contemplated above) shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement.
(f)  .  The Borrower's obligation to reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of [i] any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein, [ii] any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, [iii] payment by the Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against prese ntation of a draft or other document that does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit, or [iv] any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, the Borrower's obligations hereunder.

The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or wilful misconduct on the part of the Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), the Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination.  In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the pa rties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.

In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day fr om and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at [i] in the case of such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation or [ii] in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to ABR Loans.

The Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a se parate Borrowing.  This Section shall not apply to Swingline Borrowings, which may not be converted or continued.

Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Borrower, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing [i] no outstanding Revolving Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing and [ii] unless repaid, each Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto.

and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender or such other Recipient of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the cost to such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such other Recipient of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such other Recipient hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the Borrower will pay to such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such other Recipient, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such other Recipient, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
(b)  If any Lender or the Issuing Bank determines that any Change in Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's capital or on the capital of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by the Issuing Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's policies and the policies of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company with respect to ca pital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company for any such reduction suffered.
(c)  A certificate of a Lender or the Issuing Bank setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  The Borrower shall pay such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.

(d)  [Intentionally Omitted]
(e)  Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's right to demand such compensation; that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or the Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 270 days prior to the date that such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's intention to claim compensation therefor; that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 270-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.

SECTION 2.16.    In the event of [a] the payment of any principal of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default), [b] the conversion of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, [c] the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Eurodollar Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice may be revoked under Section 2.11(b) and is revoked in accordance therewith), or [d] the assignment of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.19, then, in any such event, the Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense attributable to such event.  In the case of a Eurodollar Loan, such loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of [i] the amount of interest which would have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such event not occurred, at the Adjusted LIBO Rate that would have been applicable to such Loan, for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have been the Interest Period for such Loan), over [ii] the amount of interest which would accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest rate which such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for dollar deposits of a comp arable amount and period from other banks in the eurodollar market.  A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

SECTION 2.17.  .
Taxes
(a) Withholding of Taxes; Gross-Up. Each payment by any Obligor under any Loan Document shall be made without withholding for any Taxes, unless such withholding is required by any law. If any Withholding Agent determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it is so required to withhold Taxes, then such Withholding Agent may so withhold and shall timely pay the full amount of withheld Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law. If such Taxes are Indemnified Taxes, then the amount payable by the Obligor shall be increased as necessary so that net of such withholding (including such withholding applicable to additional amounts payable under this Section), the applicable Recipient receives the amount it would have received had no such wit hholding been made.
(b) Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrower. The Borrower shall timely pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
 
36
 
(c) Evidence of Payments. As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes by the Obligor to a Governmental Authority, such Obligor shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
(d) Indemnification by the Obligors.  The Obligors shall jointly and severally indemnify each Recipient for any Indemnified Taxes that are paid or payable by such Recipient in connection with an Loan Document (including amounts payable under this Section 2.17(d)) and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. The indemnity under this Section 2.17(d) shall be paid within 10 days after the Recipient delivers to the Borrower a certificate stating the amount of any Indemnified Taxes so payable by such Recipient. Such certificate shall be conclusive of the amount so payable absent manifest error. Such Recipient shall deliver a copy of su ch certificate to the Administrative Agent. In the case of any Lender making a claim under this Section 2.17(d) on behalf of any of its beneficial owners, an indemnity payment under this Section 2.17(d) shall be due only to the extent that such Lender is able to establish that, with respect to the applicable Indemnified Taxes, such beneficial owners supplied to the applicable Persons such properly completed and executed documentation necessary to claim any applicable exemption from, or reduction of, such Indemnified Taxes.
(e) Indemnification by the Lenders. Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent for any Taxes (but, in the case of any Indemnified Taxes, only to the extent that the Borrower has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Obligors to do so) and the Obligors for any Excluded Taxes, in each case attributable to such Lender that are paid or payable by the Administrative Agent or the applicable Obligor (as applicable) in connection with any Loan Document and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes or Excluded Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. The indemnity under this Section 2.17(e) shall be paid within 10 days after the Administrative Agent or the Borrower (as applicable) delivers to the applicable Lender a certificate stating the amount of Taxes or Excluded Taxes so paid or payable by the Administrative Agent or the Obligor (as applicable). Such certificate shall be conclusive of the amount so paid or payable absent manifest error.
(f) Status of Lenders.
(i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from, or reduction of, any applicable withholding Tax with respect to any payments under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times prescribed by law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without, or at a reduced rate of, withholding. In addition, any Lender, if requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administ rative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 2.17(f)(ii) and (iii) below) shall not be required if in the Lender's judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender. Upon the reasonable request of such Borrower or the Administrative Agent, any Lender shall
 
37
 
update any form or certification previously delivered pursuant to this Section 2.17(f). If any form or certification previously delivered pursuant to this Section expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect with respect to a Lender, such Lender shall promptly (and in any event within 10 days after such expiration, obsolescence or inaccuracy) notify such Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of such expiration, obsolescence or inaccuracy and update the form or certification if it is legally eligible to do so.
(ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if the Borrower is a U.S. Person, any Lender with respect to such Borrower shall, if it is legally eligible to do so, deliver to such Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies reasonably requested by such Borrower and the Administrative Agent) on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a party hereto, duly completed and executed copies of whichever of the following is applicable:
(A) in the case of a Lender that is a U.S. Person, IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. Federal backup withholding tax;
(B) in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party [1] with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. Federal withholding Tax pursuant to the "interest" article of such tax treaty and [2] with respect to any other applicable payments under this Agreement, IRS Form W-8BEN establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. Federal withholding Tax pursuant to the "business profits" or "other income" article of such tax treaty;
(C) in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender for whom payments under this Agreement constitute income that is effectively connected with such Lender's conduct of a trade or business in the United States, IRS Form W-8ECI;
(D) in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code both [1] IRS Form W-8BEN and [2] a certificate substantially in the form of (a "") to the effect that such Lender is not [a] a "bank" within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, [b] a "10 percent shareholder" of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code [c] a "controlled foreign corporation" described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code and [d] conducting a trade or business in the United States with which the relevant interest payments are eff ectively connected;
Exhibit D
U.S. Tax Certificate
(E) in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender that is not the beneficial owner of payments made under this Agreement (including a partnership or a participating Lender) [1] an IRS Form W-8IMY on behalf of itself and [2] the relevant forms prescribed in clauses (A), (B), (C), (D) and (F) of this paragraph (f)(ii) that would be required of each such beneficial owner or partner of such partnership if such beneficial owner or partner were a Lender; provided, however, that if the Lender is a partnership and one or more of its partners are claiming the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, such Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Certificate on behalf of such partners; or
(F) any other form prescribed by law as a basis for claiming exemption from, or a reduction of, U.S. Federal withholding Tax together with such supplementary documentation necessary to enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the amount of Tax (if any) required by law to be withheld.
(iii) If a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. Federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the
 
38
 
applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Withholding Agent, at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Withholding Agent, such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Withholding Agent as may be necessary for the Withholding Agent to comply with its obligations under FATCA, to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender's obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.
(g) Treatment of Certain Refunds. If any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section 2.17 (including additional amounts paid pursuant to this Section 2.17), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including any Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund).  Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid to such indemnified party pursuant to the previous sentence (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.17(g), in no event will any indemnified party be required to pay any amount to any indemnifying party pursuant to this Section 2.17(g) if such payment would place such indemnified party in a less favorable position (on a net after-Tax basis) than such indemnified party would have been in if the indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid. This Section 2.17(g) shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes which it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.
(h) Survival.  [intentionally omitted].
(i) Issuing Bank. For purposes of Section 2.17(e) and (f), the term "Lender" includes any Issuing Bank.
SECTION 2.18.  
Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs.
(a)  The Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees or reimbursement of LC Disbursements, or of amounts payable under Section 2.15, 2.16 or 2.17, or otherwise) prior to 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without set-off or counterclaim.  Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon.  All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its offices at 270 Park Avenue, New York, New York, except payments to be made directly to the Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender as expre ssly provided herein and except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto.  The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof.  Payments made by the Administrative Agent to Lenders of amounts due with respect to the Commitment of the Lenders shall be apportioned according to the Applicable Percentage of each Lender.  If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension.  All payments hereunder shall be made in dollars.
 
39
 
(b)  If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied [i] first, towards payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and [ii] second, towards payment of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties.
(c)  If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Revolving Loans or participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans; that [i] if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered,  such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and [ii] the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply).  The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.
provided
(d)  Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due.  In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.
(e)  If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.05(c), 2.06(d) or (e), 2.07(b), 2.18(d) or 9.03(c), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion and notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, [i] apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Swingline Lender or the Issuing Bank to satisfy such Lenders obligations to it under such Section until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid, and/or [ii] hold any such amounts in a segregated account as cash collateral for, and application to, any future funding obligations of such Lender under any such Section, in the case of each of clauses [i] and [ii] above, i n any order as determined by the Administrative Agent in its discretion.

SECTION 2.19.  
Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.
(a)           If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment [i] would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.17, as the case may be, in the future and [ii] would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender.  The B orrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.
(b)
 
If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, or if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); that [i] the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent (and if a Commitment is being assigned, the Issuing Bank), which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, [ii] such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts) and [iii] in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.15 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.17, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments.  A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.

(a)  .  The Borrower may, at any time and from time to time (but in no event more than once during each fiscal year of Borrower), request, by notice to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agents approval of an increase of the total Commitments (a ) within the limitations hereafter described, which request shall set forth the amount of each such requested Commitment Increase.  Within twenty (20) days of such request, the Administrative Agent shall determine in accordance with its customary underwriting standards then in effect whether or not it approves the Commit ment Increase and advise the Borrower in writing of its approval or disapproval of such request and, if the request is not approved, the reasons therefor.  Failure to so advise the Borrower within twenty (20) days shall not constitute approval or disapproval. If the Administrative Agent approves any such Commitment Increase, then the total Commitment may be so increased (up to the amount of such approved Commitment Increase) by having one or more New Lenders increase the amount of their then existing Commitments or become Lenders, provided however that approval by the Administrative Agent is not a commitment by the Administrative Agent to increase its Commitment or to find New Lenders.  Any Commitment Increase shall be subject to the following limitations and conditions:  [i] any increase (in the aggregate) in the total Commitment and the amount (in the aggregate) of any new Commitment
Request for Increase

and/or any amount (in the aggregate) of any increase in the Commitment of any New Lender, shall not be less than $1,000,000 (and shall be in integral multiples of $500,000 if in excess thereof); [ii] no Commitment Increase pursuant to this Section 2.20 shall increase the total Commitment to an amount in excess of $175,000,000; [iii] the Borrower and each New Lender shall have executed and delivered a Commitment and Acceptance and the Administrative Agent shall have accepted and executed the same; [iv] the Borrower shall have executed and delivered to the Administrative Agent such Note or Notes as any such New Lender shall request to reflect such Commitment Increase; [v] the Borrower shall have delivered to the Administrative Agent opinions of counsel (substantially similar to the form of opinion provided for in Section 4.01, modified t o apply to the Commitment Increase and each Note and Commitment and Acceptance executed and delivered in connection therewith); [vi] all Guarantors shall have consented in writing to the Commitment Increase and shall have agreed that their Guaranties continue in full force and effect; and (vii) the Borrower and each New Lender shall otherwise have executed and delivered such other instruments and documents, including but not limited to modifications of the Mortgages, Security Agreement, Pledge of Equity Interests to, among other things reflect the Commitment Increase, as the Administrative Agent shall have reasonably requested in connection with such Commitment Increase.  The form and substance of the documents required under through [ above shall be acceptable to the Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent shall provide written notice to all of the Lenders hereunder of any Commitment Increase.
clauses [iii]

(b)           .  Upon the effective date of any increase in the total Commitment pursuant to the provisions hereof, which effective date shall be mutually agreed upon by the Borrower, each New Lender and the Administrative Agent, each New Lender shall make a payment to the Administrative Agent in an amount sufficient, upon the application of such payments by all New Lenders to the reduction of the outstanding Revolving Loan held by the Lenders, to cause the principal amount outstanding under the Revolving Loans made by each Lender (including any New Lender) to be in the amount of its Applicable Percentage (upon the effective date of such increase) of all outstanding Revolving Loans.  The Borrower hereby irrevocably authorizes each New Lender to fund to the Administrative Agent the payment required to be made pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence for application to the reduction of the outstanding Revolving Loans held by the other Lenders hereunder.  If, as a result of the repayment of the Revolving Loan provided for in this Section 2.20(b), any payment of a Eurodollar Advance occurs on a day that is not the last day of the applicable Interest Period, the Borrower will pay to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of any of the Lenders holding a Eurodollar Loan any loss or cost incurred by such Lender resulting therefrom in accordance with Section 3.04.  Upon the effective date of such increase in the total Commitment, all Revolving Loans outstanding hereunder (including any Revolving Loans made by the New Lenders on such date) shall be ABR Loans, subject to the Borrowers right to c onvert the same to Eurodollar Loans on or after such date in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.07.
Revolving Loans by New Lenders
(c)           .  Upon the effective date of any increase in the total Commitment and the making of the Revolving Loans by the New Lenders in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.17(b), each New Lender also shall be deemed irrevocably and unconditionally to have purchased and received, without recourse or warranty, from the Lenders party to this Agreement immediately prior to the effective date of such increase, an undivided interest and participation in any Letter of Credit then outstanding, ratably, such that each Lender (including each New Lender) holds a participation interest in each such Letter o f Credit in proportion to the ratio that such Lenders Commitment (upon the effective date of such increase in the total Commitment) bears to the total Commitment as so increased.
New Lenders Participation in Letters of Credit
(d)           .  Nothing contained herein shall constitute, or otherwise be deemed to be, a commitment or agreement on the part of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to give or grant any Lender the right to increase its Commitment hereunder at any

                                (b)           the Commitment and Revolving Credit Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether all Lenders or the Required Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder (including any consent to any amendment or waiver pursuant to Section 9.02), except [i] such Defaulting Lenders Commitment may not be increased or extended without its consent and [ii] the principal amount of, or interest or fees payable on, Loans or LC Disbursements may not be reduced or excused or the scheduled date of payment may not be postponed as to such Defaulting Lend er without such Defaulting Lenders consent.
(c)           if any Swingline Exposure or LC Exposure exists at the time a Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender then:
 
(i)           all or any part of such Swingline Exposure and LC Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall be reallocated among the non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages but only to the extent the sum of all non-Defaulting Lenders Revolving Credit Exposures plus such Defaulting Lenders Swingline Exposure and LC Exposure does not exceed the total of all non-Defaulting Lenders Commitments; and
 
 
(ii)           if the reallocation described in clause (i) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrower shall within one Business Day following notice by the Administrative Agent [x] , prepay such Swingline Exposure and [y] , cash collateralize for the Issuing Bank only the Borrowers obligations corresponding to such Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure (after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to clause (i) above) in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.06(j) for so long as such LC Exposure is outstanding;

(iv)           if the LC Exposure of the non-Defaulting Lenders is reallocated pursuant to clause (i) above, then the fees payable to the Lenders pursuant to Section 2.12(a) and Section 2.12(b) shall be adjusted in accordance with such non-Defaulting Lenders Applicable Percentages; or

The bank serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and such bank and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent hereunder.
The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, [a] the Administrative Agent shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing, [b] the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise in writing as directed by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 9.02), and [c] except as expressly set forth herei n, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by the bank serving as Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.  The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided
 
57
 
in Section 9.02) or in the absence of its own gross negligence or wilful misconduct.  The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower or a Lender, and the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into [i] any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement, [ii] the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or in connection herewith, [iii] the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein, [iv] the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement or any other agreement, instrument or document, or [v] the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.
The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person.  The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon.  The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.
The Administrative Agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their respective Related Parties.  The exculpatory provisions of the preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.
Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Administrative Agent as provided in this paragraph, the Administrative Agent may resign at any time by notifying the Lenders, the Issuing Bank and the Borrower.  Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with the Borrower, to appoint a successor.  If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Bank, appoint a successor Administrative Agent which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of any such bank.& #160; Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder.  The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor.  After the Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 9.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was acting as Administrative Agent.
Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement.  Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate,
 
58
 
continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.
Lenders hereby irrevocably authorize Administrative Agent, at its option and in its discretion, to release any Lien granted to or held by Administrative Agent upon any Collateral [i] upon termination of the Commitments and upon final and indefeasible payment in full in cash and satisfaction of all Obligations and termination of this Agreement; [ii] constituting property being sold or disposed of in accordance with the Loan Documents; or [iii] constituting property leased to an Obligor under a lease that has expired or been terminated in a transaction permitted under this Agreement or is about to expire and which has not been, and is not intended by the applicable Obligor to be, renewed or extended.  Any such release shall not in any manner discharge, affect, or impair the Oblig ations or any Liens (other than those expressly being released) upon (or obligations of the Obligors in respect of) all interests retained by the Obligors, including the proceeds of any sale, all of which shall continue to constitute part of the Collateral and the Administrative Agent shall not be required to execute any such release on terms which, in the Administrative Agents reasonable opinion, would expose the Administrative Agent to liability or create any obligation or entail any consequence other than the release of such Liens without recourse or warranty.
Administrative Agent shall have no obligation whatsoever to any Lender or any other Person to assure that the property covered by this Agreement or the other Loan Documents exists or is owned by an Obligor or is cared for, protected or insured or has been encumbered or that the Liens granted to Administrative Agent on behalf of Lenders herein or pursuant hereto have been properly or sufficiently or lawfully created, perfected, protected or enforced or are entitled to any particular priority, or to exercise at all or in any particular manner or under any duty of care, disclosure or fidelity, or to continue exercising, any of the rights, authorities and powers granted or available to Administrative Agent in this Agreement or in any of the Loan Documents, it being understood and agreed that in respect of the property covered by this Agreement or the Loan Documents or any act, omission or event related thereto, Administrative Agent may act in any manner it may deem appropriate, in its discretion, given Administrative Agents own interest in property covered by this Agreement or the Loan Documents as one of the Lenders and that Administrative Agent shall have no duty or liability in that regard whatsoever to any of the other Lenders.
Each Lender hereby appoints each other Lender as agent for the purpose of perfecting Lenders security interest in Collateral which, in accordance with of the Uniform Commercial Code in any applicable jurisdiction, can be perfected only by possession.  Should any Lender (other than Administrative Agent) obtain possession of any such Collateral following an Event of Default, such Lender shall notify Administrative Agent thereof, and, promptly upon Administrative Agents request therefor, shall deliver such Collateral to Administrative Agent or in accordance with Administrative Agents instructions.  The Administrative Agent may file such proofs of claim or documents as may be n ecessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, their respective agents, financial advisors and counsel), allowed in any judicial proceedings relative to any Obligor, or any of their respective creditors or property, and shall be entitled and empowered to collect, receive and distribute any monies, securities or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims.  Any  custodian in any judicial proceedings relative to any Obligor is hereby authorized by each Lender to make payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Lenders, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Administrative Agent, its agents, financial advisors an d counsel, and any other amounts due the Administrative Agent.  Nothing contained in
Article 9
 
59
 
this Agreement or the other Loan Documents shall be deemed to authorize the Administrative Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Loans, or the rights of any holder thereof, or to authorize the Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender in any such proceeding, except as specifically permitted herein.
Each Lender agrees that, except as to Collateral in which a security interest may be perfected by possession, it will not have any right individually to enforce or seek to enforce this Agreement or any other Loan Document or to realize upon any Collateral for the benefit of the Lenders, it being understood and agreed that such rights and remedies may be exercised only by Administrative Agent.
Any proceeds of Collateral received by the Administrative Agent [i] not constituting a specific payment of principal, interest, fees or other sum payable under the Loan Documents (which shall be applied as specified by the Borrower) or [ii] after an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent so elects or the Required Lenders otherwise so direct, shall be applied ratably first, to pay any fees, indemnities, or expense reimbursements including amounts then due to the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank from the Borrower; second, to pay any fees or expense reimbursements then due to the Lenders from the Borrower; third, to pay interest then due and payable on the Loans ratably; fourth, to prepay principal on the Loans and unreimbursed LC Disbursements and any amounts owing with respect to Cash Management Products and Swap Obligations ratably; fifth, to pay an amount to the Administrative Agent equal to one hundred five percent (105%) of the aggregate LC Exposure, to be held as cash Collateral for such Obligations, and sixth, to the payment of any other Obligations due to the Administrative Agent or any Lender by the Borrower. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, unless so directed by the Borrower, or unless a Default is in existence, none of the Administrative Agent or any Lender shall apply any payment which it receives to any Eurodollar Loan of a Class, except [a] on the expiration date of the Interest Period applicable to any such Eurodollar Loan or [b] in the event, and only to the extent, that there are no outstanding ABR Loans of the same Class and, in any event, the Borrower shall pay the break funding payment required in accordance with Section 2.16.

Waivers; Amendments.
(a)  No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power.  The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have.  No waiver of any provision of any Loan Document or consent to any departure by an Obligor therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan or issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Issuing Bank may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time.
(b)  Neither this Agreement nor any other Loan Document nor any provision thereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Borrower and the Required Lenders or by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders and, in the case of any waiver, amendment or modification affecting Section 2.21, the consent of the Administrative Agent, the Swingline Lender and the Issuing Bank; that no such agreement shall [i] increase  the Commitment of any Lender without the written consent of such Lender, [ii] reduce or forgive the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement or reduce the rate of interest thereon, or reduce or forgive any fees payable hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby, [iii] postpone the scheduled date of payment of the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement, or any date for the payment of any interest thereon, or any fees or other Obligations payable under the Loan Documents, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment, or postpone the scheduled date of expiration of any Commitment, without the written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby, except that all Lenders Commitments may be reduced pro rata if the Borrower reduces Commitments pursuant to Section 2.09(b) hereof, [iv] change Section 2.18(a), (b) or (c) in a manner that would alter the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby,

Our management team and over 6,000 caregivers continued their uncompromising focus on our Senior Advocacy Mission providing the highest quality home care to our patients throughout the communities we serve.

Fourth Quarter Financial Results
Almost Family reported fourth quarter 2010 net service revenues of $84.6 million, an 8.5% increase from $78.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2009.
Net income for the fourth quarter of 2010 was $7.0 million, or $0.75 per diluted share, compared to $6.8 million, or $0.73 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2009.  Results for the quarter included the unfavorable impact of the 5.2% Medicare reimbursement rate cut for 2011 which reduced revenue, operating income and net income for episodes started in the fourth quarter which did not complete until 2011.  This rate cut lowered revenues by approximately $1.2 million and lowered diluted EPS by approximately $0.08.  Additionally, fees and expenses related to regulatory investigations lowered EPS by approximately $0.04.  Without these two externally imposed items diluted EPS would have been $0.87.
Fourth Quarter Segment Results
Net revenues in the Visiting Nurse segment for the fourth quarter of 2010 were $74.3 million, a 10% increase from $67.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2009.  The total revenue growth of $6.7 million came from a 10% organic growth rate plus $0.2 million from acquired operations.  Organic Medicare admission and episode growth were both also 10%.  Operating income before corporate expenses in the VN segment for the fourth quarter of 2010 was $16.2 million, a 9% increase from $14.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2009.
Net revenues in the Personal Care (PC) segment for the fourth quarter of 2010 were flat at $10.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 and 2009.  Operating income before unallocated corporate expenses in the PC segment was also flat at $1.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 and 2009.
Full Year Financial Results
Almost Family reported net service revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010 of $336.9 million, a 13% increase from $297.8 million in the same period of 2009.  Full year net income for 2010 was $30.7 million, or $3.28 per diluted share, compared to $24.6 million, or $2.86 per diluted share, for 2009 on 9% more diluted shares outstanding.  The Medicare rate cut described above also lowered fiscal year revenues by approximately $1.2 million and lowered diluted EPS by approximately $0.08.  Additionally, fees and expenses related to regulatory investigations lowered EPS by approximately $0.08.  Without these two externally imposed items diluted EPS would have been $3.44.
Full year net cash provided by operating activities increased 28% to $34.8 million in 2010 from $27.1 million in 2009.
Full Year Segment Results
Net revenues in the Visiting Nurse segment for 2010 were $294.9 million, a 15% increase from $256.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009.  The total revenue growth of $38.9 million came
 
 
 
Almost Family Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2010 Results

February 28, 2011
from a 14% organic growth rate plus $2.2 million from acquired operations.  Operating income before corporate expenses in the VN segment for 2010 was $66.3 million, a 23% increase from $54.0 million in the same period of 2009.
Full year net revenues in the Personal Care (PC) segment for 2010 were $42.0 million, a 0.5% increase from $41.8 million in 2009.  Operating income before unallocated corporate expenses in the PC segment for the twelve month period of 2010 was $5.7 million, an 11% increase from $5.2 million in the twelve month period of 2009.

Fees and expenses associated with these inquiries and their impact on the Companys financial results are described above.

In accordance with SEC rules, the Company has provided, in the supplemental information and the footnotes to the tables, a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.
EBITDA:
EBITDA is defined as net income before depreciation and amortization, net interest expense and income taxes. EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. It should not be considered in isolation or as

a substitute for net income, operating income, cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities, or any other measure calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The items excluded from EBITDA are significant components in understanding and evaluating financial performance and liquidity. Management routinely calculates and communicates EBITDA and believes that it is useful to investors because it is commonly used as an analytical indicator within our industry to evaluate performance, measure leverage capacity and debt service ability, and to estimate current or prospective enterprise value. EBITDA is also used in certain covenants contained in our credit agreement.

Exhibit 99.1
First Quarter Highlights:
 Almost Family, Inc. (Nasdaq: AFAM), a leading regional provider of home health nursing services, announced today its financial results for the three-months ended March 31, 2011.
Louisville, KY, April 28, 2011
William Yarmuth, Chief Executive Officer, commented, Our first quarter operating results mark the Companys first full quarter with the effect of the Medicare rate cut combined with other operational challenges from health care reform.  Despite these headwinds, we are pleased to announce favorable operating results and continued growth produced by the unwavering patient care focus of our Senior Advocacy Mission and our team of over 6,000.  Our organic admission and revenue growth continue to produce cash flow that further strengthens our balance sheet and positions us well for continued growth.
First Quarter Financial Results
Almost Family reported first quarter results that included the impact of the Medicare reimbursement rate cut for 2011 which reduced consolidated and Visiting Nurse (VN) segment revenue and pre-tax operating income by $3.9 million. This was partially offset by volume growth.
Net service revenues for the first quarter grew to $82.6 million, a 2% increase from $81.3 million reported in the first quarter of 2010.
Net income for the first quarter of 2011 was $5.7 million, or $0.61 per diluted share, down from first quarter of 2010 net income of $7.4 million, or $0.80 per diluted share. Fees and expenses related to governmental inquiries lowered first quarter 2011 EPS by approximately $0.03 while deal costs lowered first quarter 2011 EPS by approximately $0.01, without which diluted EPS
would have been $0.65.  There were no investigation or acquisition costs included in operating results for the first quarter of 2010.

First Quarter Segment Results

Operating income before corporate expenses in the VN segment for the first quarter of 2011 was $13.0 million, a $2.9 million decrease from $15.9 million reported for the first quarter of 2010 as the impact of VN admission growth offset approximately $1.0 million of the Medicare rate cut.
Net service revenues in the Personal Care (PC) segment for the first quarter of 2011 grew 1.4% or $0.1 million to $9.9 million from $9.8 million in the first quarter of 2010.  Operating income before unallocated corporate expenses in the PC segment increased 24.2% to $1.5 million from $1.2 million in the first quarter of 2010.  In 2011, the Company discontinued its personal care operations previously located in Boston MA.

Comments on Quarterly Results
William Yarmuth, Chief Executive Officer, commented on the quarterly results: Our second quarter operating results mark the Companys first quarter complying with new regulatory requirements for face to face encounters and therapy reassessments, which were effective April 1, 2011.  Our team of over 6,000 caregivers has worked diligently incorporating new processes and procedures into daily execution, while continuing the unwavering patient care focus of our Senior Advocacy Mission.  Our results reflect the initial operational challenges of implementing and complying with these new rules.
Comments on Cambridge Acquisition
We are extremely pleased to announce the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire Cambridge Home Health Care Holdings, Inc., a leading provider of personal and home health care services in Ohio and Pennsylvania, said Yarmuth. In a single transaction we are able to put over $30 million of cash on hand to work delivering significant earnings accretion, nearly double the size of our Personal Care segment and attain state wide coverage capabilities in Ohio after combining the Medicare provider coverage of Cambridge with our own.  This acquisition provides both our Personal Care and Visiting Nurse segments with new growth channels in Ohio and western Pennsylvania as well as providing some diversification of our revenue stream.  We are excited to expand our Senior Advocacy Mission to new markets and welcome the Cambridge employees into our family of caregivers.
Second Quarter Financial Results
Almost Family reported second quarter results that included the impact of the Medicare reimbursement rate cut for 2011 which reduced consolidated and Visiting Nurse (VN) segment revenue and pre-tax operating income by $3.9 million.
Net service revenues for the second quarter declined to $81.7 million, a 4% decrease from $85.1 million reported in the second quarter of 2010, primarily as a result of the aforementioned Medicare rate cut and by the provision of a $0.5 million revenue allowance for episodes started after April 1, 2011 that were directly impacted by the new face to face and therapy reassessment regulations, both of which were partially offset by volume growth.
The second quarter of 2011 was the first in which these new rules went into effect.  During the quarter the Company experienced softer than normal admission volumes and a decline in re-certifications.  Also, during the quarter, management changes in Florida, in the midst of implementation of the new regulatory requirements, led to disruption in labor cost controls resulting in lower margins and operating income in the Company's Visiting Nurse segment.  The Company is implementing actions under its new Florida management team to realign labor costs with ongoing volumes.

Net income for the second quarter of 2011 was $5.0 million, or $0.53 per diluted share, down from second quarter of 2010 net income of $8.3 million, or $0.89 per diluted share. Fees and expenses related to governmental inquiries lowered second quarter 2011 EPS by approximately $0.03, while deal costs lowered second quarter 2011 EPS by approximately $0.02, without which diluted EPS would have been $0.58.  For the second quarter of 2010, investigation costs lowered operating results by approximately $0.01, while there were no deal costs.
Diluted EPS for the quarter were lowered $0.03 due to a revenue allowance for potential issues surrounding new face-to-face and therapy regulations, and  increased by $0.03 due to reversal in the second quarter, based on the Companys year to date performance, of incentive accruals recorded in the first quarter.
Second Quarter Segment Results
Net service revenues in the VN segment for the second quarter declined to $71.2 million, a 5.0% decrease from $75.0 million in the second quarter of 2010, after the $3.9 million effect of the previously mentioned Medicare rate cut, volume and related issues in our Florida cluster along with a $0.5 million reduction for the impact of new regulations on episodes started after April 1, 2011.  Medicare admissions and completed episodes grew 7.1% and 3.8%, respectively, substantially all of which was organic, while re-certifications dropped 8.5%.
Operating income before corporate expenses in the VN segment for the second quarter of 2011 was $11.8 million, a $6.0 million decrease from $17.7 million reported for the second quarter of 2010 primarily as a result of the impact of the Medicare rate cut, volume and related issues in Florida, and the costs associated with implementing new regulations for face-to-face physician encounters and therapy reassessments.
Net service revenues in the Personal Care (PC) segment for the second quarter of 2011 grew 3.3% or $0.3 million to $10.5 million from $10.2 million in the second quarter of 2010.  Operating income before unallocated corporate expenses in the PC segment decreased $0.1 million to $1.2 million in the second quarter of 2010 primarily due to increased workers compensation claims and bad debt provision.
Six Month Period Ended June 30, 2011
Almost Family reported six month results that included the impact of the Medicare reimbursement rate cut for 2011 which reduced consolidated and Visiting Nurse (VN) segment revenue and pre-tax operating income by $7.7 million. This was partially offset by volume growth.  Net service revenues for the six month period declined to $164.3 million, a 1.3% decrease from $166.4 million reported in the six month period of 2010.

Net income for the six month period of 2011 was $10.7 million, or $1.14 per diluted share, down from the six month period of 2010 net income of $15.8 million, or $1.69 per diluted share. Fees and expenses related to governmental inquiries lowered year to date 2011 EPS by approximately $0.05 while deal costs lowered year to date 2011 EPS by approximately $0.03, without which diluted EPS would have been $1.22.  For the six month period of 2010, investigation costs lowered operating results by approximately $0.01, while there were no deal costs.
Six Month Period Segment Results
Net service revenues in the VN segment for the six month period declined to $143.9 million, a 1.8% decrease from $146.5 million in the six month period of 2010, after the effect of the previously mentioned Medicare rate cut which was partially offset by volume growth.  Medicare admissions grew 7.6%, while completed episodes grew 5.5%, substantially all of which was organic.
Operating income before corporate expenses in the VN segment for the six month period of 2011 was $24.8 million, an $8.8 million decrease from $33.6 million reported for the six month period of 2010 as a result of the impact of the Medicare rate cut, volume and related issues in Florida, and the costs associated with implementing new regulations for face-to-face physician encounters and therapy reassessments.
Net service revenues in the Personal Care (PC) segment for the six month period of 2011 grew 2.4% or $0.5 million to $20.4 million from $19.9 million in the six month period of 2010.  Operating income before unallocated corporate expenses in the PC segment increased 5.6% to $2.7 million from $2.6 million in the six month period of 2010.
Acquisition of Cambridge Home Health
On August 2, 2011 the Company entered into a stock purchase agreement with the shareholders of Cambridge Home Health Care Holdings, Inc. (Cambridge) an Ohio based provider of home health services with $38 million in annual revenues.  Cambridge operates a total of 38 home health branches with 35 in Ohio and 3 in western Pennsylvania.  Cambridge services over 3,000 patients annually.  
 
The Company will be acquiring 100% of the outstanding equity interests of Cambridge with a cash-free, debt free balance sheet for an all-cash purchase price of $32.5 million.  The transaction is expected to close by August 6, 2011.
 
 
 
Almost Family Reports Second Quarter 2011 Results

August 3, 2011
 
In its audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2010 Cambridge reported $38.2 million in revenues of which $33.7 million would be classified in our Personal Care segment and $4.5 million would be classified in our Visiting Nurse segment.  Net income was $4.3 million after interest expense and related party management fees of $1.1 million.  Cambridge is a subchapter S Corporation for income tax purposes and thus had no income tax provision.  The Company expects to eventually achieve approximately $1.0 million to $1.5 million in combination synergies.  However, the Company expects also to incur certain costs of integration of systems and processes in a range of $600,000 to $800,000 over its planned transition time frame of 6 to 9 months.  Finally, reductions in Ohio Medicaid and Passport reimbursement rates going into effect on July 1, 2011 and October 1, 2011 are expected to reduce annual revenue and pre-tax income by approximately $620,000.
Regulatory Inquiries and Shareholder Litigation
As previously announced, the Company is continuing to cooperate fully with investigators from the US Senate Finance Committee and the US Securities and Exchange Commission regarding their inquiries following an April 27, 2010 article related to Medicare home health therapy services.  Fees and expenses associated with these inquiries and their impact on the Companys financial results are described above.

Non-GAAP Financial Measure
The information provided in some of the tables in this release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined under Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules.  In accordance with SEC rules, the Company has provided, in the supplemental information and the footnotes to the tables, a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.
EBITDA
Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  It should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income, operating income, cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities, or any other measure calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The items excluded from EBITDA are significant components in understanding and evaluating financial performance and liquidity. Management routinely calculates and communicates EBITDA and believes that it is useful to investors because it is commonly used as an analytical indicator within our industry to evaluate performance, measure leverage capacity and debt service ability, and to estimate current or prospective enterprise value. EBITDA is also used in certain covenants contained in our credit agreement.
The following tables set forth a reconciliation of net income to EBITDA:

Third Quarter Results:
 Almost Family, Inc. (Nasdaq: AFAM), a leading regional provider of home health nursing and personal care services, announced today its financial results for the three-and nine months ended September 30, 2011.
Louisville, KY, November 2, 2011
Comments on Quarterly Results
William Yarmuth, Chief Executive Officer, commented on the quarterly results: Despite particularly challenging times facing everyone in the home health industry, we are pleased to report our results for the quarter which include organic volume growth in both our VN and PC segments.  During the quarter, we also completed the second largest acquisition in the history of the Company, nearly doubling the size of our PC segment and expanding our total branch locations to over 150.  This acquisition, combined with improved performance in the balance of our PC segment, has helped us to improve that segments operating income by 87% as compared to the same quarter of last year. Finally, we are continuing to work on the operational management issues in our Florida VN operations described last quarter and view this as an opportunity to improve on the results weve reported for this quarter.
Final Medicare Home Health Rule for 2012
On October 31, 2011 the Medicare program released its final rule for home health reimbursement rates which specify a reduction in the national standard 60 day episodic reimbursement rate of approximately 2.5%.   The final rule also includes a redistribution of reimbursement away from therapy intensive cases towards non-therapy intensive cases and removes certain diagnoses from consideration in determining reimbursement on individual patient cases.  The Companys preliminary calculations suggest that the 2012 final rule may reasonably be expected to reduce its Medicare reimbursement for 2012 between 5.0% and 5.5% as compared to 2011 assuming no changes in the mix of patients the Company serves. The Company noted that the new rates impact episodes ended on or after January 1, 2012.  Accordingly, revenues and net income for the quarter ended December 31, 2011 will be partially impacted by these rates.

Third Quarter Financial Results
Almost Family reported third quarter results that included the impact of the Medicare reimbursement rate cut for 2011 which reduced consolidated and Visiting Nurse (VN) segment revenue and pre-tax operating income by $3.8 million.
Net service revenues for the third quarter grew to $86.2 million, a 2% increase from $84.4 million reported in the third quarter of 2010, primarily as a result of the Cambridge Home Health Care Holdings, Inc. (Cambridge) acquisition, which closed in early August, offset by the VN segments Medicare rate cut.
The third quarter of 2011 was the second under the new regulatory rules regarding therapy reassessments and face-to-face physician encounters for patients in our VN segment.  During the quarter, the Company continued to experience softer than normal admission volumes and a decline in re-certifications.  Also, disruption in labor cost controls continued in Florida from the changes in management during the second quarter, resulted in lower margins and operating income in the Companys VN segment.
Net income for the third quarter of 2011 was $4.8 million, or $0.52 per diluted share, down from third quarter of 2010 net income of $7.9 million, or $0.85 per diluted share. Fees and expenses related to governmental inquiries lowered third quarter 2011 EPS by approximately $0.02, while acquisition costs lowered third quarter 2011 EPS by approximately $0.01, without which diluted EPS would have been $0.54.  For the third quarter of 2010, investigation costs lowered operating results by approximately $0.02, while there were no acquisition costs.
Diluted EPS for the quarter were increased by $0.06 as a result of the Cambridge acquisition. Unallocated corporate overhead included approximately $373,000 of transitional expenses related to the Cambridge home office which is expected to be wound down over the next 4-5 quarters.
Third Quarter Segment Results
Net service revenues in the VN segment for the third quarter declined to $70.2 million, a 5% decrease from $74.1 million in the third quarter of 2010, after the $3.8 million effect of the Medicare rate cut, volume and related issues in our Florida cluster.  Medicare admissions grew 5%, of which 3% was organic, while completed episodes declined 3% as a result of a drop in re-certifications of 6%.  Our VN Medicare admissions grew 7% organically outside of Florida.
Operating income before corporate expenses in the VN segment for the third quarter of 2011 was $10.3 million, a $6.2 million decrease from $16.5 million reported for the third quarter of 2010 primarily as a result of the impact of the Medicare rate cut, volume and related issues in Florida, and the costs associated with implementing new regulations for face-to-face physician encounters and therapy reassessments.

Net service revenues in the Personal Care (PC) segment for the third quarter of 2011 grew 56% or $5.8 million to a record $16.0 million from $10.2 million in the third quarter of 2010 due primarily to our Cambridge acquisition.  Operating income before unallocated corporate expenses in the PC segment increased $1.2 million to $2.6 million in the third quarter of 2011 primarily due to the Cambridge acquisition.
Nine Month Period Ended September 30, 2011
Almost Family reported nine month results that included the impact of the Medicare reimbursement rate cut for 2011 which reduced consolidated and Visiting Nurse (VN) segment revenue and pre-tax operating income by $11.5 million. This was partially offset by the Cambridge acquisition and volume growth.  Net service revenues for the nine month period declined to $250.5 million, a 0.1% decrease from $250.8 million reported in the nine month period of 2010.
Net income for the nine month period of 2011 was $15.5 million, or $1.66 per diluted share, down from the nine month period of 2010 net income of $23.7 million, or $2.54 per diluted share. Fees and expenses related to governmental inquiries lowered year to date 2011 EPS by approximately $0.07 while deal costs lowered year to date 2011 EPS by approximately $0.03, without which diluted EPS would have been $1.76.  For the nine month period of 2010, investigation costs lowered operating results by approximately $0.03, while there were no deal costs.
Nine Month Period Segment Results
Net service revenues in the VN segment for the nine month period declined to $214.1 million, a 3.0% decrease from $220.6 million in the nine month period of 2010, after the effect of the previously mentioned Medicare rate cut which was partially offset by volume growth.  Medicare admissions grew 7%, of which 5% was organic, while completed episodes grew 3%.  Our VN Medicare admissions grew 10% organically outside of Florida.
Operating income before corporate expenses in the VN segment for the nine month period of 2011 was $35.1 million,  a $15.0 million decrease from $50.1 million reported for the nine month period of 2010 as a result of the impact of the Medicare rate cut, volume and related issues in Florida, and the costs associated with implementing new regulations for face-to-face physician encounters and therapy reassessments, all of which were partially offset by operating income before corporate expense from our Cambridge acquisition.
Net service revenues in the PC segment for the nine month period of 2011 grew 21% or $6.2 million to $36.4 million from $30.2 million in the nine month period of 2010, primarily due to our Cambridge acquisition.

Full Year Highlights:
Comments on Results
William Yarmuth, Chief Executive Officer, commented on the results:
Last year was a very challenging year for everyone in the home health business.  Despite the regulatory obstacles and meaningful rate cuts we had to overcome, we are proud of the accomplishments we made during the year.  We emerge from 2011 with a strong management team focused on the future and with an outstanding reputation to help us capitalize on opportunities.

In the long term, we believe it will ultimately prove economically impossible for our nation to meet its commitment to provide health care for our elderly without a strong and vibrant home health industry. We believe, now more than ever, in the long-term future for home health as a key component in the cost effective delivery of health care services for Americas seniors.  Consistent with our mission as Senior Advocates, we will continue working with others in the industry, CMS, MedPac, Congress and the Administration to make that future happen.
While 2012 will undoubtedly present us with new challenges, we believe we are well prepared to take them on.  We remain focused on improving our operations and growing our business both organically and through acquisition, supported by the highest quality caregivers in the industry and the strongest balance sheet in our history.
Fourth Quarter Financial Results
Almost Family reported fourth quarter results that included: i) the favorable impact of the first full quarter of results from our Cambridge Home Health Care Holdings, Inc. (Cambridge) acquisition, which closed in early August and ii) the unfavorable impact of the 2012 and 2011 Medicare reimbursement rate cuts in the Visiting Nurse (VN) segment.  The rate cuts were effective for episodes ending in the year of the rate cut.  The combined effect of Medicare rate changes reduced revenue and operating income by $4.2 million and earnings per diluted share by $0.27.
Net service revenues for the fourth quarter grew to $89.3 million, a 6% increase from $84.4 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2010, as a result of the Cambridge acquisition and VN segment volume growth, which were partially offset by the VN segments Medicare rate cuts.
The fourth quarter of 2011 was the third under the new regulatory rules regarding therapy reassessments and face-to-face physician encounters for patients in our VN segment.  During the quarter, the Company continued to experience softer than normal admission volumes and a decline in re-certifications.  VN segment labor cost controls improved during the fourth quarter primarily in Florida from the changes in management during the second quarter, but continued to contribute to lower margins and operating income in the Companys VN segment due to the Medicare rate cuts.
Net income for the fourth quarter of 2011 was $5.3 million, or $0.57 per diluted share, down from fourth quarter of 2010 net income of $7.0 million, or $0.75 per diluted share. Fees and expenses related to governmental inquiries lowered fourth quarter 2011 EPS by approximately $0.01, without which diluted EPS would have been $0.58.  For the fourth quarter of 2010, investigation costs lowered operating results by approximately $0.05, while there were no acquisition costs.
Diluted EPS for the quarter were increased by $0.09 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2010 as a result of the Cambridge acquisition. Unallocated corporate overhead included approximately

$289,000 of transitional expenses related to the Cambridge home office which is expected to be wound down during 2012. Diluted EPS for the quarter include a $0.01 favorable impact of a decline in our effective tax rate for the year to 39.5% from 40%, primarily due to the impact of a lower state tax rate from the Cambridge acquisition.
Fourth Quarter Segment Results
VN Segment fourth quarter results include the unfavorable impact of the Medicare rate cuts, volume and related issues in Florida and costs associated with new regulations for face-to-face physician encounters and therapy reassessments.  As a result, VN segment fourth quarter net service revenues declined 5% to $70.4 million, from $74.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, while operating income before corporate expenses for the fourth quarter of 2011 declined to $11.0 million from $16.2 million reported for the fourth quarter of 2010.  Medicare admissions grew 5%, of which 3% was organic, which was partially offset by a 3% decline in re-certifications.  Organic VN Medicare admission growth outside Florida was 8%.
Primarily as a result of our Cambridge acquisition, PC segment net service revenues grew 86% or $8.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 to a record $19.0 million from $10.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, while operating income before unallocated corporate expenses increased 97%, or $1.5 million to $3.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2011.
Full Year Ended December 31, 2011
Almost Family reported full year results that included: i) the favorable impact of our acquisitions and ii) the unfavorable impact of the 2012 and 2011 Medicare reimbursement rate cuts in the VN segment.  The rate cuts were effective for episodes ending in the year of the rate cut.  The combined effect of Medicare rate changes reduced 2011 revenue and operating income by $15.7 million and earnings per diluted share by $1.02.
Net service revenues for 2011 increased to $339.9 million, a 1.4% increase from $335.3 million in 2010, primarily due to the Cambridge acquisition and volume growth which were partially offset by the VN segments Medicare rate cuts.
Net income for 2011 was $20.8 million, or $2.22 per diluted share, down from 2010 net income of $30.7 million, or $3.28 per diluted share. Fees and expenses related to governmental inquiries lowered both 2011 and 2010 EPS by approximately $0.08, while deal costs also lowered 2011 EPS by approximately $0.04.  Deal costs did not impact 2010 EPS.

Full Year Segment Results
Net service revenues in the VN segment for 2011 declined to $284.5 million, a 3.5% decrease from $294.9 million in 2010, after the effect of Medicare rate cuts which were partially offset by volume growth.  Medicare admissions grew 6%, of which 5% was organic, which was partially
offset by a 5% decline in recertifications resulting in 1% growth in completed episodes.  Organic VN Medicare admission growth outside of Florida was 10%.
Operating income before corporate expenses in the VN segment for 2011 was $46.1 million, a $20.2 million decrease from $66.3 million reported for 2010 as a result of the impact of the Medicare rate cuts, volume and related issues in Florida, and the costs associated with implementing new regulations for face-to-face physician encounters and therapy reassessments, all of which combined to reduce our VN segment operating income before corporate expenses by 6.3% to 16.2% in 2011 from 22.5% in 2010.
As a result of our Cambridge acquisition, PC segment net service revenues in 2011 grew 37.1% or $15.0 million to $55.3 million from $40.4 million in 2010, while operating income before unallocated corporate expenses in the PC segment also increased 52.0% to $8.4 million from $5.5 million in 2010.

Non-GAAP Financial Measure
The information provided in some of the tables in this release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined under SEC rules.  In accordance with SEC rules, the Company has provided, in the supplemental information and the footnotes to the tables, a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.
EBITDA
Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  It should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income, operating income, cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities, or any other measure calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The items excluded from EBITDA are significant components in understanding and evaluating financial performance and liquidity. Management routinely calculates and communicates EBITDA and believes that it is useful to investors because it is commonly used as an analytical indicator within our industry to evaluate performance, measure leverage capacity and debt service ability, and to estimate current or prospective enterprise value. EBITDA is also used in certain covenants contained in our credit agreement.
The following tables set forth a reconciliation of net income to EBITDA:

Item 8.01                      Other Information.
On February 27, 2012, upon the recommendation of a committee of three of its independent and disinterested members, the Registrants board of directors approved the redemption of up to 94,440 shares of the Registrants common stock that were issued upon the termination and liquidation of the Registrants Non-Employee Directors Deferred Compensation Plan (the Plan), as amended.  The Plan was terminated by action of the Registrants board of directors on February 22, 2010 and was automatically liquidated one year and one day later on February 23, 2011.  Shares were liquidated at a per share price of $37.71, which price was the closing per share price on February 22, 2011.
As a result of the Plan liquidation, the Registrant received a tax benefit which increased cash on hand by approximately $1.9 million at December 31, 2011, while creating a tax obligation for participating directors, both at a value of $37.71 per share.  In lieu of open market sales of shares by directors which could have been detrimental to the value of shares in the public market, the Registrant offered to redeem the shares held by the participating directors at the lesser of the average of the open and closing price or the closing per share price on February 27, 2012.
On February 28, 2012, the Registrant agreed to redeem 72,000 shares of the Registrants common stock for $1,739,520 under this offer at a per share price of $24.16 which represented the closing per share price on February 27, 2012.  If the transaction had been completed on January 1, 2011, diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2011 would have been $0.01 higher.  The participating members of the Registrants board of directors were Jonathan D. Goldberg and Donald G. McClinton.

Louisville, KY, May 2, 2012
First Quarter Highlights:
Comments on Results
 
William Yarmuth, Chief Executive Officer, commented on the results:  "
In an environment of slowing health care expenditures, both broadly and specifically in home health care, we are pleased with our first quarter results.  In the first quarter, we turned our near-term focus, though not to the exclusion of organic growth, more toward managing costs in a world of lower reimbursement rates.  Nonetheless, our enthusiasm for home halth care over the long run remains extremely high and we continue our pursuit to be a leader in this very important sector of the health care delivery system.
 
First Quarter Financial Results
Almost Family reported first quarter results that included: i) the favorable impact of our Cambridge Home Health Care Holdings, Inc. (Cambridge) acquisition, which closed in early August of 2011 and ii) the unfavorable impact of the 2012 Medicare reimbursement rate cut in the Visiting Nurse (VN) segment.  The Medicare rate changes reduced revenue and operating income by $2.9 million and earnings per diluted share by $0.19.
 
 
 
Almost Family Reports First Quarter 2012 Results
Page  2
May 2, 2012
Net service revenues for the first quarter grew to $90.0 million, a 9% increase from $82.6 million reported in the first quarter of 2011, as a result of the Cambridge acquisition and VN segment volume growth, which were partially offset by the VN segments Medicare rate cuts.
Net income for the first quarter of 2012 was $4.9 million, or $0.53 per diluted share, down from first quarter of 2011 net income of $5.7 million, or $0.61 per diluted share.
Diluted EPS for the quarter was increased by $0.08 as compared to the first quarter of 2011 as a result of the Cambridge acquisition. Unallocated corporate overhead included approximately $0.3 million of transitional expenses related to the Cambridge home office which is expected to wind down during the remainder of 2012. Diluted EPS for the quarter includes a $0.02 favorable impact of a decline in our effective tax rate for the year to 38.0% from 40.3%, primarily due to the impact of a one-time benefit from the release of a valuation allowance in conjunction with tax planning strategies completed in the first quarter of 2012 in addition to a lower state tax rate from the Cambridge acquisition.
First Quarter Segment Results
VN Segment first quarter results include the unfavorable impact of the Medicare rate cuts.  As a result, VN segment first quarter net service revenues declined 3% to $70.7 million, from $72.7 million in the first quarter of 2011, while operating income before corporate expenses for the first quarter of 2012 declined to $11.0 million from $13.0 million reported for the first quarter of 2011.  Medicare admissions grew 2%, of which 1% was organic, which was partially offset by a 3% decline in re-certifications.  Organic VN Medicare admission growth outside Florida was 5%.
Primarily as a result of our Cambridge acquisition, PC segment net service revenues grew 94% or $9.3 million in the first quarter of 2012 to a record $19.2 million from $9.9 million in the first quarter of 2011, while operating income before unallocated corporate expenses increased 68%, or $1.0 million to $2.5 million in the first quarter of 2012.
Regulatory Inquiries and Legal Matters
The Company is continuing to cooperate fully with investigators from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  Fees and expenses associated with these and related inquiries did not significantly impact EPS in the first quarter of 2012, while reducing first quarter 2011 EPS by approximately $0.03.
In addition, as previously disclosed, the Company had previously been advised that a relator had filed a False Claims Act qui tam complaint regarding our visiting nurse operations in Birmingham, Alabama, and a different relator had filed a False Claims Act qui tam complaint regarding our Medicare practices at facilities in Tampa, Florida.  Following decisions by the Department of Justice not to join the cases, in April 2012, the Company was advised that the relators in both cases voluntarily filed for dismissal without prejudice, to which the government consented.  As a result, the Court dismissed both cases without prejudice.

Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented in writing.
(a)
Action.
 
            In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board, and which date shall not be more than ten days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board. Any stockholder of record seeking to have the stockholders authorize or take corporate action by written consent shall, by written notice to the Secretary, request the Board to fix a record date. The Board shall promptly, but in all events within ten days after the date on which such a request is received, adopt a resolution fixing the record date. If no record date has been fixed by the Board within ten days of the date on which such a request is received, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board is required by applicable law, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office, its principal place of business, or an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to the Corporations registered office shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. If no record date has been fixed by the Board and prior action by the Board is required by applicable law, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the date on which the Board adopts the resolution taking such prior action.

3.6
Committees of Directors.
 
            Any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board, or of any committee thereof, may be taken without a meeting, if all members of the Board or committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing, and such written consent is filed with the minutes of proceedings of the Board or such committee.
3.7

Second Quarter Highlights:
Comments on Results
 
William Yarmuth, Chief Executive Officer, commented on the results: We're very pleased to report significant earnings progress despite continued Medicare rate cuts and a slowing Medicare home health market.  During the first half of 2012, our VN segment staff and management have been intensely focused on improving our operational efficiency while continuing to provide quality care to the patients we serve.  During the second quarter, in our PC segment we completed the system conversion of the final branches from last falls Cambridge acquisition.  I'm pleased with the extent to which we've improved our results.  Our charge for the second half of 2012 is to leverage the progress achieved in both segments, while turning a more substantial part of our focus toward driving the organic growth of our business.
 
Second Quarter Financial Results
Almost Family reported second quarter results that included: i) the favorable impact of our Cambridge Home Health Care Holdings, Inc. (Cambridge) acquisition, which closed in early August of 2011, ii) the unfavorable impact of higher than normal workers compensation costs which lowered EPS by $0.04 and iii) the unfavorable impact of the 2012 Medicare reimbursement rate cut in the Visiting Nurse (VN) segment.  The Medicare rate changes reduced revenue and operating income by $2.8 million and earnings per diluted share by $0.18.

Net service revenues for the second quarter grew to $86.9 million, a 6% increase from $81.7 million reported in the second quarter of 2011, as a result of the Cambridge acquisition, partially offset by the VN segments Medicare rate cut.
Net income for the second quarter of 2012 was $4.5 million, or $0.49 per diluted share, down from second quarter of 2011 net income of $5.0 million, or $0.53 per diluted share.

Diluted EPS for the quarter includes a $0.01 for transaction related costs, similar costs in the prior year quarter totaled $0.02.  Our effective tax rate for the quarter declined to 39.5% from 40.2% in the prior year quarter, primarily due to a lower state tax rate from the Cambridge acquisition.
Second Quarter Segment Results
VN Segment second quarter results include the unfavorable impact of the Medicare rate cuts.  As a result, VN segment second quarter net service revenues declined 5% to $67.6 million, from $71.2 million in the second quarter of 2011, while operating income before corporate expenses for the second quarter of 2012 declined to $10.8 million from $11.8 million reported for the second quarter of 2011.

Six Month Period Ended June 30, 2012

(Cambridge) acquisition, which closed in early August of 2011 and ii) the unfavorable impact of the 2012 Medicare reimbursement rate cut in the Visiting Nurse (VN) segment.  The Medicare rate changes reduced revenue and operating income by $5.7 million and earnings per diluted share by $0.37.
Net income for the six month period of 2012 was $9.5 million, or $1.02 per diluted share, down from the six month period of 2011 net income of $10.7 million, or $1.14 per diluted share.

Non-GAAP Financial Measure
The information provided in some of the tables in this release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined under SEC rules.  In accordance with SEC rules, the Company has provided, in the supplemental information and the footnotes to the tables, a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.
EBITDA
Earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  It should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income, operating income, cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities, or any other measure calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The items excluded from EBITDA are significant components in understanding and evaluating financial performance and liquidity. Management routinely calculates and communicates EBITDA and believes that it is useful to investors because it is commonly used as an analytical indicator within our industry to evaluate performance, measure leverage capacity and debt service ability, and to estimate current or prospective enterprise value. EBITDA is also used in certain covenants contained in our credit agreement.
The following tables set forth a reconciliation of net income to EBITDA:

Louisville, KY, November 6, 2012
Highlights:
Comments on Results
William Yarmuth, Chief Executive Officer, commented on the results: Our results for the third quarter reflect the impact of normal seasonality in our VN segment along with an apparent slowing in health care utilization nationwide.  While external market conditions continue to be somewhat challenging, we are continuing to focus on improving the organic growth of our business.  We have been extremely pleased with the success of our operators in tightly managing the efficiencies of their business units delivering meaningful year over year cost savings in the VN segment.
With regard to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) development described in more detail below, Yarmuth added:  We continue to be very proud of our track record of sound compliance and the absence of any findings of wrongdoing at Almost Family by any of the investigatory bodies that began probing us and others in the industry in mid-2010.  I am extremely proud of the way our management team, and most importantly our caregivers, have refused to allow any of this to detract from our Senior Advocacy mission of providing the highest quality care to our patients.

November 6, 2012
Third Quarter Financial Results
Almost Family reported third quarter results that included the impact of the 2012 Medicare reimbursement rate cut in the Visiting Nurse (VN) segment.  The Medicare rate cuts reduced revenue and operating income by $2.7 million and earnings per diluted share by $0.17, while a change in certain Medicare Advantage plans paying on a per visit versus episodic basis reduced revenue by $0.8 million and earnings per diluted share by $0.03.  While total VN admissions increased approximately 2% and traditional Medicare episodic admissions increased approximately 1%, total Medicare episodic admissions declined 2.5% primarily as a result of certain Medicare Advantage plans switching from episodic to per visit payment models.
The Companys earnings were favorably impacted by efforts to improve its operating efficiencies and the inclusion in the quarter of a full three months of the Cambridge Home Health Care Holdings, Inc. (Cambridge) acquisition, which closed in early August of 2011.  Improvements in operating efficiencies, principally in the VN segment, improved earnings per diluted share by $0.17.
Net service revenues for the third quarter were $85.1 million, a 1% decrease from $86.2 million reported in the third quarter of 2011, primarily as a result of the VN segments Medicare rate cut, partially offset by the Cambridge acquisition.
Net income for the third quarter of 2012 was $4.1 million, or $0.44 per diluted share, down from third quarter of 2011 net income of $4.8 million, or $0.52 per diluted share.
The effective tax rate of 39.5% in the third quarter of 2012 was consistent with the 39.4% for the third quarter of 2011.
SEC and Legal Developments
Since our last quarterly report the Company has received two favorable determinations with respect to previously disclosed regulatory inquiries and litigation.  On November 2, 2012, the Company and those affected executive officers and members of its board of directors were all notified by the SEC Staff that it has concluded its investigation and does not intend to recommend enforcement action to the Commission.  Separately, on October 2, 2012 the judge in certain shareholder derivative actions in Kentucky state court granted the Companys motion for dismissal.  Although the plaintiffs have appealed that ruling, the Company intends to vigorously defend the appeal of the ruling.
As previously disclosed, an April 2010 newspaper article reporting on home health care delivery practices in the industry and at the Company triggered inquiries to the Company from the U.S. Senate Finance Committee (SFC), followed by the SEC.  These were in turn followed by shareholder litigation making various claims related to the newspaper article against the Company, its board of directors and certain of its officers.  As also previously disclosed, in its October 2011 report, the SFC found no wrongdoing with regard to Almost Family and, on February 10, 2012, the judge in certain shareholder actions in Federal court granted the Companys motion for dismissal.

Refer to the Companys filings on Forms 10-K for 2011 and 10-Q for 2012 for a more complete background of the matters described in this section.
Possible Impact of Hurricane Sandy
Approximately 25% of our VN segment operations are located in the northeastern U.S. (New Jersey, Connecticut and Massachusetts), areas impacted by Hurricane Sandy which struck in late October 2012.  While we are currently unable to predict to the extent, if any, it is reasonable to expect that this significant weather event may have a detrimental impact on our operating results for the quarter and thus the year ending December 31, 2012.
Third Quarter Segment Results
VN segment third quarter results include the unfavorable impact of the Medicare rate cuts as well as the change of certain Medicare Advantage payors to per visit reimbursement.  As a result, VN segment third quarter net service revenues declined 6% to $65.9 million, from $69.9 million in the third quarter of 2011, while operating income before corporate expenses for the third quarter of 2012 declined to $8.9 million from $10.2 million reported for the third quarter of 2011.  Total admissions grew 2%, substantially all organic.  Organic VN admission growth in Florida was 5%.
Primarily as a result of our Cambridge acquisition, Personal Care (PC) segment net service revenues grew 18% or $2.9 million in the third quarter of 2012 to $19.2 million from $16.3 million in the third quarter of 2011, while operating income before unallocated corporate expenses increased 5%, or $0.1 million to $2.8 million in the third quarter of 2012.
Nine Month Period Ended September 30, 2012
Almost Family reported nine month results that included: i) the favorable impact of a full nine months of operations from our Cambridge acquisition, which closed in early August of 2011, ii) the unfavorable impact of the 2012 Medicare reimbursement rate cut and the shift of certain Medicare Advantage payors to per visit reimbursement in the VN segment, iii) the unfavorable impact of higher than normal health insurance and workers compensation costs which lowered EPS by $0.09 and iv) the unfavorable impact of higher bad debt provision which lowered EPS by $0.04.  The Medicare rate cuts reduced revenue and operating income by $8.4 million and earnings per diluted share by $0.55.
Net income for the nine month period of 2012 was $13.6 million, or $1.46 per diluted share, down from the nine month period of 2011 net income of $15.5 million, or $1.66 per diluted share.  Fees and expenses related to governmental inquiries did not impact the 2012 nine month period, while lowering the 2011 nine month period EPS by approximately $0.07.  Deal costs lowered year to date 2012 and 2011 EPS by approximately $0.03.
Nine Month Period Segment Results
Net service revenues in the VN segment for the nine month period declined to $204.2 million, a 4.5% decrease from $213.8 million in the nine month period of 2011, after the effect of the previously mentioned Medicare rate cut and lower Medicare volumes.  Total admissions grew 3%, of which 2% was organic.

November 6, 2012
Operating income before corporate expenses in the VN segment for the nine month period of 2012 was $30.7 million, a $4.3 million decrease from $35.0 million reported for the nine month period of 2011, primarily as a result of the impact of the Medicare rate cut and a $0.9 million increase in bad debt provision, both of which were partially offset by a focused effort to reduce labor costs relative to patients served.
Primarily as a result of our Cambridge acquisition, net service revenues in the PC segment for the nine month period of 2012 grew 57% or $21.0 million to $57.8 million from $36.7 million in the nine month period of 2011.  As a result, operating income before unallocated corporate expenses in the PC segment increased 40% to $7.6 million from $5.4 million in the nine month period of 2011.

Non-GAAP Financial Measure
The information provided in some of the tables in this release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined under SEC rules.  In accordance with SEC rules, the Company has provided, in the supplemental information and the footnotes to the tables, a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.
EBITDA
Earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  It should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income, operating income, cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities, or any other measure calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The items excluded from EBITDA are significant components in understanding and evaluating financial performance and liquidity. Management routinely calculates and communicates EBITDA and believes that it is useful to investors because it is commonly used as an analytical indicator within our industry to evaluate performance, measure leverage capacity and debt service ability, and to estimate current or prospective enterprise value. EBITDA is also used in certain covenants contained in our credit agreement.
The following tables set forth a reconciliation of net income to EBITDA:

Almost Family Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2012 Results
 Almost Family, Inc. (Nasdaq: AFAM), a leading regional provider of home health nursing and personal care services, announced today its financial results for the three months and full year ended December 31, 2012.
Louisville, KY, February 27, 2013
Fourth Quarter Highlights:
 
 
Full Year Highlights:
Comments on Results
William Yarmuth, Chief Executive Officer, commented on the results: All things considered, we emerge from 2012 pleased with the progress weve made and the position were in to capitalize on our future opportunities.  We weathered storms, both literally and figuratively, that have had an impact on our quarterly operating results.  We continued to make progress in our Florida operations while dealing with the ramifications of Medicare Advantage plan changes in our northern operations.
Looking at the year as a whole, we weathered our second straight year of Medicare rate cuts in the neighborhood of 5% and, with a keen eye on cost controls, managed to offset a meaningful portion of those cuts.  Despite all this, we increased shareholder value by paying a $2 per share special dividend at the end of December without compromising our financial capability to pursue the opportunities we see coming our way.  We enter 2013 in a very strong position with one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry.
 
Fourth Quarter Financial Results
Almost Family reported fourth quarter results that included the impact of the 2012 Medicare reimbursement rate cut in the Visiting Nurse (VN) segment.  The Medicare rate cuts reduced revenue and operating income by $3.0 million and earnings per diluted share by $0.20.  A change in certain Medicare Advantage contracts we chose to renew that now pay on a per visit versus episodic basis reduced revenue by $0.7 million and earnings per diluted share by $0.03.  While total VN admissions increased approximately 1%, Medicare episodic admissions declined approximately 2% primarily as a result of those Medicare Advantage plans switching from episodic to per visit payment models.  Admissions in 2011 included approximately 300 Medicare Advantage admissions under a contract that was terminated when payment switched from episodic to per visit.
Approximately 25% of our VN segment and 20% of our PC segment operations are located in the northeastern U.S. (New Jersey, Connecticut and Massachusetts), areas impacted by Hurricane Sandy which struck in late October 2012.  Earnings per share for the fourth quarter were reduced by $0.02 as a result of business disruptions due to Hurricane Sandy primarily in our New Jersey and Connecticut markets.
Net service revenues for the fourth quarter were $86.6 million, a 3% decrease from $89.3 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2011, primarily as a result of the VN segments Medicare rate cut.
Net income for the fourth quarter of 2012 was $3.7 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, down from fourth quarter of 2011 net income of $5.3 million, or $0.57 per diluted share.
The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2012 increased to 40.1% from 38.0% for the fourth quarter of 2011, primarily as a result of the shift of earnings to states with higher tax rates and the absence of tax credits.
Fourth Quarter Segment Results
VN segment fourth quarter results include the unfavorable impact of the Medicare rate cuts as well as the change of certain Medicare Advantage payors to per visit reimbursement.  As a result, VN segment fourth quarter net service revenues declined 4% to $67.3 million, from $69.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, while operating income before corporate expenses for the fourth quarter of 2012 declined to $8.7 million from $10.7 million reported for the fourth quarter of 2011.  Total admissions grew 1%, substantially all organic.  Sequential VN segment sales force expansion decreased EPS by $0.03.
Personal Care (PC) segment net service revenues declined slightly to $19.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2012 from $19.5 million in 2011, due to a 4% decline in volumes which was partially offset by higher rates per hour.  Operating income before unallocated corporate expenses decreased 25% or $0.8 million to $2.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2012 due to a combination of lower volumes and wage increases.
 
 
 
Full Year Ended December 31, 2012
Almost Family reported full year results that included: i) the favorable impact of a full year of operations from our Cambridge acquisition, which closed in early August of 2011, ii) the unfavorable impact of the 2012 Medicare reimbursement rate cut and iii) the unfavorable impact of the change of certain Medicare Advantage payors to per visit reimbursement for contracts we chose to renew, which lowered EPS by $0.06.  The Medicare rate cuts reduced revenue and operating income by $12.3 million and earnings per diluted share by $0.80.
Net income for 2012 was $17.3 million, or $1.85 per diluted share, down from 2011 net income of $20.8 million, or $2.22 per diluted share.  Fees and expenses related to governmental inquiries did not impact 2012, while lowering 2011 EPS by approximately $0.08.  Deal costs lowered both 2012 and 2011 EPS by approximately $0.03 and $0.04, respectively.
 
Full Year Segment Results
Net service revenues in the VN segment for 2012 declined to $271.5 million, a 4.3% decrease from $283.6 million in 2011, after the effect of the previously mentioned Medicare rate cut.  Total admissions grew 2%, of which all was organic.
Operating income before corporate expenses in the VN segment for 2012 was $39.4 million, a $6.3 million decrease from $45.7 million reported for 2011, primarily as a result of the impact of the Medicare rate cut, the shift of certain Medicare Advantage contracts we chose to renew to per visit reimbursement and a $0.9 million increase in bad debt provision, which were partially offset by a focused effort to reduce labor costs relative to patients served.
Primarily as a result of our Cambridge acquisition, net service revenues in the PC segment for 2012 grew 37% or $20.8 million to $77.0 million from $56.3 million 2011.  As a result, operating income before unallocated corporate expenses in the PC segment increased 16% to $10.0 million from $8.7 million 2011.

Non-GAAP Financial Measure
The information provided in some of the tables in this release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined under SEC rules.  In accordance with SEC rules, the Company has provided, in the supplemental information and the footnotes to the tables, a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.
EBITDA
Earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  It should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income, operating income, cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities, or any other measure calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The items excluded from EBITDA are significant components in understanding and evaluating financial performance and liquidity. Management routinely calculates and communicates EBITDA and believes that it is useful to investors because it is commonly used as an analytical indicator within our industry to evaluate performance, measure leverage capacity and debt service ability, and to estimate current or prospective enterprise value. EBITDA is also used in certain covenants contained in our credit agreement.
The following tables set forth a reconciliation of net income to EBITDA:

Louisville, KY, May 7, 2013
First Quarter Highlights:
Comments on Results
William Yarmuth, Chief Executive Officer, commented on the results: All things considered were pleased with our results for the first quarter.  Given the impact of sequestration and fewer business days than the first quarter of 2012, we are pleased with the positive total admission growth our VN Segment achieved.   We continue to have the utmost confidence in our ability to grow long term both organically and through acquisition and remain well positioned to capitalize on the opportunities we see ahead of us.
First Quarter Financial Results
Almost Family reported net service revenues for the first quarter of $86.9 million, a 3.4% decrease from $90.0 million reported in the first quarter of 2012, primarily as a result of fewer calendar days as 2012 was a leap year and the VN segments Medicare Advantage shift and Medicare rate cut.  The change in certain Medicare Advantage contracts that now pay on a per visit versus episodic basis reduced revenue by $1.0 million and earnings per diluted share by $0.06, while the partial impact of the 2% sequestration, which is effective for episodes ended after March 31, 2013, lowered revenue by $0.3 million and earnings per share by $0.02.
Net income for the first quarter of 2013 was $3.2 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, down from first quarter of 2012 net income of $4.9 million, or $0.53 per diluted share.
The effective tax rate was approximately 36.9% in the first quarter of 2013, which declined from the 38.0% for the first quarter of 2012 due primarily to one-time benefit resulting from the January 2, 2013 retroactive extension of the Work Opportunity Tax Credit.

First Quarter Segment Results
VN segment first quarter results include fewer calendar days, the change of certain Medicare Advantage payors to per visit reimbursement, as well as the unfavorable impact of sequestration.  As a result, VN segment first quarter net service revenues declined 4% to $68.0 million, from $70.7 million in the first quarter of 2012, while operating income before corporate expenses for the first quarter of 2013 declined to $8.2 million from $11.0 million reported for the first quarter of 2012.  Medicare admissions grew 1%, all organic.
Personal Care (PC) segment net service revenues declined slightly to $18.9 million in the first quarter of 2013 from $19.2 million in 2012, due to a 5% decline in volumes partially driven by fewer calendar days which was partially offset by changes in mix of business.  As a result, operating income before unallocated corporate expenses decreased 19% or $0.5 million to $2.0 million.
Conference Call
A conference call to review the results will begin at 11:00 a.m. ET on May 7, 2013, and will be hosted by William Yarmuth, Chief Executive Officer, and Steve Guenthner, President and Principal Financial Officer.
