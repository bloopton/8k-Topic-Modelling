Yields are computed using interest rates as of the balance sheet date and include amortization of loan origination fees, original issue discount and market premium or discount, weighted by their respective costs when averaged. Through September 30, 2004, we invested approximately $404 million of the net proceeds from our initial public offering. Net proceeds were invested 13.5% in subordinated debt/corporate notes, 0.5% in common stock/warrants and 32.4% in bank debt/senior secured debt. The remaining initial capital was invested in cash equivalents. Bank debt/senior secured debt typically accrues interest at variable rates determined on the basis of a benchmark LIBOR or prime rate with stated maturities at origination that range from 5 to 10 years. While subordinated debt/corporate notes will typically accrue interest at fixed rates, some of these investments may include zero coupon, PIK and/or step bonds that accrue income on a constant yield to call or maturity basis. Chairman and CEO, Michael Gross said, "We are quite pleased with the progress we've made in building our portfolio over our first two quarters and remain confident that we will meet the objectives we described at the time of the IPO. Additionally, our strong deal flow gives us the conviction that during the balance of our first year ramp up period, we will continue to experience quarterly sequential growth in yield." Results of Operations Operating Income Investment income totaled $7.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2004 versus $3.8 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2004. For the period April 8, 2004 (commencement of operations) through September 30, 2004, gross investment income totaled $11.7 million. As we continue investing the net proceeds from the initial offering, we expect to continue generating additional income at rates greater than the rates we receive on cash and cash equivalents. Operating Expenses Operating expenses totaled $5.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2004 versus $5.3 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2004. For the period April 8, 2004 (commencement of operations) through September 30, 2004, operating expenses totaled $10.9 million. This amount consisted of investment advisory and management fees, insurance expenses, administrative services fees, professional fees, directors' fees and other general and administrative expenses. The investment advisory fee for the quarter was $4.4 million versus $4.0 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2004 and represented the base fee as provided for in the investment advisory and management agreement. Administrative services fees accrued for the quarter was $273,000 versus $175,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2004. Net Operating Income The Company's net operating income was $2.26 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2004 versus a net operating loss of $1.48 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2004. For the period April 8, 2004 (commencement of operations) through September 30, 2004, net operating income was $785,968. Net Unrealized Appreciation on Investments and Cash Equivalents For the quarter ended September 30, 2004, the Company's investments had an increase in net unrealized appreciation of $3.52 million versus $2.34 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2004. At September 30, 2004, net unrealized appreciation totaled $5.86 million of which $2.18 million was attributable to net unrealized appreciation on our bank debt/senior secured debt and $3.76 million was attributable to our subordinated debt/corporate notes. The Company's cash equivalents had net unrealized depreciation of approximately $77,000.
Net Realized Losses on Repayments The Company had partial principal repayments of $347,011 for the quarter ended September 30, 2004 versus $125,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2004. Net losses for the quarter totaled $322 versus $368 for the quarter ended June 30, 2004. For the period April 8, 2004 (commencement of operations) through September 30, 2004, the Company had total principal repayments of $472,011 and net realized losses of $690. Net Increase in Stockholders' Equity From Operations For the quarter ended September 30, 2004, the Company had a net increase in stockholders' equity resulting from operations of $5.79 million versus $863,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2004.

We invested $327 million in the aggregate, adding ten new portfolio companies. We closed eight mezzanine loans (three of which included an equity co-investment) and three
senior secured loans (one of which we invested alongside a mezzanine loan). The weighted average yield on the subordinated debt purchased during the quarter was 14.2%. The weighted average yield on the senior secured debt purchased during the quarter was 10.3%. More specifically, we invested $295 million in the aggregate in the subordinated debt of AMH Holdings II, Inc., National Waterworks Holdings, Inc., Playpower Holdings Inc., Source Media Holdings, Inc., WDAC Intermediate Corp. and the subordinated debt and equity of Latham Manufacturing Corp., Inc., Lexicon Marketing (USA), Inc. and Pro Mach Merger Sub Inc. We also funded three investments in the senior secured debt of C.H.I. Overhead Doors, Inc., Source Media Holdings, Inc. and United Site Services, Inc. totaling $30 million in aggregate. The Company had repayments and exits of senior secured bank debt during the quarter totaling $25.3 million. Through December 31, 2004, we have invested $731 million of the $870 million net proceeds from our initial public offering. At December 31, 2004, the net portfolio was invested 47% in subordinated debt/corporate notes, 2% in common stock/warrants, 33% in bank debt/senior secured debt and 18% in cash equivalents. At December 31, 2004, the weighted average yield on our invested capital was 10.9% versus 8.8% at September 30, 2004. The weighted average yield on our entire portfolio, including cash equivalents, was 9.3% at December 31, 2004 versus 4.5% at September 30, 2004. The weighted average yield on our subordinated debt/corporate notes yielded 13.8% at December 31, 2004 versus 12.8% at September 30, 2004. Our bank debt/senior secured debt yielded 7.6% at December 31, 2004 versus 6.9% at September 30, 2004. Chairman and CEO, Michael Gross said, "We were quite successful during our third fiscal quarter in selectively identifying and investing in portfolio companies that we believe have compelling risk-reward characteristics. Our investment progress was primarily driven by a combination of our backlog and the leverage finance market's strong M&A activity. The environment was opportunistic for expert and responsive middle market lenders and we proved to be a valuable source of financing to many quality middle market equity sponsors. Through December 31, we are very pleased with our investment progress and our success in creating a portfolio that is much more heavily weighted in mezzanine than the target we had set out at the time of the IPO. By virtue of these strong results to date, we enter 2005 with the advantage of maintaining our discipline as a highly selective and patient investor with our capital." Results of Operations Operating Income Interest income totaled $14.8 million for the quarter versus $7.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2004. The increase was attributable to our investment progress through December 31, 2004. For the period April 8, 2004 (commencement of operations) through December 31, 2004, gross investment income totaled $26.5 million. Operating Expenses Operating expenses totaled $5.7 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2004 versus $5.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2004. For the period April 8, 2004 (commencement of operations) through December 31, 2004, operating expenses totaled $16.6 million.

Under the Credit Agreement, the lenders have agreed to extend credit to Apollo in an initial aggregate principal or face amount not exceeding $800,000,000 at any one time outstanding. The Credit Agreement is a five-year revolving facility (with a stated maturity date of April 14, 2010) and is secured by substantially all of the assets in Apollo's portfolio. Pricing is set at 100 basis points over LIBOR. The Credit Agreement contains affirmative and restrictive covenants, including: (a) periodic financial reporting requirements, (b) maintaining minimum shareholders' equity of the greater of (i) 40% of the total assets of Apollo and its subsidiaries as at the last day of any fiscal quarter and (ii) the sum of (A) $300,000,000 plus (B) 25% of the net proceeds from the sale of equity interests in Apollo after the closing date of the Credit Agreement, (c) maintaining a ratio of total assets (less total liabilities) to total indebtedness, in each case of Apollo and its subsidiaries, of not less than 2.0:1.0, (d) maintaining minimum liquidity, (e) limitations on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, (f) limitations on liens, (g) limitations on investments (other than in the ordinary course of Apollo's business), (h) limitations on mergers and disposition of assets (other than in the normal course of Apollo's business activities) and (i) limitations on the creation or existence of agreements that prohibit liens on properties of Apollo's subsidiaries. In addition to the asset coverage ratio described in clause (c) of the preceding sentence, borrowings under the Credit Agreement (and the incurrence of certain other permitted debt) will be subject to compliance with a borrowing base that will apply different advance rates to different types of assets in Apollo's portfolio. The Credit Agreement will provide for the ability of Apollo to seek additional commitments from lenders thereunder in an aggregate amount of up to $400,000,000. Apollo has not yet borrowed any amounts under the Credit Agreement.
 
The Credit Agreement will be used to supplement Apollo's equity capital to make additional portfolio investments. Apollo has employed a significant portion of its equity capital and expects to begin using the Credit Agreement in the coming months to support additions to the portfolio.
 
From time to time, certain of the lenders provide customary commercial and investment banking services to Apollo. JPMorgan also serves as custodian for Apollo pursuant to a global custody agreement.

Each Foreign Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at any time the chief tax officer of such Foreign Lender becomes aware that it no longer satisfies the legal requirements to provide any previously delivered form or certificate to the Borrower (or any other form of certification adopted by the U.S. or other taxing authorities for such purpose).
provided
 
(f) . If the Administrative Agent, any Lender or an Issuing Bank determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund or credit (in lieu of such refund) of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section, it shall pay to the Borrower an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent, any Lender or an Issuing Bank, as the case may be, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund), provided that the Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent, any Lender or an Issuing Bank, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent, any Lender or an Issuing Bank in the event the Administrative Agent, any Lender or an Issuing Bank is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.

Treatment of Certain Refunds
 
SECTION 2.17. .
Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs
 
(a) . The Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees or reimbursement of LC Disbursements, or under Section 2.14, 2.15 or 2.16, or otherwise) or under any other Loan Document (except to the extent otherwise provided therein) prior to 2:00 p.m., Local Time, on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without set-off or counterclaim.

Payments by the Borrower
 
 
directly to the Persons entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All amounts owing under this Agreement (including commitment fees, payments required under Section 2.14, and payments required under Section 2.15 relating to any Loan denominated in Dollars, but not including principal of, and interest on, any Loan denominated in any Foreign Currency or payments relating to any such Loan required under Section 2.15, which are payable in such Foreign Currency) or under any other Loan Document (except to the extent otherwise provided therein) are payable in Dollars. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Borrower shall fail to pay any principal of any Loan when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration, by mandatory prepayment or otherwise), the unpaid portion of such Loan shall, if such Loan is not denominated in Dollars, automatically be redenominated in Dollars on the due date thereof (or, if such due date is a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor, on the last day of such Interest Period) in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent thereof on the date of such redenomination and such principal shall be payable on demand; and if the Borrower shall fail to pay any interest on any Loan that is not denominated in Dollars, such interest shall automatically be redenominated in Dollars on the due date therefor (or, if such due date is a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor, on the last day of such Interest Period) in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent thereof on the date of such redenomination and such interest shall be payable on demand.
 
(b) . If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, to pay interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, to pay principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties.
Application of Insufficient Payments
 
(c) . Except to the extent otherwise provided herein: (i) each Syndicated Borrowing shall be made from the Lenders, each payment of commitment fee under Section 2.11 shall be made for account of the Lenders, and each termination or reduction of the amount of the Commitments under Section 2.08 shall be applied to the respective Commitments of the Lenders, pro rata according to the amounts of their respective Commitments; (ii) each Syndicated Borrowing shall be allocated pro rata among the Lenders according to the amounts of their respective Commitments (in the case of the making of Syndicated Loans) or their respective Loans that are to be included in such Borrowing (in the case of conversions and continuations of Loans); (iii) each payment or prepayment of principal of Syndicated Loans by the Borrower shall be made for account of the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the respective unpaid principal
Pro Rata Treatment
 
 
amounts of the Syndicated Loans held by them; and (iv) each payment of interest on Syndicated Loans by the Borrower shall be made for account of the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the amounts of interest on such Loans then due and payable to the respective Lenders.
 
(d) . If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Syndicated Loans or participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Syndicated Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans and accrued interest thereon then due than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Syndicated Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Syndicated Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans; that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.
Sharing of Payments by Lenders
provided
 
(e) . Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for account of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or the Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Effective Rate.
Presumptions of Payment
 
 
(f) . If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.04(c), 2.05(e), 2.06(b) or 2.17(e), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.

The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.
Designation of a Different Lending Office
 
(b) . If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16, or if any Lender defaults in its obligation to fund Loans hereunder, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); that (i) the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent (and, if a Commitment is being assigned, the Issuing Bank and the Swingline Lender), which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.14 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.16, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.

The following press release was issued by Apollo Investment Corporation on May 24, 2005:
 
 
NEW YORKMay 23, 2005Apollo Investment Corporation (NASDAQ: AINV) today announced financial results for its first fiscal year ended March 31, 2005. AINV commenced operations on April 8, 2004 after closing its initial public offering of 62,000,000 shares of common stock at $15.00 per share. The primary purpose of the initial public offering was to obtain capital with which to invest primarily in mezzanine loans, senior secured loans and equity investments in U.S. middle-market companies. After deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses, Apollo Investment Corporation received net proceeds of $870.2 million or $14.035 per share. At March 31, 2005, our net asset value was $14.27 per share after deducting dividends of $0.485 per share.

Portfolio and Investment Activity
 
During our first fiscal year, we invested $894.3 million in 37 portfolio companies and received principal prepayments of $71.7 million. At March 31, 2005, our net portfolio was invested 51% in subordinated debt/corporate notes, 42% in senior secured loans, 3% in common stock/warrants and 4% in cash equivalents. Our weighted average yield on invested capital was 10.9% at March 31, 2005. The weighted average yield on our invested capital including cash equivalents and before expenses was 10.2% versus 9.3% at December 31, 2004. Weighted average yields on our subordinated debt and senior secured debt were 13.7% and 8.2%, respectively, at March 31, 2005.
 
For the quarter ended March 31, 2005, investments totaled $163.3 million across ten portfolio companies. This relatively moderate level of activity was a result of slower middle market M&A activity and a robust credit market that in many cases priced risk-reward inappropriately from our standpoint. During the quarter, we invested $40.0 million in ALM Media Holdings, a leading publisher of journals, periodicals and other media to the legal industry. We also invested $19.0 million in Tumi Holdings, a leading international brand in prestige travel and business luggage and personal accessories. Other selected investments were senior secured loans to American Safety Razor,
 
Goodyear Tire & Rubber, MGM/LOC Acquisition Co., Ranpak Corp., Spectrum Brands (formerly Rayovac), Trout Coal Holdings and Wyle Laboratories. We also increased our positions in Language Line's subordinated debt during the quarter. Principal repayments during the quarter totaled $46.5 million as our investments in Prestige Brands and United Industries were fully prepaid together with applicable prepayment penalties.
 
From a market perspective, since quarter end the credit markets have deteriorated. This positions us well to invest our substantial liquid resources at attractive values given our recently closed undrawn $800 million credit facility. Additionally, as we progress further into 2005, we expect to selectively exit some of our initial investments in first lien, senior secured debt, as a source of additional liquidity, in favor of higher yielding second lien and subordinated loans. Our senior secured loans are floating rate investments that have performed well in a rising interest rate environment. At March 31, 2005, our first lien, senior secured debt portfolio totaled $141.7 million and yielded 6.3%.
 
Chairman and CEO, Michael S. Gross said, "We have concluded our first fiscal year of operations exceeding the objectives we laid out at the time of the initial public offering having invested close to $900 million in a high quality diversified portfolio that is providing attractive early returns to our investors. Throughout the year, we were driven by the efforts and dedication of our investment professionals and our access to invaluable proprietary research, broad network of industry contacts and our deep relationships with middle market sponsors. Our primary objective is to create and maintain a well diversified, performing investment portfolio one credit at a time. In general, we remain comfortable with the annual investment pace we experienced in our first fiscal year, however, we expect that pace to vary quarter to quarter, as it did in this past year. As we proceed into fiscal 2006, we believe our company is well positioned with a diversified portfolio of investments, a strong, flexible balance sheet and an expanding pipeline of opportunities."
 
Conference Call at 10:00 a.m. ET on May 24, 2005

Results of Operations
 
Operating Income
 
Interest income for the quarter ended March 31, 2005 totaled $21.3 million versus $14.8 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2004. For the period April 8, 2004 (commencement of operations) through March 31, 2005, gross operating income totaled $47.8 million, all of which represented interest income. Origination, closing and/or commitment fees associated with investments in portfolio companies that we receive are accreted into interest income over the respective terms of the applicable loans. For the period from April 8, 2004 (commencement of operations) through March 31, 2005, these fees totaled $4.5 million. Our gross income for the fiscal year also reflects income earned from a significant amount of short-term U.S. Government securities and other temporary investments held during the ramp up period of our portfolio since our initial public offering. Accordingly, our gross income is generally lower than what would normally be earned had we been more fully invested for the entire fiscal year.
 
Operating Expenses
 
Operating expenses totaled $5.8 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2005 versus $5.7 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2004. For the period April 8, 2004 (commencement of operations) through March 31, 2005, operating expenses totaled $22.4 million. This amount consisted of investment advisory and management fees, insurance expenses, administrative services expenses, professional fees, directors' fees and other general and administrative expenses. It also included a non-recurring expense of $252,311 related to the organization of Apollo Investment Corporation.
 
Net Operating Income
 
The Company's net operating income for the quarter ended March 31, 2005 totaled $15.6 million versus $9.1 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2004. For the period from April 8, 2004 (commencement of operations) through March 31, 2005, our net operating income was $25.5 million.
 
Net Unrealized Appreciation on Investments and Cash Equivalents
 
For the quarter ended March 31, 2005, the Company had a decrease in net unrealized appreciation of $3.9 million versus an increase of $16.2 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2004. At March 31, 2005, net unrealized appreciation totaled $18.2 million of which $3.9 million was attributable to net unrealized appreciation on our bank debt/senior secured loans, $12.3 million was attributable to our subordinated debt/corporate notes, $1.0 million was attributable to our equity investments and $1.0 million attributable to unrealized appreciation on our forward foreign currency contract used to hedge our foreign exchange rate risk for WDAC Intermediate Corp.
 
Net Realized Gains/Losses
 
The Company had exits and repayments totaling $46.5 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2005 versus $25.3 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2004. The net realized gain on investments for the quarter totaled $354 versus a loss of $322 for the quarter ended December 31, 2004. For the period from April 8, 2004 (commencement of operations) through March 31, 2005, we had total principal repayments and exits of $71.7 million and total net realized losses of $658 on our investments. Furthermore, we realized $640,200 from the settlement of our forward foreign currency contract in March 2005 and we incurred net realized losses on the sale of our U.S. Treasury Bills totaling $144,381 during the period from April 8, 2004 (commencement of operations) through March 31, 2005.
 
Net Increase in Stockholders' Equity From Operations
 
For the quarter ended March 31, 2005, the Company had a net increase in stockholders' equity resulting from operations of $12.3 million versus $25.2 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2004. Our operations generated a total net increase in stockholders' equity resulting from operations of $44.1 million for the period April 8, 2004 (commencement of operations) through March 31, 2005. Based on our weighted-average shares outstanding, our net change in stockholders' equity from operations was $0.198 for the quarter ended March 31, 2005 versus $0.406 for the quarter ended December 31, 2004. The net change in stockholders' equity from operations for the period from April 8, 2004 (commencement of operations) through March 31, 2005 was $0.711 per share.
 
Dividends
 
Dividends paid to stockholders for the quarter totaled $16.2 million or $0.26 per share versus $11.2 million or $0.18 per share for the quarter ended December 31, 2004. For the period April 8, 2004 (commencement of operations) through March 31, 2005, dividends paid to stockholders totaled $30.2 million or $0.485 per share. Please look for our first fiscal quarter's dividend announcement in mid June 2005. With respect to the dividends paid to shareholders, income from origination, structuring, closing, commitment and other upfront fees associated with investments in portfolio companies is treated as taxable income and accordingly, distributed to shareholders. Tax characteristics of all dividends will be reported to shareholders on Form 1099 after the end of the calendar year.
 
Subsequent Event
 
Shortly after our fiscal year end, we increased our capital resources by closing on an $800 million, multi-currency, five year, senior secured credit facility with a group of six relationship banks. The credit agreement also provides for the ability of us to seek additional commitments in an aggregate amount of up to $400 million. The interest rate applicable to borrowings under this credit facility will be LIBOR plus 100 basis points. We expect this significant capital resource to provide us with the flexibility to take advantage of market opportunities when they arise and to provide us with a strong balance sheet as we move into our second fiscal year of operations.

Item 9.01. Financial Statements & Exhibits
 
The following press release was issued by Apollo Investment Corporation on August 3, 2005:
 
 
NEW YORKAugust 3, 2005Apollo Investment Corporation (NASDAQ: AINV) today announced financial results for its fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2005.
 
HIGHLIGHTS:
 
 
Portfolio and Investment Activity
 
During the quarter ended June 30, 2005, Apollo Investment Corporation ("AIC" or the "Company") invested $250.3 million across seven new portfolio companies while adding to four existing positions. AIC generally invested higher in the capital structures of these companies on average, investing $193.4 million in mostly second lien, senior secured loans while subordinated and equity opportunities totaled $56.9 million. The weighted average yields on the senior secured and subordinated loans made during the quarter were 11.3% and 12.8%, respectively.
 
Throughout the quarter AIC remained selective, but prudently positioned the portfolio to hold a core group of attractively priced second lien loans with companies that possess strong credit characteristics. In advance of drawing on its substantial credit facility and as the Company had planned at the time of its IPO, it began rationalizing the composition of its portfolio by selectively exiting certain of its first lien and lower yielding senior secured loans. These loans were generally sold at par or better reducing these holdings by $94.5 million during the quarter.
 
As the first fiscal quarter of 2006 closed, the Company realized significant earnings from its investment in N.E.W. Customer Services Companies ("N.E.W."), a portfolio company in which AIC invested in August 2004. The successful and strong financial results of N.E.W.'s business led management of the company to refinance its subordinated debt and simultaneously, structure a dividend recapitalization plan.
 
At June 30, 2005, AIC's net portfolio of $1.0 billion was invested 48% in subordinated debt/corporate notes, 2% in common stock, 46% in senior secured loans and 4% in cash equivalents. It's remaining first lien senior loan holdings were 11% of the portfolio at June 30, 2005. A year earlier at June 30, 2004, the net portfolio was invested 6% in subordinated debt/corporate notes, 21% in 1
st
and 2
nd
lien senior secured loans and 73% in cash equivalents.
At June 30, 2005, the weighted average yield on AIC's debt portfolio was 11.8% versus 11.2% at March 31, 2005 and 7.4% at June 30, 2004. The weighted average yield on the entire portfolio, including cash equivalents, was 11.2% at June 30, 2005 versus 10.2% at March 31, 2005 and 2.7% at June 30, 2004. The weighted average yield on our subordinated debt/corporate notes was 13.6% at June 30, 2005 versus 13.7 at March 31, 2005 and 10.6% at June 30, 2004. The total bank debt/senior secured loan portfolio yielded 10.0% at June 30, 2005 versus 8.2% at March 31, 2005 and 6.3% at June 30, 2004. Of the bank debt, the weighted average yield attributable to first lien notes was 8.1% at June 30, 2005 versus 6.3% at March 31, 2005 and 5.0% at June 30, 2004. AIC's second lien bank debt yielded 10.6% at June 30, 2005 versus 9.4% at March 31, 2005 and 8.4% at June 30, 2004. Yields are computed using interest rates as of the balance sheet date and include amortization of loan origination fees, original issue discount and market premium or discount, weighted by their respective costs when averaged.
 
"After fully investing our IPO proceeds by the close of our first fiscal year, we entered our second fiscal year well positioned with significant capital resources and an expanding pipeline of opportunities," said Chairman and CEO, Michael S. Gross. "We accomplished three important objectives this quarter as we exited many of our lower yielding senior secured loans, realized gains on our investments and continued to build a high quality, higher yielding portfolio. We are pleased that our investment performance-to-date combined with the continued growth in the size and yield of our portfolio will allow us to continue to deliver sequential quarterly dividend growth."
 
Conference Call at 10:00 a.m. ET on August 4, 2005
 
The company will host a conference call at 10:00a.m. (ET) on August 4, 2005 to discuss 1
st
fiscal quarter 2006 financial results. All interested parties are welcome to participate. You can access the conference call by dialing (877) 780-2271 approximately 5-10 minutes prior to the call. International callers should dial (973) 582-2773. All callers should reference "Apollo Investment Corporation". An archived replay of the call will be available through August 18, 2005 by calling (877) 519-4471. International callers please dial (973) 341-3080. For the replay, please reference pin # 6296193.
 
Results of Operations
 
Results comparisons to the quarter ended June 2004 may not necessarily be meaningful as our portfolio was largely in cash equivalents from our initial IPO in April 2004.

NEW YORKNovember 3, 2005Apollo Investment Corporation (NASDAQ: AINV) today announced financial results for its fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2005.
 
HIGHLIGHTS:
 
 
Portfolio and Investment Activity
 
Our ongoing investment strategy and strong relationships combined to produce an active second fiscal quarter. Throughout the summer months, activity remained strong as we continued to identify attractive investment opportunities with middle market companies generating strong free cash flow. We also identified some interesting private equity opportunities at prices that met our value discipline. During the quarter ended September 30, 2005, we invested $302.9 million across eight new portfolio companies while adding to two existing positions. These investments were in our targeted asset classes with $37.7 million invested in private equity, $224.6 million invested in subordinated debt and $40.6 million invested in second lien bank debt. In addition, we re-invested an additional $30.0 million in the refinanced bank debt of Healthy Directions, LLC as our $26.4 million position with the company was pre-paid. Investments during the quarter totaled $332.9 million. For the fiscal year-to-date period April 1, 2005 through September 30, 2005, we invested $583.6 million across 15 new and 7 existing portfolio companies.
 
In addition to the $26.4 million refinancing of Healthy Directions, LLC, we also continued to rationalize our portfolio during the quarter ended September 30 by selectively exiting $68.9 million in lower-yielding senior bank debt. Also during the quarter, our $37.0 million subordinated loan to National Waterworks was pre-paid at a premium. For the quarter and six months ended September 30, 2005, we had proceeds from exits and prepayments
totaling $134.2 million and $258.7 million, respectively. Of the $258.7 million of total fiscal year exits and prepayments, $190 million were exits of senior loans which we intended to divest. The remaining $69 million were pre-payments by two successful companies.
 
Beginning in early July, we began drawing on our $800 million, multi-currency credit facility and had $289 million drawn and outstanding at September 30 with $511 million available. Our net portfolio reached $1.2 billion and was invested 56.9% in subordinated debt/corporate notes, 5.3% in private equity and 37.8% in senior secured loans. Our remaining first lien senior secured debt holdings represented 5.7% of our portfolio at September 30, 2005. A year earlier at September 30, 2004, our net portfolio of $901.1 million was invested 13.3% in subordinated debt/corporate notes, 31.4% in senior secured loans, 0.7% in equity and 54.6% in cash equivalents. At September 30, 2005, 52% of our debt portfolio is floating rate debt and 48% is fixed rate debt.
 
At September 30, 2005, the weighted average yield on our debt portfolio was 12.2% versus 11.8% at June 30, 2005 and 8.8% at September 30, 2004. The weighted average yield on our subordinated debt/corporate notes was 13.4% at September 30, 2005 versus 13.6% at June 30, 2005 and 12.8% at September 30, 2004. Our total bank debt/senior secured loan portfolio yielded 10.4% at September 30, 2005 versus 10.0% at June 30, 2005 and 6.9% at September 30, 2004. The weighted average yield attributable to first lien bank loans was 9.6% at September 30, 2005 versus 8.1% at June 30, 2005 and 5.4% at September 30, 2004. Our second lien bank loans yielded 10.6% at September 30, 2005 versus 10.6% at June 30, 2005 and 8.2% at September 30, 2004.
 
"Our strong deal flow and selective exits delivered healthy net portfolio growth during the quarter", said Chairman and CEO, Michael S. Gross. "We continued to add targeted assets while we strategically exited almost all of our non-core senior loans. In total and for our first eighteen months of operations, we have invested $1.5 billion across 52 portfolio companies. We have also built a strong, client service business executing transactions with 42 quality financial sponsors that look for consistency and reliability in the middle of the capital structure. In addition and consistent with our stated goal of delivering sequential growth in our quarterly dividend, we increased our dividend to $0.43 per share for the September quarter. Based on our recent closing stock price of $19.10 per share, our annualized dividend yield is 9.0%. Looking forward, you should continue to expect a competitive marketplace and a variable investment pace as we remain steadfast and disciplined with our capital, irrespective of the number of opportunities available to us."

Results of Operations
 
Results comparisons are for the three and six months ended September 2005 and 2004.

Investment Income
 
Gross investment income totaled $35.0 million and $72.8 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended September 30, 2005 compared to $7.9 million and $11.7 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended September 30, 2004.

Expenses net of performance-based incentive fees and interest and other credit facility expenses for the three and six months ended September 30, 2005 were $6.8 million and $12.6 million, respectively, versus the $5.6 million and $10.9 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended September 30, 2004. Operating expenses consist of base investment advisory and management fees, insurance expenses, administrative services fees, professional fees, directors' fees, audit and tax services expenses, and other general and administrative expenses. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to the increase in base management fees related to the growth of our investment portfolio as compared to the September 2004 comparative periods.

This compared to net appreciation of $3.5 million and $5.9 million, respectively, on the portfolio for the three and six months ended September 30, 2004. At September 30, 2005, net unrealized appreciation totaled $10.6 million of which $5.2 million was attributable to net unrealized appreciation on our bank debt/senior secured debt, $1.5 million was attributable to net unrealized appreciation on our subordinated debt/corporate notes/equity and $3.9 million in unrealized appreciation on our foreign currency contracts and translations.

Pricing was set, and remains, at 100 basis points over LIBOR.
                        The Agreement also provided for the ability of Apollo to seek additional commitments from lenders in an aggregate amount of up to $400,000,000 without the consent of any lender other than those providing the additional commitments. Effective December 29, 2005, lenders provided such additional commitments in the amount of $100,000,000, increasing the total facility size to $900 million, on the same terms and conditions as the existing commitments. Apollo maintains its ability to seek an additional $300,000,000 of commitments from lenders in the future under the Agreement.
                        The Agreement is generally being used to supplement Apollo's equity capital to make additional portfolio investments.

Item 9.01  Financial Statements & Exhibits
 
The following press release was issued by Apollo Investment Corporation on February 7, 2006:
 
 
NEW YORKFebruary 7, 2006Apollo Investment Corporation (NASDAQ: AINV) today announced financial results for its fiscal third quarter ended December 31, 2005.
 
HIGHLIGHTS:
 
 
Portfolio and Investment Activity
 
After two active investment quarters, we entered our third fiscal quarter well positioned with a high quality portfolio and significant debt capital available for investment. Due to our robust deal sourcing network and our consistent and credible capital, we are pleased to report that we found significant opportunities to invest in larger middle market companies with strong management teams generating high free cash flow. Accordingly, and during the quarter ended December 31, 2005, we invested $257 million across five new and two existing portfolio companies. All investments were in our targeted asset classes with $161 million invested in subordinated debt, $87 million invested in second lien bank debt and $9 million invested in private equity. For the fiscal year-to-date period April 1, 2005 through December 31, 2005, we invested $841 million across 20 new and 9 existing portfolio companies.
 
Also during the quarter we were able to further rationalize our portfolio by selectively exiting $27 million of our positions in lower-yielding senior bank debt and corporate notes. We also saw well-performing portfolio companies pre-pay $76 million of their debt. For the quarter and nine months ended December 31, 2005, we had proceeds from
exits and prepayments totaling $103 million and $361 million, respectively. Of the $361 million of total fiscal year exits and prepayments, $217 million were planned exits of senior loans and lower yielding corporate notes. The remaining $145 million were pre-payments by eight successful companies.
 
We continued utilizing our $900 million credit facility this quarter and had $413 million drawn and outstanding at December 31 with $487 million available. Our net portfolio reached $1.35 billion and was invested 59.9% in subordinated debt, 6.3% in private equity and 33.8% in senior secured loans. A year earlier at December 31, 2004, our net portfolio of $887 million was invested 46.9% in subordinated debt, 32.6% senior secured loans, 2.3% in private equity and 18.2% in cash equivalents.
 
At December 31, 2005, the weighted average yield on our debt portfolio was up to 12.6% versus 12.2% at September 30, 2005 and 10.9% at December 31, 2004. The weighted average yield on our subordinated debt was 13.4% at December 31, 2005 versus 13.4% at September 30, 2005 and 13.8% at December 31, 2004. Our total bank debt/senior secured loan portfolio yielded 11.3% at December 31, 2005 versus 10.4% at September 30, 2005 and 7.6% at December 31, 2004. Yields are computed using interest rates as of the balance sheet date and include amortization of loan origination and commitment fees, original issue discount and market premium or discount, weighted by their respective costs when averaged.
 
"Our reputable client service franchise continues to attract new clients and repeat business", said Chairman and CEO, Michael S. Gross. "These relationships are strategic and are with well-respected firms. During the quarter, we selectively and opportunistically added liquidity by successfully expanding our credit facility to $900 million in total commitments. This increase will give us the flexibility of added capital as we progress into 2006. We also continue to be pleased with the performance and quality of our overall investment portfolio. Through December 31, all debt investments continue to perform. Furthermore, and with greater than 45% of all our debt investments in senior bank debt, we have generated an IRR in excess of 15% on our debt portfolio since the IPO. When combined with the performance of our equity investments which represented less than 5% of our $1.7 billion of invested capital, our portfolio's IRR exceeded 20%. These strong returns to date have allowed us to distribute a steady and growing dividend stream and give us confidence in our future dividend stream to shareholders."
 
Conference Call at 10:00 a.m. ET on February 8, 2006
 
The company will also host a conference call at 10:00 a.m. (Eastern Time) on Wednesday, February 8, 2006 to discuss its third fiscal quarter financial results.

Expenses consist of base investment advisory and management fees, insurance expenses, administrative services fees, professional fees, directors' fees, audit and tax services expenses, and other general and administrative expenses.

At December 31, 2005, net unrealized appreciation totaled $18.9 million of which $2.0 million was attributable to net unrealized appreciation on our bank debt/senior secured debt and $16.9 million was attributable to net unrealized appreciation on our subordinated debt and private equity (after considering the effects of foreign currency hedging for our non-U.S. investments).
 
Net Increase in Net Assets From Operations

At December 31, 2005, the Company has $413 million in borrowings outstanding and $487 million available for its use.

Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Principal Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Principal Officers.
1. On February 24, 2006, Apollo Investment Corporation (the "Company") issued the following press release.
NEW YORK, February 24, 2006  The Board of Directors of Apollo Investment Corporation (NASDAQ: AINV), announced today that Michael S. Gross, the Company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, resigned as Chief Executive Officer in order to pursue other opportunities in the alternative asset arena. Mr. Gross, 44, will continue to serve as non-executive Chairman of the Company and as chairman of the investment committee. Mr. Gross, who has served in his present capacity since the Company's founding in February 2004, will be succeeded as Chief Executive Officer by John Hannan, who is currently, and will remain, a director and is a co-founder of Apollo Management, L.P. Art Penn has been elected President and will remain the Company's Chief Operating Officer, a position he has held with the Company since its inception.
"As a director of our Company since its inception, John Hannan has intimate knowledge of our business," said Mr. Gross. "In addition, as a fellow founding partner of Apollo Management L.P. and a partner of mine for 18 years, John Hannan brings solid relationships and a wealth of experience and sound judgment to the position. Art Penn has been integral to the Company's past success, and his promotion to President will ensure leadership continuity going forward," said Mr. Gross. "Over the last two years, supported by our highly talented team of investment professionals and the entire Apollo organization, we have built an exceptionally strong foundation for Apollo Investment Corporation. Our business plan has been validated by our record of generating consistently strong returns for our shareholders."
In the first 21 months since Apollo Investment Corp.'s initial public offering in April 2004, the Company has invested over $1.7 billion across 57 portfolio companies. The Company has achieved an internal rate of return on its debt investments of greater than 15%. When its private equity investments are included, the IRR on invested capital exceeds 20%. Since the IPO and through February 23, 2006, the cumulative total return, including reinvested dividends, to shareholders has been 42.4%. Apollo Investment Corp.'s quarterly shareholder dividend has risen every quarter since September 30, 2004, the Company's second full quarter as a public company, with the most recent quarterly dividend being 44 cents per share.
"In the spring of 2004, we set out to create a new company that would bring Apollo's extensive private equity investing experience to bear on an underserved market  growing, middle-market companies in need of capital," said Mr. Gross. "We built an environment and corporate structure that would allow us to put capital to work prudently and share returns with our shareholders. We have been gratified by the results thus far, and with the relationships we have built with all our stakeholders: clients, private equity sponsors, and our shareholders."
 
"As Apollo Investment Corporation approaches the second anniversary of its IPO, the investment portfolio is performing well, the outlook for deploying capital is quite favorable and we have a proven investment team firmly established," said Mr. Gross. "I believe it is a good time for a seamless leadership transition that permits me to remain involved with the Company but also enables me to pursue other opportunities in the alternative asset arena in a new capacity."
"As I embark on a new phase of my professional life, it also makes sense for me to disengage from my responsibilities as a founding partner of Apollo Management, L.P.," Mr. Gross added. "Over the past sixteen years, I had the opportunity to help build the firm with a group of very talented partners and colleagues. I wish them continued success."
"Since we founded Apollo Management in 1990, Michael Gross has been an integral partner of the firm," said Leon Black, founding partner of Apollo Management, L.P. "Having worked with Michael for close to two decades, I'm confident he will continue to find success. We wish him well in his future endeavors."

Investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk, including the risk of the use of leverage. Before buying any securities, you should read the discussion of the material risks of investing in our securities in "Risk Factors" beginning on page 6 of the accompanying prospectus.
Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state securities commission, nor any other regulatory body has approved or disapproved of these securities or determined if this prospectus supplement or the accompanying prospectus is truthful or complete.

Table of Contents
You should rely only on the information contained in this prospectus supplement and the accompanying base prospectus, which we refer to collectively as the "prospectus." We have not authorized anyone to provide you with additional information, or information different from that contained in this prospectus supplement, and the accompanying prospectus, if any. If anyone provides you with different or additional information, you should not rely on it. We are offering to sell, and seeking offers to buy, securities only in jurisdictions where offers and sales are permitted. The information contained in or incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus is accurate only as of the date of this prospectus supplement or such prospectus. Our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may have changed since then.
 
 
 
 
Table of Contents
Table of Contents
 
The following table is intended to assist you in understanding the costs and expenses that an investor in shares of our common stock will bear directly or indirectly. We caution you that some of the percentages indicated in the table below are estimates and may vary. Except where the context suggests otherwise, whenever this prospectus contains a reference to fees or expenses paid by "you," "us" or "Apollo Investment," or that "we" will pay fees or expenses, stockholders will indirectly bear such fees or expenses as investors in Apollo Investment.
 
 
The SEC requires that "Total annual expenses" be calculated as a percentage of net assets in the above chart rather than total assets, which includes assets that have been funded with borrowed monies (leverage). For reference, the below chart illustrates our "Total annual expenses" as a percentage of our total assets:
 
 
 
Table of Contents
 
Example
 
The following example demonstrates the projected dollar amount of total cumulative expenses that would be incurred over various periods with respect to a hypothetical investment in our common stock. In calculating the following expense amounts, we have assumed we would have no additional leverage and that our annual operating expenses would remain at the levels set forth in the table above, other than the performance-based incentive fee. Because the example below assumes a 5% annual return, the performance-based incentive fee would not be earned or payable and is not included in the example.
 
 
While the example assumes a 5% annual return as required by the SEC, our performance will vary and may result in a return greater or less than 5%. Assuming a 5% annual return, the incentive fee under the investment advisory and management agreement would not be earned or payable and is not included in the example. This illustration also assumes that we will not realize any capital gains computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation in any of the indicated time periods. If we achieve sufficient returns on our investments, including through the realization of capital gains, to trigger an incentive fee of a material amount, our expenses, and returns to our investors, would be higher. In addition, while the example assumes reinvestment of all dividends and distributions at net asset value, participants in our dividend reinvestment plan will receive a number of shares of our common stock, determined by dividing the total dollar amount of the dividend payable to a participant by the market price per share of our common stock at the close of trading on the valuation date for the dividend. See "Dividend Reinvestment Plan" for additional information regarding our dividend reinvestment plan.
 
This example and the expenses in the table above should not be considered a representation of our future expenses, and actual expenses (including the cost of debt, if any, and other expenses) may be greater or less than those shown.
 
Table of Contents
 
This summary highlights some of the information in this prospectus. It is not complete and may not contain all of the information that you may want to consider. You should read carefully the more detailed information set forth under "Risk Factors" in the accompanying prospectus and the other information included in this prospectus supplement. In this prospectus and any accompanying prospectus, except where the context suggests otherwise, the terms "we", "us", "our" and "Apollo Investment" refer to Apollo Investment Corporation; "Apollo Investment Management" or "investment adviser" refers to Apollo Investment Management, L.P.; "Apollo Administration" refers to Apollo Investment Administration, LLC; and "Apollo" refers to the affiliated companies of Apollo Investment Management, L.P.
 
Apollo Investment
 
Apollo Investment is a closed-end management investment company that has elected to be treated as a business development company under the 1940 Act. Our investment objective is to generate both current income and capital appreciation through debt and equity investments. We invest primarily in middle-market companies in the form of mezzanine and senior secured loans (which may include first and second lien loans), each of which may include an equity component, as well as by making direct equity investments in such companies. From time to time, we may also invest in public companies that are thinly traded. We use the term middle market to include companies with annual revenues typically between $50 million and $1 billion.
 
Our portfolio is comprised primarily of investments in long-term subordinated loans, referred to as mezzanine loans, and senior secured loans of private middle-market companies, and includes common stock and other equity interests. Our targeted investment typically ranges between $20 million and $150 million, although this investment size may vary proportionately as the size of our capital base changes. We source our deals through a network of relationships with financial sponsors as well as commercial and investment banks whose focus is on middle-market companies.
 
While our primary focus is to generate current income through investments in loans, we may invest a portion of the portfolio in opportunistic investments in order to seek to enhance returns to stockholders. Such investments may include investments in high-yield bonds, distressed debt, foreign securities, or securities of public companies that are not thinly traded. We expect that these public companies generally will have debt securities that are non-investment grade. For a discussion of the limitations imposed by the 1940 Act on our ability to make certain of these investments, see "RegulationQualifying Assets" in the accompanying prospectus.
 
About Apollo
 
Founded in 1990, Apollo is a recognized leader in private equity investing, having invested more than $13 billion in over 150 companies since its founding. Apollo traditionally has focused on companies that it believes are undervalued yet have successful business models, strong cash flows and prospects for value creation. The Apollo investment professionals' disciplined, value-oriented strategy has sought to identify opportunities in all investment environments, selecting from a range of approaches, such as traditional or corporate partner buyouts, distressed debt buyouts or more liquid, non-control distressed debt investments. The Apollo investment professionals have sought through this strategy to provide investors with attractive returns while minimizing the risk of capital loss throughout economic cycles.
 
Apollo's active private investment funds focus primarily on making either control-oriented equity investments or distressed debt investments of $150 million or more, either for control or non-control positions. In contrast, Apollo Investment seeks to capitalize on the significant investment opportunities emerging in the lending market for middle-market companies, which it believes offers the potential for attractive risk-adjusted returns. Apollo Investment is currently the only Apollo-related investment vehicle focused primarily on investing in mezzanine and senior secured loans of middle-market companies and is currently the only publicly traded investment vehicle managed by an affiliate of Apollo.

On March 3, 2006, our Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.45 per share. The record date for the dividend is March 14, 2006, and the dividend is payable on March 30, 2006. Because this offering will not be completed before March 14, 2006, investors in this offering will not be entitled to receive this dividend.
 
On February 24, 2006, John J. Hannan, who has been one of our directors since inception, was elected our Chief Executive Officer, succeeding Michael S. Gross, who resigned in order to consider other opportunities in the alternative asset arena. Mr. Gross continues to serve as our non-executive Chairman and as chairman of the investment committee of Apollo Investment Management. On the same date, our Board of Directors elected Arthur H. Penn, our Chief Operating Officer since our inception, to serve as our President.
 
Table of Contents
 
We estimate that the net proceeds from the sale of the 15,000,000 shares of our common stock that we are offering, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated expenses of this offering payable by us, will be approximately $255.3 million (or $293.7 million, if the over-allotment is exercised in full), based upon a public offering price of $17.85 per share. We expect to use the net proceeds from selling shares of our common stock to repay indebtedness owed under our senior credit facility, to make investments in portfolio companies in accordance with our investment objective and for general corporate purposes.
 
At March 3, 2006, we had approximately $508 million outstanding under our senior credit facility. Our senior credit facility matures on April 14, 2010 and bears interest at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 100 basis points on the outstanding balance. Borrowings under our senior credit facility were used to fund investments in portfolio companies and for general corporate purposes. Amounts repaid under our senior credit facility will remain available for future borrowings.

Our common stock is quoted on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol "AINV". The following table lists the high and low closing prices for our common stock, the closing price as a percentage of net asset value, or NAV and quarterly dividends per share since shares of our initial public offering in April 2004. On March 16, 2006, the last reported closing price of our common stock was $17.85 per share.
 
 
Our common stock continues to trade in excess of our net asset value. There can be no assurance, however, that our shares will continue to trade above, below or at our net asset value.
 
We intend to pay quarterly dividends to our common stockholders. The amount of our quarterly dividend is determined by our Board of Directors. There can be no assurance that we will achieve investment results or maintain a tax status that will permit any particular level of dividend payment.

Overview
 
Apollo Investment was incorporated under the Maryland General Corporation Law in February 2004. We have elected to be treated as a business development company under the 1940 Act. As such, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. For instance, we generally have to invest at least 70% of our total assets in "qualifying assets," including securities of private or thinly traded public U.S. companies, cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less.
 
On April 5, 2004, we completed our initial public offering and became an externally managed, non-diversified, closed-end investment company that elected to be treated as a business development company under the 1940 Act. In addition, for tax purposes we have elected to be treated as a regulated investment company, or RIC, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Pursuant to these elections, we generally do not have to pay corporate-level taxes on any income we distribute to our stockholders. The following discussion and analysis covers the period from April 1, 2005 through December 31, 2005 and supplements the section captioned "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in the accompanying prospectus.
 
Portfolio and Investment Activity
 
After two active investment quarters ending September 30, 2005, we entered our third fiscal quarter well positioned with a quality portfolio and significant debt capital available for investment. At December 31, 2005, we did not have any loans that were not current in terms of payment of cash interest and principal. Due to our robust deal sourcing network and our consistent and credible capital, we found significant opportunities to invest in larger middle market companies with strong management teams generating high free cash flow during the quarter ended December 31, 2005. Accordingly, during the quarter ended December 31, 2005, we invested $257.3 million in five new and two existing portfolio companies. All investments were in our targeted asset classes, with $161.0 million invested in subordinated debt, $86.8 million invested in second lien bank debt and $9.5 million invested in private equity (some of which included debt and equity components). For the nine-month period from April 1, 2005 through December 31, 2005, we invested $840.9 million in 20 new and nine existing portfolio companies.
 
During the quarter ended December 31, 2005, we were able to rationalize our portfolio further by selectively exiting $26.7 million of our positions in lower-yielding senior bank debt and corporate notes. We also saw well-performing portfolio companies pre-pay $75.9 million of their debt to us. For the quarter and nine months ended December 31, 2005, we received proceeds from exits and prepayments totaling $102.6 million and $361 million, respectively. Of the $361 million of total exits and prepayments for the nine months ended December 31, 2005, $217 million were planned exits of senior loans and lower yielding corporate notes. The remaining $144 million were pre-payments by eight portfolio companies.
 
We continued utilizing our $900 million senior credit facility in the quarter ended December 31, 2005 and had $413 million drawn and outstanding at December 31, 2005, with $487 million in additional funds available under that facility. Our portfolio, net of cash equivalents, reached $1.35 billion and was invested 59.9% in subordinated debt, 6.3% in private equity and 33.8% in senior secured loans. A year earlier, at December 31, 2004, our portfolio of $887.2 million was invested 46.9% in subordinated debt, 32.6% in senior secured loans, 18.2% in cash equivalents and 2.3% in private equity.
 
At December 31, 2005, the weighted average yield on our debt portfolio was up to 12.6%, versus 12.2% at September 30, 2005 and 10.9% at December 31, 2004. The weighted average yield on our subordinated debt was 13.4% at December 31, 2005, versus 13.4% at September 30, 2005 and 13.8% at December 31, 2004. Our total senior secured loan portfolio yielded 11.3% at December 31, 2005 versus 10.4% at September 30, 2005 and 7.6%
 
Table of Contents
at December 31, 2004. We compute yields using interest rates as of the balance sheet date and include amortization of loan origination and commitment fees, original issue discount and market premium or discount, weighted by their respective costs when averaged.
 
Bank debt and senior secured debt and European mezzanine loans typically accrue interest at variable rates determined on the basis of a benchmark LIBOR, EURIBOR or prime rate, with stated maturities at origination that range from five to ten years. While subordinated debt issued within the United States will typically accrue interest at fixed rates, some of these investments may include zero coupon, PIK and/or step bonds that accrue income on a constant "yield-to-call" or maturity basis. At December 31, 2005, 52% or $656.4 million of our debt portfolio was fixed rate debt and 48% or $608.5 million was floating rate debt.
 
As a business development company, we must not acquire any assets other than "qualifying assets" specified in the 1940 Act unless, at the time the acquisition is made, at least 70% of our total assets are qualifying assets (with certain limited exceptions). If we invest in an issuer that, at the time we make the investment, has outstanding securities as to which a broker or dealer may extend or maintain margin credit or "marginable securities," these acquired assets cannot normally be treated as qualifying assets. This results from the definition of "eligible portfolio company" under the 1940 Act, which in part looks to whether a company has outstanding securities that are eligible for margin credit. Amendments promulgated in 1998 by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to Regulation T under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, expanded the definition of marginable security to include any non-equity security. These amendments have raised questions as to whether a private company that has outstanding debt securities would qualify as an eligible portfolio company. We note that under applicable self-regulatory organization rules that govern the ability of brokers and dealers to extend margin credit, many non-equity securities issued by private companies may not be effectively marginable. While we understand the SEC is considering these issues, we do not believe the SEC or the Staff has made any determinations with respect to the above. See "Regulation." We continue to monitor this issue closely and intend to adjust our investment focus as needed to comply with and/or take advantage of any future administrative position, judicial decision or legislative action.
 
In August 2004, our board of directors approved an amendment to our investment policy to eliminate the 5% limitation on investments on foreign securities. As such, these investments are included in our 30% "non-qualifying assets" bucket.
 
Results of Operations
 
Results comparisons are for the three and nine months ended December 2005 and 2004.
 
Investment Income
 
Gross investment income totaled $37.6 million and $110.4 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2005 compared to $14.8 million and $26.5 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2004. The increases in gross investment income were primarily due to the growth of our investment portfolio compared to the December 2004 comparative periods. For the nine months ended December 31, 2005, we had dividend income of $3.5 million and other income of $9.1 million. Our other income is primarily composed of consent fees.
 
Expenses
 
Expenses totaled $17.0 million and $43.9 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2005 of which $5.1 million and $16.6 million, respectively, were performance-based incentive fees and $4.2 million and $7.0 million, respectively, were interest and other credit facility expenses. Expenses net of performance-based incentive fees and interest and other credit facility expenses for the three and nine months
 
Table of Contents
ended December 31, 2005 were $7.7 million and $20.3 million, respectively, versus the $5.7 million and $16.6 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2004. Expenses consist of investment advisory and management fees payable to Apollo Investment Management, insurance expenses, administrative services fees, professional fees, directors' fees, audit and tax services expenses, and other general and administrative expenses. The increase in expenses, net of performance-based incentive fees and interest and other credit facility expenses, was primarily due to the increase in base management fees related to the growth of our investment portfolio as compared to the December 2004 comparative periods.
 
Net Investment Income
 
Our net investment income totaled $20.6 million and $66.5 million, or $0.33 per share and $1.06 per share, respectively, for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2005 versus $9.1 million and $9.9 million, or $0.15 per share and $0.16 per share, respectively, for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2004.
 
Net Realized Gains/Losses
 
We had sales and prepayments totaling $102.6 million and $361.3 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2005 versus $25.3 million and $25.8 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2004. Net realized gains on investments totaled $2.1 million and $5.6 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2005, versus $0.0 million for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2004. We also had net realized gains on our foreign currency transactions of $2.6 million and $5.4 million, respectively, during the three and nine months ended December 31, 2005 versus $0.0 million for both the three and nine month periods ended December 31, 2004. Total net realized gains for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2005 were $4.7 million and $10.9 million, respectively, versus a loss of $0.1 million for both the three and nine months ended December 31, 2004.
 
Net Unrealized Appreciation on Investments and Foreign Currency Contracts and Translations
 
For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2005, our investments, foreign currencies and other assets and liabilities had a net increase in appreciation of $8.3 million and $0.7 million, respectively. This compared to an increase in net appreciation of $16.2 million and $22.0 million, respectively, on our portfolio for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2004. At December 31, 2005, net unrealized appreciation totaled $18.9 million of which $2.0 million was attributable to net unrealized appreciation on our bank debt/senior secured debt and $16.9 million was attributable to net unrealized appreciation on our subordinated debt and private equity (after considering the effects of foreign currency hedging for our non-U.S. investments).
 
Net Increase in Net Assets From Operations
 
For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2005, we had a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of $33.5 million and $78.1 million, respectively, versus $25.2 million and $31.8 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2004. The net change in net assets from operations per share was $0.53 and $1.25, respectively, for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2005 versus $0.41 and $0.51 per share, respectively, for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2004.
 
Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources
 
Our liquidity and capital resources are generated primarily through our $900 million senior credit facility, which is a secured, multi-currency, five-year credit facility, as well as from cash flows from operations, including exits and prepayments of senior and subordinated loans and income earned from investments and cash equivalents (which are normally comprised of U.S. government securities and other high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less).
 
At December 31, 2005, we had $413 million in borrowings outstanding and $487 million available under this credit facility. In the future, we may raise additional capital through additional sales of our debt or equity
 
Table of Contents
securities under our shelf registration statement or by securitizing a portion of our investments. Because we are constrained in our ability to issue debt for the reasons given above, we are dependent on the issuance of equity as a financing source. We are restricted to issuing equity at prices equal to or above our net asset value at the time of issuance. We can offer no assurance that we will be able to issue equity when necessary. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of our common stock or debt securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock, the percentage ownership of our stockholders at the time would decrease, and they may experience additional dilution. In addition, any convertible or exchangeable securities may have rights, preferences and privileges more favorable than those of our common stock. Under the terms of our senior credit facility, as our equity capital base grows, we may qualify to access up to $300 million of additional credit commitments, and we are considering amending our senior credit facility to increase borrowing capacity further, although we have not yet determined the terms of such an amendment. The primary use of funds will be investments in portfolio companies, general corporate purposes and cash distributions to holders of common stock and any other securities we may issue in the future.
 
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
 
We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. Many of the investments in our debt portfolio have floating rates. We also have a significant portion of our investments with fixed rates. At December 31, 2005, 52% or $656.4 million of our debt portfolio was fixed rate debt and 48% or $608.5 million was floating rate debt.
 
As appropriate, we may hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using standard hedging instruments such as futures, options and forward contracts subject to the requirements of the 1940 Act. While hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates, they may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to our portfolio of investments. During the three and nine-month periods ended December 31, 2005, we did not engage in interest rate hedging activities.
 
On December 8, 2005, we entered into a forward foreign currency contract to hedge our exposure to the currency risk associated with our investment in WDAC Intermediate Corp. Accordingly, we sold 38,250,000 euro forward at a rate of 1.184 dollars per euro for settlement on March 8, 2006. Unrealized depreciation on this contract is represented on our statement of assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2005 and described further in footnote 7 to the financial statements.
 
Additionally, we currently have, and may continue to have, outstanding borrowings denominated in foreign currencies. These borrowings are primarily used to fund foreign investments. As a result of borrowing and subsequently investing in the same foreign currency denominated investments, we are able to effectively hedge our exposure to currency risk resulting from these foreign investments. Unrealized appreciation on these borrowings is reflected in the value of the outstanding liability for credit facility payable on our statement of assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2005 and described further in footnote 7 to the financial statements.
 
The following table is designed to illustrate the effect on return to a holder of our common stock of the leverage created by our use of borrowing, at the weighted average annual interest rate of 4.35% for the nine months ended December 31, 2005 and assuming hypothetical annual returns on our portfolio of minus 10 to plus 10 percent. As can be seen, leverage generally increases the return to stockholders when the portfolio return is positive and decreases return when the portfolio return is negative. Actual returns may be greater or less than those appearing in the table.

Dividends
 
Dividends paid to stockholders for the quarter totaled $27.8 million, or $0.44 per share, versus $11.2 million, or $0.18 per share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2004. For the period April 1, 2005 through December 31, 2005, dividends paid to stockholders totaled $74.1 million, or $1.18 per share. We report the tax characteristics of all dividends to our shareholders on Form 1099 after the end of the calendar year.
 
We have elected to be taxed as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. As a RIC, any income or gains that we distribute to our shareholders will not be subject to corporate-level tax as long as we annually distribute at least 90% of our investment company taxable income. In addition, we will not be subject to a nondeductible excise tax if we annually distribute at least 98% of our income (both ordinary income and net capital gains). We intend to make distributions to our stockholders on a quarterly basis of substantially all of our taxable net ordinary income. We also intend to make distributions of net realized capital gains, if any, at least annually.
 
We may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these distributions from time to time. In addition, we may be limited in our ability to make distributions due to the asset coverage test for borrowings applicable to us as a business development company under the 1940 Act and due to provisions in our credit facility. If we do not distribute a certain percentage of our income annually, we will suffer adverse tax consequences, including possible loss of our status as a RIC. We cannot assure stockholders that they will receive any distributions or distributions at a particular level.
 
With respect to the dividends paid to shareholders, income from origination, closing, commitment and other upfront fees associated with investments in portfolio companies is treated as taxable income and accordingly, distributed to stockholders. For the period from April 1, 2005 through December 31, 2005 these fees totaled $3.4 million. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005, these fees totaled $4.5 million.
 
Ordinary income dividends paid to shareholders that are non-resident aliens or foreign entities are federally subject to a 30% U.S. withholding tax, unless a reduced rate of withholding applies under an applicable tax treaty. For taxable years beginning before January 1, 2008, certain "interest-related dividends" and "short-term capital gains dividends" paid by a RIC to a non-U.S. shareholder and designated as such would be eligible for an exemption from U.S. withholding tax. We do not intend to designate interest-related dividends or short-term capital gain dividends. Accordingly, investment in the shares may not be appropriate for non-U.S. persons.

Citigroup Global Markets Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Banc of America Securities LLC and Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc. are acting as joint bookrunning managers of the offering and as representatives of the underwriters named below. Subject to the terms and conditions stated in the underwriting agreement dated the date of this prospectus, each underwriter named below has agreed to purchase, and we have agreed to sell to that underwriter, the number of shares set forth opposite the underwriter's name.
 
 
The underwriting agreement provides that the obligations of the underwriters to purchase the shares included in this offering are subject to certain conditions precedent, including the absence of any material adverse change in our business and the receipt of certain certificates, opinions and letters from us, our counsel and our independent registered public accounting firm. The underwriters are committed to purchase all shares included in this offering, other than those shares covered by the over-allotment option described below, if they purchase any of the shares.
 
The underwriters propose to offer some of the shares directly to the public at the public offering price set forth on the cover page of this prospectus and some of the shares to dealers at the public offering price less a concession not to exceed $0.48 per share. The underwriters may allow, and dealers may reallow, a concession not to exceed $0.10 per share on sales to other dealers. If all of the shares are not sold at the initial offering price, the representatives may change the public offering price and the other selling terms.
 
We have granted to the underwriters an option, exercisable for 30 days from the date of this prospectus, to purchase up to 2,250,000 additional shares of common stock at the public offering price less the underwriting discount. The underwriters may exercise the option solely for the purpose of covering over-allotments, if any, in connection with this offering. To the extent the option is exercised, each underwriter must purchase a number of additional shares approximately proportionate to that underwriter's initial purchase commitment. If the underwriters exercise the option in full, the public offering price, the sales load (underwriting discounts and commissions) and proceeds, net of offering expenses, to us would be $307.9 million, $13.9 million and $293.7 million, respectively.
 
We, our officers and directors, Apollo Investment Management and certain of the partners and officers of Apollo Investment Management (or any entities through which such partners and officers may invest in our shares) have agreed that, for a period of 90 days from the date of this prospectus, we and they will not, without the prior written consent of the representatives, dispose of or hedge any shares of our common stock or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock. Citigroup in its sole discretion may release any of the securities subject to these lock-up agreements at any time without notice. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for the purpose of allowing the underwriters to comply with NASD Rule 2711(f)(4), if (1) during the last 17 days of the initial 90-day lock-up period, we release earnings results or material news or a material event relating to us occurs or (2) prior to the expiration of the initial 90-day lock-up period, we announce that we will
 
Table of Contents
release earnings results during the 16-day period beginning on the last day of the initial 90-day lock-up period, then in each case the initial 90-day lock-up period will be extended until the expiration of the 18-day period beginning on the date of release of the earnings results or the occurrence of the material news or material event, as applicable.
 
The common stock is quoted on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol "AINV".
 
Each underwriter has represented, warranted and agreed that:
 
 
 
 
 
The following table shows the underwriting discounts and commissions that we are to pay to the underwriters in connection with this offering. These amounts are shown assuming both no exercise and full exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares of common stock.
 
 
In connection with the offering, the underwriters may purchase and sell shares of common stock in the open market. These transactions may include short sales, syndicate covering transactions and stabilizing transactions. Short sales involve syndicate sales of common stock in excess of the number of shares to be purchased by the underwriters in the offering, which creates a syndicate short position. "Covered" short sales are sales of shares made in an amount up to the number of shares represented by the underwriters' over-allotment option. In determining the source of shares to close out the covered syndicate short position, the underwriters will consider, among other things, the price of shares available for purchase in the open market as compared to the price at which they may purchase shares through the over-allotment option. Transactions to close out the covered syndicate short involve either purchases of the common stock in the open market after the distribution has been completed or the exercise of the over-allotment option. The underwriters may also make "naked" short sales of shares in excess of the over-allotment option. The underwriters must close out any naked short position by purchasing shares of common stock in the open market. A naked short position is more likely to be created if the underwriters are concerned that there may be downward pressure on the price of the shares in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in the offering. Stabilizing transactions consist of bids for or purchases of shares in the open market while the offering is in progress.
 
Table of Contents
The underwriters may also impose a penalty bid. Penalty bids permit the underwriters to reclaim a selling concession from a syndicate member when an underwriter repurchases shares originally sold by that syndicate member in order to cover syndicate short positions or make stabilizing purchases.
 
Any of these activities may have the effect of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the common stock. They may also cause the price of the common stock to be higher than the price that would otherwise exist in the open market in the absence of these transactions. The underwriters may conduct these transactions on the Nasdaq Global Market or in the over-the-counter market, or otherwise. If the underwriters commence any of these transactions, they may discontinue them at any time.
 
In addition, in connection with this offering, some of the underwriters may engage in passive market making transactions in the common stock on the Nasdaq Global Market, prior to the pricing and completion of the offering. Passive market making consists of displaying bids on the Nasdaq Global Market no higher than the bid prices of independent market makers and making purchases at prices no higher than those independent bids and effected in response to order flow. Net purchases by a passive market maker on each day are limited to a specified percentage of the passive market maker's average daily trading volume in the common stock during a specified period and must be discontinued when that limit is reached. Passive market making may cause the price of the common stock to be higher than the price that otherwise would exist in the open market in the absence of those transactions. If the underwriters commence passive market making transactions, they may discontinue them at any time.
 
We estimate that our portion of the total expenses of this offering will be $400,000. In addition, the underwriters have agreed to pay certain of our expenses associated with this offering.
 
As described under "Use of Proceeds," we intend to use a part of the net proceeds from this offering to repay a portion of the borrowings outstanding under our senior credit facility. Affiliates of each of Citigroup Global Markets Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities, Inc., Banc of America Securities LLC, Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc., UBS Securities LLC and Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC are lenders under each such credit facility and, therefore, will receive a portion of the net proceeds from this offering through the repayment of those borrowings. Accordingly, this offering is being made pursuant to NASD Rule 2710(h).
 
The underwriters have performed investment banking and advisory services for us from time to time for which they have received customary fees and expenses. The underwriters may, from time to time, engage in transactions with and perform services for us in the ordinary course of their business.
 
A prospectus in electronic format may be made available on the websites maintained by one or more of the underwriters. The representatives may agree to allocate a number of shares to underwriters for sale to their online brokerage account holders. The representatives will allocate shares to underwriters that may make Internet distributions on the same basis as other allocations. In addition, shares may be sold by the underwriters to securities dealers who resell shares to online brokerage account holders.
 
We have agreed to indemnify the underwriters against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, or to contribute to payments the underwriters may be required to make because of any of those liabilities.

Note 1. Organization
 
Apollo Investment Corporation ("Apollo Investment" or the "Company"), a Maryland corporation organized on February 2, 2004, is a closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that has filed an election to be treated as a business development company ("BDC") under the Investment Company Act of 1940. In addition, for federal income tax purposes we have elected to be treated as a regulated investment company, or RIC, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Our investment objective is to generate both current income and capital appreciation through debt and equity investments. We invest primarily in middle-market companies in the form of mezzanine and senior secured loans, each of which may include an equity component, and, to a lesser extent, by making direct equity investments in such companies.
 
On April 8, 2004, Apollo Investment closed its initial public offering and sold 62,000,000 shares of its common stock at a price of $15.00 per share, less an underwriting discount and commissions totaling $0.9375 per share. We commenced operations on April 8, 2004 as we received $870.15 million in total net proceeds from the offering.
 
Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies
 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reported period. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining these estimates could cause actual results to differ.
 
Interim financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP for interim financial information and pursuant to the requirements for reporting on Form 10-Q and Article 6 or 10 of Regulation S-X, as appropriate. Accordingly, certain disclosures accompanying financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP are omitted. In accordance with Article 6-09 of Regulation S-X under the Exchange Act, we are providing a Statement of Changes in Net Assets in lieu of a Statement of Changes in Stockholders' Equity. In addition, certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting solely of normal recurring accruals, considered necessary for the fair presentation of financial statements for the interim period, have been included.
 
The significant accounting policies consistently followed by Apollo Investment are:
 
 
 
Table of Contents
 
 
 
With respect to our investments for which market quotations are not readily available, our Board of Directors undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below:
 
 
 
 
 
 
The types of factors that we may take into account in fair value pricing our investments include, as relevant, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company's ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flow, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparison to publicly traded securities and other relevant factors.
 
Determination of fair values involves subjective judgments and estimates. Accordingly, these notes to our financial statements express the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of such valuations, and any change in such valuations, on our financial statements.

Note 3. Agreements
 
Apollo Investment has an Investment Advisory and Management Agreement with the Investment Adviser, Apollo Investment Management, L.P., under which the Investment Adviser, subject to the overall supervision of Apollo Investment's Board of Directors, will manage the day-to-day operations of, and provide investment advisory services to, Apollo Investment. For providing these services, the Investment Adviser receives a fee from Apollo Investment, consisting of two componentsa base management fee and an incentive fee. The base management fee is calculated at an annual rate of 2.00% of Apollo Investment's gross assets. The incentive fee has two parts, as follows: one part is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on Apollo Investment's pre-incentive fee net investment income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter. For this purpose, pre-incentive fee net investment income means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees (other than fees for providing managerial assistance), such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that we receive from portfolio companies) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus Apollo Investment's operating expenses for the quarter (including the base management fee, any expenses payable under the Administration Agreement, and any interest expense and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee). Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not include any realized capital gains computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation. Pre-incentive fee net investment income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of Apollo Investment's net assets at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, is compared to the hurdle rate of 1.75% per quarter (7% annualized). Our net investment income used to calculate this part of the incentive fee is also included in the amount of our gross assets used to calculate the 2% base management fee.
 
Table of Contents
 
 
Apollo Investment pays the Investment Adviser an incentive fee with respect to Apollo Investment's pre-incentive fee net investment income in each calendar quarter as follows: (1) no incentive fee in any calendar quarter in which Apollo Investment's pre-incentive fee net investment income does not exceed the hurdle rate; (2) 100% of Apollo Investment's pre-incentive fee net investment income with respect to that portion of such pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than 2.1875% in any calendar quarter; and (3) 20% of the amount of Apollo Investment's pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds 2.1875% in any calendar quarter. These calculations are appropriately pro rated for any period of less than three months and adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the relevant quarter. The second part of the incentive fee is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Investment Advisory and Management Agreement, as of the termination date), commencing on December 31, 2004, and will equal 20.0% of Apollo Investment's cumulative realized capital gains less cumulative realized capital losses, unrealized capital depreciation (unrealized depreciation on a gross investment-by-investment basis at the end of each calendar year) and all capital gains upon which prior performance-based capital gains incentive fee payments were previously made to the advisor.
 
For the three and nine month periods ended December 31, 2005, the Investment Adviser received $6,421 and $16,222, respectively, in base investment advisory and management fees and $5,138 and $16,622, respectively, in performance-based net investment income incentive fees from Apollo Investment.
 
Apollo Investment has also entered into an Administration Agreement with Apollo Investment Administration, LLC (the "Administrator") under which the Administrator provides administrative services for Apollo Investment. For providing these services, facilities and personnel, Apollo Investment reimburses the Administrator for Apollo Investment's allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by Apollo Administration in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent and Apollo Investment's allocable portion of its chief compliance officer and chief financial officer and their respective staffs. The Administrator will also provide on Apollo Investment's behalf managerial assistance to these portfolio companies to which Apollo Investment is required to provide such assistance.
 
For the three and nine month periods ended December 31, 2005, the Administrator was reimbursed $298 and $757, respectively, from Apollo Investment on the $359 and $1,074, respectively, of expenses accrued under the Administration Agreement.
 
On April 14, 2005, Apollo Investment entered into an $800 million Senior Secured Revolving Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement"), among Apollo Investment, the lenders party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. ("JPMorgan"), as administrative agent for the lenders. On December 29, 2005, the Credit Agreement was expanded to $900 million of commitments. From time to time, certain of the lenders provide customary commercial and investment banking services to affiliates of Apollo Investment. JPMorgan also serves as custodian and fund accounting agent for Apollo Investment.

Note 8. Expense Offset Arrangement
 
The Company benefits from an expense offset arrangement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. ("custodian bank") whereby the Company earns credits on any uninvested US dollar cash balances held by the custodian bank. These credits are applied by the custodian bank as a reduction of the monthly custody fees charged to the Company. The total amount of credits earned during the nine months ended December 31, 2005 is $30.
 
Note 9. Cash Equivalents
 
Pending investment in longer-term portfolio holdings, Apollo Investment makes temporary investments in U.S. Treasury bills (of varying maturities) and repurchase agreements as outlined in our prospectus. These temporary investments are deemed cash equivalents by us and are included in our Schedule of Investments. At the end of each fiscal quarter, the Company typically takes proactive steps to prospectively preserve investment flexibility in the next quarter which is assessed against the Company's total assets at its most recent quarter end. The Company can accomplish this in many ways including its current practice of purchasing U.S. Treasury bills and closing out its position on a net cash basis subsequent to quarter end. The Company may also utilize repurchase agreements or other balance sheet transactions as it deems appropriate for this purpose and these amounts are excluded from total assets for purposes of computing the asset base upon which the management fee is determined. U.S. Treasury bills with maturities of greater than 60 days from the time of purchase are marked-to-market as per our valuation policy. U.S. Treasury bills settle "regular way" on trade date plus one.
 
Note 10. Repurchase Agreements
 
The Company enters into repurchase agreements as part of its investment program. The Company's custodian takes possession of collateral pledged by the counterparty. The collateral is marked-to-market daily to ensure that the value, plus accrued interest, is at least equal to the repurchase price. In the event of default of the obligor to repurchase, the Company has the right to liquidate the collateral and apply the proceeds in satisfaction of the obligation. Under certain circumstances, in the event of default or bankruptcy by the counterparty to the agreement, realization and/or retention of the collateral or proceeds may be subject to legal proceedings. There were no repurchase agreements outstanding at December 31, 2005.

Note 12. Credit Agreement and Borrowings
 
At December 31, 2005 and under the terms of the Credit Agreement, the lenders agree to extend credit to Apollo Investment in an aggregate principal or face amount not exceeding $900 million at any one time outstanding. The Credit Agreement is a five-year revolving facility (with a stated maturity date of April 14, 2010) and is secured by substantially all of the assets in Apollo Investment's portfolio, including cash and cash equivalents. Pricing is set at 100 basis points over LIBOR. The Credit Agreement contains affirmative and restrictive covenants, including: (a) periodic financial reporting requirements, (b) maintaining minimum shareholders' equity of the greater of (i) 40% of the total assets of Apollo Investment and its subsidiaries as at the last day of any fiscal quarter and (ii) the sum of (A) $300 million plus (B) 25% of the net proceeds from the sale of equity interests in Apollo Investment after the closing date of the Credit Agreement, (c) maintaining a ratio of total assets (less total liabilities) to total indebtedness, in each case of Apollo Investment and its subsidiaries, of not less than 2.0:1.0, (d) maintaining minimum liquidity, (e) limitations on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, (f) limitations on liens, (g) limitations on investments (other than in the ordinary course of Apollo Investment's business), (h) limitations on mergers and disposition of assets (other than in the normal course of Apollo Investment's business activities) and (i) limitations on the creation or existence of agreements that prohibit liens on properties of Apollo Investment's subsidiaries. In addition to the asset coverage ratio described in clause (c) of the preceding sentence, borrowings under the Credit Agreement (and the incurrence of certain other permitted debt) are subject to compliance with a borrowing base that applies different advance rates to different types of assets in Apollo Investment's portfolio. The Credit Agreement currently provides for the ability of Apollo Investment to seek additional commitments from lenders in an aggregate amount of up to $300 million. The Credit Agreement is used to supplement Apollo Investment's equity capital to make additional portfolio investments and for other general corporate purposes.
 
At December 31, 2005, the Company had $413,237 (at value) drawn on its $900,000 senior credit facility. The weighted average annual interest cost for the nine months ended December 31, 2005 was 4.35%, exclusive of 0.20% for commitment fees and for other prepaid expenses related to establishing the credit facility.
 
Table of Contents
 
 
The average debt outstanding on the credit facility was $261,754 for the period that borrowings were outstanding from July 8, 2005 through December 31, 2005. The maximum amount borrowed during this period was $413,237. The remaining amount available under the facility was $486,763 at December 31, 2005.
 
At December 31, 2005, the Company was in compliance with all financial and operational covenants required by the Credit Agreement.

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
Apollo Investment Corporation
 
We have reviewed the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of Apollo Investment Corporation (the "Company") as of December 31, 2005, including the schedule of investments, the related statements of operations for each of the three-month and nine-month periods ended December 31, 2005, the three-month period ended December 31, 2004 and for the period April 8, 2004 through December 31, 2004 and the statements of cash flows and of changes in net assets for the nine-month period ended December 31, 2005 and for the period April 8, 2004 through December 31, 2004. These interim financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.
 
We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.
 
Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying interim financial statements for them to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
 
We previously audited in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the statement of assets and liabilities of the Company as of March 31, 2005, including the schedule of investments and the related statements of operations, of cash flows and of changes in net assets for the period from April 8, 2004 through March 31, 2005 and in our report dated June 14, 2005, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

With respect to the unaudited interim financial information as of December 31, 2005 and for the nine-month periods ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, included herein, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has reported that they applied limited procedures in accordance with professional standards for a review of such information. However, their separate report included herein states that they did not audit and they do not express an opinion on that interim financial information. Accordingly, the degree of reliance on their report on such information should be restricted in light of the limited nature of the review procedures applied. The accountants are not subject to the liability provisions of Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933 for their report on the unaudited interim financial information because that report is not a "report" or a "part" of the registration statement prepared or certified by the accountants within the meaning of Sections 7 and 11 of the Securities Act of 1933.

Apollo Investment
 
Apollo Investment is a closed-end management investment company that has elected to be treated as a business development company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, or the "1940 Act." Our investment objective is to generate both current income and capital appreciation through debt and equity investments. We intend to invest primarily in middle-market companies in the form of mezzanine and senior secured loans, as well as by making direct equity investments in such companies. From time to time, we may invest in public companies that are thinly traded.
 
Our portfolio is comprised primarily of investments in long-term subordinated loans, referred to as mezzanine loans, and senior secured loans of private middle-market companies, and from time to time include equity interests such as common stock, warrants or options. Our targeted investment typically ranges between $10 million and $100 million, although this investment size may vary proportionately as the size of our capital base changes. In this prospectus, we use the term "middle-market" to refer to companies with annual revenues between $50 million and $1 billion.
 
At March 31, 2005, our portfolio consisted of approximately 51% in subordinated loans and corporate notes, 3% in common stock or warrants, 42% in senior secured loans and 4% in cash equivalents. At March 31, 2005, the weighted average yield on our invested capital was 10.9%, the weighted average yield on our invested capital including cash equivalents and after expenses was 7.6%, the weighted average yield on our subordinated debt was 13.7% and on our senior secured debt was 8.2%. Our first lien and second lien senior secured debt investments yielded 6.4% and 9.8%, respectively. Yields are computed using interest rates as of the balance sheet date and include amortization of loan origination fees, original issue discount and market premium or discount, weighted by their respective costs when averaged.
 
While our primary focus is to generate both current income and capital appreciation through investments in loans, we may invest a portion of the portfolio in opportunistic investments in order to seek to enhance returns to stockholders. Such investments may include investments in high-yield bonds, distressed debt, foreign securities, private equity or securities of public companies that are not thinly traded. We expect that these public companies generally will have debt securities that are not investment grade.
 
About Apollo
 
Founded in 1990 by Leon Black, Michael Gross, John Hannan and three other co-founders, Apollo is a recognized leader in private equity investing, having invested more than $12 billion in over 150 companies since its founding. Apollo traditionally has focused on companies that it believes are undervalued yet have successful business models, strong cash flows and prospects for value creation. The Apollo investment professionals' disciplined, value-oriented strategy has sought to identify opportunities in all investment environments, selecting from a range of approaches, such as traditional or corporate partner buyouts, distressed debt buyouts or more liquid, non-control distressed debt investments. The Apollo investment professionals have sought through this strategy to provide investors with attractive returns while minimizing the risk of capital loss throughout economic cycles.
 
Table of Contents
Apollo's active private investment funds focus on making either control-oriented equity investments or distressed debt investments of $100 million or more, either for control or non-control positions. In contrast, Apollo Investment seeks to capitalize on the significant investment opportunities emerging in the mezzanine segment of the lending market for middle-market companies, which it believes offers the potential for attractive risk-adjusted returns. Apollo Investment is currently the only Apollo-related investment vehicle focused primarily on investing in mezzanine and senior secured loans of middle-market companies, and currently the only publicly traded investment vehicle managed by an affiliate of Apollo.
 
About Apollo Investment Management
 
Apollo Investment Management, our investment adviser, is led by two managing partners, Michael S. Gross (our Chairman and CEO) and Arthur H. Penn (our Chief Operating Officer), who have a combined 37 years of experience, and is supported by Apollo's team of approximately 37 investment professionals. In addition, Apollo Investment Management has hired nine additional investment professionals since its initial public offering in April 2004 and expects to add additional professionals in the future. Apollo Investment Management draws upon Apollo's 15-year history and benefits from the Apollo investment professionals' significant capital markets, trading and research expertise developed through investments in 23 different industries and over 150 companies in the United States and Western Europe.
 
Operating and Regulatory Structure
 
Our investment activities are managed by Apollo Investment Management and supervised by our board of directors, a majority of whom are independent of Apollo and its affiliates. Apollo Investment Management is an investment adviser that is registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, or the "Advisers Act." Under our investment advisory and management agreement, we pay Apollo Investment Management an annual base management fee based on our gross assets as well as an incentive fee based on our performance. See "ManagementInvestment Advisory and Management Agreement."
 
As a business development company, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. For example, we cannot invest in any portfolio company in which Apollo or any of its affiliates has a pre-existing investment (although we may co-invest on a concurrent basis with other affiliates of Apollo Investment, subject to compliance with existing regulatory guidance, applicable regulations and our allocation procedures). Also, while we are permitted to finance investments using debt, our ability to use debt is limited in certain significant respects. See "Regulation." We have elected to be treated for federal income tax purposes as a regulated investment company, or a RIC, under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or the "Code." For more information, see "Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations."
 
Determination of Net Asset Value
 
The net asset value per share of our outstanding shares of common stock is determined quarterly by dividing the value of our total assets minus our liabilities by the total number of our shares outstanding.
 
In calculating the value of our total assets, we value investments for which market quotations are readily available at such market quotations. Debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded or whose market price is not readily available are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors under a valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process. Because there is no readily available market value for a significant portion of the investments in our portfolio, we value these portfolio investments at fair value.
 
Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments, and the differences could be material. Determination of fair values involves subjective judgments and estimates not susceptible to substantiation by auditing procedures. Accordingly,
 
Table of Contents
under current auditing standards, the notes to our financial statements refer to the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of such valuations, and any change in such valuations, on our financial statements. For more information, see "Determination of Net Asset Value."
 
Use of Proceeds
 
We intend to use the net proceeds from the sale of our securities for general corporate purposes, which includes investing in portfolio companies in accordance with our investment objective and strategies and repaying indebtedness, if any, incurred under our senior credit facility. Pending such investments, we will invest in cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and other high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less from the date of investment and other general corporate purposes. The supplement to this prospectus relating to an offering will more fully identify the use of the proceeds from such offering. For more information, see "Use of Proceeds."
 
Dividends
 
We intend to continue to distribute quarterly dividends to our stockholders. Our quarterly dividends, if any, will be determined by our board of directors. For more information, see "Dividends."
 
Dividend Reinvestment Plan
 
We have adopted an opt-out' dividend reinvestment plan that provides for reinvestment of our dividend distributions on behalf of our stockholders, unless a stockholder elects to receive cash. As a result, if our board of directors authorizes, and we declare, a cash dividend, then our stockholders who have not opted out' of our dividend reinvestment plan will have their cash dividends automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock, rather than receiving the cash dividends. A registered stockholder must notify our transfer agent in writing if they wish to opt-out' of the dividend reinvestment plan. For more information, see "Dividend Reinvestment Plan."
 
Plan of Distribution
 
We may offer, from time to time, up to $900,000,000 of our common stock, preferred stock, debt securities or warrants representing rights to purchase shares of our common stock, preferred stock or debt securities, on terms to be determined at the time of the offering.
 
Securities may be offered at prices and on terms described in one or more supplements to this prospectus directly to one or more purchasers, through agents designated from time to time by us, or to or through underwriters or dealers. The supplement to this prospectus relating to the offering will identify any agents or underwriters involved in the sale of our securities, and will set forth any applicable purchase price, fee and commission or discount arrangement or the basis upon which such amount may be calculated. In compliance with the guidelines of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. ("NASD"), the maximum compensation to the underwriters or dealers in connection with the sale of our securities pursuant to this prospectus and the accompanying supplement to this prospectus may not exceed 8% of the aggregate offering price of the securities as set forth on the cover page of the supplement to this prospectus.
 
We may not sell securities pursuant to this prospectus without delivering a prospectus supplement describing the method and terms of the offering of such securities. For more information, see "Plan of Distribution."
 
Our Corporate Information
 
Our administrative and executive offices are located at 9 West 57

Table of Contents
 
The following table is intended to assist you in understanding the costs and expenses that an investor in shares of our common stock will bear directly or indirectly. We caution you that some of the percentages indicated in the table below are estimates and may vary. Except where the context suggests otherwise, whenever this prospectus contains a reference to fees or expenses paid by "you", "us" or "Apollo Investment", or that "we" will pay fees or expenses, stockholders will indirectly bear such fees or expenses as investors in Apollo Investment.

Example
 
The following example demonstrates the projected dollar amount of total cumulative expenses that would be incurred over various periods with respect to a hypothetical investment in our common stock. In calculating the following expense amounts, we have assumed we would have no leverage and that our annual operating expenses would remain at the levels set forth in the table above.
 
 
While the example assumes, as required by the SEC, a 5% annual return, our performance will vary and may result in a return greater or less than 5%. The incentive fee under the investment advisory and management agreement, which, assuming a 5% annual return, would either not be payable or have an insignificant impact on the expense amounts shown above, is not included in the example. This illustration assumes that we will not realize any capital gains computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation in any of the indicated time periods. If we achieve sufficient returns on our investments, including through the realization of capital gains, to trigger an incentive fee of a material amount, our expenses, and returns to our investors, would be higher. In addition, while the example assumes reinvestment of all dividends and distributions at net asset value, participants in our dividend reinvestment plan will receive a number of shares of our common stock, determined by dividing the total dollar amount of the dividend payable to a participant by the market price per share of our common stock at the close of trading on the valuation date for the dividend. See "Dividend Reinvestment Plan" for additional information regarding our dividend reinvestment plan.
 
This example and the expenses in the table above should not be considered a representation of our future expenses, and actual expenses (including the cost of debt, if any, and other expenses) may be greater or less than those shown.
 
Table of Contents
 
Before you invest in our shares, you should be aware of various risks, including those described below. You should carefully consider these risk factors, together with all of the other information included in this prospectus, before you decide whether to make an investment in our securities. The risks set out below are not the only risks we face. If any of the following events occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In such case, our net asset value and the trading price of our common stock could decline or the value of our preferred stock, debt securities or warrants may decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.
 
RISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS AND STRUCTURE
 
We are a new company with limited operating history.
 
We were incorporated in February 2004 and have conducted limited operations to date. We are subject to all of the business risks and uncertainties associated with any new business, including the risk that we may not achieve our investment objective and that the value of your investment could decline substantially. We anticipated that it would take us up to two years to invest the majority of the net proceeds of our initial public offering in April 2004 in mezzanine debt and senior secured loans. Immediately following our initial public offering, we invested a portion of the proceeds largely in temporary investments, such as cash equivalents, which earn yields substantially lower than the interest income that we anticipated receiving in respect of investments in mezzanine and senior secured loans. We have recently begun to make investments in mezzanine and senior secured loans. Dividends that we pay prior to being fully invested may be substantially lower than the dividends that we expect to pay when our portfolio is fully invested in mezzanine and senior secured loans.
 
Our investment adviser and its senior management have limited experience managing a business development company.
 
The 1940 Act imposes numerous constraints on the operations of business development companies. For example, business development companies are required to invest at least 70% of their total assets primarily in securities of private or thinly traded U.S. public companies, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and other high quality debt investments that mature in one year or less. Our investment adviser's and its senior management's limited experience in managing a portfolio of assets under such constraints may hinder their ability to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities and, as a result, achieve our investment objective. In addition, even though Apollo Investment Management is led by senior investment professionals of Apollo who apply the value-oriented philosophy and techniques used by the Apollo investment professionals in their private fund investing, our investment strategies differ from those of other private funds that are or have been managed by the Apollo investment professionals. Further, investors in Apollo Investment are not acquiring an interest in other Apollo funds. Further, while Apollo Investment may consider potential co-investment participation in portfolio investments with other Apollo funds, any such investment activity is subject to, among other things, independent board member approvals, the receipt of which cannot be assured, and compliance with existing regulatory guidance and applicable allocation procedures. Accordingly, we can offer no assurance that Apollo Investment will replicate Apollo's historical success, and we caution you that our investment returns could be substantially lower than the returns achieved by those private funds.
 
We are dependent upon Apollo Investment Management's key personnel for our future success and upon their access to Apollo's investment professionals and partners.
 
We depend on the diligence, skill and network of business contacts of the senior management of Apollo Investment Management. For a description of the senior management team, see "Management." We also depend, to a significant extent, on Apollo Investment Management's access to the investment professionals and partners of Apollo and the information and deal flow generated by the Apollo investment professionals in the course of their investment and portfolio management activities. The senior management of Apollo Investment Management evaluates, negotiates, structures, closes and monitors our investments. Our future success depends
 
Table of Contents
on the continued service of the senior management team of Apollo Investment Management. The departure of any of the senior managers of Apollo Investment Management, or of a significant number of the investment professionals or partners of Apollo, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our investment objective. In addition, we can offer no assurance that Apollo Investment Management will remain our investment adviser or that we will continue to have access to Apollo's partners and investment professionals or its information and deal flow.
 
Our financial condition and results of operation depend on our ability to manage future growth effectively.
 
Our ability to achieve our investment objective depends, in part, on our ability to grow, which depends, in turn, on Apollo Investment Management's ability to identify, invest in and monitor companies that meet our investment criteria.
 
Accomplishing this result on a cost-effective basis is largely a function of Apollo Investment Management's structuring of the investment process, its ability to provide competent, attentive and efficient services to us and our access to financing on acceptable terms. The senior management team of Apollo Investment Management has substantial responsibilities under the investment advisory and management agreement, as well as in connection with their roles as officers of other Apollo funds. They may also be called upon to provide managerial assistance to our portfolio companies as principals of our administrator. These demands on their time may distract them or slow the rate of investment. In order to grow, we and Apollo Investment Management need to hire, train, supervise and manage new employees. Any failure to manage our future growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
We operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities.
 
A number of entities compete with us to make the types of investments that we make in middle-market companies. We compete with public and private funds, commercial and investment banks, commercial financing companies, and, to the extent they provide an alternative form of financing, private equity funds. Additionally, because competition for investment opportunities generally has increased among alternative investment vehicles, such as hedge funds, those entities have begun to invest in areas they have not traditionally invested in, including investments in middle-market companies. As a result of these new entrants, competition for investment opportunities at middle-market companies has intensified and we expect that trend to continue. Many of our existing and potential competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. For example, some competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that are not available to us. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than us. Furthermore, many of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the 1940 Act imposes on us as a business development company. We cannot assure you that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Also, as a result of this existing and increasing competition, we may not be able to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities from time to time, and we can offer no assurance that we will be able to identify and make investments that are consistent with our investment objective.
 
We do not seek to compete primarily based on the interest rates we offer, and we believe that some of our competitors make loans with interest rates that are comparable to or lower than the rates we offer.
 
We may lose investment opportunities if we do not match our competitors' pricing, terms and structure. If we match our competitors' pricing, terms and structure, we may experience decreased net interest income and increased risk of credit loss.
 
We will be subject to corporate-level income tax if we are unable to qualify as a RIC.
 
To qualify as a RIC under the Code, we must meet certain source-of-income, asset diversification and annual distribution requirements. The annual distribution requirement for a RIC is satisfied if we distribute
 
Table of Contents
at least 90% of our ordinary income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any, to our stockholders on an annual basis. Because we expect to use debt financing in the future, we are subject to certain asset coverage ratio requirements under the 1940 Act and financial covenants under loan and credit agreements that could, under certain circumstances, restrict us from making distributions necessary to qualify as a RIC. If we are unable to obtain cash from other sources, we may fail to qualify as a RIC and, thus, may be subject to corporate-level income tax. To qualify as a RIC, we must also meet certain asset diversification requirements at the end of each calendar quarter. Failure to meet these tests may result in our having to dispose of certain investments quickly in order to prevent the loss of RIC status. Because most of our investments are in private companies, any such dispositions could be made at disadvantageous prices and may result in substantial losses. If we fail to qualify as a RIC for any reason and become subject to corporate income tax, the resulting corporate taxes could substantially reduce our net assets, the amount of income available for distribution and the amount of our distributions. Such a failure would have a material adverse effect on us and our stockholders.
 
We may have difficulty paying our required distributions if we recognize income before or without receiving cash representing such income.
 
For federal income tax purposes, we include in income certain amounts that we have not yet received in cash, such as original issue discount, which may arise if we receive warrants in connection with the making of a loan or possibly in other circumstances, or payment-in-kind interest, which represents contractual interest added to the loan balance and due at the end of the loan term. Such original issue discount, which could be significant relative to Apollo Investment's overall investment activities, or increases in loan balances as a result of payment-in-kind arrangements are included in income before we receive any corresponding cash payments. We also may be required to include in income certain other amounts that we do not receive in cash.
 
That part of the incentive fee payable by us that relates to our net investment income is computed and paid on income that may include interest that has been accrued but not yet received in cash. If a portfolio company defaults on a loan that is structured to provide accrued interest, it is possible that accrued interest previously used in the calculation of the incentive fee will become uncollectible.
 
Since in certain cases we may recognize income before or without receiving cash representing such income, we may have difficulty meeting the tax requirement to distribute at least 90% of our ordinary income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any, to maintain our status as a RIC. Accordingly, we may have to sell some of our investments at times we would not consider advantageous, raise additional debt or equity capital or reduce new investment originations to meet these distribution requirements. See "Material U.S. Federal Income Tax ConsiderationsTaxation as a RIC."
 
Regulations governing our operation as a business development company affect our ability to, and the way in which we, raise additional capital.
 
We may issue debt securities or preferred stock and/or borrow money from banks or other financial institutions, which we refer to collectively as "senior securities," up to the maximum amount permitted by the 1940 Act. Under the provisions of the 1940 Act, we are permitted, as a business development company, to issue senior securities only in amounts such that our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, equals at least 200% after each issuance of senior securities. If the value of our assets declines, we may be unable to satisfy this test. If that happens, we may be required to sell a portion of our investments and, depending on the nature of our leverage, repay a portion of our indebtedness at a time when such sales may be disadvantageous.
 
We are not generally able to issue and sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share. We may, however, sell our common stock at a price below the current net asset value of the common stock, or sell warrants, options or rights to acquire such common stock at a price below the current net asset value of the stock, if our board of directors determines that such sale is in the best interests of Apollo Investment and its stockholders, and our stockholders approve Apollo Investment's policy and practice of making such sales. In any
 
Table of Contents
such case, the price at which our securities are to be issued and sold may not be less than a price which, in the determination of our board of directors, closely approximates the market value of such securities (less any distributing commission or discount).
 
In addition to issuing securities to raise capital as described above, we may in the future seek to securitize our loans to generate cash for funding new investments. To securitize loans, we may create a wholly owned subsidiary and contribute a pool of loans to the subsidiary. This could include the sale of interests in the subsidiary on a non-recourse basis to purchasers who we would expect to be willing to accept a lower interest rate to invest in investment grade loan pools, and we would retain a portion of the equity in the securitized pool of loans. An inability to successfully securitize our loan portfolio could limit our ability to grow our business and fully execute our business strategy, and could decrease our earnings, if any. Moreover, the successful securitization of our loan portfolio might expose us to losses as the residual loans in which we do not sell interests may tend to be those that are riskier and more apt to generate losses.
 
If we issue debt securities, we will be exposed to additional risks, including the typical risks associated with leverage.
 
 
 
 
 
 
We intend to borrow money, which would magnify the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested and may increase the risk of investing in us.
 
Borrowings, also known as leverage, would magnify the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested and, therefore, increase the risks associated with investing in our securities. We intend to borrow from institutional banks and other lenders and entered into a credit agreement in April 2005 to facilitate such borrowing. In the event that we incur such borrowings, our lenders would have fixed dollar claims on our consolidated assets that are superior to the claims of our common shareholders. If the value of our consolidated assets increases, then leveraging would cause the net asset value to increase more sharply than it would have had we not leveraged. Conversely, if the value of our consolidated assets decreases, leveraging would cause net asset value to decline more sharply than it otherwise would have had we not leveraged. Similarly, any increase in our consolidated income in excess of consolidated interest payable on the borrowed funds would cause our net income to increase more than it would without the leverage, while any decrease in our consolidated income would cause net income to decline more sharply than it would have had we not borrowed. Such a decline could negatively affect our ability to make common stock dividend payments. Leverage is generally considered a speculative investment technique.
 
Changes in interest rates may affect our cost of capital and net investment income.
 
Because we intend to borrow money to make investments, our net investment income would depend upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest these funds. As a result, we can offer no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. In periods of rising interest rates, our cost of funds would increase, which could
 
Table of Contents
reduce our net investment income. Our long-term fixed-rate investments are financed primarily with equity and long-term debt. We may use interest rate risk management techniques in an effort to limit our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. Such techniques may include various interest rate hedging activities to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act. We have analyzed the potential impact of changes in interest rates on interest income net of interest expense. Assuming that the balance sheet were to remain constant and no actions were taken to alter the existing interest rate sensitivity, a hypothetical immediate 1% change in interest rates would have affected our net income by less than 1% over a one-year horizon. Although management believes that this measure is indicative of our sensitivity to interest rate changes, it does not adjust for potential changes in credit quality, size and composition of the assets on the balance sheet and other business developments that could affect net increase in net assets resulting from operations, or net income. Accordingly, no assurances can be given that actual results would not differ materially from the potential outcome simulated by this estimate.
 
You should also be aware that a rise in the general level of interest rates can be expected to lead to higher interest rates applicable to our debt investments. Accordingly, an increase in interest rates would make it easier for us to meet or exceed the incentive fee hurdle rate and may result in a substantial increase of the amount of incentive fees payable to our investment adviser with respect to pre-incentive fee net investment income.
 
We need to raise additional capital to grow because we must distribute most of our income.
 
We may need additional capital to fund growth in our investments. We have issued equity securities and plan to borrow from financial institutions. A reduction in the availability of new capital could limit our ability to grow. We must distribute at least 90% of our ordinary income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any, to our shareholders to maintain our regulated investment company status. As a result, such earnings are not available to fund investment originations. We expect to continue to borrow from financial institutions and issue additional debt and equity securities. If we fail to obtain funds from such sources or from other sources to fund our investments, it could limit our ability to grow, which may have an adverse effect on the value of our securities. In addition, as a business development company, we are generally required to maintain a ratio of at least 200% of total assets to total borrowings, which may restrict our ability to borrow in certain circumstances.
 
Many of our portfolio investments are recorded at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors and, as a result, there is uncertainty as to the value of our portfolio investments.
 
A large percentage of our portfolio investments are in the form of securities that are not publicly traded. The fair value of securities and other investments that are not publicly traded may not be readily determinable. We value these securities quarterly at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors. However, we may be required to value our securities at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors to the extent necessary to reflect significant events affecting the value of our securities. Our board of directors utilizes the services of two independent valuation firms to aid it in determining the fair value of these securities. The types of factors that may be considered in fair value pricing of our investments include the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company's ability to make payments and its earnings, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparison to publicly traded companies, discounted cash flow and other relevant factors. Because such valuations, and particularly valuations of private securities and private companies, are inherently uncertain, may fluctuate over short periods of time and may be based on estimates, our determinations of fair value may differ materially from the values that would have been used if a ready market for these securities existed. Our net asset value could be adversely affected if our determinations regarding the fair value of our investments were materially higher than the values that we ultimately realize upon the disposal of such securities.
 
The lack of liquidity in our investments may adversely affect our business.
 
We generally make investments in private companies. Substantially all of these securities are subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or are otherwise less liquid than publicly traded securities. The illiquidity of
 
Table of Contents
our investments may make it difficult for us to sell such investments if the need arises. In addition, if we are required to liquidate all or a portion of our portfolio quickly, we may realize significantly less than the value at which we have previously recorded our investments. In addition, we may face other restrictions on our ability to liquidate an investment in a portfolio company to the extent that we or an affiliated manager of Apollo has material non-public information regarding such portfolio company.
 
We may experience fluctuations in our quarterly results.
 
We could experience fluctuations in our quarterly operating results due to a number of factors, including the interest rate payable on the debt securities we acquire, the default rate on such securities, the level of our expenses, variations in and the timing of the recognition of realized and unrealized gains or losses, the degree to which we encounter competition in our markets and general economic conditions. As a result of these factors, results for any period should not be relied upon as being indicative of performance in future periods.
 
There are significant potential conflicts of interest which could impact our investment returns.
 
Our executive officers and directors, and the partners of our investment adviser, Apollo Investment Management, serve or may serve as officers, directors or principals of entities that operate in the same or a related line of business as we do or of investment funds managed by our affiliates. Accordingly, they may have obligations to investors in those entities, the fulfillment of which might not be in the best interests of us or our stockholders. For example, Mr. Gross, our president, chief executive officer, chairman of the board of directors and a managing partner of Apollo Investment Management, is a founding partner of Apollo with management responsibilities for other Apollo investment funds. In addition, Mr. Penn, our chief operating officer, is also a managing partner of Apollo Investment Management and a senior partner of Apollo DIF Management, an affiliated investment manager to Apollo Distressed Investment Fund, an affiliated private investment fund. Moreover, we note that, notwithstanding the difference in principal investment objectives between Apollo Investment and other Apollo funds, such other Apollo sponsored funds, including new affiliated potential pooled investment vehicles or managed accounts not yet established, have and may from time to time have overlapping investment objectives with those of Apollo Investment and accordingly invest in, whether principally or secondarily, asset classes similar to those targeted by Apollo Investment. As a result, the partners of Apollo Investment Management face conflicts in the allocation of investment opportunities to other Apollo funds. Although Apollo Investment Management endeavors to allocate investment opportunities in a fair and equitable manner, it is possible that we may not be given the opportunity to participate in certain investments made by investment funds managed by investment managers affiliated with Apollo Investment Management. When the partners of Apollo Investment Management identify an investment, they will be forced to choose which investment fund should make the investment.
 
We do not invest in any portfolio company in which Apollo or any affiliates has a pre-existing investment. We have in the past and expect in the future to co-invest on a concurrent basis with other affiliates of Apollo Investment, subject to compliance with existing regulatory guidance, applicable regulations and our allocation procedures.
 
In the course of our investing activities, we pay management and incentive fees to Apollo Investment Management, and reimburse Apollo Investment Management for certain expenses it incurs. As a result, investors in our common stock invest on a "gross" basis and receive distributions on a "net" basis after expenses, resulting in, among other things, a lower rate of return than one might achieve through direct investments. As a result of this arrangement, there may be times when the management team of Apollo Investment Management has interests that differ from those of our stockholders, giving rise to a conflict.
 
Apollo Investment Management receives a quarterly incentive fee based, in part, on our pre-incentive fee income, if any, for the immediately preceding calendar quarter. This incentive fee is subject to a quarterly hurdle rate before providing an incentive fee return to the investment adviser. To the extent we or Apollo Investment Management are able to exert influence over our portfolio companies, the quarterly pre-incentive fee may
 
Table of Contents
provide Apollo Investment Management with an incentive to induce our portfolio companies to accelerate or defer interest or other obligations owed to us from one calendar quarter to another.
 
We have entered into a royalty-free license agreement with Apollo, pursuant to which Apollo has agreed to grant us a non-exclusive license to use the name "Apollo." Under the license agreement, we have the right to use the "Apollo" name for so long as Apollo Investment Management or one of its affiliates remains our investment adviser. In addition, we rent office space from Apollo Administration, an affiliate of Apollo Investment Management, and pay Apollo Administration our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by Apollo Administration in performing its obligations under the administration agreement, including our allocable portion of the cost of our chief financial officer and chief compliance officer and their respective staffs, which can create conflicts of interest that our board of directors must monitor.
 
Changes in laws or regulations governing our operations may adversely affect our business.
 
We and our portfolio companies are subject to regulation by laws at the local, state and federal levels. These laws and regulations, as well as their interpretation, may be changed from time to time. Accordingly, any change in these laws or regulations could have a material adverse affect on our business.
 
RISKS RELATED TO OUR INVESTMENTS
 
We may not realize gains from our equity investments.
 
When we invest in mezzanine or senior secured loans, we have and may continue to acquire warrants or other equity securities as well. In addition, we may invest directly in the equity securities of portfolio companies. Our goal is ultimately to dispose of such equity interests and realize gains upon our disposition of such interests. However, the equity interests we receive may not appreciate in value and, in fact, may decline in value. Accordingly, we may not be able to realize gains from our equity interests, and any gains that we do realize on the disposition of any equity interests may not be sufficient to offset any other losses we experience.
 
Our portfolio is concentrated in a limited number of portfolio companies, which subject us to a risk of significant loss if any of these companies defaults on its obligations under any of its debt securities.
 
As of March 31, 2005, we had invested in 37 companies. A consequence of this limited number of investments is that the aggregate returns we realize may be significantly adversely affected if a small number of investments perform poorly or if we need to write down the value of any one investment. Beyond our income tax diversification requirements, we do not have fixed guidelines for diversification, and our investments could be concentrated in relatively few portfolio companies.
 
Our investments in prospective portfolio companies may be risky, and you could lose all or part of your investment.
 
Investment in middle-market companies involves a number of significant risks, including:
 
 
 
 
Table of Contents
 
Economic recessions or downturns could impair our portfolio companies and harm our operating results.
 
Many of our portfolio companies may be susceptible to economic slowdowns or recessions and may be unable to repay our loans during these periods. Therefore, our non-performing assets are likely to increase and the value of our portfolio is likely to decrease during these periods. Adverse economic conditions also may decrease the value of collateral securing some of our loans and the value of our equity investments. Economic slowdowns or recessions could lead to financial losses in our portfolio and a decrease in revenues, net income and assets. Unfavorable economic conditions also could increase our funding costs, limit our access to the capital markets or result in a decision by lenders not to extend credit to us. These events could prevent us from increasing investments and harm our operating results.
 
A portfolio company's failure to satisfy financial or operating covenants imposed by us or other lenders could lead to defaults and, potentially, termination of its loans and foreclosure on its secured assets, which could trigger cross-defaults under other agreements and jeopardize our portfolio company's ability to meet its obligations under the debt securities that we hold. We may incur expenses to the extent necessary to seek recovery upon default or to negotiate new terms with a defaulting portfolio company. In addition, if one of our portfolio companies were to go bankrupt, even though we or one of our affiliates may have structured our interest as senior debt, depending on the facts and circumstances, including the extent to which we actually provided managerial assistance to that portfolio company, a bankruptcy court might recharacterize our debt holding and subordinate all or a portion of our claim to that of other creditors.
 
An investment strategy focused primarily on privately-held companies presents certain challenges, including the lack of available information about these companies, a dependence on the talents and efforts of only a few key portfolio company personnel and a greater vulnerability to economic downturns.
 
We have invested and will continue to invest primarily in privately-held companies. Generally, little public information exists about these companies, and we are required to rely on the ability of the members of Apollo Investment Management's investment professionals to obtain adequate information to evaluate the potential returns from investing in these companies. If we are unable to uncover all material information about these companies, we may not make a fully informed investment decision, and we may lose money on our investments. Also, privately-held companies frequently have less diverse product lines and smaller market presence than larger competitors. These factors could affect our investment returns.
 
Our portfolio companies may incur debt that ranks equally with, or senior to, our investments in such companies.
 
We have invested and intend to invest primarily in mezzanine and senior debt securities issued by our portfolio companies. The portfolio companies usually have, or may be permitted to incur, other debt that ranks equally with, or senior to, the debt securities in which we invest. By their terms, such debt instruments may provide that the holders are entitled to receive payment of interest or principal on or before the dates on which we are entitled to receive payments in respect of the debt securities in which we invest. Also, in the event of insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or bankruptcy of a portfolio company, holders of debt instruments ranking senior to our investment in that portfolio company would typically be entitled to receive payment in full before we receive any distribution in respect of our investment. After repaying such senior creditors, such portfolio company may not have any remaining assets to use for repaying its obligation to us. In the case of debt ranking equally with debt securities in which we invest, we would have to share on an equal
 
Table of Contents
basis any distributions with other creditors holding such debt in the event of an insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or bankruptcy of the relevant portfolio company. In addition, we may not be in a position to control any portfolio company by investing in its debt securities. As a result, we are subject to the risk that a portfolio company in which we invest may make business decisions with which we disagree and the management of such company, as representatives of the holders of their common equity, may take risks or otherwise act in ways that do not serve our interests as debt investors.
 
Our incentive fee may induce Apollo Investment Management to make certain investments, including speculative investments.
 
The incentive fee payable by us to Apollo Investment Management may create an incentive for Apollo Investment Management to make investments on our behalf that are risky or more speculative than would be the case in the absence of such compensation arrangement. The way in which the incentive fee payable to our investment adviser is determined, which is calculated as a percentage of the return on invested capital, may encourage our investment adviser to use leverage to increase the return on our investments. Under certain circumstances, the use of leverage may increase the likelihood of default, which would disfavor the holders of our common stock, including investors in offerings of common stock, securities convertible into our common stock or warrants representing rights to purchase our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock pursuant to this prospectus. In addition, the investment adviser receives the incentive fee based, in part, upon net capital gains realized on our investments. Unlike the portion of the incentive fee based on income, there is no hurdle rate applicable to the portion of the incentive fee based on net capital gains. As a result, the investment adviser may have a tendency to invest more in investments that are likely to result in capital gains as compared to income producing securities. Such a practice could result in our investing in more speculative securities than would otherwise be the case, which could result in higher investment losses, particularly during economic downturns.
 
The incentive fee payable by us to Apollo Investment Management also may create an incentive for Apollo Investment Management to invest on our behalf in instruments that have a deferred interest feature. Under these investments, we would accrue the interest over the life of the investment but would not receive the cash income from the investment until the end of the term. Our net investment income used to calculate the income portion of our investment fee, however, includes accrued interest. Thus, a portion of this incentive fee would be based on income that we have not yet received in cash.
 
We may invest, to the extent permitted by law, in the securities and instruments of other investment companies, including private funds, and, to the extent we so invest, will bear our ratable share of any such investment company's expenses, including management and performance fees. We will also remain obligated to pay management and incentive fees to Apollo Investment Management with respect to the assets invested in the securities and instruments of other investment companies. With respect to each of these investments, each stockholder of Apollo Investment will bear his or her share of the management and incentive fee of Apollo Investment Management as well as indirectly bearing the management and performance fees and other expenses of any investment companies in which Apollo Investment invests.
 
Our investments in foreign securities may involve significant risks in addition to the risks inherent in U.S. investments.
 
Our investment strategy contemplates that a portion of our investments may be in securities of foreign companies. Investing in foreign companies may expose us to additional risks not typically associated with investing in U.S. companies. These risks include changes in exchange control regulations, political and social instability, expropriation, imposition of foreign taxes, less liquid markets and less available information than is generally the case in the United States, higher transaction costs, less government supervision of exchanges, brokers and issuers, less developed bankruptcy laws, difficulty in enforcing contractual obligations, lack of uniform accounting and auditing standards and greater price volatility.
 
Table of Contents
Although most of our investments are denominated in U.S. dollars, our investments that are denominated in a foreign currency are subject to the risk that the value of a particular currency may change in relation to one or more other currencies. Among the factors that may affect currency values are trade balances, the level of short-term interest rates, differences in relative values of similar assets in different currencies, long-term opportunities for investment and capital appreciation, and political developments. We may employ hedging techniques to minimize these risks, but we can offer no assurance that we will, in fact, hedge currency risk or, that if we do, such strategies will be effective.
 
If we engage in hedging transactions, we may expose ourselves to risks associated with such transactions. We may utilize instruments such as forward contracts, currency options and interest rate swaps, caps, collars and floors to seek to hedge against fluctuations in the relative values of our portfolio positions from changes in currency exchange rates and market interest rates. Hedging against a decline in the values of our portfolio positions does not eliminate the possibility of fluctuations in the values of such positions or prevent losses if the values of such positions decline. However, such hedging can establish other positions designed to gain from those same developments, thereby offsetting the decline in the value of such portfolio positions. Such hedging transaction may also limit the opportunity for gain if the values of the underlying portfolio positions should increase. Moreover, it may not be possible to hedge against an exchange rate or interest rate fluctuation that is so generally anticipated that we are not able to enter into a hedging transaction at an acceptable price.
 
While we may enter into transactions to seek to reduce currency exchange rate and interest rate risks, unanticipated changes in currency exchange rates or interest rates may result in poorer overall investment performance than if we had not engaged in any such hedging transactions. In addition, the degree of correlation between price movements of the instruments used in a hedging strategy and price movements in the portfolio positions being hedged may vary. Moreover, for a variety of reasons, we may not seek to establish a perfect correlation between such hedging instruments and the portfolio holdings being hedged. Any such imperfect correlation may prevent us from achieving the intended hedge and expose us to risk of loss. In addition, it may not be possible to hedge fully or perfectly against currency fluctuations affecting the value of securities denominated in non-U.S. currencies because the value of those securities is likely to fluctuate as a result of factors not related to currency fluctuations.
 
Provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law and of our charter and bylaws could deter takeover attempts and have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock.
 
The Maryland General Corporation Law, our charter and our bylaws contain provisions that may discourage, delay or make more difficult a change in control of Apollo Investment or the removal of our directors. We are subject to the Maryland Business Combination Act, subject to any applicable requirements of the 1940 Act. Our board of directors has adopted a resolution exempting from the Business Combination Act any business combination between us and any other person, subject to prior approval of such business combination by our board of directors, including approval by a majority of our disinterested directors. If the resolution exempting business combinations is repealed or our board of directors does not approve a business combination, the Business Combination Act may discourage third parties from trying to acquire control of us and increase the difficulty of consummating such an offer. Our bylaws exempt from the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act acquisitions of our common stock by any person. If we amend our bylaws to repeal the exemption from the Control Share Acquisition Act, the Control Share Acquisition Act also may make it more difficult for a third party to obtain control of us and increase the difficulty of consummating such an offer.
 
We have also adopted other measures that may make it difficult for a third party to obtain control of us, including provisions of our charter classifying our board of directors in three classes serving staggered three-year terms, and provisions of our charter authorizing our board of directors to classify or reclassify shares of our stock in one or more classes or series, to cause the issuance of additional shares of our stock, and to amend our charter, without stockholder approval, to increase or decrease the number of shares of stock that we have authority to issue. These provisions, as well as other provisions of our charter and bylaws, may delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders.
 
Table of Contents
RISKS RELATING TO THIS OFFERING
 
Investing in our securities may involve an above average degree of risk.
 
The investments we make in accordance with our investment objective may result in a higher amount of risk than alternative investment options and volatility or loss of principal. Our investments in portfolio companies may be highly speculative and aggressive, therefore, an investment in our securities may not be suitable for someone with a low risk tolerance.
 
There is a risk that investors in our equity securities may not receive dividends or that our dividends may not grow over time and that investors in our debt securities may not receive all of the interest income to which they are entitled.
 
We intend to make distributions on a quarterly basis to our stockholders out of assets legally available for distribution. We cannot assure you that we will achieve investment results that will allow us to make a specified level of cash distributions or year-to-year increases in cash distributions. In addition, due to the asset coverage test applicable to us as a business development company, we may be limited in our ability to make distributions.
 
The market price of our securities may fluctuate significantly.
 
The market price and liquidity of the market for our securities may be significantly affected by numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control and may not be directly related to our operating performance. These factors include:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
We may allocate the net proceeds from this offering in ways with which you may not agree.
 
We have significant flexibility in investing the net proceeds of this offering and may use the net proceeds from this offering in ways with which you may not agree or for purposes other than those contemplated at the time of the offering.
 
Sales of substantial amounts of our securities may have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities.
 
Sales of substantial amounts of our securities, or the availability of such securities for sale, could adversely affect the prevailing market prices for our securities. If this occurs and continues, it could impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of securities should we desire to do so.
 
Table of Contents
 
We intend to use the net proceeds from selling securities pursuant to this prospectus for general corporate purposes, which includes investing in portfolio companies in accordance with our investment objective and strategies and, pending such investments, investing in cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and other high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less from the date of investment and other general corporate purposes. The supplement to this prospectus relating to an offering will more fully identify the use of the proceeds from such offering.
 
We anticipate that substantially all of the net proceeds of an offering of securities pursuant to this prospectus will be used for the above purposes within two years, depending on the availability of appropriate investment opportunities consistent with our investment objective and market conditions. Our portfolio currently consists primarily of senior loans and mezzanine loans. Pending our investments in new debt investments, we plan to invest a portion of net proceeds in cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and other high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less from the date of investment and other general corporate purposes. The management fee payable by us will not be reduced while our assets are invested in such securities. See "RegulationTemporary investments" for additional information about temporary investments we may make while waiting to make longer-term investments in pursuit of our investment objective.
 
Table of Contents
 
We intend to continue to distribute quarterly dividends to our stockholders. Our quarterly dividends, if any, will be determined by our board of directors.
 
We have elected to be taxed as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. To maintain our RIC status, we must distribute at least 90% of our ordinary income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any, out of the assets legally available for distribution. In order to avoid certain excise taxes imposed on RICs, we currently intend to distribute during each calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98% of our ordinary income for the calendar year, (2) 98% of our capital gains in excess of capital losses for the one-year period ending on October 31st and (3) any ordinary income and net capital gains for preceding years that were not distributed during such years. In addition, although we currently intend to distribute realized net capital gains (, net long-term capital gains in excess of short-term capital losses), if any, at least annually, out of the assets legally available for such distributions, we may in the future decide to retain such capital gains for investment. In such event, the consequences of our retention of net capital gains are as described under "Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations."
i.e.
 
We maintain an "opt out" dividend reinvestment plan for our common stockholders. As a result, if we declare a dividend, then stockholders' cash dividends will be automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock, unless they specifically "opt out" of the dividend reinvestment plan so as to receive cash dividends. See "Dividend Reinvestment Plan."
 
We may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make dividends and distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these dividends and distributions from time to time. In addition, we may be limited in our ability to make dividends and distributions due to the asset coverage test for borrowings when applicable to us as a business development company under the 1940 Act and due to provisions in future credit facilities. If we do not distribute a certain percentage of our income annually, we will suffer adverse tax consequences, including possible loss of our RIC status. We cannot assure stockholders that they will receive any dividends and distributions or dividends and distributions at a particular level.
 
With respect to the dividends paid to shareholders, income from origination, structuring, closing, commitment and other upfront fees associated with investments in portfolio companies was treated as taxable income and accordingly, distributed to shareholders. For the period from April 8, 2004 (commencement of operations) through March 31, 2005, these fees totaled $4.5 million.
 
The following table lists the quarterly dividends per share since shares of our common stock began being regularly quoted on The Nasdaq National Market.

OVERVIEW
 
Apollo Investment was incorporated under the Maryland General Corporation Law in February 2004. We have elected to be treated as a business development company under the 1940 Act. As such, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. For instance, we generally have to invest at least 70% of our total assets in "qualifying assets," including securities of private or thinly traded public U.S. companies, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less. In addition, for federal income tax purposes we have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Pursuant to this election and assuming we qualify as a RIC, we generally do not have to pay corporate-level federal income taxes on any income we distribute to our stockholders. On April 8, 2004, we completed our initial public offering as an externally managed, non-diversified, closed-end investment company that elected to be treated as a business development company under the 1940 Act. We commenced operations on April 8, 2004 upon receipt of $870.2 million in net proceeds from our initial public offering of common stock.
 
Investments
 
Our level of investment activity can and does vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt and equity capital available to middle market companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity for such companies, the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make. Over the last twelve months, we believe that the availability of senior debt capital from banks for middle market companies has generally increased and has put downward pressure on interest rate spreads at the same time that base interest rates have risen. We do not expect this increased availability of capital to impair our ability to make longer-term investment allocations with our capital. We remain steadfast with our investment discipline in selectively investing in appropriate risk-reward opportunities within the middle market.
 
As a business development company, we must not acquire any assets other than "qualifying assets" specified in the 1940 Act unless, at the time the acquisition is made, at least 70% of our total assets are qualifying assets (with certain limited exceptions). If we invest in an issuer that, at the time we make the investment, has outstanding securities as to which a broker or dealer may extend or maintain margin credit or "marginable securities," these acquired assets cannot normally be treated as qualifying assets. This treatment results from the definition of "eligible portfolio company" under the 1940 Act, which in part looks to whether a company has outstanding securities that are eligible for margin credit. Amendments promulgated in 1998 by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to Regulation T under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, expanded the definition of marginable security to include any non-equity security. These amendments have raised questions as to whether a private company that has outstanding debt securities would qualify as an eligible portfolio company. We note that under applicable self-regulatory organization rules that govern the ability of brokers and dealers to extend margin credit, many non-equity securities issued by private companies may not be effectively marginable.
 
To address these questions, the SEC proposed amendments to the 1940 Act to expand the definition of eligible portfolio company in a manner that would promote the flow of capital to small, developing and financially troubled companies. These amendments would define eligible portfolio company with reference to whether a company has any class of securities listed on an exchange. We continue to monitor this issue closely and intend to adjust our investment focus as needed to comply with and/or take advantage of these amendments if they are adopted or of any other future administrative position, judicial decision or legislative action.
 
Our board of directors approved an amendment to our investment policy to eliminate the 5% limitation on investments in foreign securities. This change was implemented as of August 14, 2004 and any such investments are included as non-qualifying assets.

Revenue
 
We generate revenue primarily in the form of interest income from the debt securities we hold and capital gains, if any, on investment securities that we may acquire in portfolio companies. Our investments, whether in the form of mezzanine or senior secured loans, generally have a stated term of five to ten years and bear interest at a fixed rate or a floating rate usually determined on the basis of a benchmark LIBOR or prime rate. While subordinated debt and corporate notes typically accrue interest at fixed rates, some of these investments may include zero coupon, payment-in-kind ("PIK") and/or step bonds that accrue income on a constant yield to call or maturity basis. Interest on debt securities is generally payable quarterly or semiannually. In some cases, some of our investments provide for deferred interest payments or PIK. The principal amount of the debt securities and any accrued but unpaid interest generally becomes due at the maturity date. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of commitment, origination, structuring or diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and, if applicable, consulting fees, etc.
 
Expenses
 
All investment professionals of the investment adviser and their staff, when and to the extent engaged in providing investment advisory and management services to us, and the compensation and routine overhead expenses of that personnel which is allocable to those services are provided and paid for by Apollo Investment Management. We bear all other costs and expenses of our operations and transactions, including those relating to:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table of Contents
We expect our general and administrative operating expenses related to our ongoing operations to remain generally stable or decline slightly as a percentage of our assets in future periods. Incentive fees, interest expense and costs relating to future offerings of securities would be additive.
 
Portfolio and Investment Activity
 
The total portfolio at fair value at March 31, 2005, was as follows:
 
 
 
Table of Contents
 
Table of Contents
During the period from April 8, 2004 (commencement of operations) through March 31, 2005, we invested $894.3 million in a variety of mezzanine loans, subordinated debt and senior secured debt, some of which included debt or equity co-investment components. At March 31, 2005, our net portfolio consisted of 35 portfolio companies and was invested 51% in subordinated debt and corporate notes, 42% in senior secured loans, 3% in common stock or warrants and 4% in cash equivalents.
 
At March 31, 2005, the weighted average yield on our invested capital was 10.9% and the weighted average yield on our invested capital including cash equivalents and after expenses was 7.6%. The weighted average yield on our subordinated debt was 13.7% and on our senior secured debt was 8.2% at March 31, 2005. Our first lien and second lien senior secured debt investments yielded 6.4% and 9.8%, respectively. Yields are computed using interest rates as of the balance sheet date and include amortization of loan origination fees, original issue discount and market premium or discount, weighted by their respective costs when averaged.
 
Investment Ratings and Quality of Investments
 
In addition to various risk management and monitoring tools, Apollo Investment Management uses an investment rating system to characterize and monitor our expected level of returns on each investment in our portfolio. We use an investment rating scale of 1 to 5. The following is a description of the conditions associated with each investment rating:
 
 
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
Operating Income
 
For the period April 8, 2004 (commencement of operations) through March 31, 2005, gross investment income totaled $47.8 million, all of which represented interest income. Origination, closing and/or commitment fees associated with investments in portfolio companies are accreted into interest income over the respective terms of the applicable loans. Our gross income for the fiscal year also reflects income earned from a significant amount of short-term U.S. Government securities and other temporary investments held during the ramp-up period of our portfolio since our initial public offering. Accordingly, our gross income is generally lower than what would normally be earned had we been more fully invested for the entire fiscal year. As we continue investing the net proceeds from the initial offering, we expect to continue generating additional income at rates greater than the rates we receive on cash and cash equivalents. In addition, we may, from time to time, generate income from other sources other than interest income.
 
Operating Expenses
 
For the period from April 8, 2004 (commencement of operations) through March 31, 2005, operating expenses totaled $22.4 million. This amount consisted of investment advisory and management fees, insurance
 
Table of Contents
expenses, administrative services fees, professional fees, directors' fees and other general and administrative expenses. It also included a non-recurring charge of $252,300 in expenses related to the organization of Apollo Investment. For the period from April 8, 2004 (commencement of operations) through March 31, 2005, our investment advisory fees totaled $17.3 million, and represented the base fee as provided for in the investment advisory and management agreement. In addition, Apollo Investment Administration was reimbursed $987,500 for expenses incurred under the Administration Agreement. No incentive fees were paid or owed to Apollo Investment management, our investment adviser, for the period from April 8, 2004 (commencement of operations) through March 31,2004.
 
Net Operating Income
 
For the period from April 8, 2004 (commencement of operations) through March 31, 2005, our net operating income was $25.5 million.
 
Net Unrealized Appreciation on Investments and Cash Equivalents
 
At March 31, 2005, net unrealized appreciation totaled $18.2 million, of which $3.9 million was attributable to net unrealized appreciation on our bank debt/senior secured loans, $12.3 million was attributable to our subordinated debt/corporate notes, $1.0 million was attributable to our equity investments and $1.0 million was attributable to unrealized appreciation on a forward foreign currency contract used to hedge our foreign exchange rate risk on our investment in WDAC Intermediate Corp.
 
Net Realized Gains/Losses
 
For the period from April 8, 2004 (commencement of operations) through March 31, 2005, we had total principal repayments and exits of $71.7 million and total net realized losses of $658 on our investments. Furthermore, we realized $640,200 from the settlement of our forward foreign currency contract in March 2005 and we incurred net realized losses on the sale of our U.S. Treasury Bills totaling $144,400 during the period from April 8, 2004 (commencement of operations) through March 31, 2005.
 
Net Increase in Stockholders' Equity From Operations
 
Our operations generated a total net increase in stockholders' equity resulting from operations of $44.1 million for the period April 8, 2004 (commencement of operations) through March 31, 2005. Based on our weighted-average shares outstanding, our net change in stockholders' equity from operations was $0.71 per share for the period from April 8, 2004 (commencement of operations) through March 31, 2005.
 
Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources
 
Prior to this offering, we generated cash primarily from the net proceeds of our initial public offering and cash flows from operations, including interest earned on subordinated notes and senior secured loans as well as from our temporary investment of cash in U.S. government securities and other high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less. We plan to generate additional cash from borrowings under our senior secured multi-currency revolving credit facility. In April 2005, we entered into a senior credit facility having the term of five years and providing for borrowings of up to $800 million. The Credit Agreement will also provide for the ability of Apollo Investment to seek additional commitments from lenders thereunder in an aggregate amount of up to $400 million. Apollo Investment has not yet borrowed any amounts under the Credit Agreement. The interest rate generally applicable to borrowings under this senior credit facility will be LIBOR plus 100 basis points. This facility will be secured by a security interest in virtually all of our portfolio investments (including cash and hedge transaction value), subject to certain exceptions. The senior credit facility contains covenants and events of default customary for financings of this type. In the future, we may also securitize a portion of our investments in mezzanine or senior secured loans or other assets. Our primary use of funds are expected to be investments in portfolio companies, payment of fees and other operating expenses and cash distributions to holders of our common stock.
 
Table of Contents
From April 8, 2004, when we commenced operations, through March 31, 2005, our net cash provided by financing activities was $848.7 million, including primarily the net proceeds of our initial public offering of common stock, and our net cash used by operating activities was $29.5 million. At March 31, 2005, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $43.4 million (as adjusted for unsettled trades at year-end), which we intend to use in our operations. From time to time we expect to raise capital in the form of new debt or equity capital, including by way of offerings of securities pursuant to our shelf registration.
 
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
 
We consider our principal business risk to derive from credit risks attributable to our portfolio companies. We also incur market risk due to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency rates. Some loans in our portfolio have floating rates. However, we may face potential losses in future earnings, fair values or cash flows for any loans in our portfolio which have fixed rates. We may hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using standard hedging instruments such as futures, options and forward contracts subject to the requirements of the 1940 Act. While hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates, they may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to our portfolio of investments. During the period from April 8, 2004 (commencement of operations) through March 31, 2005, we did not engage in interest rate hedging activities. See "Risk FactorsChanges in interest rates may affect our cost of capital and net investment income."
 
We may also face potential losses in future earnings, fair values or cash flows for any investments in our portfolio which are in foreign currencies. For more information, see "Risk FactorsOur investments in foreign debt securities may involve significant risks in addition to the risks inherent in U.S. investments." On December 3, 2004, we entered into a forward foreign currency contract to hedge our exposure to the currency risk associated with our investment in WDAC Intermediate Corp.
 
Contractual Obligations
 
We have entered into two contracts under which we have future commitments: the investment advisory and management agreement, pursuant to which Apollo Investment Management has agreed to serve as our investment adviser, and the administration agreement, pursuant to which Apollo Administration has agreed to furnish us with the facilities and administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations and provide on our behalf managerial assistance to those portfolio companies to which we are required to provide such assistance. Payments under the investment advisory and management agreement are equal to (1) a percentage of the value of our gross assets and (2) a two-part incentive fee. Payments under the administration agreement are equal to an amount based upon our allocable portion of Apollo Administration's overhead in performing its obligations under the administration agreement, including rent, technology systems, insurance and our allocable portion of the costs of our chief compliance officer and chief financial officer and their respective staffs. Either party may terminate each of the investment advisory and management agreement and administration agreement without penalty upon not more than 60 days' written notice to the other.
 
At March 31, 2005, we did not have any off-balance sheet liabilities or other contractual obligations that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, other than the investment advisory and management agreement and the administration agreement.
 
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. In addition to the discussion below, our critical accounting policies are further described in the notes to the financial statements.
 
Table of Contents
Valuation of Portfolio Investments
 
As a business development company, we generally invest in illiquid securities including debt and equity securities of middle market companies. Under procedures established by our board of directors, we value investments, including certain subordinated debt, senior secured debt and other debt securities with maturities greater than 60 days, for which market quotations are readily available at such market quotations. We obtain these market values from an independent pricing service or at the mean between the bid and ask prices obtained from at least two brokers or dealers (if available, otherwise by a principal market maker or a primary market dealer). Debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded or whose market prices are not readily available are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of our board of directors. Such determination of fair values may involve subjective judgments and estimates. Investments purchased within 60 days of maturity are valued at cost plus accreted discount, or minus amortized premium, which approximates value. With respect to unquoted securities, our board of directors, together with our independent valuation adviser, values each investment considering, among other measures, discounted cash flow models, comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public and other factors.
 
When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, our board will use the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate and/or assist us in our valuation. Because we expect that there will not be a readily available market for many of the investments in our portfolio, we expect to value many of our portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of our board of directors using a documented valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value existed for such investments, and the differences could be material.
 
With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, our board of directors undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below:
 
 
 
 
 
 
For more information, see "BusinessInvestment selectionValuation process."
 
Revenue Recognition
 
We record interest income on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. For loans and debt securities with contractual PIK interest, which represents contractual interest accrued and added to the loan balance that generally becomes due at maturity, we will not accrue PIK interest if the portfolio company valuation indicates that the PIK interest is not collectible. We do not accrue as a receivable interest on loans and debt securities if we have reason to doubt our ability to collect such interest. Loan origination fees, original issue discount, and market discount are capitalized and then we amortize such amounts as interest income. Upon the prepayment of a loan or debt security, any unamortized loan origination fees are recorded as interest income. We record prepayment premiums on loans and debt securities as interest income when we receive such amounts.
 
Table of Contents
Net Realized Gains or Losses and Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation or Depreciation
 
We measure realized gains or losses by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment, without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized, but considering unamortized upfront fees and prepayment penalties. Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflects the change in portfolio investment values during the reporting period, including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation, when gains or losses are realized.
 
Within the context of these critical accounting policies, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported.

Our common stock is quoted on The Nasdaq National Market under the symbol "AINV". The following table lists the high and low closing bid price for our common stock, the closing bid price as a percentage of net asset value, or NAV and quarterly dividends per share since shares of our common stock began being regularly quoted on The Nasdaq National Market. On June 15, 2005, the last reported closing price of our common stock was $17.99 per share.
 
 
Our common stock continues to trade in excess of our net asset value. There can be no assurance, however, that our shares will continue to trade at a premium to our net asset value.
 
 
The following table sets forth the ratio of our earnings to fixed charges for the period ended March 31, 2005. For purposes of computing the ratio of earnings to fixed charges, earnings represent income from continuing operations before fixed charges and taxes. Fixed charges represent interest expense, amortization of capitalized interest and such portion of rental expense that represents an appropriate interest factor.

Apollo Investment
 
Apollo Investment is a closed-end management investment company that has elected to be treated as a business development company under the 1940 Act. Our investment objective is to generate both current income and capital appreciation through debt and equity investments. We intend to invest primarily in middle-market companies in the form of mezzanine and senior secured loans, as well as by making direct equity investments in such companies. From time to time, we may also invest in public companies that are thinly traded.
 
Our portfolio is comprised primarily of investments in long-term subordinated loans, referred to as mezzanine loans, and senior secured loans of private middle-market companies, and may include equity interests such as common stock, warrants or options. Our targeted investment typically ranges between $10 million and $100 million, although this investment size may vary proportionately as the size of our capital base changes.
 
While our primary focus is to generate current income through investments in loans, we may invest a portion of the portfolio in opportunistic investments in order to seek to enhance returns to stockholders. Such investments may include investments in high-yield bonds, distressed debt, foreign securities, private equity or securities of public companies that are not thinly traded. We expect that these public companies generally will have debt securities that are non-investment grade. We may also invest in cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and other high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less.
 
About Apollo
 
Founded in 1990 by Leon Black, Michael Gross, John Hannan and three other co-founders, Apollo is a recognized leader in private equity investing, having invested more than $12 billion in over 150 companies since its founding. Apollo traditionally has focused on companies that it believes are undervalued yet have successful business models, strong cash flows and prospects for value creation. The Apollo investment professionals' disciplined, value-oriented strategy has sought to identify opportunities in all investment environments, selecting from a range of approaches, such as traditional or corporate partner buyouts, distressed debt buyouts or more liquid, non-control distressed debt investments. The Apollo investment professionals have sought through this strategy to provide investors with attractive returns while minimizing the risk of capital loss throughout economic cycles.
 
Apollo's active private investment funds focus on making either control-oriented equity investments or distressed debt investments of $100 million or more, either for control or non-control positions. In contrast, Apollo Investment seeks to capitalize on the significant investment opportunities emerging in the mezzanine segment of the lending market for middle-market companies, which it believes offers the potential for attractive risk-adjusted returns. Apollo Investment is currently the only Apollo-related investment vehicle focused primarily on investing in mezzanine and senior secured loans of middle-market companies, and currently the only publicly traded investment vehicle managed by an affiliate of Apollo.
 
About Apollo Investment Management
 
Apollo Investment Management, our investment adviser, is led by two managing partners, Michael S. Gross (our Chairman and CEO) and Arthur H. Penn (our Chief Operating Officer), who have a combined 37 years of experience, and is supported by Apollo's team of approximately 37 investment professionals. In addition, Apollo Investment Management has hired nine additional investment professionals since its initial public offering in April 2004 and expects to hire additional investment professionals in the future. Apollo Investment Management draws upon Apollo's 15-year history and benefits from the Apollo investment professionals' significant capital markets, trading and research expertise developed through investments in 23 different industries and over 150 companies in the United States and Western Europe.

About Apollo Administration
 
In addition to furnishing us with office facilities, equipment and clerical, bookkeeping and record keeping services, Apollo Administration also oversees our financial records which we are required to maintain, as well as prepares reports to our stockholders and reports filed with the SEC. Apollo Administration oversees the determination and publication of our net asset value, oversees the preparation and filing of our tax returns, and generally monitors the payment of our expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to us by others. Furthermore, Apollo Administration provides on our behalf managerial assistance to those portfolio companies to which we are required to provide such assistance. Apollo Administration also benefits from its relationship with Apollo Investment.
 
Operating and Regulatory Structure
 
Our investment activities are managed by Apollo Investment Management and supervised by our board of directors, a majority of whom are independent of Apollo and its affiliates. Apollo Investment Management is an investment adviser that is registered under the Advisers Act. Under our investment advisory and management agreement, we pay Apollo Investment Management an annual base management fee based on our gross assets as well as an incentive fee based on our performance. See "ManagementInvestment Advisory and Management Agreement."
 
As a business development company, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. For example, we cannot invest in any portfolio company in which Apollo or any of its affiliates currently has an investment (although we may co-invest on a concurrent basis with other affiliates of Apollo Investment, subject to compliance with existing regulatory guidance, applicable regulations and our allocation procedures). Also, while we are permitted to finance investments using debt, our ability to use debt is limited in certain significant respects. See "Regulation." We have elected to be treated for federal income tax purposes as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. See "Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations."
 
Investments
 
Apollo Investment seeks to create a portfolio that includes mezzanine and senior secured loans by generally investing approximately $10 to $100 million of capital, on average, in the securities of middle-market companies. Our target portfolio over time will include both mezzanine and senior secured loans. Structurally, mezzanine loans usually rank subordinate in priority of payment to senior debt, such as senior bank debt, and are often unsecured. However, mezzanine loans rank senior to common and preferred equity in a borrowers' capital structure. Typically, mezzanine loans have elements of both debt and equity instruments, offering the fixed returns in the form of interest payments associated with senior debt, while providing lenders an opportunity to participate in the capital appreciation of a borrower, if any, through an equity interest. This equity interest typically takes the form of warrants. Due to its higher risk profile and often less restrictive covenants as compared to senior loans, mezzanine loans generally earn a higher return than senior secured loans. The warrants associated with mezzanine loans are typically detachable, which allows lenders to receive repayment of their principal on an agreed amortization schedule while retaining their equity interest in the borrower. Mezzanine loans also may include a "put" feature, which permits the holder to sell its equity interest back to the borrower at a price determined through an agreed formula. We believe that mezzanine loans offer an attractive investment opportunity based upon their historic returns and resilience during economic downturns, as compared to investments in equity or senior secured loans which can be subject to more volatility under similar circumstances.
 
At March 31, 2005, our portfolio was invested 51% in subordinated loans and corporate notes, 3% in common stock or warrants, 42% in senior secured loans and 4% in cash equivalents. We expect that our portfolio will be predominantly invested in mezzanine loans and senior secured loans. In addition to mezzanine and senior secured loans, we invest a portion of our portfolio in opportunistic investments, which are not our primary focus, but are intended to enhance our returns to stockholders. These investments may include, but are not limited to,
 
Table of Contents
high-yield bonds, private equity investments, distressed debt investments and securities of public companies that are not thinly traded. We expect that these public companies generally will have debt securities that are non-investment grade. Within this portion, we also may invest in debt securities of middle-market companies located outside of the United States.
 
Additionally, we may acquire investments in the secondary market and, in analyzing such investments, we will employ the same analytical process as we use for our primary investments.
 
Our principal focus is to provide mezzanine and senior secured loans to middle-market companies in a variety of industries. We generally seek to target companies that generate positive cash flows. We generally seek to invest in companies from the broad variety of industries in which Apollo's investment professionals have direct expertise. The following is a representative list of the industries in which Apollo has invested.
 
 
We may also invest in other industries if we are presented with attractive opportunities.
 
In an effort to increase our returns and the number of loans that we can make, we may in the future seek to securitize our loans. To securitize loans, we would create a wholly owned subsidiary and contribute a pool of loans to the subsidiary. We would sell interests in the subsidiary on a non-recourse basis to purchasers who we would expect to be willing to accept a lower interest rate to invest in investment-grade loan pools. We may use the proceeds of such sales to pay down bank debt or to fund additional investment.
 
We may invest, to the extent permitted by law, in the securities and instruments of other investment companies, including private funds.
 
We do not invest in any portfolio company in which Apollo or any affiliates has a pre-existing investment. We have in the past and expect in the future to co-invest on a concurrent basis with other affiliates of Apollo Investment, subject to compliance with existing regulatory guidance, applicable regulations and our allocation procedures.
 
Investment Selection
 
We intend to utilize the same, value oriented philosophy used by the investment professionals of Apollo in Apollo's private investment funds and will commit resources to managing downside exposure.
 
Prospective portfolio company characteristics
 
We have identified several criteria that we believe are important in identifying and investing in prospective portfolio companies. These criteria provide general guidelines for our investment decisions; however, we caution you that not all of these criteria will be met by each prospective portfolio company in which we choose to invest. Generally, we seek to utilize our access to information generated by Apollo's investment professionals to identify investment candidates and to structure investments quickly and effectively.
 
Table of Contents
Value orientation/positive cash flow
 
Our investment philosophy places a premium on fundamental analysis from an investor's perspective and has a distinct value orientation. We focus on companies in which we can invest at relatively low multiples of operating cash flow and that are profitable at the time of investment on an operating cash flow basis. Typically, we do not expect to invest in start-up companies or companies having speculative business plans.
 
Experienced management
 
We generally require that our portfolio companies have an experienced management team. We also require the portfolio companies to have in place proper incentives to induce management to succeed and to act in concert with our interests as investors, including having significant equity interests.
 
Strong competitive position in industry
 
We seek to invest in target companies that have developed leading market positions within their respective markets and are well positioned to capitalize on growth opportunities. We seek companies that demonstrate significant competitive advantages versus their competitors, which should help to protect their market position and profitability.
 
Exit strategy
 
We seek to invest in companies that we believe will provide a steady stream of cash flow to repay our loans. We expect that such internally generated cash flow, leading to the payment of interest on, and the repayment of the principal of, our investments in portfolio companies to be a key means by which we exit from our investments over time. In addition, we also seek to invest in companies whose business models and expected future cash flows offer attractive exit possibilities. These companies include candidates for strategic acquisition by other industry participants and companies that may repay our investments through an initial public offering of common stock or another capital market transaction.
 
Liquidation value of assets
 
The prospective liquidation value of the assets, if any, collateralizing loans in which we invest is an important factor in our credit analysis. We emphasize both tangible assets, such as accounts receivable, inventory, equipment and real estate, and intangible assets, such as intellectual property, customer lists, networks and databases.
 
Due diligence
 
Our investment adviser conducts diligence on prospective portfolio companies consistent with the approach adopted by the investment professionals of Apollo. We believe that Apollo's investment professionals have a reputation for conducting extensive due diligence investigations in their investment activities. In conducting their due diligence, Apollo's investment professionals use publicly available information as well as information from their extensive relationships with former and current management teams, consultants, competitors and investment bankers and the direct experience of the senior partners of Apollo.
 
Our due diligence will typically include:
 
 
 
 
 
Table of Contents
 
 
Upon the completion of due diligence and a decision to proceed with an investment in a company, the professionals leading the investment present the investment opportunity to our investment adviser's investment committee, which determines whether to pursue the potential investment. The members of the investment committee who have the most significant responsibility for the day-to-day management of our portfolio are Michael Gross and Arthur Penn. None of the other members of the investment committee has more significant responsibility than any other member with respect to Apollo Investment Company. Mr. Gross and Mr. Penn have served on Apollo Investment Management's investment committee since Apollo Investment began operations. Additional due diligence with respect to any investment may be conducted on our behalf by attorneys and independent registered public accountants prior to the closing of the investment, as well as other outside advisers, as appropriate.
 
Investment structure
 
Once we have determined that a prospective portfolio company is suitable for investment, we work with the management of that company and its other capital providers, including senior, junior and equity capital providers, to structure an investment.
 
We seek to structure our mezzanine investments primarily as unsecured, subordinated loans that provide for relatively high interest rates that provide us with significant current interest income. These loans typically have interest-only payments in the early years, with amortization of principal deferred to the later years of the mezzanine loans. In some cases, we may enter into loans that, by their terms, convert into equity or additional debt securities or defer payments of interest after our investment. Also, in some cases our mezzanine loans may be collateralized by a subordinated lien on some or all of the assets of the borrower. Typically, our mezzanine loans have maturities of five to ten years. We generally target a gross return of 12% to 20% for our mezzanine loan investments.
 
We also seek to invest in portfolio companies in the form of senior secured loans. We expect these senior secured loans to have terms of three to ten years and may provide for deferred interest payments over the term of the loan. We generally seek to obtain security interests in the assets of our portfolio companies that serve as collateral in support of the repayment of these loans. This collateral may take the form of first or second priority liens on the assets of a portfolio company. We expect that the interest rate on our senior secured loans generally will range between 2% and 10% over the London Interbank Offer Rate, or LIBOR.
 
In the case of our mezzanine and senior secured loan investments, we seek to tailor the terms of the investment to the facts and circumstances of the transaction and the prospective portfolio company, negotiating a structure that protects our rights and manages our risk while creating incentives for the portfolio company to achieve its business plan and improve its profitability. For example, in addition to seeking a senior position in the capital structure of our portfolio companies, we seek to limit the downside potential of our investments by:
 
 
 
 
Table of Contents
Our investments may include equity features, such as warrants or options to buy a minority interest in the portfolio company. Any warrants we receive with our debt securities generally require only a nominal cost to exercise, and thus, as a portfolio company appreciates in value, we may achieve additional investment return from this equity interest. We may structure the warrants to provide provisions protecting our rights as a minority-interest holder, as well as puts, or rights to sell such securities back to the company, upon the occurrence of specified events. In many cases, we may also seek to obtain registration rights in connection with these equity interests, which may include demand and "piggyback" registration rights. With respect to preferred equity and common equity investments, we target an investment return of at least 12% and 20%, respectively. However, we can offer no assurance that we can achieve such a return with respect to any investment or our portfolio as a whole.
 
We expect to hold most of our investments to maturity or repayment, but we may sell certain of our investments earlier if a liquidity event takes place, such as the sale or recapitalization or worsening of credit quality of a portfolio company.
 
Managerial assistance
 
As a business development company, we offer, and must provide upon request, managerial assistance to our portfolio companies. This assistance could involve, among other things, monitoring the operations of our portfolio companies, participating in board and management meetings, consulting with and advising officers of portfolio companies and providing other organizational and financial guidance. We may receive fees for these services. Apollo Administration provides such managerial assistance on our behalf to portfolio companies that request this assistance.
 
Ongoing relationships with portfolio companies
 
Monitoring
 
Apollo Investment Management monitors our portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. Apollo Investment Management monitors the financial trends of each portfolio company to determine if each is meeting its respective business plans and to assess the appropriate course of action for each company.
 
Apollo Investment Management has several methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance and fair value of our investments, which can include, but are not limited to, the following:
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table of Contents
In addition to various risk management and monitoring tools, Apollo Investment Management also uses an investment rating system to characterize and monitor our expected level of returns on each investment in our portfolio. We use an investment rating scale of 1 to 5. The following is a description of the conditions associated with each investment rating:
 
 
Apollo Investment Management monitors and, when appropriate, changes the investment ratings assigned to each investment in our portfolio. In connection with our valuation process, Apollo Investment Management reviews these investment ratings on a quarterly basis, and our board of directors affirms such ratings.
 
Valuation Process
 
The following is a description of the steps we take each quarter to determine the value of our portfolio. Investments for which market quotations are readily available are recorded in our financial statements at such market quotations. With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, our board of directors undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below:
 
 
 
 
 
 
When we make investments that involve deferrals of interest payable to us, any increase in the value of the investment due to the accrual or receipt of payment of interest is allocated to the increase in the cost basis of the investment, rather than to capital appreciation or gain.
 
Competition
 
Our primary competitors in providing financing to middle-market companies include public and private funds, commercial and investment banks, commercial financing companies, and, to the extent they provide an alternative form of financing, private equity funds. Additionally, because competition for investment opportunities generally has increased among alternative investment vehicles, such as hedge funds, those entities
 
Table of Contents
have begun to invest in areas they have not traditionally invested in, including investments in middle-market companies. As a result of these new entrants, competition for investment opportunities at middle-market companies has intensified. Many of our existing and potential competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. For example, some competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that are not available to us. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than us. Furthermore, many of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the 1940 Act imposes on us as a business development company. We expect to use the industry information of Apollo's investment professionals to which we have access to assess investment risks and determine appropriate pricing for our investments in portfolio companies. In addition, we believe that the relationships of the senior managers of Apollo Investment Management and of the senior partners of Apollo, enable us to learn about, and compete effectively for, financing opportunities with attractive middle-market companies in the industries in which we seek to invest. For additional information concerning the competitive risks we face, see "Risk FactorsRisks relating to our business and structureWe operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities."
 
Staffing
 
We have hired a chief financial officer and chief compliance officer and, to the extent necessary, will hire additional personnel. These individuals are employees of Apollo Administration and perform their respective functions under the terms of the administration agreement. Certain of our executive officers described under "Management" are also managing partners of our investment adviser. Our day-to-day investment operations will be managed by our investment adviser. In addition, Apollo Investment Management has hired nine additional investment professionals since the initial public offering and expects to add additional professionals in the future. See "ManagementInvestment Advisory and Management Agreement." In addition, we reimburse Apollo Administration for our allocable portion of expenses incurred by it in performing its obligations under the administration agreement, including rent and our allocable portion of the cost of our chief financial officer and chief compliance officer and their respective staffs. See "ManagementAdministration agreement."
 
Properties
 
We do not own any real estate or other physical properties materially important to our operation. Our administrative and principal executive offices are located at 9 West 57
th
Street, New York, NY 10019. We believe that our office facilities are suitable and adequate for our business as it is contemplated to be conducted.

In addition to managing our investments, investment professionals of Apollo Investment Management also manage or have managed the following other Apollo investment entities, none of which is currently soliciting new investors:

Management fee
 
Pursuant to the investment advisory and management agreement, we pay Apollo Investment Management a fee for investment advisory and management services consisting of two componentsa base management fee and an incentive fee. For the year ended March 31, 2005, we paid base management fees in the aggregate total amount of $17,315,026 to Apollo Investment Management for such investment advisory and management services. For the year ended March 31, 2005, we paid no incentive fees.
 
The base management fee is calculated at an annual rate of 2.00% of our gross assets. For services that were rendered under the investment advisory and management agreement during the period commencing on the closing of our initial public offering through and including our first six months of operations, the base management fee was payable monthly in arrears. Thereafter, the base management fee has been payable quarterly in arrears. For the first quarter of our operations, the base management fee was calculated based on the initial value of our gross assets. The base management fee is now calculated based on the average value of our gross assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters, and appropriately adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the current calendar quarter. Base management fees for any partial month or quarter are appropriately pro rated.
 
The incentive fee has two parts, as follows: one part is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on our pre-incentive fee net investment income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter. For this purpose, pre-incentive fee net investment income means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees (other than fees for providing managerial assistance), such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that we receive from portfolio companies) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus our operating expenses for the quarter (including the base management fee, any expenses payable under the Administration Agreement, and any interest expense and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee). Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not include any realized capital gains computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation. Pre-incentive fee net investment income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, is compared to the hurdle rate of 1.75% per quarter (7% annualized). Our net investment income used to calculate this part of the incentive fee is also included in the amount of our gross assets used to calculate the 2% base management fee. We pay Apollo Investment Management an incentive fee with respect to our pre-incentive fee net investment income in each calendar quarter as follows:
 
 
 
 
Table of Contents
The following is a graphical representation of the calculation of the income-related portion of the incentive fee:
 
 
 
 
 
These calculations are appropriately pro rated for any period of less than three months and adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the relevant quarter. You should be aware that a rise in the general level of interest rates can be expected to lead to higher interest rates applicable to our debt investments. Accordingly, an increase in interest rates would make it easier for us to meet or exceed the incentive fee hurdle rate and may result in a substantial increase of the amount of incentive fees payable to our investment adviser with respect to pre-incentive fee net investment income.
 
The second part of the incentive fee is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Investment Advisory and Management Agreement, as of the termination date), commenced on December 31, 2004, and will equal 20.0% of our realized capital gains for each calendar year computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation and incorporating unrealized depreciation on a gross investment-by-investment basis at the end of such year. Capital gains with respect to any investment will equal the difference between the proceeds from the sale of such investment and the accreted or amortized cost basis of such investment.
 
The incentive fee determined as of December 31, 2004 was calculated for a period of shorter than twelve calendar months to take into account any realized capital gains computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation for the period ending December 31, 2004 and was determined to be zero.

Examples of Quarterly Incentive Fee Calculation
 
Example 1: Income Related Portion of Incentive Fee (*):
 
Alternative 1
 
Assumptions
 
Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 1.25%
Hurdle rate(1) = 1.75%
Management fee(2) = 0.50%
Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.)(3) = 0.20%
Pre-incentive fee net investment income
(investment income  (management fee + other expenses)) = 0.55%
 
Pre-incentive net investment income does not exceed hurdle rate, therefore there is no incentive fee.
 
Alternative 2
 
Assumptions
 
Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 2.70%
Hurdle rate(1) = 1.75%
Management fee(2) = 0.50%
Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.)(3) = 0.20%
Pre-incentive fee net investment income
(investment income  (management fee + other expenses)) = 2.00%
 
Incentive fee = 100%  pre-incentive fee net investment income, subject to the "catch-up"(4)
  = 100%  (2.00%  1.75%)
  = 0.25%
 
Alternative 3
 
Assumptions
 
Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 3.00%
Hurdle rate(1) = 1.75%
Management fee(2) = 0.50%
Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.)(3) = 0.20%
Pre-incentive fee net investment income
(investment income  (management fee + other expenses)) = 2.30%
 
Incentive fee = 20%  pre-incentive fee net investment income, subject to "catch-up"(4)
Incentive fee = 100%  "catch-up" + (20%  (pre-incentive fee net investment income  2.1875%))
 
Catch-up = 2.1875%  1.75%
  = 0.4375%
Incentive fee = (100%  0.4375%) + (20%  (2.3%  2.1875%))
  = 0.4375% + (20%  0.1125%)
  = 0.4375% + 0.0225%

Duration and termination

Unless terminated earlier as described below, it will continue in effect for a period of two years from its effective date. It will remain in effect from year to year thereafter if approved annually by our board of directors or by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities, including, in either case, approval by a majority of our directors who are not interested persons. The investment advisory and management agreement will automatically terminate in the event of its assignment.

Board approval of the Investment Advisory and Management Agreement
 
Our board of directors determined at a meeting held on March 8, 2004, to approve the investment advisory and management agreement. In its consideration of the investment advisory and management agreement, the board of directors focused on information it had received relating to, among other things: (a) the nature, quality and extent of the advisory and other services to be provided to us by the investment adviser; (b) comparative data
 
Table of Contents
with respect to advisory fees or similar expenses paid by other business development companies with similar investment objectives; (c) our projected operating expenses and expense ratio compared to business development companies with similar investment objectives; (d) any existing and potential sources of indirect income to the investment adviser or Apollo Administration from their relationships with us and the profitability of those relationships; (e) information about the services to be performed and the personnel performing such services under the investment advisory and management agreement; (f) the organizational capability and financial condition of the investment adviser and its affiliates; (g) the investment adviser's practices regarding the selection and compensation of brokers that may execute our portfolio transactions and the brokers' provision of brokerage and research services to the investment adviser; and (h) the possibility of obtaining similar services from other third party service providers or through an internally managed structure.
 
Based on the information reviewed and the discussions, the board of directors, including a majority of the non-interested directors, concluded that the investment advisory and management fee rates were reasonable in relation to the services to be provided.
 
ADMINISTRATION AGREEMENT
 
Pursuant to a separate administration agreement, Apollo Administration furnishes us with office facilities, equipment and clerical, bookkeeping and record keeping services at such facilities. Under the administration agreement, Apollo Administration also performs, or oversee the performance of, our required administrative services, which include, among other things, being responsible for the financial records which we are required to maintain and preparing reports to our stockholders and reports filed with the SEC.

As of March 31, 2005, there were no persons that owned 25% or more of our outstanding voting securities, and no person would be deemed to control us, as such term is defined in the 1940 Act.
 
The following table sets forth, as of March 31, 2005, each stockholder who owned more than 5% of our outstanding shares of common stock, each director, the chief executive officer, our executive officers and our directors and executive officers as a group. Unless otherwise indicated, we believe that each beneficial owner set forth in the table has sole voting and investment power.
 
Our directors have been divided into two groupsinterested directors and independent directors. Interested directors are "interested persons" as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940.
 
The following table sets forth, as of March 31, 2005, certain ownership information with respect to our common stock for those persons who directly or indirectly own, control or hold with the power to vote, 5% or more of our outstanding common stock and all officers and directors, as a group.

The following is a listing of each portfolio company or its affiliate, together referred to as portfolio companies, in which we had an investment at March 31, 2005. Percentages shown for class of investment securities held by us represent percentage of the class owned and do not necessarily represent voting ownership. Percentages shown for equity securities, other than warrants or options, represent the actual percentage of the class of security held before dilution. Percentages shown for warrants and options held represent the percentage of class of security we may own assuming we exercise our warrants or options before dilution.
 
The portfolio companies are presented in three categories: "companies more than 25% owned" which represent portfolio companies where we directly or indirectly own more than 25% of the outstanding voting securities of such portfolio company and, therefore, are presumed to be controlled by us under the 1940 Act; "companies owned 5% to 25%" which represent portfolio companies where we directly or indirectly own 5% to 25% of the outstanding voting securities of such portfolio company or where we hold one or more seats on the portfolio company's board of directors and, therefore, are deemed to be an affiliated person under the 1940 Act; and "companies less than 5% owned" which represent portfolio companies where we directly or indirectly own less than 5% of the outstanding voting securities of such portfolio company and where we have no other affiliations with such portfolio company. We make available significant managerial assistance to our portfolio companies. We generally request and may receive rights to observe the meetings of our portfolio companies' board of directors.

The net asset value per share of our outstanding shares of common stock is determined quarterly by dividing the value of total assets minus liabilities by the total number of shares outstanding.
 
In calculating the value of our total assets, we value investments for which market quotations are readily available at such market quotations. Debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded or whose market price is not readily available are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors. As a general rule, we do not value our loans or debt securities above cost, but loans and debt securities are subject to fair value write-downs when the asset is considered impaired. With respect to private equity securities, each investment is valued using comparisons of financial ratios of the portfolio companies that issued such private equity securities to peer companies that are public. The value is then discounted to reflect the illiquid nature of the investment, as well as our minority, non-control position. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, we use the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate our private equity valuation. Because we believe that there is not a readily available market value for a significant portion of the investments in our portfolio, we value substantially all of our portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors under a valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments, and the differences could be material.
 
With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, our board of directors undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below:
 
 
 
 
 
 
The types of factors that we may take into account in fair value pricing our investments include, as relevant, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company's ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flow, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparison to publicly traded securities and other relevant factors.
 
Determination of fair values involves subjective judgments and estimates not susceptible to substantiation by auditing procedures. Accordingly, under current auditing standards, the notes to our financial statements refer to the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of such valuations, and any change in such valuations, on our financial statements.

We have adopted a dividend reinvestment plan that provides for reinvestment of our dividend distributions on behalf of our stockholders, unless a stockholder elects to receive cash as provided below. As a result, if our board of directors authorizes, and we declare, a cash dividend, then our stockholders who have not opted out' of our dividend reinvestment plan will have their cash dividends automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock, rather than receiving the cash dividends.
 
No action is required on the part of a registered stockholder to have their cash dividend reinvested in shares of our common stock. A registered stockholder may elect to receive an entire dividend in cash by notifying American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, the plan administrator and our transfer agent and registrar, in writing so that such notice is received by the plan administrator no later than the record date for dividends to stockholders. The plan administrator will set up an account for shares acquired through the plan for each stockholder who has not elected to receive dividends in cash and hold such shares in non-certificated form. Upon request by a stockholder participating in the plan, received in writing not less than 10 days prior to the record date, the plan administrator will, instead of crediting shares to the participant's account, issue a certificate registered in the participant's name for the number of whole shares of our common stock and a check for any fractional share.
 
Those stockholders whose shares are held by a broker or other financial intermediary may receive dividends in cash by notifying their broker or other financial intermediary of their election.
 
We intend to use primarily newly issued shares to implement the plan, whether our shares are trading at a premium or at a discount to net asset value. However, we reserve the right to purchase shares in the open market in connection with our implementation of the plan. The number of shares to be issued to a stockholder is determined by dividing the total dollar amount of the dividend payable to such stockholder by the market price per share of our common stock at the close of regular trading on The Nasdaq National Market on the valuation date for such dividend. Market price per share on that date will be the closing price for such shares on The Nasdaq National Market or, if no sale is reported for such day, at the average of their reported bid and asked prices. The number of shares of our common stock to be outstanding after giving effect to payment of the dividend cannot be established until the value per share at which additional shares will be issued has been determined and elections of our stockholders have been tabulated.
 
There will be no brokerage charges or other charges to stockholders who participate in the plan. The plan administrator's fees under the plan will be paid by us. If a participant elects by written notice to the plan administrator to have the plan administrator sell part or all of the shares held by the plan administrator in the participant's account and remit the proceeds to the participant, the plan administrator is authorized to deduct a $15 transaction fee plus a 10 per share brokerage commissions from the proceeds.
 
Stockholders who receive dividends in the form of stock are subject to the same federal, state and local tax consequences as are stockholders who elect to receive their dividends in cash. A stockholder's basis for determining gain or loss upon the sale of stock received in a dividend from us will be equal to the total dollar amount of the dividend payable to the stockholder. Any stock received in a dividend will have a new holding period for tax purposes commencing on the day following the day on which the shares are credited to the U.S. stockholder's account.
 
Participants may terminate their accounts under the plan by notifying the plan administrator via its website at www.amstock.com, by filling out the transaction request form located at bottom of their statement and sending it to the plan administrator at P.O. Box 922, Wall Street Station, NY, NY 10269-0560 or by calling the plan administrator's Interactive Voice Response System at 1-888-777-0324.
 
The plan may be terminated by us upon notice in writing mailed to each participant at least 30 days prior to any record date for the payment of any dividend by us. All correspondence, including requests for additional information, concerning the plan should be directed to the plan administrator by mail at American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, 59 Maiden Lane, New York, NY 10007 or by telephone at (718) 921-8200.

The following discussion is a general summary of the material U.S. federal income tax considerations applicable to us and to an investment in shares of our common stock. This summary does not purport to be a complete description of the income tax considerations applicable to such an investment. For example, we have not described tax consequences that we assume to be generally known by investors or certain considerations that may be relevant to certain types of holders subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws, including stockholders subject to the alternative minimum tax, tax-exempt organizations, insurance companies, dealers in securities, pension plans and trusts, and financial institutions. This summary assumes that investors hold our common stock as capital assets (within the meaning of the Code). The discussion is based upon the Code, Treasury regulations, and administrative and judicial interpretations, each as of the date of this prospectus and all of which are subject to change, possibly retroactively, which could affect the continuing validity of this discussion. We have not sought and will not seek any ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") regarding this offering. This summary does not discuss any aspects of U.S. estate or gift tax or foreign, state or local tax. It does not discuss the special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws that could result if we invested in tax-exempt securities or certain other investment assets.
 
This summary does not discuss the consequences of an investment in shares of our preferred stock, debt securities or warrants representing rights to purchase shares of our common stock, preferred stock or debt securities. The tax consequences of such an investment will be discussed in a relevant prospectus supplement.
 
A "U.S. stockholder" is a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes:
 
 
 
 
A "Non-U.S. stockholder" is a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock that is not a U.S. stockholder.
 
If a partnership (including an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) holds shares of our common stock, the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. A prospective stockholder that is a partner of a partnership holding shares of our common stock should consult its tax advisors with respect to the purchase, ownership and disposition of shares of our common stock.
 
Tax matters are very complicated and the tax consequences to an investor of an investment in our shares will depend on the facts of his, her or its particular situation. We encourage investors to consult their own tax advisors regarding the specific consequences of such an investment, including tax reporting requirements, the applicability of federal, state, local and foreign tax laws, eligibility for the benefits of any applicable tax treaty and the effect of any possible changes in the tax laws.
 
Election to be Taxed as a RIC
 
As a business development company, we have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As a RIC, we generally will not have to pay corporate-level federal income taxes on any ordinary income or capital gains that we distribute to our stockholders as dividends. To qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements (as described below). In addition, to obtain RIC tax treatment we must distribute to our stockholders, for each taxable year, at least 90% of our
 
Table of Contents
"investment company taxable income," which is generally our ordinary income plus the excess of realized net short-term capital gains over realized net long-term capital losses (the "Annual Distribution Requirement").
 
Taxation as a RIC
 
If we:
 
 
 
then we will not be subject to federal income tax on the portion of our investment company taxable income and net capital gain (, net long-term capital gains in excess of net short-term capital losses) we distribute to stockholders. We will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the regular corporate rates on any income or capital gain not distributed (or deemed distributed) to our stockholders.
i.e.
 
We will be subject to a 4% nondeductible federal excise tax on certain undistributed income of RICs unless we distribute in a timely manner an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98% of our ordinary income for each calendar year, (2) 98% of our capital gain net income for the one-year period ending October 31 in that calendar year and (3) any income realized, but not distributed, in preceding years (the "Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement"). We currently intend to make sufficient distributions each taxable year to satisfy the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement.
 
In order to qualify as a RIC for federal income tax purposes, we must, among other things:
 
 
 
 
 
 
We may be required to recognize taxable income in circumstances in which we do not receive cash. For example, if we hold debt obligations that are treated under applicable tax rules as having original issue discount (such as debt instruments with payment-in-kind interest or, in certain cases, increasing interest rates or issued with warrants), we must include in income each year a portion of the original issue discount that accrues over the life of the obligation, regardless of whether cash representing such income is received by us in the same taxable year. Because any original issue discount accrued will be included in our investment company taxable income for the year of accrual, we may be required to make a distribution to our stockholders in order to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, even though we will not have received any corresponding cash amount.
 
Gain or loss realized by us from warrants acquired by us as well as any loss attributable to the lapse of such warrants generally will be treated as capital gain or loss. Such gain or loss generally will be long-term or short-term, depending on how long we held a particular warrant.
 
Table of Contents
Although we do not presently expect to do so, we are authorized to borrow funds and to sell assets in order to satisfy distribution requirements. However, under the 1940 Act, we are not permitted to make distributions to our stockholders while our debt obligations and other senior securities are outstanding unless certain "asset coverage" tests are met. See "RegulationSenior securities." Moreover, our ability to dispose of assets to meet our distribution requirements may be limited by (1) the illiquid nature of our portfolio and/or (2) other requirements relating to our status as a RIC, including the Diversification Tests. If we dispose of assets in order to meet the Annual Distribution Requirement or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement, we may make such dispositions at times that, from an investment standpoint, are not advantageous.
 
If we fail to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement or otherwise fail to qualify as a RIC in any taxable year, we will be subject to tax in that year on all of our taxable income, regardless of whether we make any distributions to our stockholders. In that case, all of our income will be subject to corporate-level federal income tax, reducing the amount available to be distributed to our stockholders. In contrast, assuming we qualify as a RIC, our corporate-level federal income tax should be substantially reduced or eliminated. See "Election to be taxed as a RIC" above.
 
The remainder of this discussion assumes that we qualify as a RIC and have satisfied the Annual Distribution Requirement.
 
Taxation of U.S. Stockholders
 
Distributions by us generally are taxable to U.S. stockholders as ordinary income or capital gains. Distributions of our "investment company taxable income" (which is, generally, our ordinary income plus realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses) will be taxable as ordinary income to U.S. stockholders to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, whether paid in cash or reinvested in additional common stock. To the extent such distributions paid by us to non-corporate stockholders (including individuals) are attributable to dividends from U.S. corporations and certain qualified foreign corporations, such distributions generally will be eligible for a maximum tax rate of 15% for taxable years beginning before 2009. In this regard, it is anticipated that distributions paid by us will generally not be attributable to dividends and, therefore, generally will not qualify for the 15% maximum rate. Distributions of our net capital gains (which is generally our realized net long-term capital gains in excess of realized net short-term capital losses) properly designated by us as "capital gain dividends" will be taxable to a U.S. stockholder as long-term capital gains at a maximum rate of 15% in the case of individuals, trusts or estates, regardless of the U.S. stockholder's holding period for his, her or its common stock and regardless of whether paid in cash or reinvested in additional common stock. Distributions in excess of our earnings and profits first will reduce a U.S. stockholder's adjusted tax basis in such stockholder's common stock and, after the adjusted basis is reduced to zero, will constitute capital gains to such U.S. stockholder.
 
Although we currently intend to distribute any long-term capital gains at least annually, we may in the future decide to retain some or all of our long-term capital gains, but designate the retained amount as a "deemed distribution." In that case, among other consequences, we will pay tax on the retained amount, each U.S. stockholder will be required to include his, her or its share of the deemed distribution in income as if it had been actually distributed to the U.S. stockholder, and the U.S. stockholder will be entitled to claim a credit equal to his, her or its allocable share of the tax paid thereon by us. The amount of the deemed distribution net of such tax will be added to the U.S. stockholder's tax basis for his, her or its common stock. Since we expect to pay tax on any retained capital gains at our regular corporate tax rate, and since that rate is in excess of the maximum rate currently payable by individuals on long-term capital gains, the amount of tax that individual stockholders will be treated as having paid and for which they will receive a credit will exceed the tax they owe on the retained net capital gain. Such excess generally may be claimed as a credit against the U.S. stockholder's other federal income tax obligations or may be refunded to the extent it exceeds a stockholder's liability for federal income tax. A stockholder that is not subject to federal income tax or otherwise required to file a federal income tax return would be required to file a federal income tax return on the appropriate form in order to claim a refund for the taxes we paid. In order to utilize the deemed distribution approach, we must provide written notice to our
 
Table of Contents
stockholders prior to the expiration of 60 days after the close of the relevant taxable year. We cannot treat any of our investment company taxable income as a "deemed distribution."
 
For purposes of determining (1) whether the Annual Distribution Requirement is satisfied for any year and (2) the amount of capital gain dividends paid for that year, we may, under certain circumstances, elect to treat a dividend that is paid during the following taxable year as if it had been paid during the taxable year in question. If we make such an election, the U.S. stockholder will still be treated as receiving the dividend in the taxable year in which the distribution is made. However, any dividend declared by us in October, November or December of any calendar year, payable to stockholders of record on a specified date in such a month and actually paid during January of the following year, will be treated as if it had been received by our U.S. stockholders on December 31 of the year in which the dividend was declared.
 
If an investor purchases shares of our common stock shortly before the record date of a distribution, the price of the shares will include the value of the distribution and the investor will be subject to tax on the distribution even though it represents a return of his, her or its investment.
 
A stockholder generally will recognize taxable gain or loss if the stockholder sells or otherwise disposes of his, her or its shares of our common stock. Any gain arising from such sale or disposition generally will be treated as capital gain or loss if the stockholder has held his, her or its shares for more than one year. Otherwise, it would be classified as short-term capital gain or loss. However, any capital loss arising from the sale or disposition of shares of our common stock held for six months or less will be treated as long-term capital loss to the extent of the amount of capital gain dividends received, or undistributed capital gain deemed received, with respect to such shares. In addition, all or a portion of any loss recognized upon a disposition of shares of our common stock may be disallowed if other shares of our common stock are purchased (whether through reinvestment of distributions or otherwise) within 30 days before or after the disposition.
 
In general, individual and other non-corporate U.S. stockholders currently are subject to a maximum federal income tax rate of 15% on their net capital gain, i.e., the excess of realized net long-term capital gain over realized net short-term capital loss for a taxable year, including a long-term capital gain derived from an investment in our shares. Such rate is lower than the maximum rate on ordinary income currently payable by individuals. Corporate U.S. stockholders currently are subject to federal income tax on net capital gain at the maximum 35% rate also applied to ordinary income. Non-corporate stockholders with net capital losses for a year (i.e., capital losses in excess of capital gains) generally may deduct up to $3,000 of such losses against their ordinary income each year; any net capital losses of a non-corporate stockholder in excess of $3,000 generally may be carried forward and used in subsequent years as provided in the Code. Corporate stockholders generally may not deduct any net capital losses against ordinary income for a year, but may carryback such losses for three years or carry forward such losses for five years.
 
We will send to each of our U.S. stockholders, as promptly as possible after the end of each calendar year, a notice detailing, on a per share and per distribution basis, the amounts includible in such U.S. stockholder's taxable income for such year as ordinary income and as long-term capital gain. In addition, the federal tax status of each year's distributions generally will be reported to the Internal Revenue Service (including the amount of dividends, if any, eligible for the 15% maximum rate). Distributions may also be subject to additional state, local and foreign taxes depending on a U.S. stockholder's particular situation. Dividends distributed by us generally will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction or the 15% maximum rate applicable to qualifying dividends.
 
We may be required to withhold federal income tax ("backup withholding") currently at a rate of 28% from all taxable distributions to any non-corporate U.S. stockholder (1) who fails to furnish us with a correct taxpayer identification number or a certificate that such stockholder is exempt from backup withholding, or (2) with respect to whom the IRS notifies us that such stockholder has failed to properly report certain interest and dividend income to the IRS and to respond to notices to that effect. An individual's taxpayer identification
 
Table of Contents
number is his or her social security number. Any amount withheld under backup withholding is allowed as a credit against the U.S. stockholder's federal income tax liability and may entitle such stockholder to a refund, provided that proper information is timely provided to the IRS.
 
Taxation of Non-U.S. Stockholders
 
Whether an investment in the shares is appropriate for a Non-U.S. stockholder will depend upon that person's particular circumstances. An investment in the shares by a Non-U.S. stockholder may have adverse tax consequences. Non-U.S. stockholders should consult their tax advisers before investing in our common stock.
 
Distributions of our "investment company taxable income" to Non-U.S. stockholders, subject to the discussion below, will be subject to withholding of federal tax at a 30% rate (or lower rate provided by an applicable treaty) to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits unless the distributions are effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business of the Non-U.S. stockholder, and, if an income tax treaty applies, attributable to a permanent establishment in the United States, in which case the distributions will be subject to federal income tax at the rates applicable to U.S. stockholders, and we will not be required to withhold federal tax if the Non-U.S. stockholder complies with applicable certification and disclosure requirements. However, pursuant to recently enacted legislation, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2004 and before January 1, 2008, certain "interest-related dividends" and "short-term capital gain dividends" paid by us to Non-U.S. stockholders would be eligible for an exemption from the 30% federal withholding tax. Interest-related dividends generally are dividends derived from certain interest income earned by us that would not be subject to such tax if earned by Non-U.S. stockholders directly. Short-term capital gain dividends generally are dividends derived from the excess of our net short-term capital gains over net long-term capital losses. Special certification requirements apply to a Non-U.S. stockholder that is a foreign partnership or a foreign trust, and such entities are urged to consult their own tax advisors.
 
Actual or deemed distributions of our net capital gains to a Non-U.S. stockholder, and gains realized by a Non-U.S. stockholder upon the sale of our common stock, will not be subject to federal withholding tax and generally will not be subject to federal income tax unless the distributions or gains, as the case may be, are effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business of the Non-U.S. stockholder and, if an income tax treaty applies, are attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the Non-U.S. stockholder in the United States.
 
If we distribute our net capital gains in the form of deemed rather than actual distributions (which we may do in the future), a Non-U.S. stockholder will be entitled to a federal income tax credit or tax refund equal to the stockholder's allocable share of the tax we pay on the capital gains deemed to have been distributed. In order to obtain the refund, the Non-U.S. stockholder must obtain a U.S. taxpayer identification number and file a federal income tax return even if the Non-U.S. stockholder would not otherwise be required to obtain a U.S. taxpayer identification number or file a federal income tax return. For a corporate Non-U.S. stockholder, distributions (both actual and deemed), and gains realized upon the sale of our common stock that are effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business may, under certain circumstances, be subject to an additional "branch profits tax" at a 30% rate (or at a lower rate if provided for by an applicable tax treaty). Accordingly, investment in the shares may not be appropriate for certain Non-U.S. stockholders.
 
A Non-U.S. stockholder who is a non-resident alien individual, and who is otherwise subject to withholding of federal income tax, may be subject to information reporting and backup withholding of federal income tax on dividends unless the Non-U.S. stockholder provides us or the dividend paying agent with an IRS Form W-8BEN (or an acceptable substitute form) or otherwise meets documentary evidence requirements for establishing that it is a Non-U.S. stockholder or otherwise establishes an exemption from backup withholding.
 
Non-U.S. persons should consult their own tax advisors with respect to the U.S. federal income tax and withholding tax, and state, local and foreign tax consequences of an investment in the shares.

Failure to Qualify as a RIC
 
If we were unable to qualify for treatment as a RIC, we would be subject to tax on all of our taxable income at regular corporate rates. We would not be able to deduct distributions to stockholders, nor would they be required to be made. Distributions would generally be taxable to our stockholders as ordinary dividend income eligible for the 15% maximum rate for taxable years beginning before 2009 to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. Subject to certain limitations under the Code, corporate distributees would be eligible for the dividends received deduction. Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits would be treated first as a return of capital to the extent of the stockholder's tax basis, and any remaining distributions would be treated as a capital gain.

The following description is based on relevant portions of the Maryland General Corporation Law and on our charter and bylaws. This summary is not necessarily complete, and we refer you to the Maryland General Corporation Law and our charter and bylaws for a more detailed description of the provisions summarized below.
 
Capital Stock
 
At June 15, 2005, our authorized capital stock consists of 400,000,000 shares of stock, par value $0.001 per share, all of which is initially designated as common stock. Our common stock is quoted on The Nasdaq National Market under the ticker symbol "AINV". There are no outstanding options or warrants to purchase our stock, and no stock has been authorized for issuance under any equity compensation plans. Under Maryland law, our stockholders generally are not personally liable for our debts or obligations. On June 15, 2005, the last reported closing market price of our common stock was $17.99 per share. As of June 15, 2005, we had 17 shareholders of record.
 
Under our charter, our board of directors is authorized to classify and reclassify any unissued shares of stock into other classes or series of stock and authorize the issuance of shares of stock without obtaining stockholder approval. As permitted by the Maryland General Corporation Law, our charter provides that the board of directors, without any action by our stockholders, may amend the charter from time to time to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that we have authority to issue.
 
The following table sets forth information of our capital stock as of June 15, 2005:
 
 
Common stock
 
All shares of our common stock have equal rights as to earnings, assets, dividends and voting and, when they are issued, will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. Distributions may be paid to the holders of our common stock if, as and when authorized by our board of directors and declared by us out of funds legally available therefor. Shares of our common stock have no preemptive, exchange, conversion or redemption rights and are freely transferable, except where their transfer is restricted by federal and state securities laws or by contract. In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of Apollo Investment, each share of our common stock would be entitled to share ratably in all of our assets that are legally available for distribution after we pay all debts and other liabilities and subject to any preferential rights of holders of our preferred stock, if any preferred stock is outstanding at such time. Each share of our common stock is entitled to one vote on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders, including the election of directors. Except as provided with respect to any other class or series of stock, the holders of our common stock will possess exclusive voting power. There is no cumulative voting in the election of directors, which means that holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock can elect all of our directors, and holders of less than a majority of such shares will be unable to elect any director.
 
Preferred stock
 
Our charter authorizes our board of directors to classify and reclassify any unissued shares of stock into other classes or series of stock, including preferred stock. Prior to issuance of shares of each class or series, the board of directors is required by Maryland law and by our charter to set the terms, preferences, conversion or
 
Table of Contents
other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends or other distributions, qualifications and terms or conditions of redemption for each class or series. Thus, the board of directors could authorize the issuance of shares of preferred stock with terms and conditions which could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for holders of our common stock or otherwise be in their best interest. You should note, however, that any issuance of preferred stock must comply with the requirements of the 1940 Act. The 1940 Act requires, among other things, that (1) immediately after issuance and before any dividend or other distribution is made with respect to our common stock and before any purchase of common stock is made, such preferred stock together with all other senior securities must not exceed an amount equal to 50% of our total assets after such issuance and after deducting the amount of such dividend, distribution or purchase price, as the case may be, and (2) the holders of shares of preferred stock, if any are issued, must be entitled as a class to elect two directors at all times and to elect a majority of the directors if dividends on such preferred stock are in arrears by two years or more. Certain matters under the 1940 Act require the separate vote of the holders of any issued and outstanding preferred stock. For example, holders of preferred stock would vote separately from the holders of common stock on a proposal to cease operations as a business development company. We believe that the availability for issuance of preferred stock will provide us with increased flexibility in structuring future financings and acquisitions.
 
Limitation on Liability of Directors and Officers; Indemnification and Advance of Expenses
 
Maryland law permits a Maryland corporation to include in its charter a provision limiting the liability of its directors and officers to the corporation and its stockholders for money damages except for liability resulting from (a) actual receipt of an improper benefit or profit in money, property or services or (b) active and deliberate dishonesty established by a final judgment as being material to the cause of action. Our charter contains such a provision which eliminates directors' and officers' liability to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law, subject to the requirements of the 1940 Act.
 
Our charter authorizes us and our bylaws obligate us, to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law and subject to the requirements of the 1940 Act, to indemnify any present or former director or officer or any individual who, while a director or officer and at our request, serves or has served another corporation, real estate investment trust, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise as a director, officer, partner or trustee, from and against any claim or liability to which that person may become subject or which that person may incur by reason of his or her status as a present or former director or officer and to pay or reimburse their reasonable expenses in advance of final disposition of a proceeding. The charter and bylaws also permit us to indemnify and advance expenses to any person who served a predecessor of us in any of the capacities described above and any of our employees or agents or any employees or agents of our predecessor. In accordance with the 1940 Act, we will not indemnify any person for any liability to which such person would be subject by reason of such person's willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of his or her office.
 
Maryland law requires a corporation (unless its charter provides otherwise, which our charter does not) to indemnify a director or officer who has been successful, on the merits or otherwise, in the defense of any proceeding to which he or she is made, or threatened to be made, a party by reason of his or her service in that capacity. Maryland law permits a corporation to indemnify its present and former directors and officers, among others, against judgments, penalties, fines, settlements and reasonable expenses actually incurred by them in connection with any proceeding to which they may be made, or threatened to be made, a party by reason of their service in those or other capacities unless it is established that (a) the act or omission of the director or officer was material to the matter giving rise to the proceeding and (1) was committed in bad faith or (2) was the result of active and deliberate dishonesty, (b) the director or officer actually received an improper personal benefit in money, property or services or (c) in the case of any criminal proceeding, the director or officer had reasonable cause to believe that the act or omission was unlawful. However, under Maryland law, a Maryland corporation may not indemnify for an adverse judgment in a suit by or in the right of the corporation or for a judgment of liability on the basis that a personal benefit was improperly received, unless in either case a court orders indemnification, and then only for expenses. In addition, Maryland law permits a corporation to advance
 
Table of Contents
reasonable expenses to a director or officer upon the corporation's receipt of (a) a written affirmation by the director or officer of his or her good faith belief that he or she has met the standard of conduct necessary for indemnification by the corporation and (b) a written undertaking by him or her or on his or her behalf to repay the amount paid or reimbursed by the corporation if it is ultimately determined that the standard of conduct was not met.
 
Provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law and Our Charter and Bylaws
 
The Maryland General Corporation Law and our charter and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a potential acquiror to acquire us by means of a tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise. These provisions are expected to discourage certain coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids and to encourage persons seeking to acquire control of us to negotiate first with our board of directors. We believe that the benefits of these provisions outweigh the potential disadvantages of discouraging any such acquisition proposals because, among other things, the negotiation of such proposals may improve their terms.
 
Classified board of directors
 
Our board of directors is divided into three classes of directors serving staggered three-year terms. The initial terms of the first, second and third classes will expire in 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively. Beginning in 2005, upon expiration of their current terms, directors of each class will be elected to serve for three-year terms and until their successors are duly elected and qualify and each year one class of directors will be elected by the stockholders. A classified board of directors may render a change in control of us or removal of our incumbent management more difficult. We believe, however, that the longer time required to elect a majority of a classified board of directors will help to ensure the continuity and stability of our management and policies.
 
Election of directors
 
Our charter and bylaws provide that the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote in the election of directors will be required to elect a director. Pursuant to the charter, our board of directors may amend the bylaws to alter the vote required to elect directors.
 
Number of directors; vacancies; removal
 
Our charter provides that the number of directors will be set only by the board of directors in accordance with our bylaws. Our bylaws provide that a majority of our entire board of directors may at any time increase or decrease the number of directors. However, unless our bylaws are amended, the number of directors may never be less than four nor more than eight. Our charter provides that, at such time as we have three independent directors and our common stock is registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"), we elect to be subject to the provision of Subtitle 8 of Title 3 of the Maryland General Corporation Law regarding the filling of vacancies on the board of directors. Accordingly, at such time, except as may be provided by the board of directors in setting the terms of any class or series of preferred stock, any and all vacancies on the board of directors may be filled only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors in office, even if the remaining directors do not constitute a quorum, and any director elected to fill a vacancy will serve for the remainder of the full term of the directorship in which the vacancy occurred and until a successor is elected and qualifies, subject to any applicable requirements of the 1940 Act.
 
Our charter provides that a director may be removed only for cause, as defined in our charter, and then only by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast in the election of directors.
 
Action by stockholders
 
Under the Maryland General Corporation Law, stockholder action can be taken only at an annual or special meeting of stockholders or by unanimous written consent in lieu of a meeting, unless the charter provides for stockholder action by less than unanimous written consent (which our charter does not). These provisions, combined with the requirements of our bylaws regarding the calling of a stockholder-requested special meeting
 
Table of Contents
of stockholders discussed below, may have the effect of delaying consideration of a stockholder proposal until the next annual meeting.
 
Advance notice provisions for stockholder nominations and stockholder proposals
 
Our bylaws provide that with respect to an annual meeting of stockholders, nominations of persons for election to the board of directors and the proposal of business to be considered by stockholders may be made only (1) pursuant to our notice of the meeting, (2) by the board of directors or (3) by a stockholder who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who has complied with the advance notice procedures of the bylaws. With respect to special meetings of stockholders, only the business specified in our notice of the meeting may be brought before the meeting. Nominations of persons for election to the board of directors at a special meeting may be made only (1) pursuant to our notice of the meeting, (2) by the board of directors or (3) provided that the board of directors has determined that directors will be elected at the meeting, by a stockholder who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who has complied with the advance notice provisions of the bylaws.
 
The purpose of requiring stockholders to give us advance notice of nominations and other business is to afford our board of directors a meaningful opportunity to consider the qualifications of the proposed nominees and the advisability of any other proposed business and, to the extent deemed necessary or desirable by our board of directors, to inform stockholders and make recommendations about such qualifications or business, as well as to provide a more orderly procedure for conducting meetings of stockholders. Although our bylaws do not give our board of directors any power to disapprove stockholder nominations for the election of directors or proposals recommending certain action, they may have the effect of precluding a contest for the election of directors or the consideration of stockholder proposals if proper procedures are not followed and of discouraging or deterring a third party from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect its own slate of directors or to approve its own proposal without regard to whether consideration of such nominees or proposals might be harmful or beneficial to us and our stockholders.
 
Calling of special meetings of stockholders
 
Our bylaws provide that special meetings of stockholders may be called by our board of directors and certain of our officers. Additionally, our bylaws provide that, subject to the satisfaction of certain procedural and informational requirements by the stockholders requesting the meeting, a special meeting of stockholders will be called by the secretary of the corporation upon the written request of stockholders entitled to cast not less than a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at such meeting.
 
Approval of extraordinary corporate action; amendment of charter and bylaws
 
Under Maryland law, a Maryland corporation generally cannot dissolve, amend its charter, merge, sell all or substantially all of its assets, engage in a share exchange or engage in similar transactions outside the ordinary course of business, unless approved by the affirmative vote of stockholders entitled to cast at least two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. However, a Maryland corporation may provide in its charter for approval of these matters by a lesser percentage, but not less than a majority of all of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. Our charter generally provides for approval of charter amendments and extraordinary transactions by the stockholders entitled to cast at least a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. Our charter also provides that certain charter amendments and any proposal for our conversion, whether by merger or otherwise, from a closed-end company to an open-end company or any proposal for our liquidation or dissolution requires the approval of the stockholders entitled to cast at least 80 percent of the votes entitled to be cast on such matter. However, if such amendment or proposal is approved by at least two-thirds of our continuing directors (in addition to approval by our board of directors), such amendment or proposal may be approved by a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on such a matter. The "continuing directors" are defined in our charter as our current directors as well as those directors whose nomination for election by the stockholders or whose election by the directors to fill vacancies is approved by a majority of the continuing directors then on the board of directors.
 
Table of Contents
Our charter and bylaws provide that the board of directors will have the exclusive power to adopt, alter or repeal any provision of our bylaws and to make new bylaws.
 
No appraisal rights
 
Except with respect to appraisal rights arising in connection with the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act discussed below, as permitted by the Maryland General Corporation Law, our charter provides that stockholders will not be entitled to exercise appraisal rights.
 
Control share acquisitions
 
The Control Share Acquisition Act provides that control shares of a Maryland corporation acquired in a control share acquisition have no voting rights except to the extent approved by a vote of two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. Shares owned by the acquiror, by officers or by directors who are employees of the corporation are excluded from shares entitled to vote on the matter. Control shares are voting shares of stock which, if aggregated with all other shares of stock owned by the acquiror or in respect of which the acquiror is able to exercise or direct the exercise of voting power (except solely by virtue of a revocable proxy), would entitle the acquiror to exercise voting power in electing directors within one of the following ranges of voting power:
 
 
 
 
The requisite stockholder approval must be obtained each time an acquiror crosses one of the thresholds of voting power set forth above. Control shares do not include shares the acquiring person is then entitled to vote as a result of having previously obtained stockholder approval. A control share acquisition means the acquisition of control shares, subject to certain exceptions.
 
A person who has made or proposes to make a control share acquisition may compel the board of directors of the corporation to call a special meeting of stockholders to be held within 50 days of demand to consider the voting rights of the shares. The right to compel the calling of a special meeting is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including an undertaking to pay the expenses of the meeting. If no request for a meeting is made, the corporation may itself present the question at any stockholders meeting.
 
If voting rights are not approved at the meeting or if the acquiring person does not deliver an acquiring person statement as required by the statute, then the corporation may repurchase for fair value any or all of the control shares, except those for which voting rights have previously been approved. The right of the corporation to repurchase control shares is subject to certain conditions and limitations, including, as provided in our bylaws, compliance with the 1940 Act. Fair value is determined, without regard to the absence of voting rights for the control shares, as of the date of the last control share acquisition by the acquiror or of any meeting of stockholders at which the voting rights of the shares are considered and not approved. If voting rights for control shares are approved at a stockholders meeting and the acquiror becomes entitled to vote a majority of the shares entitled to vote, all other stockholders may exercise appraisal rights. The fair value of the shares as determined for purposes of appraisal rights may not be less than the highest price per share paid by the acquiror in the control share acquisition.
 
The Control Share Acquisition Act does not apply (a) to shares acquired in a merger, consolidation or share exchange if the corporation is a party to the transaction or (b) to acquisitions approved or exempted by the charter or bylaws of the corporation.
 
Our bylaws contain a provision exempting from the Control Share Acquisition Act any and all acquisitions by any person of our shares of stock. There can be no assurance that such provision will not be amended or
 
Table of Contents
eliminated at any time in the future. However, we will amend our bylaws to be subject to the Control Share Acquisition Act only if the board of directors determines that it would be in our best interests based on our determination that our being subject to the Control Share Acquisition Act does not conflict with the 1940 Act.
 
Business combinations
 
Under Maryland law, "business combinations" between a Maryland corporation and an interested stockholder or an affiliate of an interested stockholder are prohibited for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. These business combinations include a merger, consolidation, share exchange or, in circumstances specified in the statute, an asset transfer or issuance or reclassification of equity securities. An interested stockholder is defined as:
 
 
 
A person is not an interested stockholder under this statute if the board of directors approved in advance the transaction by which he otherwise would have become an interested stockholder. However, in approving a transaction, the board of directors may provide that its approval is subject to compliance, at or after the time of approval, with any terms and conditions determined by the board of directors.
 
After the five-year prohibition, any business combination between the corporation and an interested stockholder generally must be recommended by the board of directors of the corporation and approved by the affirmative vote of at least:
 
 
 
These super-majority vote requirements do not apply if the corporation's common stockholders receive a minimum price, as defined under Maryland law, for their shares in the form of cash or other consideration in the same form as previously paid by the interested stockholder for its shares.
 
The statute permits various exemptions from its provisions, including business combinations that are exempted by the board of directors before the time that the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. Our board of directors has adopted a resolution that any business combination between us and any other person is exempted from the provisions of the Business Combination Act, provided that the business combination is first approved by the board of directors, including a majority of the directors who are not interested persons as defined in the 1940 Act. This resolution, however, may be altered or repealed in whole or in part at any time. If this resolution is repealed, or the board of directors does not otherwise approve a business combination, the statute may discourage others from trying to acquire control of us and increase the difficulty of consummating any offer.
 
Conflict with 1940 Act
 
Our bylaws provide that, if and to the extent that any provision of the Maryland General Corporation Law, including the Control Share Acquisition Act (if we amend our bylaws to be subject to such Act) and the Business Combination Act, or any provision of our charter or bylaws conflicts with any provision of the 1940 Act, the applicable provision of the 1940 Act will control.
 
Table of Contents
 
In addition to shares of common stock, our charter authorizes the issuance of preferred stock. If we offer preferred stock under this prospectus, we will issue an appropriate prospectus supplement. We may issue preferred stock from time to time in one or more classes or series, without stockholder approval. Prior to issuance of shares of each class or series, our Board of Directors is required by Maryland law and by our charter to set the terms, preferences, conversion or other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends or other distributions, qualifications and terms or conditions of redemption for each class or series. Any such an issuance must adhere to the requirements of the 1940 Act, Maryland law and any other limitations imposed by law.
 
The 1940 Act requires, among other things, that (1) immediately after issuance and before any distribution is made with respect to common stock, the liquidation preference of the preferred stock, together with all other senior securities, must not exceed an amount equal to 50% of our total assets (taking into account such distribution) and (2) the holders of shares of preferred stock, if any are issued, must be entitled as a class to elect two directors at all times and to elect a majority of the directors if dividends on the preferred stock are in arrears by two years or more.
 
For any series of preferred stock that we may issue, our board of directors will determine and the prospectus supplement relating to such series will describe:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
All shares of preferred stock that we may issue will be identical and of equal rank except as to the particular terms thereof that may be fixed by our board of directors, and all shares of each series of preferred stock will be identical and of equal rank except as to the dates from which cumulative dividends, if any, thereon will be cumulative.
 
Table of Contents
 
The following is a general description of the terms of the warrants we may issue from time to time. Particular terms of any warrants we offer will be described in the prospectus supplement relating to such warrants.
 
We may issue warrants to purchase shares of our common stock. Such warrants may be issued independently or together with shares of common stock and may be attached or separate from such shares of common stock. We will issue each series of warrants under a separate warrant agreement to be entered into between us and a warrant agent. The warrant agent will act solely as our agent and will not assume any obligation or relationship of agency for or with holders or beneficial owners of warrants.
 
A prospectus supplement will describe the particular terms of any series of warrants we may issue, including the following:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
We and the warrant agent may amend or supplement the warrant agreement for a series of warrants without the consent of the holders of the warrants issued thereunder to effect changes that are not inconsistent with the provisions of the warrants and that do not materially and adversely affect the interests of the holders of the warrants.
 
Under the 1940 Act, we may generally only offer warrants provided that (1) the warrants expire by their terms within ten years; (2) the exercise or conversion price is not less than the current market value at the date of issuance; (3) our stockholders authorize the proposal to issue such warrants, and our board of directors approves such issuance on the basis that the issuance is in the best interests of Apollo Investment and its stockholders; and (4) if the warrants are accompanied by other securities, the warrants are not separately transferable unless no class of such warrants and the securities accompanying them has been publicly distributed. The 1940 Act also provides that the amount of our voting securities that would result from the exercise of all outstanding warrants at the time of issuance may not exceed 25% of our outstanding voting securities.
 
Table of Contents
 
We may issue debt securities in one or more series. The specific terms of each series of debt securities will be described in the particular prospectus supplement relating to that series. The prospectus supplement may or may not modify the general terms found in this prospectus and will be filed with the SEC. For a complete description of the terms of a particular series of debt securities, you should read both this prospectus and the prospectus supplement relating to that particular series.
 
As required by federal law for all bonds and notes of companies that are publicly offered, the debt securities are governed by a document called an "indenture". An indenture is a contract between us and JPMorgan Chase Bank, a financial institution acting as trustee on your behalf, and is subject to and governed by the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended. The trustee has two main roles. First, the trustee can enforce your rights against us if we default. There are some limitations on the extent to which the trustee acts on your behalf, described in the second paragraph under "Events of DefaultRemedies if an Event of Default Occurs". Second, the trustee performs certain administrative duties for us.
 
Because this section is a summary, it does not describe every aspect of the debt securities and the indenture. We urge you to read the indenture because it, and not this description, defines your rights as a holder of debt securities. For example, in this section, we use capitalized words to signify terms that are specifically defined in the indenture. Some of the definitions are repeated in this prospectus, but for the rest you will need to read the indenture. We have filed the form of the indenture with the SEC. See "Available Information" for information on how to obtain a copy of the indenture.
 
The prospectus supplement, which will accompany this prospectus, will describe the particular series of debt securities being offered by including:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table of Contents
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The debt securities may be secured or unsecured obligations. Under the provisions of the 1940 Act, we are permitted, as a business development company, to issue debt only in amounts such that our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, equals at least 200% after each issuance of debt. Unless the prospectus supplement states otherwise, principal (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, will be paid by us in immediately available funds.
 
General
 
The indenture provides that any debt securities proposed to be sold under this prospectus and the attached prospectus supplement ("offered debt securities") and any debt securities issuable upon the exercise of warrants or upon conversion or exchange of other offered securities ("underlying debt securities"), may be issued under the indenture in one or more series.
 
For purposes of this prospectus, any reference to the payment of principal of or premium or interest, if any, on debt securities will include additional amounts if required by the terms of the debt securities.
 
The indenture limits the amount of debt securities that may be issued thereunder from time to time. Debt securities issued under the indenture, when a single trustee is acting for all debt securities issued under the indenture, are called the "indenture securities". The indenture also provides that there may be more than one trustee thereunder, each with respect to one or more different series of indenture securities. See "Resignation of Trustee" below. At a time when two or more trustees are acting under the indenture, each with respect to only certain series, the term "indenture securities" means the one or more series of debt securities with respect to which each respective trustee is acting. In the event that there is more than one trustee under the indenture, the powers and trust obligations of each trustee described in this prospectus will extend only to the one or more series of indenture securities for which it is trustee. If two or more trustees are acting under the indenture, then the indenture securities for which each trustee is acting would be treated as if issued under separate indentures.
 
The indenture does not contain any provisions that give you protection in the event we issue a large amount of debt or we are acquired by another entity.
 
We refer you to the prospectus supplement for information with respect to any deletions from, modifications of or additions to the Events of Default or our covenants that are described below, including any addition of a covenant or other provision providing event risk or similar protection.
 
We have the ability to issue indenture securities with terms different from those of indenture securities previously issued and, without the consent of the holders thereof, to reopen a previous issue of a series of indenture securities and issue additional indenture securities of that series unless the reopening was restricted when that series was created.
 
Table of Contents
Conversion and Exchange
 
If any debt securities are convertible into or exchangeable for other securities, the prospectus supplement will explain the terms and conditions of the conversion or exchange, including the conversion price or exchange ratio (or the calculation method), the conversion or exchange period (or how the period will be determined), if conversion or exchange will be mandatory or at the option of the holder or us, provisions for adjusting the conversion price or the exchange ratio and provisions affecting conversion or exchange in the event of the redemption of the underlying debt securities. These terms may also include provisions under which the number or amount of other securities to be received by the holders of the debt securities upon conversion or exchange would be calculated according to the market price of the other securities as of a time stated in the prospectus supplement.
 
Issuance of Securities in Registered Form
 
We may issue the debt securities in registered form, in which case we may issue them either in book-entry form only or in "certificated" form. Debt securities issued in book-entry form will be represented by global securities. We expect that we will usually issue debt securities in book-entry only form represented by global securities.
 
We also will have the option of issuing debt securities in non-registered form as bearer securities if we issue the securities outside the United States to non-U.S. persons. In that case, the prospectus supplement will set forth the mechanics for holding the bearer securities, including the procedures for receiving payments, for exchanging the bearer securities, including the procedures for receiving payments, for exchanging the bearer securities for registered securities of the same series, and for receiving notices. The prospectus supplement will also describe the requirements with respect to our maintenance of offices or agencies outside the United States and the applicable U.S. federal tax law requirements.
 
Book-Entry Holders
 
We will issue registered debt securities in book-entry form only, unless we specify otherwise in the applicable prospectus supplement. This means debt securities will be represented by one or more global securities registered in the name of a depositary that will hold them on behalf of financial institutions that participate in the depositary's book-entry system. These participating institutions, in turn, hold beneficial interests in the debt securities held by the depositary or its nominee. These institutions may hold these interests on behalf of themselves or customers.
 
Under the indenture, only the person in whose name a debt security is registered is recognized as the holder of that debt security. Consequently, for debt securities issued in book-entry form, we will recognize only the depositary as the holder of the debt securities and we will make all payments on the debt securities to the depositary. The depositary will then pass along the payments it receives to its participants, which in turn will pass the payments along to their customers who are the beneficial owners. The depositary and its participants do so under agreements they have made with one another or with their customers; they are not obligated to do so under the terms of the debt securities.
 
As a result, investors will not own debt securities directly. Instead, they will own beneficial interests in a global security, through a bank, broker or other financial institution that participates in the depositary's book-entry system or holds an interest through a participant. As long as the debt securities are represented by one or more global securities, investors will be indirect holders, and not holders, of the debt securities.
 
Street Name Holders
 
In the future, we may issue debt securities in certificated form or terminate a global security. In these cases, investors may choose to hold their debt securities in their own names or in "street name". Debt securities held in street name are registered in the name of a bank, broker or other financial institution chosen by the investor, and the investor would hold a beneficial interest in those debt securities through the account he or she maintains at that institution.
 
Table of Contents
For debt securities held in street name, we will recognize only the intermediary banks, brokers and other financial institutions in whose names the debt securities are registered as the holders of those debt securities and we will make all payments on those debt securities to them. These institutions will pass along the payments they receive to their customers who are the beneficial owners, but only because they agree to do so in their customer agreements or because they are legally required to do so. Investors who hold debt securities in street name will be indirect holders, and not holders, of the debt securities.
 
Legal Holders. Our obligations, as well as the obligations of the applicable trustee and those of any third parties employed by us or the applicable trustee, run only to the legal holders of the debt securities. We do not have obligations to investors who hold beneficial interests in global securities, in street name or by any other indirect means. This will be the case whether an investor chooses to be an indirect holder of a debt security or has no choice because we are issuing the debt securities only in book-entry form.
 
For example, once we make a payment or give a notice to the holder, we have no further responsibility for the payment or notice even if that holder is required, under agreements with depositary participants or customers or by law, to pass it along to the indirect holders but does not do so. Similarly, if we want to obtain the approval of the holders for any purpose (for example, to amend an indenture or to relieve us of the consequences of a default or of our obligation to comply with a particular provision of an indenture), we would seek the approval only from the holders, and not the indirect holders, of the debt securities. Whether and how the holders contact the indirect holders is up to the holders.
 
When we refer to you, we mean those who invest in the debt securities being offered by this prospectus, whether they are the holders or only indirect holders of those debt securities. When we refer to your debt securities, we mean the debt securities in which you hold a direct or indirect interest.
 
Special Considerations for Indirect Holders
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Global Securities
 
Anoted above, we usually will issue debt securities as registered securities in book-entry form only. A global security represents one or any other number of individual debt securities. Generally, all debt securities represented by the same global securities will have the same terms.
s
 
Each debt security issued in book-entry form will be represented by a global security that we deposit with and register in the name of a financial institution or its nominee that we select. The financial institution that we select for this purpose is called the depositary. Unless we specify otherwise in the applicable prospectus
 
Table of Contents
supplement, The Depository Trust Company, New York, New York, known as DTC, will be the depositary for all debt securities issued in book-entry form.
 
A global security may not be transferred to or registered in the name of anyone other than the depositary or its nominee, unless special termination situations arise. We describe those situations below under "Special Situations when a Global Security Will Be Terminated". As a result of these arrangements, the depositary, or its nominee, will be the sole registered owner and holder of all debt securities represented by a global security, and investors will be permitted to own only beneficial interests in a global security. Beneficial interests must be held by means of an account with a broker, bank or other financial institution that in turn has an account with the depositary or with another institution that has an account with the depositary. Thus, an investor whose security is represented by a global security will not be a holder of the debt security, but only an indirect holder of a beneficial interest in the global security.
 
Special Considerations for Global Securities
 
As an indirect holder, an investor's rights relating to a global security will be governed by the account rules of the investor's financial institution and of the depositary, as well as general laws relating to securities transfers. The depositary that holds the global security will be considered the holder of the debt securities represented by the global security.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table of Contents
Special Situations when a Global Security Will Be Terminated
 
In a few special situations described below, a global security will be terminated and interests in it will be exchanged for certificates in non-book-entry form (certificated securities). After that exchange, the choice of whether to hold the certificated debt securities directly or in street name will be up to the investor. Investors must consult their own banks or brokers to find out how to have their interests in a global security transferred on termination to their own names, so that they will be holders. We have described the rights of holders and street name investors under "Holders of Registered Debt Securities" above.
 
The special situations for termination of a global security are as follows:
 
 
 
 
The prospectus supplement may list situations for terminating a global security that would apply only to the particular series of debt securities covered by the prospectus supplement. If a global security is terminated, only the depositary, and not we or the applicable trustee, is responsible for deciding the names of the institutions in whose names the debt securities represented by the global security will be registered and, therefore, who will be the holders of those debt securities.
 
Payment and Paying Agents
 
We will pay interest to the person listed in the applicable trustee's records as the owner of the debt security at the close of business on a particular day in advance of each due date for interest, even if that person no longer owns the debt security on the interest due date. That day, usually about two weeks in advance of the interest due date, is called the "record date." Because we will pay all the interest for an interest period to the holders on the record date, holders buying and selling debt securities must work out between themselves the appropriate purchase price. The most common manner is to adjust the sales price of the debt securities to prorate interest fairly between buyer and seller based on their respective ownership periods within the particular interest period. This prorated interest amount is called "accrued interest."
 
Payments on Global Securities
 
We will make payments on a global security in accordance with the applicable policies of the depositary as in effect from time to time. Under those policies, we will make payments directly to the depositary, or its nominee, and not to any indirect holders who own beneficial interests in the global security. An indirect holder's right to those payments will be governed by the rules and practices of the depositary and its participants, as described under "What Is a Global Security?".
 
Payments on Certificated Securities
 
We will make payments on a certificated debt security as follows. We will pay interest that is due on an interest payment date by check mailed on the interest payment date to the holder at his or her address shown on the trustee's records as of the close of business on the regular record date. We will make all payments of principal and premium, if any, by check at the office of the applicable trustee in New York, NY and/or at other offices that may be specified in the prospectus supplement or in a notice to holders against surrender of the debt security.
 
Alternatively, if the holder asks us to do so, we will pay any amount that becomes due on the debt security by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account at a bank in New York City, on the due date. To
 
Table of Contents
request payment by wire, the holder must give the applicable trustee or other paying agent appropriate transfer instructions at least 15 business days before the requested wire payment is due. In the case of any interest payment due on an interest payment date, the instructions must be given by the person who is the holder on the relevant regular record date. Any wire instructions, once properly given, will remain in effect unless and until new instructions are given in the manner described above.
 
Payment When Offices Are Closed
 
If any payment is due on a debt security on a day that is not a business day, we will make the payment on the next day that is a business day. Payments made on the next business day in this situation will be treated under the indenture as if they were made on the original due date, except as otherwise indicated in the attached prospectus supplement. Such payment will not result in a default under any debt security or the indenture, and no interest will accrue on the payment amount from the original due date to the next day that is a business day.
 
Book-entry and other indirect holders should consult their banks or brokers for information on how they will receive payments on their debt securities.
 
Events of Default
 
You will have rights if an Event of Default occurs in respect of the debt securities of your series and is not cured, as described later in this subsection.
 
The term "Event of Default" in respect of the debt securities of your series means any of the following:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
An Event of Default for a particular series of debt securities does not necessarily constitute an Event of Default for any other series of debt securities issued under the same or any other indenture. The trustee may withhold notice to the holders of debt securities of any default, except in the payment of principal, premium or interest, if it considers the withholding of notice to be in the best interests of the holders.
 
Remedies if an Event of Default Occurs
 
If an Event of Default has occurred and has not been cured, the trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the debt securities of the affected series may declare the entire principal amount of all the debt securities of that series to be due and immediately payable. This is called a declaration of acceleration of maturity. A declaration of acceleration of maturity may be canceled by the holders of a majority in principal amount of the debt securities of the affected series.
 
Except in cases of default, where the trustee has some special duties, the trustee is not required to take any action under the indenture at the request of any holders unless the holders offer the trustee reasonable protection from expenses and liability (called an "indemnity"). (Section 315 of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939). If
 
Table of Contents
reasonable indemnity is provided, the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of the relevant series may direct the time, method and place of conducting any lawsuit or other formal legal action seeking any remedy available to the trustee. The trustee may refuse to follow those directions in certain circumstances. No delay or omission in exercising any right or remedy will be treated as a waiver of that right, remedy or Event of Default.
 
Before you are allowed to bypass your trustee and bring your own lawsuit or other formal legal action or take other steps to enforce your rights or protect your interests relating to the debt securities, the following must occur:
 
 
 
 
 
However, you are entitled at any time to bring a lawsuit for the payment of money due on your debt securities on or after the due date.
 
Holders of a majority in principal amount of the debt securities of the affected series may waive any past defaults other than
 
 
 
Book-entry and other indirect holders should consult their banks or brokers for information on how to give notice or direction to or make a request of the trustee and how to declare or cancel an acceleration of maturity.
 
Each year, we will furnish to each trustee a written statement of certain of our officers certifying that to their knowledge we are in compliance with the indenture and the debt securities, or else specifying any default.
 
Merger or Consolidation
 
Under the terms of the indenture, we are generally permitted to consolidate or merge with another entity. We are also permitted to sell all or substantially all of our assets to another entity. However, we may not take any of these actions unless all the following conditions are met:
 
 
 
 
Table of Contents
 
 
 
Modification or Waiver
 
There are three types of changes we can make to the indenture and the debt securities issued thereunder.
 
Changes Requiring Your Approval
 
First, there are changes that we cannot make to your debt securities without your specific approval. The following is a list of those types of changes:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Changes Not Requiring Approval
 
The second type of change does not require any vote by the holders of the debt securities. This type is limited to clarifications and certain other changes that would not adversely affect holders of the outstanding debt securities in any material respect. We also do not need any approval to make any change that affects only debt securities to be issued under the indenture after the change takes effect.
 
Table of Contents
Changes Requiring Majority Approval
 
Any other change to the indenture and the debt securities would require the following approval:
 
 
 
In each case, the required approval must be given by written consent.
 
The holders of a majority in principal amount of all of the series of debt securities issued under an indenture, voting together as one class for this purpose, may waive our compliance with some of our covenants in that indenture. However, we cannot obtain a waiver of a payment default or of any of the matters covered by the bullet points included above under "Changes Requiring Your Approval."
 
Further Details Concerning Voting
 
When taking a vote, we will use the following rules to decide how much principal to attribute to a debt security:
 
 
 
 
Debt securities will not be considered outstanding, and therefore not eligible to vote, if we have deposited or set aside in trust money for their payment or redemption. Debt securities will also not be eligible to vote if they have been fully defeased as described later under "DefeasanceFull Defeasance."
 
We will generally be entitled to set any day as a record date for the purpose of determining the holders of outstanding indenture securities that are entitled to vote or take other action under the indenture. If we set a record date for a vote or other action to be taken by holders of one or more series, that vote or action may be taken only by persons who are holders of outstanding indenture securities of those series on the record date and must be taken within eleven months following the record date.
 
Book-entry and other indirect holders should consult their banks or brokers for information on how approval may be granted or denied if we seek to change the indenture or the debt securities or request a waiver.
 
Defeasance
 
The following provisions will be applicable to each series of debt securities unless we state in the applicable prospectus supplement that the provisions of covenant defeasance and full defeasance will not be applicable to that series.
 
Covenant Defeasance
 
Under current United States federal tax law, we can make the deposit described below and be released from some of the restrictive covenants in the indenture under which the particular series was issued. This is called
 
Table of Contents
"covenant defeasance". In that event, you would lose the protection of those restrictive covenants but would gain the protection of having money and government securities set aside in trust to repay your debt securities. If applicable, you also would be released from the subordination provisions described under "Indenture ProvisionsSubordination" below. In order to achieve covenant defeasance, we must do the following:
 
 
 
We must deliver to the trustee a legal opinion of our counsel stating that the above deposit does not require registration by us under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and a legal opinion and officers' certificate stating that all conditions precedent to covenant defeasance have been complied with.
 
If we accomplish covenant defeasance, you can still look to us for repayment of the debt securities if there were a shortfall in the trust deposit or the trustee is prevented from making payment. In fact, if one of the remaining Events of Default occurred (such as our bankruptcy) and the debt securities became immediately due and payable, there might be a shortfall. Depending on the event causing the default, you may not be able to obtain payment of the shortfall.
 
Full Defeasance
 
If there is a change in United States federal tax law, as described below, we can legally release ourselves from all payment and other obligations on the debt securities of a particular series (called "full defeasance") if we put in place the following other arrangements for you to be repaid:
 
 
 
 
If we ever did accomplish full defeasance, as described above, you would have to rely solely on the trust deposit for repayment of the debt securities. You could not look to us for repayment in the unlikely event of any shortfall. Conversely, the trust deposit would most likely be protected from claims of our lenders and other creditors if we ever became bankrupt or insolvent. If applicable, you would also be released from the subordination provisions described later under "Indenture ProvisionsSubordination."
 
Table of Contents
Form, Exchange and Transfer of Certificated Registered Securities
 
If registered debt securities cease to be issued in book-entry form, they will be issued:
 
 
 
 
Holders may exchange their certificated securities for debt securities of smaller denominations or combined into fewer debt securities of larger denominations, as long as the total principal amount is not changed.
 
Holders may exchange or transfer their certificated securities at the office of their trustee. We have appointed the trustee to act as our agent for registering debt securities in the names of holders transferring debt securities. We may appoint another entity to perform these functions or perform them ourselves.
 
Holders will not be required to pay a service charge to transfer or exchange their certificated securities, but they may be required to pay any tax or other governmental charge associated with the transfer or exchange. The transfer or exchange will be made only if our transfer agent is satisfied with the holder's proof of legal ownership.
 
If we have designated additional transfer agents for your debt security, they will be named in your prospectus supplement. We may appoint additional transfer agents or cancel the appointment of any particular transfer agent. We may also approve a change in the office through which any transfer agent acts.
 
If any certificated securities of a particular series are redeemable and we redeem less than all the debt securities of that series, we may block the transfer or exchange of those debt securities during the period beginning 15 days before the day we mail the notice of redemption and ending on the day of that mailing, in order to freeze the list of holders to prepare the mailing. We may also refuse to register transfers or exchanges of any certificated securities selected for redemption, except that we will continue to permit transfers and exchanges of the unredeemed portion of any debt security that will be partially redeemed.
 
If a registered debt security is issued in book-entry form, only the depositary will be entitled to transfer and exchange the debt security as described in this subsection, since it will be the sole holder of the debt security.
 
Resignation of Trustee
 
Each trustee may resign or be removed with respect to one or more series of indenture securities provided that a successor trustee is appointed to act with respect to these series. In the event that two or more persons are acting as trustee with respect to different series of indenture securities under the indenture, each of the trustees will be a trustee of a trust separate and apart from the trust administered by any other trustee.
 
Indenture ProvisionsLimitation on Liens
 
If we issue indenture securities that are denominated as senior debt securities, we covenant in the indenture that neither we nor any of our subsidiaries, if any, will pledge or subject to any lien any of our or their property or assets unless those senior debt securities issued under the indenture are secured by this pledge or lien equally and ratably with other indebtedness thereby secured. There are excluded from this covenant liens created to secure obligations for the purchase price of physical property, liens of a subsidiary securing indebtedness owed to us, liens existing on property acquired upon exercise of rights arising out of defaults on receivables acquired in the ordinary course of business, sales of receivables accounted for as secured indebtedness in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, certain liens not related to the borrowing of money and other liens not securing borrowed money aggregating less than $500,000.
 
Table of Contents
Indenture ProvisionsSubordination
 
Upon any distribution of our assets upon our dissolution, winding up, liquidation or reorganization, the payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, on any indenture securities denominated as subordinated debt securities is to be subordinated to the extent provided in the indenture in right of payment to the prior payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness, but our obligation to you to make payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, on such subordinated debt securities will not otherwise be affected. In addition, no payment on account of principal (or premium, if any), sinking fund or interest, if any, may be made on such subordinated debt securities at any time unless full payment of all amounts due in respect of the principal (and premium, if any), sinking fund and interest on Senior Indebtedness has been made or duly provided for in money or money's worth.
 
In the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing, any payment by us is received by the trustee in respect of subordinated debt securities or by the holders of any of such subordinated debt securities before all Senior Indebtedness is paid in full, the payment or distribution must be paid over to the holders of the Senior Indebtedness or on their behalf for application to the payment of all the Senior Indebtedness remaining unpaid until all the Senior Indebtedness has been paid in full, after giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution to the holders of the Senior Indebtedness. Subject to the payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness upon this distribution by us, the holders of such subordinated debt securities will be subrogated to the rights of the holders of the Senior Indebtedness to the extent of payments made to the holders of the Senior Indebtedness out of the distributive share of such subordinated debt securities.
 
By reason of this subordination, in the event of a distribution of our assets upon our insolvency, certain of our senior creditors may recover more, ratably, than holders of any subordinated debt securities. The indenture provides that these subordination provisions will not apply to money and securities held in trust under the defeasance provisions of the indenture.
 
Senior Indebtedness is defined in the indenture as the principal of (and premium, if any) and unpaid interest on:
 
 
 
If this prospectus is being delivered in connection with the offering of a series of indenture securities denominated as subordinated debt securities, the accompanying prospectus supplement will set forth the approximate amount of our Senior Indebtedness outstanding as of a recent date.
 
The Trustee under the Indenture
 
JPMorgan Chase Bank will serve as the trustee under the indenture. JPMorgan Chase Bank is one of a number of banks with which we maintain ordinary banking relationships and from which we have obtained a senior secured credit facility and lines of credit.
 
Certain Considerations Relating to Foreign Currencies
 
Debt securities denominated or payable in foreign currencies may entail significant risks. These risks include the possibility of significant fluctuations in the foreign currency markets, the imposition or modification of foreign exchange controls and potential illiquidity in the secondary market. These risks will vary depending upon the currency or currencies involved and will be more fully described in the applicable prospectus supplement.
 
Table of Contents
 
We have elected to be treated as a business development company under the 1940 Act and have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. The 1940 Act contains prohibitions and restrictions relating to transactions between business development companies and their affiliates (including any investment advisers or sub-advisers), principal underwriters and affiliates of those affiliates or underwriters and requires that a majority of the directors be persons other than "interested persons," as that term is defined in the 1940 Act. In addition, the 1940 Act provides that we may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or to withdraw our election as, a business development company unless approved by a majority of our outstanding voting securities voting as a class.
 
We may invest up to 100% of our assets in securities acquired directly from issuers in privately negotiated transactions. With respect to such securities, we may, for the purpose of public resale, be deemed an "underwriter" as that term is defined in the Securities Act. Our intention is to not write (sell) or buy put or call options to manage risks associated with the publicly traded securities of our portfolio companies, except that we may enter into hedging transactions to manage the risks associated with interest rate and currency rate fluctuations. However, we may purchase or otherwise receive warrants to purchase the common stock of our portfolio companies in connection with acquisition financing or other investment. Similarly, in connection with an acquisition, we may acquire rights to require the issuers of acquired securities or their affiliates to repurchase them under certain circumstances. We also do not intend to acquire securities issued by any investment company that exceed the limits imposed by the 1940 Act. Under these limits, we generally cannot acquire more than 3% of the voting stock of any registered investment company, invest more than 5% of the value of our total assets in the securities of one investment company or invest more than 10% of the value of our total assets in the securities of more than one investment company. With regard to that portion of our portfolio invested in securities issued by investment companies, it should be noted that such investments might subject our stockholders to additional expenses. None of these policies are fundamental and may be changed without stockholder approval.
 
Qualifying Assets
 
Under the 1940 Act, a business development company may not acquire any asset other than assets of the type listed in Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, which are referred to as qualifying assets, unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the company's total assets. The principal categories of qualifying assets relevant to our proposed business are the following:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table of Contents
 
 
 
 
 
The SEC has proposed a regulation under the 1940 Act to expand the definition of eligible portfolio company in a manner that would promote the flow of capital to small, developing and financially troubled companies. This regulation would define eligible portfolio company with reference to whether a company has any class of securities listed on an exchange. We continue to monitor this issue closely and intend to adjust our investment focus as needed to comply with and/or take advantage of this rule if it is adopted or of any other future administrative position, judicial decision or legislative action.
 
Managerial Assistance to Portfolio Companies
 
In addition, a business development company must have been organized and have its principal place of business in the United States and must be operated for the purpose of making investments in the types of securities described in (1), (2) or (3) above. However, in order to count portfolio securities as qualifying assets for the purpose of the 70% test, the business development company must either control the issuer of the securities or must offer to make available to the issuer of the securities (other than small and solvent companies described above) significant managerial assistance; except that, where the business development company purchases such securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together, one of the other persons in the group may make available such managerial assistance. Making available managerial assistance means, among other things, any arrangement whereby the business development company, through its directors, officers or employees, offers to provide, and, if accepted, does so provide, significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company.
 
Temporary Investments
 
Pending investment in other types of "qualifying assets," as described above, our investments may consist of cash equivalents, U.S. Government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, which we refer to, collectively, as temporary investments, so that 70% of our assets are qualifying assets. Typically, we will invest in U.S. Treasury bills or in repurchase agreements, provided that such agreements are fully collateralized by cash or securities issued by the U.S. Government or its agencies. A repurchase agreement involves the purchase by an investor, such as us, of a specified security and the simultaneous agreement by the seller to repurchase it at an agreed-upon future date and at a price which is greater than the purchase price by an amount that reflects an agreed-upon interest rate. There is no percentage restriction on the proportion of our assets that may be invested in such repurchase agreements.
 
Senior Securities
 
We are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of stock senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 200%
 
Table of Contents
immediately after each such issuance. In addition, while any senior securities remain outstanding, we must make provisions to prohibit any distribution to our stockholders or the repurchase of such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the distribution or repurchase. We may also borrow amounts up to 5% of the value of our total assets for temporary or emergency purposes without regard to asset coverage. For a discussion of the risks associated with leverage, see "Risk FactorsRisks relating to our business and structureRegulations governing our operation as a business development company will affect our ability to, and the way in which we, raise additional capital."
 
Code of Ethics
 
We and Apollo Investment Management have each adopted a code of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act that establishes procedures for personal investments and restricts certain personal securities transactions. Personnel subject to each code may invest in securities for their personal investment accounts, including securities that may be purchased or held by us, so long as such investments are made in accordance with the code's requirements. For information on how to obtain a copy of each code of ethics, see "Available information."
 
Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures
 
SEC registered advisers that have the authority to vote (client) proxies (which authority may be implied from a general grant of investment discretion) are required to adopt policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that the adviser votes proxies in the best interests of its clients. Registered advisers also must maintain certain records on proxy voting. In most cases, Apollo Investment will invest in securities that do not generally entitle it to voting rights in its portfolio companies. When Apollo Investment does have voting rights, it will delegate the exercise of such rights to Apollo Investment Management. Apollo Investment Management's proxy voting policies and procedures are summarized below:
 
In determining how to vote, officers of our investment adviser will consult with each other and other investment professionals of Apollo, taking into account the interests of Apollo Investment and its investors as well as any potential conflicts of interest. Our investment adviser will consult with legal counsel to identify potential conflicts of interest. Where a potential conflict of interest exists, our investment adviser may, if it so elects, resolve it by following the recommendation of a disinterested third party, by seeking the direction of the independent directors of Apollo Investment or, in extreme cases, by abstaining from voting. While our investment adviser may retain an outside service to provide voting recommendations and to assist in analyzing votes, our investment adviser will not delegate its voting authority to any third party.
 
An officer of Apollo Investment Management will keep a written record of how all such proxies are voted. Our investment adviser will retain records of (1) proxy voting policies and procedures, (2) all proxy statements received (or it may rely on proxy statements filed on the SEC's EDGAR system in lieu thereof), (3) all votes cast, (4) investor requests for voting information, and (5) any specific documents prepared or received in connection with a decision on a proxy vote. If it uses an outside service, our investment adviser may rely on such service to maintain copies of proxy statements and records, so long as such service will provide a copy of such documents promptly upon request.
 
Our investment adviser's proxy voting policies are not exhaustive and are designed to be responsive to the wide range of issues that may be subject to a proxy vote. In general, our investment adviser will vote our proxies in accordance with these guidelines unless: (1) it has determined otherwise due to the specific and unusual facts and circumstances with respect to a particular vote, (2) the subject matter of the vote is not covered by these guidelines, (3) a material conflict of interest is present, or (4) we find it necessary to vote contrary to our general guidelines to maximize shareholder value or the best interests of Apollo Investment. In reviewing proxy issues, our investment adviser generally will use the following guidelines:
 
    In general, our investment adviser will vote in favor of the management-proposed slate of directors. If there is a proxy fight for seats on a portfolio company's board of directors, or our investment
Elections of Directors:
 
Table of Contents
adviser determines that there are other compelling reasons for withholding our vote, it will determine the appropriate vote on the matter. We may withhold votes for directors that fail to act on key issues, such as failure to: (1) implement proposals to declassify a board of directors, (2) implement a majority vote requirement, (3) submit a rights plan to a shareholder vote or (4) act on tender offers where a majority of shareholders have tendered their shares. Finally, our investment adviser may withhold votes for directors of non-U.S. issuers where there is insufficient information about the nominees disclosed in the proxy statement.
 
    We believe that a portfolio company remains in the best position to choose its independent auditors and our investment adviser will generally support management's recommendation in this regard.
Appointment of Auditors:
 
    Changes in a portfolio company's charter or bylaws may be required by state or federal regulation. In general, our investment adviser will cast our votes in accordance with the management on such proposals. However, our investment adviser will consider carefully any proposal regarding a change in corporate structure that is not required by state or federal regulation.
Changes in Capital Structure:
 
    We believe proxy votes dealing with corporate reorganizations are an extension of the investment decision. Accordingly, our investment adviser will analyze such proposals on a case-by-case basis and vote in accordance with its perception of our interests.
Corporate Restructurings, Mergers and Acquisitions:
 
    We will generally vote in favor of proposals that give shareholders a greater voice in the affairs of a portfolio company and oppose any measure that seeks to limit such rights. However, when analyzing such proposals, our investment adviser will balance the financial impact of the proposal against any impairment of shareholder rights as well as of our investment in the portfolio company.
Proposals Affecting Shareholder Rights:
 
    We recognize the importance of good corporate governance. Accordingly, our investment adviser will generally favor proposals that promote transparency and accountability within a portfolio company.
Corporate Governance:
 
    Our investment adviser will evaluate, on a case-by-case basis, any proposals regarding anti-takeover measures to determine the measure's likely effect on shareholder value dilution.
Anti-Takeover Measures:
 
    Our investment adviser will generally vote with management on stock split matters.
Stock Splits:
 
    Our investment adviser will generally vote with management on matters that could adversely affect the limited liability of directors.
Limited Liability of Directors:
 
    Our investment adviser will review proposals related to social, political and environmental issues to determine whether they may adversely affect shareholder value. Our investment adviser may abstain from voting on such proposals where they do not have a readily determinable financial impact on shareholder value.
Social and Corporate Responsibility:
 
Other
 
We may also be prohibited under the 1940 Act from knowingly participating in certain transactions with our affiliates without the prior approval of our board of directors who are not interested persons and, in some cases, prior approval by the SEC.
 
We will be periodically examined by the SEC for compliance with the 1940 Act.
 
We are required to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect us against larceny and embezzlement. Furthermore, as a business development company, we are prohibited from
 
Table of Contents
protecting any director or officer against any liability to Apollo Investment or our stockholders arising from willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person's office.
 
We and Apollo Investment Management have adopted and implemented written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violation of the federal securities laws and intend to review these policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation. We have designated a chief compliance officer to be responsible for administering our policies and procedures.
 
Compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and The Nasdaq National Market Corporate Governance Regulations
 
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 imposes a wide variety of regulatory requirements on publicly-held companies and their insiders. Many of these requirements affect us. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act has required us to review our policies and procedures to determine whether we comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the new regulations promulgated thereunder. We will continue to monitor our compliance with all future regulations that are adopted under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and will take actions necessary to ensure that we are in compliance therewith.
 
In addition, The Nasdaq National Market has adopted or is in the process of adopting corporate governance changes to its listing standards. We believe we are in compliance with such corporate governance listing standards. We will continue to monitor our compliance with all future listing standards and will take actions necessary to ensure that we are in compliance therewith.

Our securities are held under a custody agreement by JPMorgan Chase Bank, a global financial services firm. The address of the custodian is: 270 Park Avenue, New York, NY 10017. American Stock Transfer and Trust Company will act as our transfer agent, dividend paying agent and registrar. The principal business address of American Stock Transfer & Trust Company is: 59 Maiden Lane, New York, NY 10007, telephone number: (718) 921-8200. JPMorgan Chase Bank will also act as the trustee. The principal business address of JPMorgan Chase Bank is: 270 Park Avenue, New York, NY 10017.
 
 
Since we generally acquire and dispose of our investments in privately negotiated transactions, we infrequently use brokers in the normal course of our business. From the commencement of our operations through March 31, 2005, we have not paid any brokerage commissions. Subject to policies established by our board of directors, our investment adviser is primarily responsible for the execution of the publicly traded securities portion of our portfolio transactions and the allocation of brokerage commissions. Our investment adviser does not execute transactions through any particular broker or dealer, but seeks to obtain the best net results for Apollo Investment, taking into account such factors as price (including the applicable brokerage commission or dealer spread), size of order, difficulty of execution, and operational facilities of the firm and the firm's risk and skill in positioning blocks of securities. While our investment adviser generally seeks reasonably competitive trade execution costs, Apollo Investment will not necessarily pay the lowest spread or commission available. Subject to applicable legal requirements, our investment adviser may select a broker based partly upon brokerage or research services provided to the investment adviser and Apollo Investment and any other clients.

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Apollo Investment Corporation:
 
In our opinion, the accompanying balance sheet, including the schedule of investments, and the related statements of operations, of stockholders' equity and of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Apollo Investment Corporation (the "Company") at March 31, 2005, the results of its operations, its changes in stockholders' equity and its cash flows for the period April 8, 2004 (commencement of operations) through March 31, 2005, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit of these financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit, which included confirmation of securities at March 31, 2005 by correspondence with the custodian and issuers, provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Note 1. Organization
 
Apollo Investment Corporation ("Apollo Investment" or the "Company"), a Maryland corporation organized on February 2, 2004, is a closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that has filed an election to be treated as a business development company ("BDC") under the Investment Company Act of 1940. In addition, for tax purposes we have elected to be treated as a regulated investment company, or RIC, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Our investment objective is to generate both current income and capital appreciation through debt and equity investments. We intend to invest primarily in middle-market companies in the form of mezzanine and senior secured loans, each of which may include an equity component, as well as by making direct equity investments in such companies.
 
On April 8, 2004, Apollo Investment closed its initial public offering and sold 62,000,000 shares of its common stock at a price of $15.00 per share, less an underwriting discount and commissions totaling $0.9375 per share. We commenced operations on April 8, 2004 as we received $870.15 million in total net proceeds from the offering.
 
Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies
 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reported period. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining these estimates could cause actual results to differ.
 
Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP and pursuant to the requirements for reporting on Form 10-K and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, certain disclosures accompanying financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP are omitted. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting solely of normal recurring accruals, considered necessary for the fair presentation of financial statements, have been included.
 
The significant accounting policies consistently followed by Apollo Investment are:
 
(a) Security transactions are accounted for on the trade date;
 
(b) Investments for which market quotations are readily available are valued at such market quotations; debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded or whose market prices are not readily available are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of our Board of Directors. Subordinated debt, senior secured debt and other debt securities with maturities greater than 60 days are valued by an independent pricing service or at the mean between the bid and ask prices from at least two brokers or dealers (if available, otherwise by a principal market maker or a primary market dealer). With respect to certain private equity securities, each investment is valued using comparisons of financial ratios of the portfolio companies that issued such private equity securities to peer companies that are public. The value is then discounted to reflect the illiquid nature of the investment. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, we will use the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate our private equity valuation. Because we expect that there will not be a readily available market value for most of the investments in our portfolio, we expect to value substantially all of our portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of our Board of Directors using a documented valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value existed for such investments, and the differences could be material.
 
Table of Contents
 
 
With respect to our investments for which market quotations are not readily available, our Board of Directors undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below:
 
(1) Our quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by the investment professionals responsible for the portfolio investment;
 
(2) Preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with our senior management;
 
(3) Independent valuation firms engaged by our board of directors conduct independent appraisals and review management's preliminary valuations and their own independent assessment;
 
(4) The audit committee of our board of directors reviews the preliminary valuation of our investment adviser and that of the independent valuation firms and responds and supplements the valuation recommendation of the independent valuation firm to reflect any comments; and
 
(5) The board of directors discusses valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith based on the input of our investment adviser, the respective independent valuation firms and the audit committee.
 
The types of factors that we may take into account in fair value pricing our investments include, as relevant, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company's ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flow, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparison to publicly traded securities and other relevant factors.
 
Determination of fair values involves subjective judgments and estimates. Accordingly, these notes to our financial statements express the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of such valuations, and any change in such valuations, on our financial statements.
 
(c) Investments purchased within 60 days of maturity are valued at cost plus accreted discount, or minus amortized premium, which approximates value;
 
(d) Gains or losses on the sale of investments are calculated by using the specific identification method;
 
(e) Interest income, adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount, is recorded on an accrual basis. Origination, closing and/or commitment fees associated with investments in portfolio companies are accreted into interest income over the respective terms of the applicable loans. Upon the prepayment of a loan or debt security, any prepayment penalties and unamortized loan origination, closing and commitment fees are recorded as interest income;
 
(f) The Company intends to comply with the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, pertaining to regulated investment companies to make distributions of taxable income sufficient to relieve it from substantially all Federal income and excise taxes;
 
(g) In accordance with Statement of Position 93-2 Determination, Disclosure, and Financial Statement Presentation of Income, Capital Gain, and Return of Capital Distributions by Investment Companies, book and tax basis differences relating to stockholder distributions and other permanent book and tax differences are reclassified to paid-in capital. In addition, the character of income and gains to be distributed is determined in accordance with income tax regulations that may differ from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Accordingly, at March 31, 2005, $640,200 was reclassified on our balance sheet from accumulated realized capital gains to accumulated net investment income. Total earnings and net asset value is not affected;
 
(h) Dividends and distributions to common stockholders are recorded on the record date. The amount to be paid out as a dividend is determined by the Board of Directors each quarter and is generally based upon the earnings estimated by management. Net realized capital gains, if any, are distributed at least annually.
 
Table of Contents
 
 
(i) Origination, facility, commitment, and other fees received by the Company on loan agreements or other investments are typically accreted over the remaining term of the loan
.
 
(j) The accounting records of the Company are maintained in U.S. dollars. All assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars based on the rate of exchange of such currencies against U.S. dollars on the date of valuation.
 
(k) The Company may enter into forward exchange contracts in order to hedge against foreign currency risk. These contracts are marked to market by recognizing the difference between the contract exchange rate and the current market rate as unrealized appreciation or depreciation. Realized gains or losses are recognized when contracts are settled.
 
Note 3. Agreements
 
Apollo Investment has entered into an Investment Advisory and Management Agreement with the Investment Adviser, Apollo Investment Management, L.P., under which the Investment Adviser, subject to the overall supervision of Apollo Investment's Board of Directors, will manage the day-to-day operations of, and provide investment advisory services to, Apollo Investment. For providing these services, the Investment Adviser receives a fee from Apollo Investment, consisting of two componentsa base management fee and an incentive fee. The base management fee is calculated at an annual rate of 2.00% of Apollo Investment's gross assets. For services rendered under the Investment Advisory and Management Agreement during the period commencing from the closing of Apollo Investment's initial offering through and including the first six months of operations, the base management fee was payable monthly in arrears. For services rendered under the Investment Advisory and Management Agreement after that time, the base management fee is payable quarterly in arrears. For the first quarter of our operations, the base management fee was calculated based on the initial value of Apollo Investment's gross assets. Subsequently, the base management fee is calculated based on the average value of Apollo Investment's gross assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters (we consider the date we commenced operations as a quarter end), and is appropriately adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the current calendar quarter. Base management fees for any partial month or quarter are appropriately pro rated.
 
The incentive fee has two parts, as follows: one part is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on Apollo Investment's pre-incentive fee net investment income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter. For this purpose, pre-incentive fee net investment income means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees (other than fees for providing managerial assistance), such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that we receive from portfolio companies) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus Apollo Investment's operating expenses for the quarter (including the base management fee, any expenses payable under the Administration Agreement, and any interest expense and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee). Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not include any realized capital gains computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation. Pre-incentive fee net investment income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of Apollo Investment's net assets at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, is compared to the hurdle rate of 1.75% per quarter (7% annualized). Our net investment income used to calculate this part of the incentive fee is also included in the amount of our gross assets used to calculate the 2% base management fee. Apollo Investment pays the Investment Adviser an incentive fee with respect to the Apollo Investment's pre-incentive fee net investment income in each calendar quarter as follows: (1) no incentive fee in any calendar quarter in which Apollo Investment's pre-incentive fee net investment income does not exceed the hurdle rate; (2) 100% of Apollo Investment's pre-incentive fee net investment income with respect to that portion of such pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than 2.1875% in any
 
Table of Contents
 
 
calendar quarter; and (3) 20% of the amount of Apollo Investment's pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds 2.1875% in any calendar quarter. These calculations are appropriately pro rated for any period of less than three months and adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the relevant quarter. You should be aware that a rise in the general level of interest rates can be expected to lead to higher interest rates applicable to our debt investments. Accordingly, an increase in interest rates would make it easier for us to meet or exceed the incentive fee hurdle rate and may result in a substantial increase of the amount of incentive fees payable to our investment adviser with respect to pre-incentive fee net investment income. Apollo Investment did not pay or incur any net investment income based incentive fees during the period April 8, 2004 (commencement of operations) through March 31, 2005.
 
The second part of the incentive fee is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Investment Advisory and Management Agreement, as of the termination date), commenced on December 31, 2004, and will equal 20.0% of our realized capital gains for each calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation and incorporating unrealized depreciation on a gross investment-by-investment basis at the end of such year. Capital gains with respect to any investment will equal the difference between the proceeds from the sale of such investment and the accreted or amortized cost basis of such investment.
 
For the period April 8, 2004 (commencement of operations) through March 31, 2005, the Investment Adviser received $17,315,026 in base investment advisory and management fees from Apollo Investment.
 
Apollo Investment has also entered into an Administration Agreement with Apollo Investment Administration, LLC (the "Administrator") under which the Administrator provides administrative services for Apollo Investment. For providing these services, facilities and personnel, Apollo Investment reimburses the Administrator for Apollo Investment's allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by Apollo Administration in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent and Apollo Investment's allocable portion of its chief compliance officer and chief financial officer and their respective staffs. The Administrator will also provide on Apollo Investment's behalf managerial assistance to these portfolio companies to which Apollo Investment is required to provide such assistance.
 
For the period April 8, 2004 (commencement of operations) through March 31, 2005, the Administrator was reimbursed $673,600 from Apollo Investment of the $987,500 of expenses accrued under the Administration Agreement.
 
Note 4. Organizational and Offering Expenses
 
A portion of the net proceeds of our initial public offering of 62,000,000 shares of common stock was used for organizational and offering expenses of $252,311 and $1,722,560, respectively. Organizational expenses were expensed as incurred. Offering expenses have been charged against paid-in capital in excess of par. All organizational and offering expenses were borne by Apollo Investment.
 
Note 5. Net Asset Value Per Share
 
At March 31, 2005, the Company's total net assets and net asset value per share were $892,885,683 and $14.27, respectively.

Credit FacilityEntry into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
On April 14, 2005, Apollo Investment entered into a Senior Secured Revolving Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement"), among Apollo Investment, the lenders party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. ("JPMorgan"), as administrative agent for the lenders.
 
Under the Credit Agreement, the lenders have agreed to extend credit to Apollo Investment in an initial aggregate principal or face amount not exceeding $800 million at any one time outstanding. The Credit Agreement is a five-year revolving facility (with a stated maturity date of April 14, 2010) and is secured by substantially all of the assets in Apollo Investment's portfolio, including cash and cash equivalents. Pricing is set at 100 basis points over LIBOR. The Credit Agreement contains affirmative and restrictive covenants, including: (a) periodic financial reporting requirements, (b) maintaining minimum shareholders' equity of the greater of (i) 40% of the total assets of Apollo Investment and its subsidiaries as at the last day of any fiscal quarter and (ii) the sum of (A) $300 million plus (B) 25% of the net proceeds from the sale of equity interests in Apollo Investment after the closing date of the Credit Agreement, (c) maintaining a ratio of total assets (less total liabilities) to total indebtedness, in each case of Apollo Investment and its subsidiaries, of not less than 2.0:1.0, (d) maintaining minimum liquidity, (e) limitations on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, (f) limitations on liens, (g) limitations on investments (other than in the ordinary course of Apollo Investment's business), (h) limitations on mergers and disposition of assets (other than in the normal course of Apollo Investment's business activities) and (i) limitations on the creation or existence of agreements that prohibit liens on properties of Apollo Investment's subsidiaries. In addition to the asset coverage ratio described in clause (c) of the preceding sentence, borrowings under the Credit Agreement (and the incurrence of certain other permitted debt) will be subject to compliance with a borrowing base that will apply different advance rates to different types of assets in Apollo Investment's portfolio. The Credit Agreement will provide for the ability of Apollo Investment to seek additional commitments from lenders thereunder in an aggregate amount of up to $400 million. Apollo Investment has not yet borrowed any amounts under the Credit Agreement.
 
The Credit Agreement will be used to supplement Apollo Investment's equity capital to make additional portfolio investments. Apollo Investment has employed a significant portion of its equity capital and expects to begin using the Credit Agreement in the coming months to support additions to the portfolio.
 
From time to time, certain of the lenders provide customary commercial and investment banking services to affiliates of Apollo Investment. JPMorgan also serves as custodian for Apollo Investment pursuant to a global custody agreement.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Borrower shall fail to pay any principal of any Loan when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration, by mandatory prepayment or otherwise), the unpaid portion of such Loan shall, if such Loan is not denominated in Dollars, automatically be redenominated in Dollars on the due date thereof (or, if such due date is a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor, on the last day of such Interest Period) in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent thereof on the date of such redenomination and such principal shall be payable on demand; and if the Borrower shall fail to pay any interest on any Loan that is not denominated in Dollars, such interest shall automatically be redenominated in Dollars on the due date therefor (or, if such due date is a day other than the last day of the Interest
 
 
Period therefor, on the last day of such Interest Period) in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent thereof on the date of such redenomination and such interest shall be payable on demand.
(b) . If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees of a Class then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, to pay interest and fees of such Class then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees of such Class then due to such parties, and (ii) second, to pay principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements of such Class then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements of such Class then due to such parties.
Application of Insufficient Payments
(c) . Except to the extent otherwise provided herein: (i) each Syndicated Borrowing of a Class shall be made from the Lenders of such Class, each payment of commitment fee under Section 2.11 shall be made for account of the Lenders of the applicable Class, and each termination or reduction of the amount of the Commitments of a Class under Section 2.08 shall be applied to the respective Commitments of the Lenders of such Class, pro rata according to the amounts of their respective Commitments of such Class; (ii) each Syndicated Borrowing of a Class shall be allocated pro rata among the Lenders of such Class according to the amounts of their respective Commitments of such Class (in the case of the making of Syndicated Loans) or their respective Loans of such Class that are to be included in such Borrowing (in the case of conversions and continuations of Loans); (iii) each payment or prepayment of principal of Syndicated Loans of a Class by the Borrower shall be made for account of the Lenders of such Class pro rata in accordance with the respective unpaid principal amounts of the Syndicated Loans of such Class held by them; and (iv) each payment of interest on Syndicated Loans of a Class by the Borrower shall be made for account of the Lenders of such Class pro rata in accordance with the amounts of interest on such Loans of such Class then due and payable to the respective Lenders.
Pro Rata Treatment
(d) . If any Lender of any Class shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Syndicated Loans, or participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans, of such Class resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Syndicated Loans, and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, and accrued interest thereon of such Class then due than the proportion received by any other Lender of such Class, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Syndicated Loans, and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, of other Lenders of such Class to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders of such Class ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their
Sharing of Payments by Lenders
 
 
respective Syndicated Loans, and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, of such Class; that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.
provided
(e) . Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for account of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or the Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Effective Rate.
Presumptions of Payment
(f) . If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.04(c), 2.05(e), 2.06(b) or 2.17(e), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.

Designation of a Different Lending Office
 
 
judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.14 or 2.16, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any cost or expense not required to be reimbursed by the Borrower and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.
(b) . If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16, or if any Lender defaults in its obligation to fund Loans hereunder, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); that (i) the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent (and, if a Commitment is being assigned, the Issuing Bank and the Swingline Lender), which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.14 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.16, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.

The Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent hereunder.
The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise in writing by the Required Lenders, and (c) except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by the bank serving as Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders or in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower or a Lender, and the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other

Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, with the consent of the Borrower not to be unreasonably withheld (or, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing in consultation with the Borrower), to appoint a successor. If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent's resignation shall nonetheless become effective and (1) the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and (2) the Required Lenders shall perform the duties of the Administrative Agent (and all payments and communications provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender directly) until such time as the Required Lenders appoint a successor agent as provided for above in this paragraph.

by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring (or retired) Administrative Agent and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder (if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this paragraph).

After the Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 9.03 shall continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as Administrative Agent.
Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.

All distributions made by the Collateral Agent pursuant to this Section shall be final (subject to any decree of any court of competent jurisdiction), and the Collateral Agent shall have no duty to inquire as to the application by the other Secured Parties of any amounts distributed to them.

The documents listed in paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) above are herein collectively called the "", and the documents listed in paragraphs (a) through (d) above are herein collectively called the "".
Security Documents
Loan Documents
In our examination, we have assumed the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals and the conformity with authentic original documents of all documents submitted to us as copies. When relevant facts were not independently established, we have relied upon representations made in or pursuant to the Loan Documents.
In our examination, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals and the conformity with authentic original documents of all documents submitted to us as copies. When relevant facts were not independently established, we have relied upon representations made in or pursuant to the Loan Documents. We have also assumed that each of the Loan Documents has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by, and (except, to the extent set forth below, as to the Borrower) constitutes a legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligation of, all of the parties thereto, that all signatories thereto have been duly authorized and that all such parties are duly organized and validly existing and have the power and authority (corporate or other) to execute, deliver and perform the same.
Based upon and subject to the foregoing and subject also to the comments and qualifications set forth below, and having considered such questions of law as we have deemed necessary as a basis for the opinions expressed below, we are of the opinion that:
(1) Each of the Loan Documents constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Borrower, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, moratorium or other similar laws relating to or affecting the rights of creditors generally, and except as the enforceability of the Loan Documents is subject to the application of general principles of equity (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law), including without limitation (a) the possible unavailability of specific performance, injunctive relief or any other equitable remedy and (b) concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing.
(2) The Guarantee and Security Agreement is effective to create, in favor of the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties (as defined in the Guarantee and Security Agreement), a valid security interest under the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in New York (the "") in the Collateral as defined therein, provided that (a) such security interest will continue in such Collateral after disposition thereof and in any proceeds (as defined in 9102(a)(64) of the UCC) thereof only to the extent provided in 9-315 of the UCC, and (b) such security interest in any portion of such Collateral in which the Borrower acquires rights after the commencement of a case under the Bankruptcy Code in respect of the Borrower may be limited by Section 552 of the Bankruptcy Code.
UCC
 
 
(3) The security interest created by the Guarantee and Security Agreement in that portion of the Collateral consisting of accounts, general intangibles, investment property and tangible chattel paper, as such terms are defined in the UCC, will be perfected by the filing of the Financing Statement in the Office of the Secretary of State of Maryland.
The foregoing opinions are also subject to the following comments and qualifications:
(A) The enforceability of provisions in the Credit Agreement to the effect that terms may not be waived or modified except in writing may be limited under certain circumstances.
(B) The enforceability of Section 9.03(b) of the Credit Agreement may be limited by laws limiting the enforceability of provisions exculpating or exempting a party from, or requiring indemnification of a party for, liability for its own action or inaction, to the extent the action or inaction involves gross negligence, recklessness, wilful misconduct or unlawful conduct.
(C) We express no opinion as to (i) the last sentence of Section 2.17(d) of the Credit Agreement, (ii) the first sentence of Section 9.09(b) of the Credit Agreement or any comparable provision of any of the other Loan Documents insofar as such sentence relates to the subject-matter jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York to adjudicate any controversy related to the Credit Agreement, (iii) the waiver of inconvenient forum set forth in Section 9.09(c) of the Credit Agreement or any comparable provision of any of the other Loan Documents with respect to proceedings in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York or (iv) Section 3.07 or 3.09 of the Guarantee and Security Agreement.
(D) We wish to point out that the obligations of the Borrower, and the rights and remedies of the Secured Parties, under each of the Security Documents may be subject to possible limitations upon the exercise of remedial or procedural provisions contained therein, provided that such limitations do not, in our opinion (but subject to the other comments and qualifications set forth in this opinion letter), make the remedies and procedures that will be afforded to the Collateral Agent inadequate for the practical realization of the substantive benefits purported to be provided by such Security Document.
(E) We express no opinion as to the existence of, or the right, title or interest of the Borrower in, to or under, any of the Collateral as defined in any of the Security Documents, and except as expressly provided in paragraphs (2) and (3) above, we express no opinion as to the creation, perfection, effect of perfection or non-perfection, or priority of any security interest in any of such Collateral.

Portfolio and Investment Activity
During our second fiscal year ended March 31, 2006, we invested $1.1 billion across 26 new and 10 existing portfolio companies. This compares to investing $894.3 million in 37 portfolio companies for the previous fiscal year ended March 31, 2005. Investments sold or prepaid during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 totaled $452.3
million versus $71.7 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005. Of the $452.3 million in net proceeds realized during fiscal 2006, $307.6 million were investment sales of senior loans and lower yielding corporate notes as we executed our second year plan of rationalizing our portfolio. The remaining $144.7 million were pre-payments by some of our successful portfolio companies.
At March 31, 2006, our net portfolio consisted of 46 portfolio companies and was invested 60% in subordinated debt, 2% in preferred equity, 7% in common equity and 31% in senior secured loans versus 35 portfolio companies invested 51% in subordinated debt, 3% in common equity, 42% in senior secured loans, and 4% in cash equivalents at March 31, 2005. The average portfolio company investment size increased to $34 million at March 31, 2006 from $24 million a year earlier.
The weighted average yields on our subordinated debt portfolio, senior secured loan portfolio and total debt portfolio were 13.6%, 12.2% and 13.1%, respectively, at March 31, 2006 versus 13.4%, 11.3% and 12.6%, respectively, at December 31, 2005 and 13.7%, 8.2% and 10.5%, respectively, at March 31, 2005.
Activity continued to be strong during the quarter as our relationships and scale afforded us the opportunity to invest in larger middle market companies. Accordingly, investments totaled $266 million as we added six new portfolio companies and added to one of our existing positions during the quarter. Our average debt investment for the quarter exceeded $40 million. The quarter also saw us invest with both new and existing equity sponsor relationships as our client service model continues to generate investment opportunities both inside and outside the United States. Investment sales and prepayments during the quarter totaled $91 million and generated $1.6 million in net realized gains. We also realized net foreign currency losses of $1.3 million as we rolled our forward currency hedge for another three months.
On March 22, 2006, we raised $294 million, net of underwriting commissions and expenses in a follow-on stock offering in which the company sold 17,250,000 shares (including the underwriters' over-allotment) at $17.85 per share. In addition, on March 31, 2006 we amended and restated our multi-currency credit facility increasing total commitments to $1,250,000,000 from $900,000,000 and extending the maturity an additional year through April 2011. The interest rate applicable to borrowings remains at LIBOR plus 100 basis points. As of March 31, 2006, we had $324 million drawn and $926 million available to us. We expect this substantial debt capital resource to afford us significant liquidity and flexibility to invest during fiscal 2007.
"Our reputation for providing credible and consistent capital continues to attract new clients and expand overall deal flow," said John J. Hannan, Chief Executive Officer. "In a competitive marketplace, our execution is constructive to middle market sponsors and has afforded us both new and repeat client business in every quarter this year. Through March 31, 2006, the performance of our overall investment portfolio continues to be strong as we've generated an IRR exceeding 23% on our $2.0 billion of invested capital since inception. We look forward to delivering continued strong investment returns to our shareholders."
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Investment Income
For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 and for the period April 8, 2004 (commencement of operations) through March 31, 2005, gross investment income totaled $152.8 million and $47.8 million, respectively. Our significantly lower gross investment income for the period April 8, 2004 (commencement of operations) through March 31, 2005 reflects income earned primarily from short-term U.S. Government securities and other temporary investments held during the ramp-up period of our portfolio. Accordingly, the increase in gross investment income for fiscal year 2006 was primarily due to the growth of our investment portfolio as compared to the previous fiscal year where we were investing the IPO net proceeds over the course of such year. Origination, closing and/or commitment fees associated with investments in portfolio companies are accreted into interest income over the respective terms of the applicable loans.
Expenses
Expenses totaled $63.7 million and $22.4 million, respectively, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 and for the period April 8, 2004 (commencement of operations) through March 31, 2005, of which $22.3 million and $0.0 million, respectively, were performance-based incentive fees and $13.0 million and $0.0 million, respectively, were
interest and other credit facility expenses. Expenses net of performance-based incentive fees and interest and other credit facility expenses for the year ended March 31, 2006 and for the period April 8, 2004 (commencement of operations) through March 31, 2005 were $28.5 million and $22.4 million, respectively. Of these expenses, general and administrative expenses totaled $5.1 million and $5.1 million, respectively, for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2006 and 2005. Expenses consist of base investment advisory and management fees, insurance expenses, administrative services fees, professional fees, directors' fees, audit and tax services expenses, and other general and administrative expenses. The increase in expenses net of performance-based incentive fees and interest and other credit facility expenses was primarily due to the increase in base management fees related to the growth of our investment portfolio as compared to the prior period.
Net Investment Income
The Company's net investment income totaled $89.1 million and $25.5 million or $1.41 per share and $0.41 per share, respectively, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 and for the period April 8, 2004 (commencement of operations) through March 31, 2005.
Net Realized Gains/Losses
The Company had investment sales and repayments totaling $452.3 million and $71.7 million, respectively, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 and for the period April 8, 2004 (commencement of operations) through March 31, 2005. Total net realized gains for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 and for the period April 8, 2004 (commencement of operations) through March 31, 2005 were $11.2 million and $0.5 million, respectively.
Net Unrealized Appreciation on Investments and Foreign Currency Contracts and Translations
For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 and for the period April 8, 2004 (commencement of operations) through March 31, 2005, the Company's investments, foreign currencies and other assets and liabilities had a net increase in appreciation of $20.1 million and $18.2 million, respectively. At March 31, 2006, net unrealized appreciation totaled $38.3 million of which $4.1 million was attributable to net unrealized appreciation on our bank debt/senior secured debt and $34.2 million was attributable to net unrealized appreciation on our subordinated debt and private equity (after considering the effects of foreign currency borrowing/hedging for our non-U.S. investments).
Net Increase in Net Assets From Operations
For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 and for the period April 8, 2004 (commencement of operations) through March 31, 2005, the Company had a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of $120.4 million and $44.1 million, respectively. The net change in net assets from operations per share was $1.90 and $0.71, respectively, for the year ended March 31, 2006 and for the period April 8, 2004 (commencement of operations) through March 31, 2005.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
The Company's liquidity and capital resources are generated primarily through its senior secured, multi-currency $1.25 billion, five-year credit facility maturing on April 13, 2011 as well as from cash flows from operations, including investment sales and prepayments of senior and subordinated loans and income earned from investments and cash equivalents (which normally are comprised of U.S. government securities and other high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less). At March 31, 2006, the Company had $324 million in borrowings outstanding and $926 million available for its use. In the future, the Company may raise additional equity capital off its shelf registration or may securitize a portion of its investments. It may also further access $750 million of additional credit commitments available under the terms of its current credit facility as the Company's equity capital base grows. The primary use of funds will be investments in portfolio companies, cash distributions to holders of common stock and for other general corporate purposes.
On March 22, 2006, we raised $294 million, net of underwriting commission and expenses in a follow-on stock offering in which the Company sold 17,250,000 shares (including the underwriters' over-allotment) at $17.85 per share. Net proceeds from the follow-on offering were primarily used to repay borrowings outstanding on the Company's revolving credit facility and for other general corporate purposes.
Dividends
Dividends paid to stockholders for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 and for the period April 8, 2004 (commencement of operations) through March 31, 2005 totaled $102.7 million or $1.63 per share versus $30.2 million or $0.485 per share. The following table summarizes our quarterly dividends paid to shareholders for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively:
 
Tax Information
For Federal tax purposes, the Company hereby designates for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006:
 
 
The percentage of ordinary income distributions paid during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 eligible for qualified dividend income treatment is 3.40%. The percentage of ordinary income distributions paid during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 eligible for the 70% dividends received deduction for corporate shareholders is 3.40%.
The tax characteristics of all dividends paid during each calendar year will be reported to shareholders on Form 1099 after the end of such calendar year.
We have elected to be taxed as a regulated investment company under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. In order to maintain our status as a regulated investment company, we are required to (1) distribute at least 90% of our investment company taxable income and (2) distribute at least 98% of our income (both ordinary income and net capital gains) to avoid an excise tax. We intend to make distributions to our stockholders on a quarterly basis of substantially all of our taxable net income. We also intend to make distributions of net realized capital gains, if any, at least annually.
We may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these distributions from time to time. In addition, we may be limited in our ability to make distributions due to the asset coverage test for borrowings when applicable to us as a business development company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and due to provisions in our credit facilities. If we do not distribute a certain percentage of our income annually, we will suffer adverse tax consequences, including possible loss of our status as a regulated investment company. We cannot assure stockholders that they will receive any distributions or distributions at a particular level.
Income from origination, structuring, closing, commitment and other upfront fees associated with investments in portfolio companies is treated as taxable income and accordingly, distributed to shareholders. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006, upfront fees totaling $5.8 million are being amortized into income over the lives of their respective loans. For the period from April 8, 2004 (commencement of operations) through March 31, 2005, upfront fees totaling $4.5 million are being amortized into income over the lives of their respective loans.

Portfolio and Investment Activity
During the three months ended June 30, 2006, we invested $286.8 million across 4 new and 5 existing portfolio companies. This compares to investing $250.3 million in 7 new and 4 existing portfolio companies for the three months ended June 30, 2005. Investment sales and pre-payments during the three months ended June 30, 2006 totaled $124.1 million versus $124.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2005. Of the $124.1 million in net proceeds realized during the quarter, $34.0 million were investment sales of senior loans. The remaining $90.1 million were pre-payments by some of our more successful portfolio companies.
At June 30, 2006, our net portfolio consisted of 48 portfolio companies and was invested 63% in subordinated debt, 3% in preferred equity, 9% in common equity and 25% in senior secured loans versus 36 portfolio companies invested 48% in subordinated debt, 2% in common equity, 46% in senior secured loans, and 4% in cash equivalents at June 30, 2005. Our targeted investment size typically ranges between $20 million and $150 million, although this investment size may vary proportionately as the size of our capital base changes.
The weighted average yields on our subordinated debt portfolio, senior secured loan portfolio and total debt portfolio were 13.6%, 12.7% and 13.3%, respectively, at June 30, 2006 versus 13.6%, 10.0% and 11.8%, respectively, at June 30, 2005.
"We are excited about today's market conditions as they have shown us increasingly better value," said John J. Hannan, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Apollo Investment Corporation is extremely well-positioned to take advantage of these trends with our strong balance sheet and growing investment team. In addition, our existing investment portfolio continues to perform well and we look forward to delivering continued strong investment returns and steady, stable and growing dividends to shareholders."
Results of Operations
Results comparisons are for the three months ended June 2006 and June 2005.
Investment Income
For the three months ended June 30, 2006 and June 30, 2005, gross investment income totaled $55.9 million and $37.8 million, respectively. The increase in investment income for the three months ended June 30, 2006 was primarily due to the continued growth and asset mix of our investment portfolio as compared to the year-ago period. Other notable events impacting investment income include a dividend of $4.9 million from a dividend recapitalization of LM Acquisition, Ltd. and a write-off of $0.6 million of accrued interest income on our senior secured position in Diam International. Diam International is now in non-accrual status. Origination, closing and/or commitment fees associated with investments in portfolio companies are accreted into interest income over the respective terms of the applicable loans.
Expenses
Expenses totaled $24.1 million and $12.5 million, respectively, for the three months ended June 30, 2006 and June 30, 2005. Of these totals, $7.9 million and $6.3 million, respectively, were performance-based incentive fees and $5.6 million and $0.5 million, respectively, were interest and other credit facility expenses. Expenses net of performance-based incentive fees, interest, and other credit facility expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2006 and June 30, 2005 were $10.6 million and $5.7 million, respectively. These net expenses consist of base investment advisory and management fees, insurance expenses, administrative services expenses, professional fees, directors' fees, audit and tax services expenses, and other general and administrative expenses. The increase in expenses was primarily due to an increase in base investment advisory and management fees resulting from the growth of our investment portfolio.
Net Investment Income
The Company's net investment income totaled $31.7 million and $25.2 million or $0.39 per share and $0.40 per share, respectively, for the three months ended June 30, 2006 and June 30, 2005.
Net Realized Gains/Losses
The Company had investment sales totaling $124.1 million and $124.5 million, respectively, for the three months ended June 30, 2006 and June 30, 2005. Total net realized losses for the three months ended June 30, 2006 were $3.0 million versus total net realized gains for the three months ended June 30, 2005 of $6.8 million. Of the $3.0 million net realized loss, $2.9 million of the loss was attributable to a currency hedge loss on the settlement of our forward Euro contract in June.
Net Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) on Investments and Foreign Currency Contracts and Translations
For the three months ended June 30, 2006 and June 30, 2005, the Company's investments, foreign currencies and other assets and liabilities had a net increase in appreciation of $42.4 million and a net decrease in appreciation of $18.5 million, respectively. At June 30, 2006, net unrealized appreciation totaled $80.7 million, of which $90.8 million was attributable to net unrealized appreciation on our subordinated debt and private equity (after considering the effects of foreign currency borrowing/hedging for our non-U.S. investments) and $10.1 million was attributable to net unrealized depreciation on our bank debt/senior secured debt.
Net Increase in Net Assets From Operations
For the three months ended June 30, 2006 and June 30, 2005, the Company had a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of $71.2 million and $13.6 million, respectively. The net change in net assets from operations per share was $0.88 and $0.22, respectively, for the three months ended June 30, 2006 and June 30, 2005.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
The Company's liquidity and capital resources are generated primarily through its senior secured, multi-currency $1.25 billion, five-year credit facility maturing in April 2011 as well as from cash flows from operations, including investment sales and prepayments of senior and subordinated loans and income earned from investments and cash equivalents (which normally comprise of U.S. government securities and other high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less). At June 30, 2006, the Company has $536 million in borrowings outstanding and $714 million available for its use. In the future, the Company may raise additional equity or debt capital off its shelf registration or may securitize a portion of its investments. It may also further access $750 million of additional credit commitments available under the terms of its current credit facility as the Company's equity capital base grows. The primary use of funds will be investments in portfolio companies, cash distributions to holders of common stock and for other general corporate purposes.
Dividends
Dividends paid to stockholders for the three months ended June 30, 2006 and June 30, 2005 totaled $36.5 million or $0.45 per share versus $19.4 million or $0.31 per share, respectively. Tax characteristics of all dividends will be reported to shareholders on Form 1099 after the end of the calendar year.
We have elected to be taxed as a regulated investment company under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. In order to maintain our status as a regulated investment company, we are required to (1) distribute at least 90% of our investment company taxable income and (2) distribute at least 98% of our income (both ordinary income and net capital gains) to avoid an excise tax. We intend to make distributions to our stockholders on a quarterly basis of substantially all of our taxable net investment income. We also intend to make distributions of net realized capital gains, if any, at least annually.
We may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these distributions from time to time. In addition, we may be limited in our ability to make distributions due to the asset coverage test for borrowings when applicable to us as a business development company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and due to provisions in our credit facilities. If we do not distribute a certain percentage of our income annually, we will suffer adverse tax consequences, including possible loss of our status as a regulated investment company. We cannot assure stockholders that they will receive any distributions or distributions at a particular level.
With respect to the dividends paid to shareholders, income from origination, structuring, closing, commitment and other upfront fees associated with investments in portfolio companies is treated as taxable income and accordingly, distributed to shareholders. For the three months ended June 30, 2006, upfront fees totaling $2.7 million are being amortized into income over the lives of their respective loans. For the three months ended June 30, 2005, upfront fees totaled $0.4 million.

The Company is now fully built and has a proven business that is firmly established. It is an opportune time for a change that allows me to pursue entrepreneurial opportunities."
"We appreciate Art's significant contributions to Apollo and wish him well in his future endeavors. I'm confident he will continue to find success," said Leon Black, founding partner of Apollo Management.
John Hannan also announced that Patrick Dalton and Edward Tam have been elected Executive Vice Presidents of Apollo Investment Corporation. Messrs. Dalton and Tam joined Apollo Investment Management in 2004 at its inception and currently lead a team responsible for sourcing transaction opportunities and overseeing portfolio development.
"Patrick and Ed have been important drivers of Apollo Investment Corporation's strong performance since its launch in 2004 and I am pleased to recognize that with these appointments," said John Hannan.
James Zelter joined Apollo Management in May 2006. From 1994 to 2006, he was with Citigroup and its predecessor companies, where he was responsible for the global expansion and strong financial performance of the Special Situations Investment Group, a proprietary investment group he founded within Citigroup's Fixed Income Division.
From 2003 to 2005, Mr. Zelter was Chief Investment Officer of Citigroup Alternative Investments, and prior to that he was responsible for the firm's global high yield leveraged finance business.
Patrick Dalton joined Apollo in 2004. Before joining Apollo, Mr. Dalton was a Vice President in Goldman Sachs & Co.'s Principal Investment Arena with a focus on mezzanine investing. Previously, from 1990 to 2000, Mr. Dalton was a Vice President at Chase Manhattan Bank, most recently in the Acquisitions Finance Department.
Edward Tam joined Apollo in 2004. Before joining Apollo, from 1991 to 1999, Mr. Tam was a member of the corporate finance group at Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette. In 1999, Mr. Tam joined DLJ Investment Partners, a mezzanine fund and was promoted to Director in 2002.

Our common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol "AINV". The last reported closing price for our common stock on January 11, 2007 was $22.44 per share.

Table of Contents
You should rely only on the information contained in this prospectus supplement and the accompanying base prospectus, which we refer to collectively as the "prospectus." We have not authorized anyone to provide you with additional information, or information different from that contained in this prospectus. If anyone provides you with different or additional information, you should not rely on it. We are offering to sell, and seeking offers to buy, securities only in jurisdictions where offers and sales are permitted. The information contained in this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus is accurate only as of the date of this prospectus supplement or such prospectus.

Table of Contents
 
 
Table of Contents
The following table is intended to assist you in understanding the costs and expenses that an investor in shares of our common stock will bear directly or indirectly. We caution you that some of the percentages indicated in the table below are estimates and may vary. Except where the context suggests otherwise, whenever this prospectus contains a reference to fees or expenses paid by "you," "us" or "Apollo Investment," or that "we" will pay fees or expenses, stockholders will indirectly bear such fees or expenses as investors in Apollo Investment.
 
 
The SEC requires that "Total Annual Expenses" be calculated as a percentage of net assets in the above chart rather than as a percentage of total assets. Total assets includes net assets as of September 30, 2006, anticipated net proceeds from this offering and assets that have been funded with borrowed monies (leverage). For reference, the below chart illustrates our "Total annual expenses" as a percentage of total assets:
 
 
Table of Contents
 
 
 
Example
The following example demonstrates the projected dollar amount of total cumulative expenses that would be incurred over various periods with respect to a hypothetical investment in our common stock. These dollar amounts are based upon payment by an investor of a 4.50% sales load (underwriting discounts and commissions) and the assumption that our annual operating expenses and leverage would remain at the levels set forth in the table above (other than performance-based incentive fees).
 
While the example assumes, as required by the SEC, a 5% annual return, our performance will vary and may result in a return greater or less than 5%. Assuming a 5% annual return, the incentive fee under the investment advisory and management agreement would not be earned or payable and is not included in the example. This illustration assumes that we will not realize any capital gains computed net of all realized capital losses and gross unrealized capital depreciation in any of the indicated time periods. If we achieve sufficient returns on our investments, including through the realization of capital gains, to trigger an incentive fee of a material amount, our expenses, and returns to our investors, would be higher. In addition, while the example assumes reinvestment of all dividends and distributions at net asset value, participants in our dividend reinvestment plan will receive a number of shares of our common stock, determined by dividing the total dollar amount of the dividend payable to a participant by the market price per share of our common stock at the close of trading on the valuation date for the dividend. See "Dividend Reinvestment Plan" in the accompanying prospectus for additional information regarding our dividend reinvestment plan.
This example and the expenses in the table above should not be considered a representation of our future expenses, and actual expenses may be greater or less than those shown.
 
Table of Contents
This summary highlights some of the information in this prospectus. It is not complete and may not contain all of the information that you may want to consider. You should read carefully the more detailed information set forth under "Risk Factors" and the other information included in this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus. In this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus, except where the context suggests otherwise, the terms "we," "us," "our," "Apollo Investment" and "the Company" refer to Apollo Investment Corporation; "Apollo Investment Management" or "investment adviser" refers to Apollo Investment Management, L.P.; "Apollo Administration" or "AIA" refers to Apollo Investment Administration, LLC; and "Apollo" refers to the affiliated companies of Apollo Investment Management, L.P.
Apollo Investment
Apollo Investment Corporation, a Maryland corporation, is a closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be treated as a business development company under the Investment Company Act of 1940. In addition, for tax purposes we have elected to be treated as a regulated investment company, or RIC, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Our investment objective is to generate both current income and capital appreciation through debt and equity investments. We intend to invest primarily in middle-market companies in the form of mezzanine and senior secured loans, as well as by making direct equity investments in such companies. From time to time, we may also invest in public companies whose securities are thinly traded.
Our portfolio is comprised primarily of investments in long-term subordinated loans, referred to as mezzanine loans, and senior secured loans of private middle-market companies, and from time to time include equity interests such as common stock, warrants or options. Our targeted investment typically ranges between $20 million and $150 million, although this investment size may vary proportionately as the size of our capital base changes. In this prospectus, we typically use the term "middle-market" to refer to companies with annual revenues between $50 million and $1 billion.
We believe that the size of the middle-market, coupled with the demands of these companies for flexible sources of capital, continue to create an attractive investment environment for Apollo Investment. We believe that traditional financing sources have de-emphasized their service and product offerings to middle-market businesses in recent years in favor of lending to large corporate clients and managing capital markets transactions. In addition, while many middle-market companies were formerly able to raise funds by issuing high-yield bonds, we believe this approach to financing has become more difficult as institutional investors have sought to invest in larger, more liquid offerings. As evidence of this trend, the average deal size in the high-yield market (including public and 144A debt (including add-ons)) has grown from approximately $164 million in 1997 to almost $452 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2006 and, in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2006, approximately 2% of the high-yield issues raised less than $100 million. Therefore, we believe that there is a continued opportunity to invest in mezzanine and senior secured loans of middle-market companies and that we are well positioned to serve this market.
Apollo Investment Management and its affiliates manage other funds that may have investment mandates that are similar, in whole or in part, with ours. Apollo Investment Management and its affiliates may determine that an investment is appropriate both for us and for one or more of those other funds. In such event, depending on the availability of such investment and other appropriate factors, Apollo Investment Management may determine that we should invest on a side-by-side basis with one or more other funds. We do not anticipate making an initial investment in any portfolio company in which Apollo or any affiliate has a pre-existing investment. We may make all such investments subject to compliance with applicable regulations and interpretations, and our allocation procedures. Certain types of negotiated co-investments may be made only if we receive an order from the SEC permitting us to do so. There can be no assurance that any such order will be obtained.
 
Table of Contents
At September 30, 2006, our net portfolio consisted of 51 portfolio companies with a fair value of $2.0 billion and was invested 64% in subordinated debt, 3% in preferred equity, 8% in common equity and 25% in senior secured loans versus 39 portfolio companies invested 57% in subordinated debt, 5% in common equity and 38% in senior secured loans at September 30, 2005. As of September 30, 2006, our average investment size was approximately $40 million.
The weighted average yields on our subordinated debt portfolio, senior secured loan portfolio and total debt portfolio were 13.5%, 12.8% and 13.3%, respectively, at September 30, 2006. Yields are computed using interest rates as of the balance sheet date and include amortization of loan origination fees, original issue discount and market premium or discount, weighted by their respective costs when averaged.
While our primary focus is to generate both current income and capital appreciation through investments in loans, we may invest a portion of the portfolio in opportunistic investments in order to seek to enhance returns to stockholders. Such investments may include investments in high-yield bonds, distressed debt, foreign securities, private equity or securities of public companies that are not thinly traded. We expect that these public companies generally will have debt securities that are not investment grade.
About Apollo
Founded in 1990, Apollo is a recognized leader in private equity investing, having invested more than $13 billion in over 150 companies since its founding. Since its inception, Apollo has raised in excess of $25 billion in capital, primarily from institutional investors. Apollo traditionally has focused on companies that it believes are undervalued yet have successful business models, strong cash flows and prospects for value creation. The Apollo investment professionals' disciplined, value-oriented strategy has sought to identify opportunities in all investment environments, selecting from a range of approaches, such as traditional or corporate partner buyouts, distressed debt buyouts or more liquid, non-control distressed debt investments. The Apollo investment professionals have sought through this strategy to provide investors with attractive returns while minimizing the risk of capital loss throughout economic cycles.
Apollo's active private investment funds focus on making either control-oriented equity investments of $200 million or more or distressed debt investments, either for control or non-control positions. In contrast, we seek to capitalize on the significant investment opportunities emerging in the mezzanine segment of the lending market for middle-market companies, which we believe offers the potential for attractive risk-adjusted returns.
About Apollo Investment Management
Apollo Investment Management, our investment adviser, is led by a dedicated team of 13 investment professionals and is further supported by Apollo's team of over 60 investment professionals. This team has invested approximately $2.8 billion in 73 companies in transactions with 54 different financial sponsors since commencement of operations in April 2004. In addition, Apollo Investment Management expects to hire additional investment professionals in the future. Apollo Investment Management's investment committee currently consists of John J. Hannan, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and a managing partner of Apollo Investment Management; James Zelter, our President and Chief Operating Officer and a managing partner of Apollo's capital markets business, which includes Apollo Investment Management; Patrick J. Dalton, our Executive Vice President and a partner of Apollo Investment Management; Edward Tam, our Executive Vice President and a partner of Apollo Investment Management and Jose Briones, a partner of Apollo Investment Management. The composition of the investment committee of Apollo Investment Management may change from time to time.
Apollo Investment Management draws upon Apollo's 16-year history and benefits from the Apollo investment professionals' significant capital markets, trading and research expertise developed through investments in 23 different industries and over 150 companies in the United States and Western Europe.

On October 25, 2006, the SEC adopted certain changes to the definition of "eligible portfolio companies" under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. In light of the SEC's rule change, the risk factor included in the accompanying prospectus entitled "Our ability to invest in private companies may be limited in certain circumstances" no longer applies to the Company.
On November 2, 2006, John J. Suydam was elected Chief Legal Officer and Vice President of the Company.
On November 30, 2006, we announced that James Zelter, a member of the investment committee of Apollo Investment Management, was elected President and Chief Operating Officer of the Company, succeeding Arthur Penn. Arthur Penn, our former President and Chief Operating Officer, resigned from the Company, effective on November 30, 2006. Also, on November 30, 2006, we announced that Patrick Dalton and Edward Tam were elected Executive Vice Presidents of the Company.
On December 7, 2006, we announced that our Board of Directors had declared its third fiscal quarter dividend of $0.50 per share, which was payable on December 28, 2006 to shareholders of record as of December 21, 2006.
On December 29, 2006, we announced that Martin E. Franklin resigned from our Board of Directors as a result of the conflict created by his recent election as Chairman of the Board of Directors of Freedom Acquisitions Holding, Inc., a special purpose acquisition company. Mr. Franklin served as chairman of the Audit Committee of our Board and as a member of our Board's Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee prior to his resignation.
 
Table of Contents
We estimate that the net proceeds from the sale of the 18,000,000 shares of our common stock that we are offering, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated expenses of this offering payable by us, will be approximately $385.1 million (or $442.9 million, if the over-allotment is exercised in full), based upon a public offering price of $22.44 per share. We expect to use the net proceeds from selling shares of our common stock to repay indebtedness owed under our senior credit facility, to make investments in portfolio companies in accordance with our investment objective and for general corporate purposes.
At September 30, 2006, we had approximately $660 million outstanding under our senior credit facility. Our senior credit facility matures on April 13, 2011 and bears interest at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 100 basis points on the outstanding balance. Borrowings under our senior credit facility were used to fund investments in portfolio companies and for general corporate purposes. Amounts repaid under our senior credit facility will remain available for future borrowings.

Our common stock is quoted on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol "AINV". The following table lists the high and low closing prices for our common stock, the closing price as a percentage of net asset value, or NAV, and quarterly dividends per share since our initial public offering in April 2004. On January 11, 2007, the last reported closing price of our common stock was $22.44 per share.
 
Our common stock continues to trade in excess of our net asset value. There can be no assurance, however, that our shares will continue to trade above, below or at our net asset value.
We intend to pay quarterly dividends to our common stockholders. The amount of our quarterly dividend is determined by our Board of Directors. There can be no assurance that we will achieve investment results or maintain a tax status that will permit any particular level of dividend payment. Our senior credit facility limits our ability to declare dividends if we default under certain provisions. For a description of the senior credit facility, see "Interim Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsLiquidity and Capital Resources" in this prospectus supplement.

OVERVIEW
Apollo Investment was incorporated under the Maryland General Corporation Law in February 2004. We have elected to be treated as a business development company under the 1940 Act. As such, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. For instance, we generally have to invest at least 70% of our total assets in "qualifying assets," including securities of private or thinly traded public U.S. companies, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less. In addition, for federal income tax purposes we have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Pursuant to this election and assuming we qualify as a RIC, we generally do not have to pay corporate-level federal income taxes on any income we distribute to our stockholders. On April 8, 2004, we completed our initial public offering and commenced operations on April 8, 2004 upon receipt of $870 million in net proceeds from our initial public offering of common stock. On March 22, 2006, the Company closed on its second public offering and sold 17,250,000 shares of its common stock at a price of $17.85 per share, receiving $294 million in total net proceeds from the offering.
Investments
Our level of investment activity can and does vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt and equity capital available to middle-market companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity for such companies, the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make. Over the last twenty-four months, we believe that the availability of senior debt capital from banks for middle-market companies has generally increased and has put downward pressure on interest rate spreads at the same time that base interest rates have risen. We do not expect this increased availability of capital to impair our ability to make longer-term investment allocations with our capital.
As a business development company, we must not acquire any assets other than "qualifying assets" specified in the 1940 Act unless, at the time the acquisition is made, at least 70% of our total assets are qualifying assets (with certain limited exceptions). Qualifying assets include investments in "eligible portfolio companies." The SEC recently adopted new rules under the 1940 Act to expand the definition of "eligible portfolio company" to include all private companies and companies whose securities are not listed on a national securities exchange. The new rules also will permit us to include as qualifying assets certain follow-on investments in companies that were eligible portfolio companies at the time of initial investment but that no longer meet the definition. The new rules became effective November 30, 2006. We are no longer required to determine the eligibility of a portfolio company by reference to whether or not it has outstanding margin securities.
In addition to the adoption of the rules described above, the SEC also proposed for comment a rule that would include as eligible portfolio companies certain public companies that have listed their securities on a national securities exchange, as long as their public float and/or market capitalization are below a specified level. We will continue to monitor closely any developments with respect to the definition of eligible portfolio company, and intend to adjust our investment focus as needed to comply with and/or take advantage of the new rules as well as any other regulatory, legislative, administrative or judicial actions in this area.
Revenue
We generate revenue primarily in the form of interest income from the debt securities we hold and capital gains, if any, on investment securities that we may acquire in portfolio companies. Our debt investments, whether in the form of mezzanine or senior secured loans, generally have a stated term of five to ten years and bear interest at a fixed rate or a floating rate usually determined on the basis of a benchmark: LIBOR, EURIBOR, GBP LIBOR, or the prime rate. While U.S. subordinated debt and corporate notes typically accrue interest at
 
Table of Contents
fixed rates, some of these investments may include zero coupon, payment-in-kind ("PIK") and/or step bonds that accrue income on a constant yield to call or maturity basis. Interest on debt securities is generally payable quarterly or semiannually. In some cases, some of our investments provide for deferred interest payments or PIK. The principal amount of the debt securities and any accrued but unpaid interest generally becomes due at the maturity date. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of dividends paid to us on equity investments as well as revenue in the form of commitment, origination, structuring and/or diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and, if applicable, consulting fees, etc.
Expenses
All investment professionals of the investment adviser and their staff, when and to the extent engaged in providing investment advisory and management services to us, and the compensation and routine overhead expenses of that personnel which is allocable to those services are provided and paid for by Apollo Investment Management. We bear all other costs and expenses of our operations and transactions, including those relating to:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
We expect our general and administrative operating expenses related to our ongoing operations to remain generally stable or decline slightly as a percentage of our total assets in future periods. Incentive fees, interest expense and costs relating to future offerings of securities, among others, would be additive.

Portfolio and Investment Activity
During the quarter ended September 30, 2006, middle market activity remained robust as we continued to identify investment opportunities that met or exceeded our risk-reward standards. Strong originations and refinancings on some of our existing portfolio companies drove an active investment quarter. Investments totaled $493.8 million across 6 new and 6 existing portfolio companies during the three months ended September 30, 2006. This compares to investing $332.9 million in 8 new and 3 existing portfolio companies for the three months ended September 30, 2005. Investment sales and pre-payment proceeds totaled $287.3 million during the quarter versus $134.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2005. The prepayment of N.E.W. Customer Service Companies in August generated an additional $28.1 million of gains on this investment. In addition, we also received a 19.1 million distribution on our 20 million investment from the recapitalization of Prysmian Cables & Systems (through our investment in GS Prysmian Co-Invest LP).
At September 30, 2006, our net portfolio consisted of 51 portfolio companies and was invested 64% in subordinated debt, 3% in preferred equity, 8% in common equity and 25% in senior secured loans versus 39 portfolio companies invested 57% in subordinated debt, 5% in common equity and 38% in senior secured loans at September 30, 2005. Our targeted investment size typically ranges between $20 million and $150 million, although this investment size may vary proportionately as the size of our capital base changes.
The weighted average yields on our subordinated debt portfolio, senior secured loan portfolio and total debt portfolio were 13.5%, 12.8% and 13.3%, respectively, at September 30, 2006 versus 13.4%, 10.4% and 12.2%, respectively, at September 30, 2005.
Senior secured loans and European mezzanine loans typically accrue interest at variable rates determined on the basis of a benchmark: LIBOR, EURIBOR, GBP LIBOR, or the prime rate, with stated maturities at origination that typically range from 5 to 10 years. While subordinated debt issued within the United States will typically accrue interest at fixed rates, some of these investments may include zero-coupon, PIK and/or step bonds that accrue income on a constant yield to call or maturity basis. At September 30, 2006, 57% or $1,071.6 million of our interest-bearing portfolio is fixed rate debt and 43% or $808.1 million is floating rate debt.
Critical Accounting Policies
Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ materially. In addition to the discussion below, our critical accounting policies are further described in the notes to the financial statements.
Valuation of Portfolio Investments
As a business development company, we generally invest in illiquid securities including debt and equity securities of middle-market companies. Under procedures established by our board of directors, we value investments, including certain subordinated debt, senior secured debt and other debt securities with maturities greater than 60 days, for which market quotations are readily available, at such market quotations. We obtain these market values from an independent pricing service or at the mean between the bid and ask prices obtained from at least two brokers or dealers (if available, otherwise by a principal market maker or a primary market dealer). Debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded or whose market prices are not readily available are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of our board of directors. Such determination of fair values may involve subjective judgments and estimates. Investments purchased within 60 days of maturity are valued at cost plus accreted discount, or minus amortized premium, which approximates
 
Table of Contents
value. With respect to unquoted securities, our board of directors, together with our independent valuation adviser, values each investment considering, among other measures, discounted cash flow models, comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public and other factors. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, our board will use the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate and/or assist us in our valuation. Because we expect that there will not be a readily available market for many of the investments in our portfolio, we expect to value many of our portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of our board of directors using a documented valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value existed for such investments, and the differences could be material.
With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, our board of directors has approved a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below:
 
 
 
 
 
In September, 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") 157, Fair Value Measurements, which clarifies the definition of fair value and requires companies to expand their disclosure about the use of fair value to measure assets and liabilities in interim and annual periods subsequent to initial recognition. Adoption of SFAS 157 requires the use of the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. At this time, the Company is in the process of reviewing the Standard against its current valuation policies to determine future applicability.
Revenue Recognition
We record interest income on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. For loans and debt securities with contractual PIK interest, which represents contractual interest accrued and added to the loan balance that generally becomes due at maturity, we will not accrue PIK interest if the portfolio company valuation indicates that the PIK interest is not collectible. We do not accrue as a receivable interest on loans and debt securities if we have reason to doubt our ability to collect such interest. Loan origination fees, original issue discount, and market discount are capitalized and then we amortize such amounts as interest income. Upon the prepayment of a loan or debt security, any unamortized loan origination fees are recorded as interest income. We record prepayment premiums on loans and debt securities as interest income when we receive such amounts.
Net Realized Gains or Losses and Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation or Depreciation
We measure realized gains or losses by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment, without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation
 
Table of Contents
previously recognized, but considering unamortized upfront fees and prepayment penalties. Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflects the change in portfolio investment values during the reporting period, including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation, when gains or losses are realized.
Within the context of these critical accounting policies, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported.
Results of Operations
Results comparisons are for the three and six months ended September 2006 and September 2005.
Investment Income
Gross investment income totaled $63.9 million and $119.8 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended September 30, 2006 compared to $35.0 million and $72.8 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended September 30, 2005. The increase in investment income for the three and six months ended September 30, 2006 was primarily due to the continued growth and asset mix of our investment portfolio as compared to the year-ago period. Notable events impacting investment income in the current period include dividend income of $2.7 million from GS Prysmian Co-Invest L.P. and $1.4 million from Sorenson Communications, Inc. Origination, closing and/or commitment fees associated with investments in portfolio companies are accreted into interest income over the respective terms of the applicable loans.
Expenses
Net expenses totaled $30.1 million and $54.2 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended September 30, 2006 versus $14.3 million and $26.9 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended September 30, 2005. Of these totals, for the three and six months ended September 30, 2006, $10.8 million and $18.7 million, respectively, were performance-based incentive fees and $8.2 million and $13.8 million, respectively, were interest and other credit facility expenses. This compares to $5.2 million and $11.5 million in performance-based incentive fees and $2.3 million and $2.8 million in interest and other credit facility expenses for the three and six months ended September 30, 2005. Expenses net of performance-based incentive fees, interest, and other credit facility expenses for the three months and six months ended September 30, 2006 were $11.1 million and $21.7 million, respectively, versus $6.8 million and $12.6 million for the three and six months ended September 30, 2005. These net expenses consist of base investment advisory and management fees, insurance expenses, administrative services expenses, professional fees, directors' fees, audit and tax services expenses, and other general and administrative expenses. The increase in expenses was driven primarily by an increase in base investment advisory and management fees resulting from the growth of our investment portfolio as well as from an accrual of $1.9 million in net realized gain incentive fees.
Net Investment Income
The Company's net investment income totaled $33.8 million and $65.6 million or $0.41 per share and $0.81 per share, respectively, for the three and six months ended September 30, 2006. For the three and six months ended September 30, 2005, the Company's net investment income totaled $20.7 million and $45.9 million or $0.33 per share and $0.73 per share, respectively.
Net Realized Gains/Losses
The Company had investment sales totaling $287.3 million and $411.4 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended September 30, 2006 versus $134.2 million and $258.7 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended September 30, 2005. Total net realized gains for the three and six months ended September 30, 2006 were $29.7 million and $26.7 million, respectively, versus total net realized losses and gains, respectively, for the three and six months ended September 30, 2005 of $0.6 million and $6.2 million. Realized gains were derived primarily from the prepayment of our investment in N.E.W. Customer Service Companies
 
Table of Contents
which contributed $28.1 million to net realized gains for the quarter ended September 30, 2006. Included in the
total net realized gains are currency losses of $0.3 million and $3.6 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended September 30, 2006 versus a currency loss and gain, respectively, of $0.7 million and $2.7 million for the three and six months ended September 30, 2005.
Net Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) on Investments and Foreign Currencies
For the three and six months ended September 30, 2006, the Company's investments, foreign currencies and other assets and liabilities had a net increase in appreciation of $17.7 million and $60.1 million, respectively, versus a net increase and decrease in appreciation, respectively, of $10.9 million and $7.6 million for the three and six months ended September 30, 2005. At September 30, 2006, net unrealized appreciation totaled $98.4 million, of which $107.6 million was attributable to net unrealized appreciation on our subordinated debt and private equity (after considering the effects of foreign currency borrowing/hedging for our non-U.S. investments) and $9.2 million was attributable to net unrealized depreciation on our bank debt/senior secured debt.
Net Increase in Net Assets from Operations
For the three and six months ended September 30, 2006, the Company had a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of $81.3 million and $152.4 million, respectively, versus an increase of $31.0 million and $44.6 million for the three and six months ended September 30, 2005, respectively. The net change in net assets from operations per share was $1.00 and $1.87, respectively, for the three and six months ended September 30, 2006 versus $0.49 and $0.71 for the three and six months ended September 30, 2005, respectively.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Company's liquidity and capital resources are generated primarily through its senior secured, multi-currency $1.25 billion, five-year credit facility maturing in April 2011 as well as from cash flows from operations, including investment sales and prepayments of senior and subordinated loans and income earned from investments and cash equivalents (which normally comprise of U.S. government securities and other high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less). At September 30, 2006, the Company had $660 million in borrowings outstanding and $590 million available for its use. In the future, the Company may raise additional equity or debt capital off its shelf registration or may securitize a portion of its investments. It may also further access $750 million of additional credit commitments available under the terms of its current credit facility as the Company's equity capital base grows. The primary use of funds will be investments in portfolio companies, cash distributions to holders of common stock and for other general corporate purposes.
The following table shows our significant contractual obligations for the repayment of outstanding borrowings under our senior secured revolving credit facility as of September 30, 2006:
 
Contractual Obligations
We have entered into two contracts under which we have future commitments: the investment advisory and management agreement, pursuant to which Apollo Investment Management has agreed to serve as our investment adviser, and the administration agreement, pursuant to which Apollo Administration has agreed to furnish us with the facilities and administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations and provide on our behalf managerial assistance to those portfolio companies to which we are required to provide such assistance. Payments under the investment advisory and management agreement are equal to (1) a percentage of the value of our gross assets and (2) a two-part incentive fee. Payments under the administration agreement are equal to an amount based upon our allocable portion of Apollo Administration's overhead in
 
Table of Contents
performing its obligations under the administration agreement, including rent, technology systems, insurance and our allocable portion of the costs of our chief financial officer and chief compliance officer and their respective
staffs. Either party may terminate each of the investment advisory and management agreement and administration agreement without penalty upon not more than 60 days' written notice to the other. Please see Note 3 within our financial statements included in this prospectus supplement for more information.
Off-balance Sheet Arrangements
At September 30, 2006, we did not have any off-balance sheet liabilities or other contractual obligations that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, other than the investment advisory and management agreement and the administration agreement.
Dividends
Dividends paid to stockholders for the three and six months ended September 30, 2006 totaled $38.4 million or $0.47 per share and $74.9 million or $0.92 per share, respectively. For the three and six months ended September 30, 2005, dividends paid totaled $27.0 million or $0.43 per share and $46.4 million or $0.74 per share, respectively. Tax characteristics of all dividends will be reported to shareholders on Form 1099 after the end of the calendar year.
We have elected to be taxed as a regulated investment company under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. In order to maintain our status as a regulated investment company, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our investment company taxable income. We also intend to make distributions of net realized capital gains, if any, at least annually.
We may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these distributions from time to time. In addition, we may be limited in our ability to make distributions due to the asset coverage test for borrowings when applicable to us as a business development company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and due to provisions in our credit facilities. If we do not distribute a certain percentage of our income annually, we will suffer adverse tax consequences, including possible loss of our status as a regulated investment company. We cannot assure stockholders that they will receive any distributions or distributions at a particular level.
With respect to the dividends paid to shareholders, income from origination, structuring, closing, commitment and other upfront fees associated with investments in portfolio companies is treated as taxable income and accordingly, distributed to shareholders. For the three and six months ended September 30, 2006, upfront fees totaling $0.8 million and $3.5 million, respectively, are being amortized into income over the lives of their respective loans. For the three and six months ended September 30, 2005, upfront fees totaled $2.0 million and $2.4 million, respectively.
In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FASB Interpretation No. ("FIN") 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. FIN 48 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. We do not expect the FASB's issuance of FIN 48 to materially impact the Company's financial condition or results of operations.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. During the three and six months ended September 30, 2006, many of the loans in our portfolio had floating interest rates. These loans are usually based on a floating LIBO rate and typically have durations of one to six months after which they reset to current market interest rates. As the percentage of our mezzanine and other subordinated loans increase as a percentage of our total investments, we expect that more of the loans in our portfolio will have fixed rates. Accordingly, we
 
Table of Contents
may hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using standard hedging instruments such as futures, options and forward contracts subject to the requirements of the 1940 Act. While hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates, they may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to our portfolio of investments. During the three and six months ended September 30, 2006, we did not engage in interest rate hedging activities.
Beginning in December 2004 and concomitant with our investment in WDAC Intermediate Corp., we entered into a three-month forward foreign currency contract to hedge our exposure to the currency risk associated with this investment. Our hedging contract continues to roll forward every three months and remains outstanding at September 30, 2006. Realized and unrealized gains on these contracts are represented on our balance sheet and statement of operations, respectively, as of and for the three and six months ended September 30, 2006. The open contract is further described in footnote 7 within our financial statements included in this prospectus supplement.
Additionally, we currently have, and may continue to have, outstanding borrowings denominated in foreign currencies. These borrowings are primarily used to fund foreign investments. As a result of borrowing and subsequently investing in the same foreign currency denominated investments, we are able to effectively hedge our exposure to currency risk resulting from these foreign investments. Unrealized appreciation on these borrowings is reflected in the value of the outstanding liability for credit facility payable on our statement of assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2006 and described further in footnote 7 to the financial statements included in this prospectus supplement.
The following table is designed to illustrate the effect on return to a holder of our common stock of the leverage created by our use of borrowing, at the weighted average annual interest rate of 5.12% for the six months ended September 30, 2006 and assuming hypothetical annual returns on our portfolio of minus 10 to plus 10 percent. As can be seen, leverage generally increases the return to stockholders when the portfolio return is positive and decreases the return when the portfolio return is negative. Actual returns may be greater or less than those appearing in the table.

J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Banc of America Securities LLC and Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc. are acting as joint bookrunning managers of the offering and as representatives of the underwriters named below. Subject to the terms and conditions stated in the underwriting agreement dated the date of this prospectus, each underwriter named below has agreed to purchase, and we have agreed to sell to that underwriter, the number of shares set forth opposite the underwriter's name.
 
The underwriting agreement provides that the obligations of the underwriters to purchase the shares included in this offering are subject to certain conditions precedent, including the absence of any material adverse change in our business and the receipt of certain certificates, opinions and letters from us, our counsel and our independent registered public accounting firm. The underwriters are committed to purchase all shares included in this offering, other than those shares covered by the over-allotment option described below, if they purchase any of the shares.
The underwriters propose to offer some of the shares directly to the public at the public offering price set forth on the cover page of this prospectus and some of the shares to dealers at the public offering price less a concession not to exceed $0.61 per share. If all of the shares are not sold at the initial offering price, the representatives may change the public offering price and the other selling terms.
We have granted to the underwriters an option, exercisable for 30 days from the date of this prospectus, to purchase up to 2,700,000 additional shares of common stock at the public offering price less the underwriting discount. The underwriters may exercise the option solely for the purpose of covering over-allotments, if any, in connection with this offering. To the extent the option is exercised, each underwriter must purchase a number of additional shares approximately proportionate to that underwriter's initial purchase commitment.
We, our officers and directors, Apollo Investment Management and certain of the partners and officers of Apollo Investment Management Company (or any entities through which such partners and officers may invest in our shares) have agreed that, for a period of 90 days from the date of this prospectus, we and they will not, without the prior written consent of the representatives, dispose of or hedge any shares of our common stock or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock. J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. in its sole discretion may release any of the securities subject to these lock-up agreements at any time without notice. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for the purpose of allowing the underwriters to comply with NASD Rule 2711(f)(4), if (1) during the last 17 days of the initial 90-day lock-up period, we release earnings results or material news or a material event relating to us occurs or (2) prior to the expiration of the initial 90-day lock-up

The following table shows the underwriting discounts and commissions that we are to pay to the underwriters in connection with this offering. These amounts are shown assuming both no exercise and full exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares of common stock.
 
In connection with the offering, the underwriters, may purchase and sell shares of common stock in the open market. These transactions may include short sales, syndicate covering transactions and stabilizing transactions. Short sales involve syndicate sales of common stock in excess of the number of shares to be purchased by the underwriters in the offering, which creates a syndicate short position. "Covered" short sales are sales of shares made in an amount up to the number of shares represented by the underwriters' over-allotment option. In determining the source of shares to close out the covered syndicate short position, the underwriters will consider, among other things, the price of shares available for purchase in the open market as compared to the price at which they may purchase shares through the over-allotment option. Transactions to close out the covered syndicate short involve either purchases of the common stock in the open market after the distribution has been completed or the exercise of the over-allotment option. The underwriters may also make "naked" short sales of shares in excess of the over-allotment option. The underwriters must close out any naked short position by purchasing shares of common stock in the open market. A naked short position is more likely to be created if the underwriters are concerned that there may be downward pressure on the price of the shares in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in the offering. Stabilizing transactions consist of bids for or purchases of shares in the open market while the offering is in progress.
 
Table of Contents
The underwriters may also impose a penalty bid. Penalty bids permit the underwriters to reclaim a selling concession from a syndicate member when an underwriter repurchases shares originally sold by that syndicate member in order to cover syndicate short positions or make stabilizing purchases.
Any of these activities may have the effect of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the common stock. They may also cause the price of the common stock to be higher than the price that would otherwise exist in the open market in the absence of these transactions. The underwriters may conduct these transactions on the Nasdaq Global Select Market or in the over-the-counter market, or otherwise. If the underwriters commence any of these transactions, they may discontinue them at any time.
In addition, in connection with this offering, some of the underwriters may engage in passive market making transactions in the common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, prior to the pricing and completion of the offering. Passive market making consists of displaying bids on the Nasdaq Global Select Market no higher than the bid prices of independent market makers and making purchases at prices no higher than those independent bids and effected in response to order flow. Net purchases by a passive market maker on each day are limited to a specified percentage of the passive market maker's average daily trading volume in the common stock during a specified period and must be discontinued when that limit is reached. Passive market making may cause the price of the common stock to be higher than the price that otherwise would exist in the open market in the absence of those transactions. If the underwriters commence passive market making transactions, they may discontinue them at any time.
We estimate that our portion of the total expenses of this offering will be $675,000. In addition, the underwriters have agreed to pay certain of our expenses associated with this offering.

Note 1. Organization
Apollo Investment Corporation ("Apollo Investment" or the "Company"), a Maryland corporation organized on February 2, 2004, is a closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that has filed an election to be treated as a business development company ("BDC") under the Investment Company Act of 1940. In addition, for tax purposes we have elected to be treated as a regulated investment company, or RIC, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Our investment objective is to generate both current income and capital appreciation through debt and equity investments. We invest primarily in middle-market companies in the form of mezzanine and senior secured loans, each of which may include an equity component, and, to a lesser extent, by making direct equity investments in such companies.
On April 8, 2004, Apollo Investment closed its initial public offering and sold 62,000,000 shares of its common stock at a price of $15.00 per share, less an underwriting discount and commissions totaling $0.9375 per share. We commenced operations on April 8, 2004 as we received $870.15 million in total net proceeds from the offering.
Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reported period. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining these estimates could cause actual results to differ materially.
Interim financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP for interim financial information and pursuant to the requirements for reporting on Form 10-Q and Article 6 or 10 of Regulation S-X, as appropriate. In accordance with Article 6-09 of Regulation S-X under the Exchange Act, we are providing a Statement of Changes in Net Assets in lieu of a Statement of Changes in Stockholders' Equity. In addition, certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting solely of normal recurring accruals, considered necessary for the fair presentation of financial statements for the interim period, have been included.
The significant accounting policies consistently followed by Apollo Investment are:
 
 
Table of Contents
With respect to our investments for which market quotations are not readily available, our Board of Directors undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below:
 
 
 
 
 
The types of factors that we may take into account in fair value pricing our investments include, as relevant, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company's ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flow, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparison to publicly traded securities and other relevant factors.
Determination of fair values involves subjective judgments and estimates. Accordingly, these notes to our financial statements express the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of such valuations, and any change in such valuations, on our financial statements.

Note 3. Agreements
Apollo Investment has an Investment Advisory and Management Agreement with the Investment Adviser, Apollo Investment Management, L.P., under which the Investment Adviser, subject to the overall supervision of Apollo Investment's Board of Directors, will manage the day-to-day operations of, and provide investment advisory services to, Apollo Investment. For providing these services, the Investment Adviser receives a fee from Apollo Investment, consisting of two componentsa base management fee and an incentive fee. The base management fee is determined by taking the average value of Apollo Investment's gross assets at the end of the
 
Table of Contents
two most recently completed calendar quarters calculated at an annual rate of 2.00%. The incentive fee has two parts, as follows: one part is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on Apollo Investment's pre-incentive fee net investment income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter. For this purpose, pre-incentive fee net investment income means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees (other than fees for providing managerial assistance), such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that we receive from portfolio companies) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus Apollo Investment's operating expenses for the quarter (including the base management fee, any expenses payable under the Administration Agreement, and any interest expense and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee). Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not include any realized capital gains computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation. Pre-incentive fee net investment income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of Apollo Investment's net assets at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, is compared to the hurdle rate of 1.75% per quarter (7% annualized). Our net investment income used to calculate this part of the incentive fee is also included in the amount of our gross assets used to calculate the 2% base management fee. Apollo Investment pays the Investment Adviser an incentive fee with respect to Apollo Investment's pre-incentive fee net investment income in each calendar quarter as follows: (1) no incentive fee in any calendar quarter in which Apollo Investment's pre-incentive fee net investment income does not exceed the hurdle rate; (2) 100% of Apollo Investment's pre-incentive fee net investment income with respect to that portion of such pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than 2.1875% in any calendar quarter; and (3) 20% of the amount of Apollo Investment's pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds 2.1875% in any calendar quarter. These calculations are appropriately pro rated for any period of less than three months and adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the relevant quarter. The second part of the incentive fee is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Investment Advisory and Management Agreement, as of the termination date), commencing on December 31, 2004, and will equal 20% of Apollo Investment's cumulative realized capital gains less cumulative realized capital losses, unrealized capital depreciation (unrealized depreciation on a gross investment-by-investment basis at the end of each calendar year) and all capital gains upon which prior performance-based capital gains incentive fee payments were previously made to the advisor.
For the three and six months ended September 30, 2006, the Investment Adviser received $9,668 and $18,144 respectively, in base investment advisory and management fees and $8,916 and $16,852 respectively, in performance-based net investment income incentive fees from Apollo Investment. For the three and six months ended September 30, 2005, the Investment Adviser received $5,310 and $9,801 respectively, in base investment advisory and management fees and $5,173 and $11,484 respectively, in performance-based net investment income incentive fees from Apollo Investment. For the three and six months ended September 30, 2006, the Company accrued $1,852 and $1,852, respectively, in performance-based net realized gain incentive fees. For the three and six months ended September 30, 2005, the Company did not have a performance-based net realized gain incentive fee accrual.
Apollo Investment has also entered into an Administration Agreement with Apollo Investment Administration, LLC (the "Administrator") under which the Administrator provides administrative services for Apollo Investment. For providing these services, facilities and personnel, Apollo Investment reimburses the Administrator for Apollo Investment's allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by Apollo Administration in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent and Apollo Investment's allocable portion of its chief financial officer and chief compliance officer and their respective staffs. The Administrator will also provide, on Apollo Investment's behalf, managerial assistance to those portfolio companies to which Apollo Investment is required to provide such assistance.
For the three and six months ended September 30, 2006, the Administrator was reimbursed $298 and $590 respectively, from Apollo Investment on $533 and $1,501, respectively, of expenses accrued under the Administration Agreement. For the three and six months ended September 30, 2005, the Administrator was reimbursed $262 and $460, respectively, from Apollo Investment on the $403 and $715, respectively, of expenses accrued under the Administration Agreement.

On April 14, 2005, Apollo Investment entered into an $800 million Senior Secured Revolving Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement"), among Apollo Investment, the lenders party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. ("JPMorgan"), as administrative agent for the lenders. Effective December 29, 2005, lenders provided additional commitments in the amount of $100 million, increasing the total facility size to $900 million on the same terms and conditions as the existing commitments. On March 31, 2006, Apollo Investment Corporation amended and restated its $900 million senior secured, multi-currency, revolving credit facility due April 14, 2010. The amended Facility increased total commitments outstanding to $1.25 billion and extended the maturity date to April 13, 2011. The amended Facility also permits Apollo to seek additional commitments from new and existing lenders in the future, up to an aggregate amount not to exceed $2 billion. Pricing remains at 100 basis points over LIBOR. The Facility will be used to supplement Apollo's equity capital to make additional portfolio investments. From time to time, certain of the lenders provide customary commercial and investment banking services to affiliates of Apollo Investment. JPMorgan also serves as custodian and fund accounting agent for Apollo Investment.
Note 4. Net Asset Value Per Share
At September 30, 2006, the Company's total net assets and net asset value per share were $1,323,359 and $16.14, respectively. This compares to total net assets and net asset value per share at March 31, 2006 of $1,229,855 and $15.15, respectively.

Note 7. Foreign Currency Transactions
At September 30, 2006, the Company had an open foreign currency contract to sell euro forward and bears the market risk that arises from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Unrealized appreciation on the contract is reflected in the accompanying financial statements as follows:
 
At September 30, 2006, the Company had outstanding non-US borrowings on its $1.25 billion multicurrency revolving credit facility denominated in euros and Canadian dollars. Unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on these outstanding borrowings is indicated in the table below:
 
Note 8. Expense Offset Arrangement
The Company benefits from an expense offset arrangement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. ("custodian bank") whereby the Company earns credits on any uninvested US dollar cash balances held by the custodian bank. These credits are applied by the custodian bank as a reduction of the monthly custody fees charged to the Company. The total amount of credits earned during the three and six months ended September 30, 2006 is $50 and $65, respectively. The total amount of credits earned during the three and six months ended September 30, 2005 is $0 and $0, respectively.
Note 9. Cash Equivalents
Pending investment in longer-term portfolio holdings, Apollo Investment makes temporary investments in U.S. Treasury bills (of varying maturities) and repurchase agreements as outlined in our prospectus. These temporary investments are deemed cash equivalents by us and are included in our Schedule of Investments. At the end of each fiscal quarter, the Company typically takes proactive steps to prospectively preserve investment flexibility in the next quarter which is assessed against the Company's total assets at its most recent quarter end. The Company can accomplish this in many ways including its current practice of purchasing U.S. Treasury bills and closing out its position on a net cash basis subsequent to quarter end. The Company may also utilize repurchase agreements or other balance sheet transactions as it deems appropriate for this purpose and these amounts are excluded from total assets for purposes of computing the asset base upon which the management fee is determined. U.S. Treasury bills with maturities of greater than 60 days from the time of purchase are marked-to-market as per our valuation policy. U.S. Treasury bills settle "regular way" on trade date plus one.
 
Table of Contents
Note 10. Repurchase Agreements
The Company enters into repurchase agreements as part of its investment program. The Company's custodian takes possession of collateral pledged by the counterparty. The collateral is marked-to-market daily to ensure that the value, plus accrued interest, is at least equal to the repurchase price. In the event of default of the obligor to repurchase, the Company has the right to liquidate the collateral and apply the proceeds in satisfaction of the obligation. Under certain circumstances, in the event of default or bankruptcy by the counterparty to the agreement, realization and/or retention of the collateral or proceeds may be subject to legal proceedings. There were no repurchase agreements outstanding at September 30, 2006.

Note 12. Credit Agreement and Borrowings
At March 31, 2006 and under the terms of the amended and restated Credit Agreement, the lenders agreed to extend credit to Apollo Investment in an aggregate principal or face amount not exceeding $1.25 billion at any one time outstanding. The Credit Agreement is a five-year revolving facility (with a stated maturity date of April 14, 2011) and is secured by substantially all of the assets in Apollo Investment's portfolio, including cash and cash equivalents. Pricing is set at 100 basis points over LIBOR. The Credit Agreement contains affirmative and restrictive covenants, including: (a) periodic financial reporting requirements, (b) maintaining minimum shareholders' equity of the greater of (i) 40% of the total assets of Apollo Investment and its subsidiaries as at the last day of any fiscal quarter and (ii) the sum of (A) $300 million plus (B) 25% of the net proceeds from the sale of equity interests in Apollo Investment after the closing date of the Credit Agreement, (c) maintaining a ratio of total assets, less total liabilities (other than indebtedness) to total indebtedness, in each case of Apollo Investment and its subsidiaries, of not less than 2.0:1.0, (d) maintaining minimum liquidity, (e) limitations on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, (f) limitations on liens, (g) limitations on investments (other than in the ordinary course of Apollo Investment's business), (h) limitations on mergers and disposition of assets (other than in the normal course of Apollo Investment's business activities) and (i) limitations on the creation or existence of agreements that permit liens on properties of Apollo Investment's subsidiaries. In addition to the asset coverage ratio described in clause (c) of the preceding sentence, borrowings under the Credit Agreement (and the incurrence of certain other permitted debt) are subject to compliance with a borrowing base that applies different advance rates to different types of assets in Apollo Investment's portfolio. The Credit Agreement currently provides for the ability of Apollo Investment to seek additional commitments from lenders in an aggregate amount of up to $750 million. The Credit Agreement is used to supplement Apollo Investment's equity capital to make additional portfolio investments and for other general corporate purposes.
At September 30, 2006 and March 31, 2006, the Company had $659,932 (at value) and $323,852 (at value), respectively, drawn on its $1,250,000 revolving credit facility. The weighted average annual interest cost for the

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
Apollo Investment Corporation
We have reviewed the accompanying statements of assets and liabilities of Apollo Investment Corporation (the "Company") as of September 30, 2006 and March 31, 2006, including the schedules of investments, the related statements of operations for the three and six-month periods ended September 30, 2006 and September 30, 2005 and of cash flows for the six-month periods ended September 30, 2006 and September 30, 2005 and the statements of changes in net assets for the six-month period ended September 30, 2006 and for the year ended March 31, 2006. These interim financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.
We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.
Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be mvbade to the accompanying interim financial statements for them to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the statement of assets and liabilities as of March 31, 2006, and the related statements of operations, of cash flows and of changes in net assets for the year then ended, management's assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2006 and the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2006; and in our report dated June 9, 2006, we expressed unqualified opinions thereon. The financial statements and management's assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting referred to above are not presented herein. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities as of March 31, 2006, is fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the statement of assets and liabilities from which it has been derived.

Table of Contents
With respect to the unaudited interim financial information as of September 30, 2006 and for the three-month and six-month periods ended September 30, 2006 and 2005, included herein, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has reported that they applied limited procedures in accordance with professional standards for a review of such information. However, their separate report included herein states that they did not audit and they do not express an opinion on that interim financial information. Accordingly, the degree of reliance on their report on such information should be restricted in light of the limited nature of the review procedures applied. The accountants are not subject to the liability provisions of Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933 for their report on the unaudited interim financial information because that report is not a "report" or a "part" of the registration statement prepared or certified by the accountants within the meaning of Sections 7 and 11 of the Securities Act of 1933.

Apollo Investment
Apollo Investment Corporation ("Apollo Investment" or the "Company"), a Maryland corporation organized on February 2, 2004, is a closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be treated as a business development company (a "BDC") under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act"). In addition, for tax purposes we have elected to be treated as a regulated investment company, or RIC, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
Our investment objective is to generate both current income and capital appreciation through debt and equity investments. We intend to invest primarily in middle-market companies in the form of mezzanine and senior secured loans, as well as by making direct equity investments in such companies. From time to time, we may also invest in public companies whose securities are thinly traded.
Our portfolio is comprised primarily of investments in long-term subordinated loans, referred to as mezzanine loans, and senior secured loans of private middle-market companies, and from time to time include equity interests such as common stock, warrants or options. Our targeted investment typically ranges between $20 million and $150 million, although this investment size may vary proportionately as the size of our capital base changes. In this prospectus, we use the term "middle-market" to refer to companies with annual revenues between $50 million and $1 billion.
Apollo Investment Management and its affiliates manage other funds that may have investment mandates that are similar, in whole or in part, with ours. Apollo Investment Management and its affiliates may determine that an investment is appropriate both for us and for one or more of those other funds. In such event, depending on the availability of such investment and other appropriate factors, Apollo Investment Management may determine that we should invest on a side-by-side basis with one or more other funds. We do not anticipate making an initial investment in any portfolio company in which Apollo or any affiliate has a pre-existing investment. We may make all such investments subject to compliance with applicable regulations and interpretations, and our allocation procedures. Certain types of negotiated co-investments may be made only if we receive an order from the SEC permitting us to do so. There can be no assurance that any such order will be obtained.
At June 30, 2006, our net portfolio consisted of 48 portfolio companies with a market value of $1.8 billion and was invested 63% in subordinated debt, 3% in preferred equity, 9% in common equity and 25% in senior secured loans versus 36 portfolio companies invested 48% in subordinated debt, 2% in common equity, 46% in senior secured loans, and 4% in cash equivalents at June 30, 2005. As of June 30, 2006, our average investment size was approximately $37 million.
The weighted average yields on our subordinated debt portfolio, senior secured loan portfolio and total debt portfolio were 13.6%, 12.7% and 13.3%, respectively, at June 30, 2006. Yields are computed using interest rates as of the balance sheet date and include amortization of loan origination fees, original issue discount and market premium or discount, weighted by their respective costs when averaged.
While our primary focus is to generate both current income and capital appreciation through investments in loans, we may invest a portion of the portfolio in opportunistic investments in order to seek to enhance returns to
 
Table of Contents
stockholders. Such investments may include investments in high-yield bonds, distressed debt, foreign securities, private equity or securities of public companies that are not thinly traded. We expect that these public companies generally will have debt securities that are not investment grade.
About Apollo
Founded in 1990, Apollo is a recognized leader in private equity investing, having invested more than $14 billion in over 150 companies since its founding. Since its inception, Apollo has raised in excess of $25 billion in capital, primarily from institutional investors. Apollo traditionally has focused on companies that it believes are undervalued yet have successful business models, strong cash flows and prospects for value creation. The Apollo investment professionals' disciplined, value-oriented strategy has sought to identify opportunities in all investment environments, selecting from a range of approaches, such as traditional or corporate partner buyouts, distressed debt buyouts or more liquid, non-control distressed debt investments. The Apollo investment professionals have sought through this strategy to provide investors with attractive returns while minimizing the risk of capital loss throughout economic cycles.
Apollo's active private equity investment funds focus on making either control-oriented equity investments of $200 million or more or distressed debt investments, either for control or non-control positions. In contrast, we seek to capitalize on the significant investment opportunities emerging in the mezzanine segment of the lending market for middle-market companies, which we believe offers the potential for attractive risk-adjusted returns.
About Apollo Investment Management
Apollo Investment Management, our investment adviser, is led by a dedicated team of 12 investment professionals and is further supported by Apollo's team of approximately 48 investment professionals. This team has invested more than $2.25 billion in 67 companies in transactions with more than 50 different financial sponsors since commencement of operations in April 2004. In addition, Apollo Investment Management expects to hire additional investment professionals in the future. Apollo Investment Management's investment committee currently consists of John J. Hannan, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and a managing partner of Apollo Investment Management, Arthur H.

About Apollo Investment Administration
In addition to furnishing us with office facilities, equipment, and clerical, bookkeeping and record keeping services, Apollo Investment Administration also oversees our financial records as well as the preparation of our reports to stockholders and reports filed with the SEC. AIA oversees the determination and publication of our net asset value, oversees the preparation and filing of our tax returns, and generally monitors the payment of our expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to us by others. Furthermore, AIA provides on our behalf managerial assistance to those portfolio companies to which we are required to provide such assistance.
Operating and Regulatory Structure
Our investment activities are managed by Apollo Investment Management and supervised by our board of directors, a majority of whom are independent of Apollo and its affiliates. Apollo Investment Management is an
 
Table of Contents
investment adviser that is registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Under our investment advisory and management agreement, we pay Apollo Investment Management an annual base management fee based on our gross assets as well as an incentive fee based on our performance. See "ManagementInvestment Advisory and Management Agreement."
As a business development company, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. Also, while we are permitted to finance investments using debt, our ability to use debt is limited in certain significant respects. See "Regulation." We have elected to be treated for federal income tax purposes as a regulated investment company, or a RIC, under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or the "Code." For more information, see "Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations."
Determination of Net Asset Value
The net asset value per share of our outstanding shares of common stock is determined quarterly by dividing the value of our total assets minus our liabilities by the total number of our shares outstanding.
In calculating the value of our total assets, we value investments for which market quotations are readily available at such market quotations. Debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded or whose market price is not readily available are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors under a valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process. Because there is no readily available market value for a significant portion of the investments in our portfolio, we value these portfolio investments at fair value.
Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments, and the differences could be material. Determination of fair values involves subjective judgments and estimates not susceptible to substantiation by auditing procedures. Accordingly, under current auditing standards, the notes to our financial statements refer to the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of such valuations, and any change in such valuations, on our financial statements. For more information, see "Determination of Net Asset Value."
Use of Proceeds
We intend to use the net proceeds from the sale of our securities for general corporate purposes, which includes investing in portfolio companies in accordance with our investment objective and strategies and repaying indebtedness, incurred under our senior credit facility. Pending such investments, we will use the net proceeds of an offering to invest in cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and other high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less from the date of investment, to reduce then-outstanding obligations under our credit facility or for other general corporate purposes. The supplement to this prospectus relating to an offering will more fully identify the use of the proceeds from such offering. For more information, see "Use of Proceeds."
Dividends
We intend to continue to distribute quarterly dividends to our stockholders. Our quarterly dividends, if any, will be determined by our board of directors. For more information, see "Dividends."
Dividend Reinvestment Plan
We have adopted an opt-out' dividend reinvestment plan that provides for reinvestment of our dividend distributions on behalf of our stockholders, unless a stockholder elects to receive cash. As a result, if our board of directors authorizes, and we declare, a cash dividend, then our stockholders who have not opted out' of our dividend reinvestment plan will have their cash dividends automatically reinvested in additional shares of our
 
Table of Contents
common stock, rather than receiving the cash dividends. A registered stockholder must notify our transfer agent in writing if they wish to opt-out' of the dividend reinvestment plan. For more information, see "Dividend Reinvestment Plan."
Plan of Distribution
We may offer, from time to time, up to $900,000,000 of our common stock, preferred stock, debt securities or warrants representing rights to purchase shares of our common stock, preferred stock or debt securities, on terms to be determined at the time of the offering.
Securities may be offered at prices and on terms described in one or more supplements to this prospectus directly to one or more purchasers, through agents designated from time to time by us, or to or through underwriters or dealers. The supplement to this prospectus relating to the offering will identify any agents or underwriters involved in the sale of our securities, and will set forth any applicable purchase price, fee and commission or discount arrangement or the basis upon which such amount may be calculated. In compliance with the guidelines of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. ("NASD"), the maximum compensation to the underwriters or dealers in connection with the sale of our securities pursuant to this prospectus and the accompanying supplement to this prospectus may not exceed 8% of the aggregate offering price of the securities as set forth on the cover page of the supplement to this prospectus.
We may not sell securities pursuant to this prospectus without delivering a prospectus supplement describing the method and terms of the offering of such securities. For more information, see "Plan of Distribution."

Table of Contents
The following table is intended to assist you in understanding the costs and expenses that an investor in shares of our common stock will bear directly or indirectly. We caution you that some of the percentages indicated in the table below are estimates and may vary. Except where the context suggests otherwise, whenever this prospectus contains a reference to fees or expenses paid by "you", "us" or "Apollo Investment", or that "we" will pay fees or expenses, stockholders will indirectly bear such fees or expenses as investors in Apollo Investment.
 
The SEC requires that "Total Annual Expenses" be calculated as a percentage of net assets in the above chart rather than as a percentage of total assets. Total assets includes assets that have been funded with borrowed monies (leverage). For reference, the below chart illustrates our "Total annual expenses" as a percentage of total assets:
 
 
 
Table of Contents
Example
The following example demonstrates the projected dollar amount of total cumulative expenses that would be incurred over various periods with respect to a hypothetical investment in our common stock, assuming a sales load of 4.50% and offering expenses totaling 0.15%. In calculating the following expense amounts, we have also assumed we would have no additional leverage and that our annual operating expenses would remain at the levels set forth in the table above.
 
While the example assumes, as required by the SEC, a 5% annual return, our performance will vary and may result in a return greater or less than 5%. The incentive fee under the investment advisory and management agreement, which, assuming a 5% annual return, would either not be payable or have an insignificant impact on the expense amounts shown above, is not included in the example. This illustration assumes that we will not realize any capital gains computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation in any of the indicated time periods. If we achieve sufficient returns on our investments, including through the realization
 
Table of Contents
of capital gains, to trigger an incentive fee of a material amount, our expenses, and returns to our investors, would be higher. In addition, while the example assumes reinvestment of all dividends and distributions at net asset value, participants in our dividend reinvestment plan will receive a number of shares of our common stock, determined by dividing the total dollar amount of the dividend payable to a participant by the market price per share of our common stock at the close of trading on the valuation date for the dividend. See "Dividend Reinvestment Plan" for additional information regarding our dividend reinvestment plan.
This example and the expenses in the table above should not be considered a representation of our future expenses, and actual expenses may be greater or less than those shown.

Before you invest in our shares, you should be aware of various risks, including those described below. You should carefully consider these risk factors, together with all of the other information included in this prospectus, before you decide whether to make an investment in our securities. The risks set out below are not the only risks we face. If any of the following events occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In such case, our net asset value and the trading price of our common stock could decline or the value of our preferred stock, debt securities or warrants may decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.
RISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS AND STRUCTURE
We can offer no assurance that we will be able to replicate the success of Apollo's private funds and our investment returns could be substantially lower than the returns achieved by those private funds.
Even though Apollo Investment Management is led by senior investment professionals of Apollo who apply the value-oriented philosophy and techniques used by the Apollo investment professionals in their private fund investing, our investment strategies and objectives differ from those of other private funds that are or have been managed by the Apollo investment professionals. Further, investors in Apollo Investment are not acquiring an interest in other Apollo funds. Further, while Apollo Investment may consider potential co-investment participation in portfolio investments with other Apollo funds, any such investment activity is subject to a number of limitations, including applicable allocation policies and regulatory limitations on certain types of co-investment activity. Certain types of negotiated co-investments may be made only if we receive an order from the SEC permitting us to do so. There can be no assurance that any such order will be obtained. Accordingly, we can offer no assurance that Apollo Investment will replicate Apollo's historical success, and we caution you that our investment returns could be substantially lower than the returns achieved by those private funds.
We are dependent upon Apollo Investment Management's key personnel for our future success and upon their access to Apollo's investment professionals and partners.
We depend on the diligence, skill and network of business contacts of the senior management of Apollo Investment Management. Members of our senior management may depart at any time. For a description of the senior management team, see "Management." We also depend, to a significant extent, on Apollo Investment Management's access to the investment professionals and partners of Apollo and the information and deal flow generated by the Apollo investment professionals in the course of their investment and portfolio management activities. The senior management of Apollo Investment Management evaluates, negotiates, structures, closes and monitors our investments. Our future success depends on the continued service of the senior management team of Apollo Investment Management. The departure of any of our directors or the senior managers of Apollo Investment Management, or of a significant number of the investment professionals or partners of Apollo, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our investment objective. In addition, we can offer no assurance that Apollo Investment Management will remain our investment adviser or that we will continue to have access to Apollo's partners and investment professionals or its information and deal flow.
Our financial condition and results of operation depend on our ability to manage future growth effectively.
Our ability to achieve our investment objective depends, in part, on our ability to grow, which depends, in turn, on Apollo Investment Management's ability to identify, invest in and monitor companies that meet our investment criteria. Accomplishing this result on a cost-effective basis is largely a function of Apollo Investment Management's structuring of the investment process, its ability to provide competent, attentive and efficient services to us and our access to financing on acceptable terms. The senior management team of Apollo Investment Management has substantial responsibilities under the investment advisory and management agreement, as well as in connection with their roles as officers of other Apollo funds. They may also be called
 
Table of Contents
upon to provide managerial assistance to our portfolio companies as principals of our administrator. These demands on their time may distract them or slow the rate of investment. In order to grow, we and Apollo Investment Management need to hire, train, supervise and manage new employees. Any failure to manage our future growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities.
A number of entities compete with us to make the types of investments that we make in middle-market companies. We compete with public and private funds, commercial and investment banks, commercial financing companies, and, to the extent they provide an alternative form of financing, private equity funds. Additionally, because competition for investment opportunities generally has increased among alternative investment vehicles, such as hedge funds, those entities have begun to invest in areas they have not traditionally invested in, including investments in middle-market companies. As a result of these new entrants, competition for investment opportunities at middle-market companies has intensified and we expect that trend to continue. Some of our existing and potential competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. For example, some competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that are not available to us. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than us. Furthermore, many of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the 1940 Act imposes on us as a business development company. We cannot assure you that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Also, as a result of this existing and increasing competition, we may not be able to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities from time to time, and we can offer no assurance that we will be able to identify and make investments that are consistent with our investment objective.
We do not seek to compete primarily based on the interest rates we offer, and we believe that some of our competitors make loans with interest rates that are comparable to or lower than the rates we offer.
We may lose investment opportunities if we do not match our competitors' pricing, terms and structure. If we match our competitors' pricing, terms and structure, we may experience decreased net interest income and increased risk of credit loss.
Any failure on our part to maintain our status as a business development company would reduce our operating flexibility.
If we do not remain a business development company, we might be regulated as a closed-end investment company under the 1940 Act, which would subject us to substantially more regulatory restrictions under the 1940 Act and correspondingly decrease our operating flexibility.
We will be subject to corporate-level income tax if we are unable to qualify as a RIC.
To qualify as a RIC under the Code, we must meet certain source-of-income, asset diversification and annual distribution requirements. The annual distribution requirement for a RIC is satisfied if we distribute at least 90% of our ordinary income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any, to our stockholders on an annual basis. To the extent we use debt financing, we are subject to certain asset coverage ratio requirements under the 1940 Act and financial covenants under loan and credit agreements that could, under certain circumstances, restrict us from making distributions necessary to qualify as a RIC. If we are unable to obtain cash from other sources, we may fail to qualify as a RIC and, thus, may be subject to corporate-level income tax. To qualify as a RIC, we must also meet certain asset diversification requirements at the end of each calendar quarter. Failure to meet these tests may result in our having to dispose of certain investments quickly in order to prevent the loss of RIC status. Because most of our investments are in
 
Table of Contents
private companies, any such dispositions could be made at disadvantageous prices and may result in substantial losses. If we fail to qualify as a RIC for any reason and become subject to corporate income tax, the resulting corporate taxes could substantially reduce our net assets, the amount of income available for distribution and the amount of our distributions. Such a failure would have a material adverse effect on us and our stockholders.
We may have difficulty paying our required distributions if we recognize income before or without receiving cash representing such income.
For federal income tax purposes, we include in income certain amounts that we have not yet received in cash, such as original issue discount, which may arise if we receive warrants in connection with the making of a loan or possibly in other circumstances, or payment-in-kind interest, which represents contractual interest added to the loan balance and due at the end of the loan term. Such original issue discount, which could be significant relative to Apollo Investment's overall investment activities, or increases in loan balances as a result of payment-in-kind arrangements are included in income before we receive any corresponding cash payments. We also may be required to include in income certain other amounts that we do not receive in cash.
That part of the incentive fee payable by us that relates to our net investment income is computed and paid on income that may include interest that has been accrued but not yet received in cash. If a portfolio company defaults on a loan that is structured to provide accrued interest, it is possible that accrued interest previously used in the calculation of the incentive fee will become uncollectible.
Since in certain cases we may recognize income before or without receiving cash representing such income, we may have difficulty meeting the tax requirement to distribute at least 90% of our ordinary income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any, to maintain our status as a RIC. Accordingly, we may have to sell some of our investments at times we would not consider advantageous, raise additional debt or equity capital or reduce new investment originations to meet these distribution requirements. See "Material U.S. Federal Income Tax ConsiderationsTaxation as a RIC."
Regulations governing our operation as a business development company affect our ability to, and the way in which we, raise additional capital.
We may issue debt securities or preferred stock and/or borrow money from banks or other financial institutions, which we refer to collectively as "senior securities," up to the maximum amount permitted by the 1940 Act. Under the provisions of the 1940 Act, we are permitted, as a business development company, to issue senior securities only in amounts such that our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, equals at least 200% after each issuance of senior securities. If the value of our assets declines, we may be unable to satisfy this test. If that happens, we may be required to sell a portion of our investments and, depending on the nature of our leverage, repay a portion of our indebtedness at a time when such sales may be disadvantageous.
We are not generally able to issue and sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share. We may, however, sell our common stock at a price below the current net asset value of the common stock, or sell warrants, options or rights to acquire such common stock at a price below the current net asset value of the stock, if our board of directors determines that such sale is in the best interests of Apollo Investment and its stockholders, and our stockholders approve Apollo Investment's policy and practice of making such sales. In any such case, the price at which our securities are to be issued and sold may not be less than a price which, in the determination of our board of directors, closely approximates the market value of such securities (less any distributing commission or discount).
In addition to issuing securities to raise capital as described above, we may in the future seek to securitize our loans to generate cash for funding new investments. To securitize loans, we may create a wholly owned subsidiary and contribute a pool of loans to the subsidiary. This could include the sale of interests in the subsidiary on a non-recourse basis to purchasers who we would expect to be willing to accept a lower interest
 
Table of Contents
rate to invest in investment grade loan pools, and we would retain a portion of the equity in the securitized pool of loans. An inability to successfully securitize our loan portfolio could limit our ability to grow our business and fully execute our business strategy, and could decrease our earnings, if any. Moreover, the successful securitization of our loan portfolio might expose us to losses as the residual loans in which we do not sell interests may tend to be those that are riskier and more apt to generate losses.
We currently use borrowed funds to make investments and are exposed to the typical risks associated with leverage.
 
 
 
 
 
We fund a portion of our investments with borrowed money, which magnifies the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested and may increase the risk of investing in us.
Borrowings, also known as leverage, magnify the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested and, therefore, increase the risks associated with investing in our securities. We entered into a credit agreement in April 2005 with institutional banks and other lenders to facilitate such borrowing. Our lenders have fixed dollar claims on our consolidated assets that are superior to the claims of our common stockholders. If the value of our consolidated assets increases, then leveraging would cause the net asset value to increase more sharply than it would have had we not leveraged. Conversely, if the value of our consolidated assets decreases, leveraging would cause net asset value to decline more sharply than it otherwise would have had we not leveraged. Similarly, any increase in our consolidated income in excess of consolidated interest payable on the borrowed funds would cause our net income to increase more than it would without the leverage, while any decrease in our consolidated income would cause net income to decline more sharply than it would have had we not borrowed. Such a decline could negatively affect our ability to make common stock dividend payments. Leverage is generally considered a speculative investment technique.
Changes in interest rates may affect our cost of capital and net investment income.
Because we borrow money to make investments, our net investment income will depend, in part, upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest these funds. As a result, we can offer no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. In periods of rising interest rates, our cost of funds would increase, which could reduce our net investment income. Our long-term fixed-rate investments are financed primarily with equity and long-term debt. We may use interest rate risk management techniques in an effort to limit our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. Such techniques may include various interest rate hedging activities to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act. We have analyzed the potential impact of changes in interest rates on interest income net of interest expense. Assuming that the balance sheet were to remain constant and no actions were taken to alter the existing interest rate sensitivity, a hypothetical immediate 1% change in interest rates would have affected our net income over a one-year horizon. Although management believes that this estimated measure is indicative of our
 
Table of Contents
sensitivity to interest rate changes, it does not adjust for potential changes in credit quality, size and composition of the assets on the balance sheet and other business developments that could affect net increase in net assets resulting from operations, or net income. Accordingly, no assurances can be given that actual results would not differ materially from the potential outcome simulated by this estimate.
You should also be aware that a rise in the general level of interest rates can be expected to lead to higher interest rates applicable to our debt investments. Accordingly, an increase in interest rates would make it easier for us to meet or exceed the incentive fee hurdle rate and may result in a substantial increase of the amount of incentive fees payable to our investment adviser with respect to pre-incentive fee net investment income.
We need to raise additional capital to grow because we must distribute most of our income.
We may need additional capital to fund growth in our investments. We have issued equity securities and have borrowed from financial institutions. A reduction in the availability of new capital could limit our ability to grow. We must distribute at least 90% of our ordinary income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any, to our stockholders to maintain our regulated investment company status. As a result, such earnings are not available to fund investment originations. We expect to continue to borrow from financial institutions and issue additional debt and equity securities. If we fail to obtain funds from such sources or from other sources to fund our investments, it could limit our ability to grow, which may have an adverse effect on the value of our securities. In addition, as a business development company, we are generally required to maintain a ratio of at least 200% of total assets to total borrowings, which may restrict our ability to borrow in certain circumstances.
Many of our portfolio investments are recorded at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors and, as a result, there is uncertainty as to the value of our portfolio investments.
A large percentage of our portfolio investments are in the form of securities that are not publicly traded. The fair value of securities and other investments that are not publicly traded may not be readily determinable. We value these securities quarterly at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors. However, we may be required to value our securities at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors to the extent necessary to reflect significant events affecting the value of our securities. Our board of directors utilizes the services of several independent valuation firms to aid it in determining the fair value of these securities. The types of factors that may be considered in fair value pricing of our investments include the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company's ability to make payments and its earnings, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparison to publicly traded companies, discounted cash flow and other relevant factors. Because such valuations, and particularly valuations of private securities and private companies, are inherently uncertain, may fluctuate over short periods of time and may be based on estimates, our determinations of fair value may differ materially from the values that would have been used if a ready market for these securities existed. Our net asset value could be adversely affected if our determinations regarding the fair value of our investments were materially higher than the values that we ultimately realize upon the disposal of such securities.
The lack of liquidity in our investments may adversely affect our business.
We generally make investments in private companies. Substantially all of these securities are subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or are otherwise less liquid than publicly traded securities. The illiquidity of our investments may make it difficult for us to sell such investments if the need arises. In addition, if we are required to liquidate all or a portion of our portfolio quickly, we may realize significantly less than the value at which we have previously recorded our investments. In addition, we may face other restrictions on our ability to liquidate an investment in a portfolio company to the extent that we or an affiliated manager of Apollo has material non-public information regarding such portfolio company.
 
Table of Contents
We may experience fluctuations in our quarterly results.
We could experience fluctuations in our quarterly operating results due to a number of factors, including the interest rate payable on the debt securities we acquire, the default rate on such securities, the level of our expenses, variations in and the timing of the recognition of realized and unrealized gains or losses, the degree to which we encounter competition in our markets and general economic conditions. As a result of these factors, results for any period should not be relied upon as being indicative of performance in future periods.
There are significant potential conflicts of interest which could impact our investment returns.
Our executive officers and directors, and the partners of our investment adviser, Apollo Investment Management, serve or may serve as officers, directors or principals of entities that operate in the same or a related line of business as we do or of investment funds managed by our affiliates. Accordingly, they may have obligations to investors in those entities, the fulfillment of which might not be in the best interests of us or our stockholders. Moreover, we note that, notwithstanding the difference in principal investment objectives between Apollo Investment and other Apollo funds, such other Apollo sponsored funds, including new affiliated potential pooled investment vehicles or managed accounts not yet established, have and may from time to time have overlapping investment objectives with those of Apollo Investment and, accordingly, invest in, whether principally or secondarily, asset classes similar to those targeted by Apollo Investment. To the extent such other investment vehicles have overlapping investment objectives, the scope of opportunities otherwise available to us may be adversely affected and/or reduced. As a result, the partners of Apollo Investment Management may face conflicts in their time management and commitments as well as in the allocation of investment opportunities to other Apollo funds. We do not anticipate making an initial investment in any portfolio company in which Apollo or any affiliate has a pre-existing investment. In addition, in the event such investment opportunities are allocated among Apollo Investment and other investment vehicles affiliated with Apollo Investment Management, our desired investment portfolio may be adversely affected. Although Apollo Investment Management endeavors to allocate investment opportunities in a fair and equitable manner, it is possible that we may not be given the opportunity to participate in certain investments made by investment funds managed by investment managers affiliated with Apollo Investment Management.
Apollo Investment Management and its affiliates and investment managers may determine that an investment is appropriate both for us and for one or more other funds. In such event, depending on the availability of such investment and other appropriate factors, Apollo Investment Management may determine that we should invest on a side-by-side basis with one or more other funds. We do not anticipate making an initial investment in any portfolio company in which Apollo or any affiliate has a pre-existing investment. We may make all such investments subject to compliance with applicable regulations and interpretations, and our allocation procedures. Certain types of negotiated co-investments may be made only if we receive an order from the SEC permitting us to do so. There can be no assurance that any such order will be obtained.
In the course of our investing activities, we pay management and incentive fees to Apollo Investment Management, and reimburse Apollo Investment Management for certain expenses it incurs. As a result, investors in our common stock invest on a "gross" basis and receive distributions on a "net" basis after expenses, resulting in, among other things, a lower rate of return than one might achieve through direct investments. As a result of this arrangement, there may be times when the management team of Apollo Investment Management has interests that differ from those of our stockholders, giving rise to a conflict.
Apollo Investment Management receives a quarterly incentive fee based, in part, on our pre-incentive fee income, if any, for the immediately preceding calendar quarter. This incentive fee is subject to a quarterly hurdle rate before providing an incentive fee return to the investment adviser. To the extent we or Apollo Investment Management are able to exert influence over our portfolio companies, the quarterly pre-incentive fee may provide Apollo Investment Management with an incentive to induce our portfolio companies to accelerate or defer interest or other obligations owed to us from one calendar quarter to another.
 
Table of Contents
We have entered into a royalty-free license agreement with Apollo, pursuant to which Apollo has agreed to grant us a non-exclusive license to use the name "Apollo." Under the license agreement, we have the right to use the "Apollo" name for so long as Apollo Investment Management or one of its affiliates remains our investment adviser. In addition, we rent office space from Apollo Administration, an affiliate of Apollo Investment Management, and pay Apollo Administration our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by Apollo Administration in performing its obligations under the administration agreement, including our allocable portion of the cost of our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Compliance Officer and their respective staffs, which can create conflicts of interest that our board of directors must monitor.
Changes in laws or regulations governing our operations may adversely affect our business.
We and our portfolio companies are subject to regulation by laws at the local, state and federal levels. These laws and regulations, as well as their interpretation, may be changed from time to time. Accordingly, any change in these laws or regulations could have a material adverse affect on our business.
RISKS RELATED TO OUR INVESTMENTS
We may not realize gains from our equity investments.
When we invest in mezzanine or senior secured loans, we have and may continue to acquire warrants or other equity securities as well. In addition, we may invest directly in the equity securities of portfolio companies. Our goal is ultimately to dispose of such equity interests and realize gains upon our disposition of such interests. However, the equity interests we receive may not appreciate in value and, in fact, may decline in value. Accordingly, we may not be able to realize gains from our equity interests, and any gains that we do realize on the disposition of any equity interests may not be sufficient to offset any other losses we experience.
Our ability to invest in private companies may be limited in certain circumstances.
As a business development company, we must not acquire any assets other than "qualifying assets" specified in the 1940 Act unless, at the time the acquisition is made, at least 70% of our total assets are qualifying assets (with certain limited exceptions). If we invest in an issuer that, at the time we make the investment, has outstanding securities as to which a broker or dealer may extend or maintain margin credit or "marginable securities," these acquired assets cannot normally be treated as qualifying assets. This treatment results from the definition of "eligible portfolio company" under the 1940 Act, which in part looks to whether a company has outstanding securities that are eligible for margin credit. Amendments promulgated in 1998 by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to Regulation T under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, expanded the definition of marginable security to include any non-equity security. These amendments have raised questions as to whether a private company that has outstanding debt securities would qualify as an eligible portfolio company. We note that under applicable self-regulatory organization rules that govern the ability of brokers and dealers to extend margin credit, many non-equity securities issued by private companies may not be effectively marginable.
To address these questions, the SEC proposed amendments to the 1940 Act to expand the definition of eligible portfolio company. These amendments would define eligible portfolio company with reference to whether a company has any class of securities listed on an exchange. We continue to monitor this issue closely and we may have to adjust our investment focus to comply with these amendments if they are adopted or any other future administrative position, judicial decision or legislative action.
Our portfolio is concentrated in a limited number of portfolio companies, which subject us to a risk of significant loss if any of these companies defaults on its obligations under any of its debt securities.
As of June 30, 2006, we have investments in 48 companies. A consequence of this limited number of investments is that the aggregate returns we realize may be significantly adversely affected if a small number of
 
Table of Contents
investments perform poorly or if we need to write down the value of any one investment. Beyond our income tax diversification requirements, we do not have fixed guidelines for diversification, and our investments could be concentrated in relatively few portfolio companies.
Our investments in prospective portfolio companies may be risky, and you could lose all or part of your investment.
Investment in middle-market companies involves a number of significant risks, including:
 
 
 
 
Economic recessions or downturns could impair our portfolio companies and harm our operating results.
Many of our portfolio companies may be susceptible to economic slowdowns or recessions and may be unable to repay our loans during these periods. Therefore, our non-performing assets are likely to increase and the value of our portfolio is likely to decrease during these periods. Adverse economic conditions also may decrease the value of collateral securing some of our loans and the value of our equity investments. Economic slowdowns or recessions could lead to financial losses in our portfolio and a decrease in revenues, net income and assets. Unfavorable economic conditions also could increase our funding costs, limit our access to the capital markets or result in a decision by lenders not to extend credit to us. These events could prevent us from increasing investments and harm our operating results.
A portfolio company's failure to satisfy financial or operating covenants imposed by us or other lenders could lead to defaults and, potentially, termination of its loans and foreclosure on its secured assets, which could trigger cross-defaults under other agreements and jeopardize our portfolio company's ability to meet its obligations under the debt securities that we hold. We may incur expenses to the extent necessary to seek recovery upon default or to negotiate new terms with a defaulting portfolio company. In addition, if one of our portfolio companies were to go bankrupt, even though we or one of our affiliates may have structured our interest as senior debt, depending on the facts and circumstances, including the extent to which we actually provided managerial assistance to that portfolio company, a bankruptcy court might recharacterize our debt holding and subordinate all or a portion of our claim to that of other creditors.
Our failure to make follow-on investments in our portfolio companies could impair the value of our portfolio.
Following an initial investment in a portfolio company, we may make additional investments in that portfolio company as "follow-on" investments, in order to: (1) increase or maintain in whole or in part our equity ownership percentage; (2) exercise warrants, options or convertible securities that were acquired in the original or subsequent financing or (3) attempt to preserve or enhance the value of our investment.
 
Table of Contents
We may elect not to make follow-on investments or otherwise lack sufficient funds to make those investments. We have the discretion to make any follow-on investments, subject to the availability of capital resources. The failure to make follow-on investments may, in some circumstances, jeopardize the continued viability of a portfolio company and our initial investment, or may result in a missed opportunity for us to increase our participation in a successful operation. Even if we have sufficient capital to make a desired follow-on investment, we may elect not to make a follow-on investment because we may not want to increase our concentration of risk, because we prefer other opportunities, or because we are inhibited by compliance with business development company requirements or the desire to maintain our tax status.
Because we generally do not hold controlling equity interests in our portfolio companies, we may not be in a position to exercise control over our portfolio companies or to prevent decisions by management of our portfolio companies that could decrease the value of our investments.
Although we may do so in the future, to date we have not taken controlling equity positions in our portfolio companies. As a result, we are subject to the risk that a portfolio company may make business decisions with which we disagree, and the stockholders and management of a portfolio company may take risks or otherwise act in ways that are adverse to our interests. Due to the lack of liquidity for the debt and equity investments that we typically hold in our portfolio companies, we may not be able to dispose of our investments in the event we disagree with the actions of a portfolio company, and may therefore suffer a decrease in the value of our investments.
An investment strategy focused primarily on privately-held companies presents certain challenges, including the lack of available information about these companies, a dependence on the talents and efforts of only a few key portfolio company personnel and a greater vulnerability to economic downturns.
We have invested and will continue to invest primarily in privately-held companies. Generally, little public information exists about these companies, and we are required to rely on the ability of Apollo Investment Management's investment professionals to obtain adequate information to evaluate the potential returns from investing in these companies. If we are unable to uncover all material information about these companies, we may not make a fully informed investment decision, and we may lose money on our investments. Also, privately-held companies frequently have less diverse product lines and smaller market presence than larger competitors. These factors could affect our investment returns.
Our portfolio companies may incur debt that ranks equally with, or senior to, our investments in such companies.
We have invested and intend to invest primarily in mezzanine and senior debt securities issued by our portfolio companies. The portfolio companies usually have, or may be permitted to incur, other debt that ranks equally with, or senior to, the debt securities in which we invest. By their terms, such debt instruments may provide that the holders are entitled to receive payment of interest or principal on or before the dates on which we are entitled to receive payments in respect of the debt securities in which we invest. Also, in the event of insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or bankruptcy of a portfolio company, holders of debt instruments ranking senior to our investment in that portfolio company would typically be entitled to receive payment in full before we receive any distribution in respect of our investment. After repaying such senior creditors, such portfolio company may not have any remaining assets to use for repaying its obligation to us. In the case of debt ranking equally with debt securities in which we invest, we would have to share on an equal basis any distributions with other creditors holding such debt in the event of an insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or bankruptcy of the relevant portfolio company. In addition, we may not be in a position to control any portfolio company by investing in its debt securities. As a result, we are subject to the risk that a portfolio company in which we invest may make business decisions with which we disagree and the management of such company, as representatives of the holders of their common equity, may take risks or otherwise act in ways that do not serve our interests as debt investors.

Our incentive fee may induce Apollo Investment Management to make certain investments, including speculative investments.
The incentive fee payable by us to Apollo Investment Management may create an incentive for Apollo Investment Management to make investments on our behalf that are risky or more speculative than would be the case in the absence of such compensation arrangement. The way in which the incentive fee payable to our investment adviser is determined, which is calculated as a percentage of the return on invested capital, may encourage our investment adviser to use leverage to increase the return on our investments. Under certain circumstances, the use of leverage may increase the likelihood of default, which would disfavor the holders of our common stock, including investors in offerings of common stock, securities convertible into our common stock or warrants representing rights to purchase our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock pursuant to this prospectus. In addition, the investment adviser receives the incentive fee based, in part, upon net capital gains realized on our investments. Unlike the portion of the incentive fee based on income, there is no hurdle rate applicable to the portion of the incentive fee based on net capital gains. As a result, the investment adviser may have a tendency to invest more in investments that are likely to result in capital gains as compared to income producing securities. Such a practice could result in our investing in more speculative securities than would otherwise be the case, which could result in higher investment losses, particularly during economic downturns.
The incentive fee payable by us to Apollo Investment Management also may create an incentive for Apollo Investment Management to invest on our behalf in instruments that have a deferred interest feature. Under these investments, we would accrue the interest over the life of the investment but would not receive the cash income from the investment until the end of the term. Our net investment income used to calculate the income portion of our investment fee, however, includes accrued interest. Thus, a portion of this incentive fee would be based on income that we have not yet received in cash.
We may invest, to the extent permitted by law, in the securities and instruments of other investment companies, including private funds, and, to the extent we so invest, will bear our ratable share of any such investment company's expenses, including management and performance fees. We will also remain obligated to pay management and incentive fees to Apollo Investment Management with respect to the assets invested in the securities and instruments of other investment companies. With respect to each of these investments, each stockholder of Apollo Investment will bear his or her share of the management and incentive fee of Apollo Investment Management as well as indirectly bearing the management and performance fees and other expenses of any investment companies in which Apollo Investment invests.
Our investments in foreign securities may involve significant risks in addition to the risks inherent in U.S. investments.
Our investment strategy contemplates that a portion of our investments may be in securities of foreign companies. Investing in foreign companies may expose us to additional risks not typically associated with investing in U.S. companies. These risks include changes in exchange control regulations, political and social instability, expropriation, imposition of foreign taxes, less liquid markets and less available information than is generally the case in the United States, higher transaction costs, less government supervision of exchanges, brokers and issuers, less developed bankruptcy laws, difficulty in enforcing contractual obligations, lack of uniform accounting and auditing standards and greater price volatility.
Although most of our investments are denominated in U.S. dollars, our investments that are denominated in a foreign currency are subject to the risk that the value of a particular currency may change in relation to one or more other currencies. Among the factors that may affect currency values are trade balances, the level of short-term interest rates, differences in relative values of similar assets in different currencies, long-term opportunities for investment and capital appreciation, and political developments. We may employ hedging techniques to minimize these risks, but we can offer no assurance that we will, in fact, hedge currency risk or, that if we do, such strategies will be effective.
 
Table of Contents
If we engage in hedging transactions, we may expose ourselves to risks associated with such transactions. We may utilize instruments such as forward contracts, currency options and interest rate swaps, caps, collars and floors to seek to hedge against fluctuations in the relative values of our portfolio positions from changes in currency exchange rates and market interest rates. Hedging against a decline in the values of our portfolio positions does not eliminate the possibility of fluctuations in the values of such positions or prevent losses if the values of such positions decline. However, such hedging can establish other positions designed to gain from those same developments, thereby offsetting the decline in the value of such portfolio positions. Such hedging transaction may also limit the opportunity for gain if the values of the underlying portfolio positions should increase. Moreover, it may not be possible to hedge against an exchange rate or interest rate fluctuation that is so generally anticipated that we are not able to enter into a hedging transaction at an acceptable price.
While we may enter into transactions to seek to reduce currency exchange rate and interest rate risks, unanticipated changes in currency exchange rates or interest rates may result in poorer overall investment performance than if we had not engaged in any such hedging transactions. In addition, the degree of correlation between price movements of the instruments used in a hedging strategy and price movements in the portfolio positions being hedged may vary. Moreover, for a variety of reasons, we may not seek to establish a perfect correlation between such hedging instruments and the portfolio holdings being hedged. Any such imperfect correlation may prevent us from achieving the intended hedge and expose us to risk of loss. In addition, it may not be possible to hedge fully or perfectly against currency fluctuations affecting the value of securities denominated in non-U.S. currencies because the value of those securities is likely to fluctuate as a result of factors not related to currency fluctuations.
Provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law and of our charter and bylaws could deter takeover attempts and have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock.
The Maryland General Corporation Law, our charter and our bylaws contain provisions that may discourage, delay or make more difficult a change in control of Apollo Investment or the removal of our directors. We are subject to the Maryland Business Combination Act, subject to any applicable requirements of the 1940 Act. Our board of directors has adopted a resolution exempting from the Business Combination Act any business combination between us and any other person, subject to prior approval of such business combination by our board of directors, including approval by a majority of our disinterested directors. If the resolution exempting business combinations is repealed or our board of directors does not approve a business combination, the Business Combination Act may discourage third parties from trying to acquire control of us and increase the difficulty of consummating such an offer. Our bylaws exempt from the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act acquisitions of our common stock by any person. If we amend our bylaws to repeal the exemption from the Control Share Acquisition Act, the Control Share Acquisition Act also may make it more difficult for a third party to obtain control of us and increase the difficulty of consummating such an offer.
We have also adopted other measures that may make it difficult for a third party to obtain control of us, including provisions of our charter classifying our board of directors in three classes serving staggered three-year terms, and provisions of our charter authorizing our board of directors to classify or reclassify shares of our stock in one or more classes or series, to cause the issuance of additional shares of our stock, and to amend our charter, without stockholder approval, to increase or decrease the number of shares of stock that we have authority to issue. These provisions, as well as other provisions of our charter and bylaws, may delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders.
RISKS RELATING TO THIS OFFERING
Investing in our securities may involve an above average degree of risk.
The investments we make in accordance with our investment objective may result in a higher amount of risk than alternative investment options and volatility or loss of principal. Our investments in portfolio companies may be highly speculative and aggressive, therefore, an investment in our securities may not be suitable for someone with a low risk tolerance.
 
Table of Contents
There is a risk that investors in our equity securities may not receive dividends or that our dividends may not grow over time and that investors in our debt securities may not receive all of the interest income to which they are entitled.
We intend to make distributions on a quarterly basis to our stockholders out of assets legally available for distribution. We cannot assure you that we will achieve investment results that will allow us to make a specified level of cash distributions or year-to-year increases in cash distributions. In addition, due to the asset coverage test applicable to us as a business development company, we may be limited in our ability to make distributions. Finally, if more stockholders opt to receive cash dividends rather than participate in our dividend reinvestment plan, we may be forced to liquidate some of our investments and raise cash in order to make dividend payments.
Our shares may trade at discounts from net asset value or at premiums that are unsustainable over the long term.
Shares of business development companies may trade at a market price that is less than the net asset value that is attributable to those shares. The possibility that our shares of common stock will trade at a discount from net asset value or at premiums that are unsustainable over the long term are separate and distinct from the risk that our net asset value will decrease. It is not possible to predict whether the shares offered hereby will trade at, above, or below net asset value.
The market price of our securities may fluctuate significantly.
The market price and liquidity of the market for our securities may be significantly affected by numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control and may not be directly related to our operating performance. These factors include:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
We may allocate the net proceeds from this offering in ways with which you may not agree.
We have significant flexibility in investing the net proceeds of this offering and may use the net proceeds from this offering in ways with which you may not agree or for purposes other than those contemplated at the time of the offering.
 
Table of Contents
We may be unable to invest the net proceeds raised from an offering on acceptable terms, which would harm our financial condition and operating results.
Until we identify new investment opportunities, we intend to either invest the net proceeds of an offering in interest-bearing deposits or other short-term instruments or use the net proceeds from such offering to reduce then-outstanding obligations under our credit facility. We cannot assure you that we will be able to find enough appropriate investments that meet our investment criteria or that any investment we complete using the proceeds from an offering will produce a sufficient return.
Sales of substantial amounts of our securities may have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities.
Sales of substantial amounts of our securities, or the availability of such securities for sale, could adversely affect the prevailing market prices for our securities. If this occurs and continues, it could impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of securities should we desire to do so.
 
Table of Contents
We intend to use the net proceeds from selling securities pursuant to this prospectus for general corporate purposes, which include investing in portfolio companies in accordance with our investment objective and strategies and, pending such investments, either investing the net proceeds of an offering in cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and other high-quality debt instruments that mature in one year or less from the date of investment, to reduce then-outstanding obligations under our credit facility, or for other general corporate purposes. The supplement to this prospectus relating to an offering will more fully identify the use of the proceeds from such offering.
We anticipate that substantially all of the net proceeds of an offering of securities pursuant to this prospectus will be used for the above purposes within two years, depending on the availability of appropriate investment opportunities consistent with our investment objective and market conditions. Our portfolio currently consists primarily of mezzanine loans and senior loans. Pending our investments in new debt investments, we plan to either invest a portion of the net proceeds from an offering in cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and other high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less from the date of investment, to reduce then-outstanding obligations under our credit facility, or for other general corporate purposes. The management fee payable by us will not be reduced while our assets are invested in such securities. See "RegulationTemporary investments" for additional information about temporary investments we may make while waiting to make longer-term investments in pursuit of our investment objective.
 
Table of Contents
We intend to continue to distribute quarterly dividends to our stockholders. Our quarterly dividends, if any, will be determined by our board of directors.
We have elected to be taxed as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. To maintain our RIC status, we must distribute at least 90% of our ordinary income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any, out of the assets legally available for distribution. In order to avoid certain excise taxes imposed on RICs, we currently intend to distribute during each calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98% of our ordinary income for the calendar year, (2) 98% of our capital gains in excess of capital losses for the one-year period ending on October 31st and (3) any ordinary income and net capital gains for preceding years that were not distributed during such years. In addition, although we currently intend to distribute realized net capital gains (, realized net long-term capital gains in excess of realized net short-term capital losses), if any, at least annually, out of the assets legally available for such distributions, we may in the future decide to retain such capital gains for investment. In such event, the consequences of our retention of net capital gains are as described under "Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations."
i.e.
We maintain an "opt out" dividend reinvestment plan for our common stockholders. As a result, if we declare a dividend, then stockholders' cash dividends will be automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock, unless they specifically "opt out" of the dividend reinvestment plan so as to receive cash dividends. See "Dividend Reinvestment Plan."
We may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make dividends and distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these dividends and distributions from time to time. In addition, we may be limited in our ability to make dividends and distributions due to the asset coverage test for borrowings when applicable to us as a business development company under the 1940 Act and due to provisions in future credit facilities. If we do not distribute a certain percentage of our income annually, we will suffer adverse tax consequences, including possible loss of our RIC status. We cannot assure stockholders that they will receive any dividends and distributions or dividends and distributions at a particular level.
With respect to the dividends paid to shareholders, income from origination, structuring, closing, commitment and other upfront fees associated with investments in portfolio companies is treated as taxable income and accordingly, distributed to shareholders.
The following table lists the quarterly dividends per share since shares of our common stock began being regularly quoted on The Nasdaq National Market.

OVERVIEW
Apollo Investment was incorporated under the Maryland General Corporation Law in February 2004. We have elected to be treated as a business development company under the 1940 Act. As such, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. For instance, we generally have to invest at least 70% of our total assets in "qualifying assets," including securities of private or thinly traded public U.S. companies, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less. In addition, for federal income tax purposes we have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Pursuant to this election and assuming we qualify as a RIC, we generally do not have to pay corporate-level federal income taxes on any income we distribute to our stockholders. On April 8, 2004, we completed our initial public offering as an externally managed, non-diversified, closed-end investment company that elected to be treated as a business development company under the 1940 Act. We commenced operations on April 8, 2004 upon receipt of $870 million in net proceeds from our initial public offering of common stock at $15 per share. On March 22, 2006, the Company closed on its second public offering at $17.85 per share, receiving $294 million in total net proceeds from the offering.
Investments
Our level of investment activity can and does vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt and equity capital available to middle market companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity for such companies, the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make. Over the last twelve months, we believe that the availability of senior debt capital from banks for middle market companies has generally increased and has put downward pressure on interest rate spreads at the same time that base interest rates have risen. We do not expect this increased availability of capital to impair our ability to make longer-term investment allocations with our capital. We remain steadfast with our investment discipline in selectively investing in appropriate risk-reward opportunities within the middle market.
As a business development company, we must not acquire any assets other than "qualifying assets" specified in the 1940 Act unless, at the time the acquisition is made, at least 70% of our total assets are qualifying assets (with certain limited exceptions). If we invest in an issuer that, at the time we make the investment, has outstanding securities as to which a broker or dealer may extend or maintain margin credit or "marginable securities," these acquired assets cannot normally be treated as qualifying assets. This treatment results from the definition of "eligible portfolio company" under the 1940 Act, which in part looks to whether a company has outstanding securities that are eligible for margin credit. Amendments promulgated in 1998 by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to Regulation T under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, expanded the definition of marginable security to include any non-equity security. These amendments have raised questions as to whether a private company that has outstanding debt securities would qualify as an eligible portfolio company. We note that under applicable self-regulatory organization rules that govern the ability of brokers and dealers to extend margin credit, many non-equity securities issued by private companies may not be effectively marginable.
To address these questions, the SEC proposed amendments to the 1940 Act to expand the definition of eligible portfolio company in a manner that would promote the flow of capital to small, developing and financially troubled companies. These amendments would define eligible portfolio company with reference to whether a company has any class of securities listed on an exchange. We continue to monitor this issue closely and intend to adjust our investment focus as needed to comply with and/or take advantage of these amendments if they are adopted or of any other future administrative position, judicial decision or legislative action.
Our board of directors approved an amendment to our investment policy to eliminate the 5% limitation on investments in foreign securities. This change was implemented as of August 14, 2004 and any such investments are included as non-qualifying assets.
 
Table of Contents
Revenue
We generate revenue primarily in the form of interest income from the debt securities we hold and capital gains, if any, on investment securities that we may acquire in portfolio companies. Our debt investments, whether in the form of mezzanine or senior secured loans, generally have a stated term of five to ten years and bear interest at a fixed rate or a floating rate usually determined on the basis of a benchmark: LIBOR, EURIBOR, GBP LIBOR, or the prime rate. While subordinated debt and corporate notes typically accrue interest at fixed rates, some of these investments may include zero coupon, payment-in-kind ("PIK") and/or step bonds that accrue income on a constant yield to call or maturity basis. Interest on debt securities is generally payable quarterly or semiannually. In some cases, some of our investments provide for deferred interest payments or PIK. The principal amount of the debt securities and any accrued but unpaid interest generally becomes due at the maturity date. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of commitment, origination, structuring and/or diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and, if applicable, consulting fees, etc.
Expenses
All investment professionals of the investment adviser and their staff, when and to the extent engaged in providing investment advisory and management services to us, and the compensation and routine overhead expenses of that personnel which is allocable to those services are provided and paid for by Apollo Investment Management. We bear all other costs and expenses of our operations and transactions, including those relating to:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table of Contents
We expect our general and administrative operating expenses related to our ongoing operations to remain generally stable or decline slightly as a percentage of our assets in future periods. Incentive fees, interest expense and costs relating to future offerings of securities would be additive.
Portfolio and Investment Activity
For the three months ended June 30, 2006 and June 30, 2005:
During the three months ended June 30, 2006, we invested $286.8 million across 4 new and 5 existing portfolio companies. This compares to investing $250.3 million in 7 new and 4 existing portfolio companies for the three months ended June 30, 2005. Investment sales and pre-payments during the three months ended June 30, 2006 totaled $124.1 million versus $124.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2005. Of the $124.1 million in net proceeds realized during the quarter, $34.0 million were investment sales of senior loans. The remaining $90.1 million were pre-payments by some of our more successful portfolio companies.
At June 30, 2006, our net portfolio consisted of 48 portfolio companies and was invested 63% in subordinated debt, 3% in preferred equity, 9% in common equity and 25% in senior secured loans versus 36 portfolio companies invested 48% in subordinated debt, 2% in common equity, 46% in senior secured loans, and 4% in cash equivalents at June 30, 2005. Our targeted investment size typically ranges between $20 million and $150 million, although this investment size may vary proportionately as the size of our capital base changes.
The weighted average yields on our subordinated debt portfolio, senior secured loan portfolio and total debt portfolio were 13.6%, 12.7% and 13.3%, respectively, at June 30, 2006 versus 13.6%, 10.0% and 11.8%, respectively, at June 30, 2005.
Senior secured loans and European mezzanine loans typically accrue interest at variable rates determined on the basis of a benchmark: LIBOR, EURIBOR, GBP LIBOR, or the prime rate, with stated maturities at origination that typically range from 5 to 10 years. While subordinated debt issued within the United States will typically accrue interest at fixed rates, some of these investments may include zero-coupon, PIK and/or step bonds that accrue income on a constant yield to call or maturity basis. At June 30, 2006, 55% or $903.8 million of our interest-bearing portfolio is fixed rate debt and 45% or $725.9 million is floating rate debt.
During our second fiscal year ended March 31, 2006, we invested $1.1 billion across 26 new and 10 existing portfolio companies. This compares to investing $894.3 million in 37 portfolio companies for the previous fiscal year ended March 31, 2005. Investments sold or prepaid during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 totaled $452.3 million versus $71.7 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005. Of the $452.3 million in net proceeds realized during fiscal 2006, $307.6 million were investment sales of senior loans and lower yielding corporate notes as we executed our second year plan of rationalizing our portfolio. The remaining $144.7 million were pre-payments by some of our more successful portfolio companies.
For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 and for the period April 8, 2004 (commencement of operations) through March 31, 2005:
At March 31, 2006, our net portfolio consisted of 46 portfolio companies and was invested 60% in subordinated debt, 2% in preferred equity, 7% in common equity and 31% in senior secured loans versus 35 portfolio companies invested 51% in subordinated debt, 3% in common equity, 42% in senior secured loans, and 4% in cash equivalents at March 31, 2005. Our targeted investment size typically ranges between $20 million and $150 million, although this investment size may vary proportionately as the size of our capital base changes.
The weighted average yields on our subordinated debt portfolio, senior secured loan portfolio and total debt portfolio were 13.6%, 12.2% and 13.1%, respectively, at March 31, 2006 versus 13.7%, 8.2% and 10.5%, respectively, at March 31, 2005.
 
Table of Contents
Senior secured loans and European mezzanine loans typically accrue interest at variable rates determined on the basis of a benchmark: LIBOR, EURIBOR, GBP LIBOR, or the prime rate, with stated maturities at origination that typically range from 5 to 10 years. While subordinated debt issued within the United States will typically accrue interest at fixed rates, some of these investments may include zero-coupon, PIK and/or step bonds that accrue income on a constant yield to call or maturity basis. At March 31, 2006, 53% or $764.5 million of our interest-bearing portfolio is fixed rate debt and 47% or $683.3 million is floating rate debt.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. In addition to the discussion below, our critical accounting policies are further described in the notes to the financial statements.
Valuation of Portfolio Investments
As a business development company, we generally invest in illiquid securities including debt and equity securities of middle market companies. Under procedures established by our board of directors, we value investments, including certain subordinated debt, senior secured debt and other debt securities with maturities greater than 60 days, for which market quotations are readily available at such market quotations. We obtain these market values from an independent pricing service or at the mean between the bid and ask prices obtained from at least two brokers or dealers (if available, otherwise by a principal market maker or a primary market dealer). Debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded or whose market prices are not readily available are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of our board of directors. Such determination of fair values may involve subjective judgments and estimates. Investments purchased within 60 days of maturity are valued at cost plus accreted discount, or minus amortized premium, which approximates value. With respect to unquoted securities, our board of directors, together with our independent valuation adviser, values each investment considering, among other measures, discounted cash flow models, comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public and other factors.
When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, our board will use the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate and/or assist us in our valuation. Because we expect that there will not be a readily available market for many of the investments in our portfolio, we expect to value many of our portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of our board of directors using a documented valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value existed for such investments, and the differences could be material.
With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, our board of directors undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below:

Revenue Recognition
We record interest income on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. For loans and debt securities with contractual PIK interest, which represents contractual interest accrued and added to the loan balance that generally becomes due at maturity, we will not accrue PIK interest if the portfolio company valuation indicates that the PIK interest is not collectible. We do not accrue as a receivable interest on loans and debt securities if we have reason to doubt our ability to collect such interest. Loan origination fees, original issue discount, and market discount are capitalized and then we amortize such amounts as interest income. Upon the prepayment of a loan or debt security, any unamortized loan origination fees are recorded as interest income. We record prepayment premiums on loans and debt securities as interest income when we receive such amounts.
Net Realized Gains or Losses and Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation or Depreciation
We measure realized gains or losses by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment, without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized, but considering unamortized upfront fees and prepayment penalties. Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflects the change in portfolio investment values during the reporting period, including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation, when gains or losses are realized.
Within the context of these critical accounting policies, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Results of operations for the three months ended June 30, 2006 and June 30, 2005.
Investment Income
For the three months ended June 30, 2006 and June 30, 2005, gross investment income totaled $55.9 million and $37.8 million, respectively. The increase in investment income for the three months ended June 30, 2006 was primarily due to the continued growth and asset mix of our investment portfolio as compared to the year-ago period. Other notable events impacting investment income include a dividend of $4.9 million from a dividend recapitalization of LM Acquisition, Ltd. and a write-off of $0.6 million of accrued interest income on our senior secured position in Diam International. Diam International is now in non-accrual status. Origination, closing and/or commitment fees associated with investments in portfolio companies are accreted into interest income over the respective terms of the applicable loans.
Expenses
Expenses totaled $24.1 million and $12.5 million, respectively, for the three months ended June 30, 2006 and June 30, 2005. Of these totals, $7.9 million and $6.3 million, respectively, were performance-based incentive fees and $5.6 million and $0.5 million, respectively, were interest and other credit facility expenses. Expenses net of performance-based incentive fees, interest, and other credit facility expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2006 and June 30, 2005 were $10.6 million and $5.7 million, respectively. These net expenses consist of
 
Table of Contents
base investment advisory and management fees, insurance expenses, administrative services expenses, professional fees, directors' fees, audit and tax services expenses, and other general and administrative expenses. The increase in expenses was primarily due to an increase in base investment advisory and management fees resulting from the growth of our investment portfolio.
Net Investment Income
The Company's net investment income totaled $31.7 million and $25.2 million or $0.39 per share and $0.40 per share, respectively, for the three months ended June 30, 2006 and June 30, 2005.
Net Realized Gains/Losses
The Company had investment sales totaling $124.1 million and $124.5 million, respectively, for the three months ended June 30, 2006 and June 30, 2005. Total net realized losses for the three months ended June 30, 2006 were $3.0 million versus total net realized gains for the three months ended June 30, 2005 of $6.8 million. Of the $3.0 million net realized loss, $2.9 million of the loss was attributable to a currency hedge loss on the settlement of our forward Euro contract in June.
Net Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) on Investments and Foreign Currency Contracts and Translations
For the three months ended June 30, 2006 and June 30, 2005, the Company's investments, foreign currencies and other assets and liabilities had a net increase in appreciation of $42.4 million and a net decrease in appreciation of $18.5 million, respectively. At June 30, 2006, net unrealized appreciation totaled $80.7 million, of which $90.8 million was attributable to net unrealized appreciation on our subordinated debt and private equity (after considering the effects of foreign currency borrowing/hedging for our non-U.S. investments) and $10.1 million was attributable to net unrealized depreciation on our bank debt/senior secured debt.
Net Increase in Net Assets From Operations
For the three months ended June 30, 2006 and June 30, 2005, the Company had a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of $71.2 million and $13.6 million, respectively. The net change in net assets from operations per share was $0.88 and $0.22, respectively, for the three months ended June 30, 2006 and June 30, 2005.
Results of operations for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 and for the period April 8, 2004 (commencement of operations) through March 31, 2005.
Investment Income
For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 and for the period April 8, 2004 (commencement of operations) through March 31, 2005, gross investment income totaled $152.8 million and $47.8 million, respectively. Our significantly lower gross investment income for the period April 8, 2004 (commencement of operations) through March 31, 2005 reflects income earned primarily from short-term U.S. Government securities and other temporary investments held during the ramp-up period of our portfolio since our initial public offering. Accordingly, the increase in gross investment income for fiscal year 2006 was primarily due to the growth of our investment portfolio as compared to the previous fiscal year where we were investing the IPO net proceeds over the course of such year. Origination, closing and/or commitment fees associated with investments in portfolio companies are accreted into interest income over the respective terms of the applicable loans.
Expenses
Expenses totaled $63.7 million and $22.4 million, respectively, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 and for the period April 8, 2004 (commencement of operations) through March 31, 2005, of which $22.3 million and $0.0 million, respectively, were performance-based incentive fees and $13.0 million and $0.0 million,

respectively, were interest and other credit facility expenses. Expenses net of performance-based incentive fees and interest and other credit facility expenses for the year ended March 31, 2006 and for the period April 8, 2004 (commencement of operations) through March 31, 2005 were $28.5 million and $22.4 million, respectively. Of these expenses, general and administrative expenses totaled $5.1 million and $5.1 million, respectively, for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2006 and 2005. Expenses consist of base investment advisory and management fees, insurance expenses, administrative services fees, professional fees, directors' fees, audit and tax services expenses, and other general and administrative expenses. The increase in expenses net of performance-based incentive fees and interest and other credit facility expenses was primarily due to the increase in base management fees related to the growth of our investment portfolio as compared to the comparative period.
Net Investment Income
The Company's net investment income totaled $89.1 million and $25.5 million or $1.40 per share and $0.41 per share, respectively, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 and for the period April 8, 2004 (commencement of operations) through March 31, 2005.
Net Realized Gains/Losses
The Company had investment sales totaling $452.3 million and $71.7 million, respectively, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 and for the period April 8, 2004 (commencement of operations) through March 31, 2005. Total net realized gains for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 and for the period April 8, 2004 (commencement of operations) through March 31, 2005 were $11.2 million and $0.5 million, respectively.
Net Unrealized Appreciation on Investments and Foreign Currency Contracts and Translations
For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 and for the period April 8, 2004 (commencement of operations) through March 31, 2005, the Company's investments, foreign currencies and other assets and liabilities had a net increase in appreciation of $20.1 million and $18.2 million, respectively. At March 31, 2006, net unrealized appreciation totaled $38.3 million of which $4.1 million was attributable to net unrealized appreciation on our bank debt/senior secured debt and $34.2 million was attributable to net unrealized appreciation on our subordinated debt and private equity (after considering the effects of foreign currency borrowing/hedging for our non-U.S. investments).
Net Increase in Net Assets From Operations
For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 and for the period April 8, 2004 (commencement of operations) through March 31, 2005, the Company had a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of $120.4 million and $44.1 million, respectively. The net change in net assets from operations per share was $1.90 and $0.71, respectively, for the year ended March 31, 2006 and for the period April 8, 2004 (commencement of operations) through March 31, 2005.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
The Company's liquidity and capital resources are generated primarily through its senior secured, multi-currency $1.25 billion, five-year credit facility maturing in April 2011 as well as from cash flows from operations, including investment sales and prepayments of senior and subordinated loans and income earned from investments and cash equivalents (which normally comprise of U.S. government securities and other high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less). At June 30, 2006, the Company had $536 million in borrowings outstanding and $714 million available for its use. In the future, the Company may raise additional equity capital off its shelf registration or may securitize a portion of its investments. It may also further access $750 million of additional credit commitments available under the terms of its current credit facility as the Company's equity capital base grows. The primary use of funds will be investments in portfolio companies, cash distributions to holders of common stock and for other general corporate purposes.
 
Table of Contents
On March 22, 2006, we raised $294 million, net of underwriting commission and expenses in a follow-on stock offering in which the company sold 17,250,000 shares (including the underwriters' over-allotment) at $17.85 per share. Net proceeds from the follow-on offering were primarily used to repay borrowings outstanding on the Company's revolving credit facility and for other general corporate purposes.
Contractual Obligations
We have entered into two contracts under which we have future commitments: the investment advisory and management agreement, pursuant to which Apollo Investment Management has agreed to serve as our investment adviser, and the administration agreement, pursuant to which Apollo Administration has agreed to furnish us with the facilities and administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations and provide on our behalf managerial assistance to those portfolio companies to which we are required to provide such assistance. Payments under the investment advisory and management agreement are equal to (1) a percentage of the value of our gross assets and (2) a two-part incentive fee. Payments under the administration agreement are equal to an amount based upon our allocable portion of Apollo Administration's overhead in performing its obligations under the administration agreement, including rent, technology systems, insurance and our allocable portion of the costs of our chief financial officer and chief compliance officer and their respective staffs. Either party may terminate each of the investment advisory and management agreement and administration agreement without penalty upon not more than 60 days' written notice to the other. Please see Note 3 within our financial statements for more information.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
At June 30, 2006, we did not have any off-balance sheet liabilities or other contractual obligations that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, other than the investment advisory and management agreement and the administration agreement.
Dividends
Dividends paid to stockholders for the three months ended June 30, 2006 totaled $36.5 million or $0.45 per share versus $19.4 million or $0.31 per share for the three months ended June 30, 2005. Dividends paid to stockholders for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 totaled $102.7 million or $1.63 per share versus $30.2 million or $0.485 per share for the period April 8, 2004 (commencement of operations) through March 31, 2005. The following table summarizes our quarterly dividends paid to shareholders for the three months ended June 30, 2006 and for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively:
 
 
Table of Contents
Tax characteristics of all dividends will be reported to shareholders on Form 1099 after the end of the calendar year.
We have elected to be taxed as a regulated investment company under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. In order to maintain our status as a regulated investment company, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our investment company taxable income. Further, we must distribute at least 98% of our income (both ordinary net income and capital gain net income) to avoid an excise tax. We intend to make distributions to our stockholders on a quarterly basis of substantially all of our taxable net income. We also intend to make distributions of net realized capital gains, if any, at least annually.
We may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these distributions from time to time. In addition, we may be limited in our ability to make distributions due to the asset coverage test for borrowings when applicable to us as a business development company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and due to provisions in our credit facilities. If we do not distribute a certain percentage of our income annually, we will suffer adverse tax consequences, including possible loss of our status as a regulated investment company. We cannot assure stockholders that they will receive any distributions or distributions at a particular level.
With respect to the dividends paid to shareholders, income from origination, structuring, closing, commitment and other upfront fees associated with investments in portfolio companies is treated as taxable income and accordingly, distributed to shareholders. For the three months ended June 30, 2006, upfront fees totaling $2.7 million are being amortized into income over the lives of their respective loans and for the three months ended June 30, 2005, upfront fees totaled $0.4 million. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006, upfront fees totaling $5.8 million are being amortized into income over the lives of their respective loans, and for the period from April 8, 2004 (commencement of operations) through March 31, 2005, upfront fees totaled $4.5 million.

Our common stock is quoted on The Nasdaq National Market under the symbol "AINV". The following table lists the high and low closing bid price for our common stock, the closing bid price as a percentage of net asset value, or NAV and quarterly dividends per share since shares of our common stock began being regularly quoted on The Nasdaq National Market. On August 8, 2006, the last reported closing price of our common stock was $19.34 per share.
 
While our common stock currently trades in excess of our net asset value, there can be no assurance, however, that our shares will continue to trade at such a premium (to net asset value). As of August 8, 2006, we had 40 shareholders of record.

Apollo Investment
Apollo Investment Corporation ("Apollo Investment" or the "Company"), a Maryland corporation organized on February 2, 2004, is a closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that has filed an election to be treated as a business development company ("BDC") under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act"). In addition, for tax purposes we have elected to be treated as a regulated investment company, or RIC, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
Our investment objective is to generate both current income and capital appreciation through debt and equity investments. We intend to invest primarily in middle-market companies in the form of mezzanine and senior secured loans, as well as by making direct equity investments in such companies. From time to time, we may also invest in public companies whose securities are thinly traded.
We commenced operations on April 8, 2004, at which time we closed our initial public offering and sold 62,000,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $15.00 per share, receiving $870 million in total net proceeds from the offering. On March 22, 2006, we closed our second public offering and sold 17,250,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $17.85 per share, receiving $294 million in total net proceeds from the offering.
In April 2005 and shortly after the Company's first fiscal year, we closed on an $800,000,000, multi-currency, five year, senior secured credit facility (the "Facility") with a group of banks. In December 2005, we increased commitments under the facility to $900,000,000 among existing and new lenders. Furthermore, in March 2006, we amended and restated the Facility to increase total commitments to $1,250,000,000 and extend the maturity an additional year. The interest rate applicable to borrowings under the Facility remains at LIBOR plus 100 basis points. We are permitted as a business development company to issue senior securities only in amounts such that our asset coverage equals at least 200% after each issuance of senior securities. As of June 30, 2006, we have $536 million drawn and outstanding on our $1.25 billion credit facility with $714 million available to us. We expect that our substantial debt capital resources will provide us with the flexibility to take advantage of investment opportunities when they arise.
During the three months ended June 30, 2006, we invested $286.8 million across 4 new and 5 existing portfolio companies. This compares to investing $250.3 million in 7 new and 4 existing portfolio companies for the three months ended June 30, 2005. Investment sales and pre-payments during the three months ended June 30, 2006 totaled $124.1 million versus $124.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2005. Of the $124.1 million in net proceeds realized during the quarter, $34.0 million were investment sales of senior loans. The remaining $90.1 million were pre-payments by some of our more successful portfolio companies.
During our fiscal year ended March 31, 2006, we invested $1.1 billion across 26 new and 10 existing portfolio companies. This compares to investing $894.3 million in 37 portfolio companies for the previous fiscal year ended March 31, 2005. Investments sold or prepaid during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 totaled $452.3 million versus $71.7 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005. Of the $452.3 million in net proceeds realized during fiscal 2006, $307.6 million were investment sales of senior loans and lower yielding corporate notes as we executed our second year plan of rationalizing our portfolio. The remaining $144.7 million were pre-payments by some of our more successful portfolio companies.
The weighted average yields on our subordinated debt portfolio, senior secured loan portfolio and total debt portfolio were 13.6%, 12.7% and 13.3%, respectively, at June 30, 2006.
Our targeted investment size typically ranges between $20 million and $150 million, although this investment size may vary proportionately as the size of our capital base changes. At June 30, 2006, our net portfolio consisted of 48 portfolio companies and was invested 63% in subordinated debt, 3% in preferred equity, 9% in common equity and 25% in senior secured loans. As of June 30, 2006, our average investment size was approximately $37 million.
 
Table of Contents
Senior secured loans and European mezzanine loans typically accrue interest at variable rates determined on the basis of a benchmark: LIBOR, EURIBOR, GBP LIBOR, or the prime rate, with stated maturities at origination that typically range from 5 to 10 years. While subordinated debt issued within the United States will typically accrue interest at fixed rates, some of these investments may include zero-coupon, payment-in-kind ("PIK") and/or step bonds that accrue income on a constant yield to call or maturity basis. At June 30, 2006, 55% or $903.8 million of our interest-bearing portfolio is fixed rate debt and 45% or $725.9 million is floating rate debt.
About Apollo
Founded in 1990, Apollo is a recognized leader in private equity investing, having invested more than $14 billion in over 150 companies since its founding. Since its inception, Apollo has raised in excess of $25 billion in capital, primarily from institutional investors. Apollo traditionally has focused on companies that it believes are undervalued yet have successful business models, strong cash flows and prospects for value creation. The Apollo investment professionals' disciplined, value-oriented strategy has sought to identify opportunities in all investment environments, selecting from a range of approaches, such as traditional or corporate partner buyouts, distressed debt buyouts or more liquid, non-control distressed debt investments. The Apollo investment professionals have sought through this strategy to provide investors with attractive returns while minimizing the risk of capital loss throughout economic cycles.
Apollo's active private equity investment funds focus on making either control-oriented equity investments of $200 million or more or distressed debt investments, either for control or non-control positions. In contrast, we seek to capitalize on the significant investment opportunities emerging in the mezzanine segment of the lending market for middle-market companies, which we believe offers the potential for attractive risk-adjusted returns.
About Apollo Investment Management
Apollo Investment Management, our investment adviser, is led by a dedicated team of 12 investment professionals and is further supported by Apollo's team of approximately 48 investment professionals. This team has invested more than $2.25 billion in 67 companies in transactions with more than 50 different financial sponsors since commencement of operations in April 2004. In addition, Apollo Investment Management expects to hire additional investment professionals in the future. Apollo Investment Management's investment committee currently consists of John J. Hannan, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and a managing partner of Apollo Investment Management, Arthur H. Penn, our President and Chief Operating Officer, and a co-founder and managing partner of Apollo Investment Management, Patrick J. Dalton, a partner of Apollo Investment Management, Edward Tam, a partner of Apollo Investment Management, Jose Briones, a partner of Apollo Investment Management and James Zelter, a managing partner of Apollo's capital markets business, which includes Apollo Investment Management. The composition of the Investment Committee of Apollo Investment Management may change from time to time. Apollo Investment Management draws upon Apollo's 16-year history and benefits from the Apollo investment professionals' significant capital markets, trading and research expertise developed through investments in 25 different industries and over 150 companies in the United States and Western Europe.
About Apollo Investment Administration
In addition to furnishing us with office facilities, equipment, and clerical, bookkeeping and record keeping services, Apollo Investment Administration also oversees our financial records as well as the preparation of our reports to stockholders and reports filed with the SEC. AIA oversees the determination and publication of our net asset value, oversees the preparation and filing of our tax returns, and generally monitors the payment of our expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to us by others. Furthermore, AIA provides on our behalf managerial assistance to those portfolio companies to which we are required to provide such assistance.

Operating and Regulatory Structure
Our investment activities are managed by Apollo Investment Management and supervised by our board of directors, a majority of whom are independent of Apollo and its affiliates. Apollo Investment Management is an investment adviser that is registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Under our investment advisory and management agreement, we pay Apollo Investment Management an annual base management fee based on our gross assets as well as an incentive fee based on our performance.
As a business development company, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. Also, while we are permitted to finance investments using debt, our ability to use debt is limited in certain significant respects. We have elected to be treated for federal income tax purposes as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code.
Investments
Apollo Investment seeks to create a portfolio that includes mezzanine, senior secured loans and private equity by generally investing approximately $20 million to $150 million of capital, on average, in the securities of middle-market companies. Our target portfolio will be more heavily weighted toward mezzanine loans. Structurally, mezzanine loans usually rank subordinate in priority of payment to senior debt, such as senior bank debt, and are often unsecured. As such, other creditors may rank senior to us in the event of a insolvency. However, mezzanine loans rank senior to common and preferred equity in a borrowers' capital structure. Mezzanine loans may have a fixed or floating interest rate. Additional upside can be generated from upfront fees, call protection including call premiums, equity co-investments or warrants. We believe that mezzanine loans offer an attractive investment opportunity based upon their historic returns and resilience during economic downturns. Additionally, we may acquire investments in the secondary market.
Our principal focus is to provide mezzanine and senior secured loans to middle-market companies in a variety of industries. We generally seek to target companies that generate positive free cash flows. We also generally seek to invest in companies from the broad variety of industries in which Apollo's investment professionals have direct expertise.
The following is a representative list of the industries in which we have invested:
 
 
Table of Contents
We may also invest in other industries if we are presented with attractive opportunities.
In an effort to increase our returns and the number of loans that we can make, we may in the future seek to securitize our loans. To securitize loans, we would create a wholly owned subsidiary and contribute a pool of loans to the subsidiary. We would sell interests in the subsidiary on a non-recourse basis to purchasers who we would expect to be willing to accept a lower interest rate to invest in investment-grade loan pools. We may use the proceeds of such sales to pay down bank debt or to fund additional investment.
We may invest, to the extent permitted by law, in the securities and instruments of other investment companies, including private funds.
Apollo Investment Management and its affiliates manage other funds that may have investment mandates that are similar, in whole or in part, with ours. Apollo Investment Management and its affiliates may determine that an investment is appropriate both for us and for one or more of those other funds. In such event, depending on the availability of such investment and other appropriate factors, Apollo Investment Management may determine that we should invest on a side-by-side basis with one or more other funds. We do not anticipate making an initial investment in any portfolio company in which Apollo or any affiliate has a pre-existing investment. We may make all such investments subject to compliance with applicable regulations and interpretations, and our allocation procedures. Certain types of negotiated co-investments may be made only if we receive an order from the SEC permitting us to do so. There can be no assurance that any such order will be obtained.
At June 30, 2006, our portfolio was invested 63% in subordinated debt, 3% in preferred equity, 9% in common equity and 25% in senior secured loans. We expect that our portfolio will continue to include primarily mezzanine loans, senior secured loans, and equity related securities. In addition to mezzanine and senior secured loans, we invest a portion of our portfolio in opportunistic investments, which are not our primary focus, but are intended to enhance our returns to stockholders. These investments may include, but are not limited to, high-yield bonds, distressed debt investments and securities of public companies that are not thinly traded. We expect that these public companies generally will have debt securities that are non-investment grade. Within this portion, we also invest in debt and equity securities of middle-market companies located outside of the United States.
Listed below are our top ten portfolio companies and industries represented as a percentage of total assets for the respective years ended March 31, 2006 and 2005 (percentage owned can be expected to change over time):

Investment Selection
We are committed to the same value oriented philosophy used by the investment professionals of Apollo in Apollo's private investment funds and will commit resources to managing downside exposure.
Prospective portfolio company characteristics
We have identified several criteria that we believe are important in identifying and investing in prospective portfolio companies. These criteria provide general guidelines for our investment decisions; however, we caution you that not all of these criteria will be met by each prospective portfolio company in which we choose to invest. Generally, we seek to utilize our access to information generated by our investment professionals to identify investment candidates and to structure investments quickly and effectively.
 
Table of Contents
Value orientation/positive cash flow
Our investment philosophy places a premium on fundamental analysis from an investor's perspective and has a distinct value orientation. We focus on companies in which we can invest at relatively low multiples of operating cash flow and that are profitable at the time of investment on an operating cash flow basis. Typically, we do not expect to invest in start-up companies or companies having speculative business plans.
Experienced management
We generally require that our portfolio companies have an experienced management team. We also require the portfolio companies to have in place proper incentives to induce management to succeed and to act in concert with our interests as investors, including having significant equity interests.
Strong competitive position in industry
We seek to invest in target companies that have developed leading market positions within their respective markets and are well positioned to capitalize on growth opportunities. We seek companies that demonstrate significant competitive advantages versus their competitors, which should help to protect their market position and profitability.
Exit strategy
We seek to invest in companies that we believe will provide a steady stream of cash flow to repay our loans. We expect that such internally generated cash flow, leading to the payment of interest on, and the repayment of the principal of, our investments in portfolio companies to be a key means by which we exit from our investments over time. In addition, we seek to invest in companies whose business models and expected future cash flows offer attractive exit possibilities. These companies include candidates for strategic acquisition by other industry participants and companies that may repay our investments through an initial public offering of common stock or another capital market transaction.
Liquidation value of assets
The prospective liquidation value of the assets, if any, collateralizing loans in which we invest is an important factor in our credit analysis. We emphasize both tangible assets, such as accounts receivable, inventory, equipment and real estate, and intangible assets, such as intellectual property, customer lists, networks and databases.
Due diligence
Our investment adviser conducts diligence on prospective portfolio companies consistent with the approach adopted by the investment professionals of Apollo. We believe that Apollo's investment professionals have a reputation for conducting extensive due diligence investigations in their investment activities.

Investment structure
Once we have determined that a prospective portfolio company is suitable for investment, we work with the management of that company and its other capital providers, including senior, junior and equity capital providers, to structure an investment.
We seek to structure our mezzanine investments primarily as unsecured, subordinated loans that provide for relatively high interest rates that provide us with significant current interest income. These loans typically have interest-only payments in the early years, with amortization of principal deferred to the later years of the mezzanine loans. In some cases, we may enter into loans that, by their terms, convert into equity or additional debt securities or defer payments of interest after our investment. Also, in some cases our mezzanine loans may be collateralized by a subordinated lien on some or all of the assets of the borrower. Typically, our mezzanine loans have maturities of five to ten years. We generally target a gross return of 12% to 18% for our mezzanine loan investments.
We also seek to invest in portfolio companies in the form of senior secured loans. We expect these senior secured loans to have terms of three to ten years and may provide for deferred interest payments over the term of the loan. We generally seek to obtain security interests in the assets of our portfolio companies that serve as collateral in support of the repayment of these loans. This collateral may take the form of first or second priority liens on the assets of a portfolio company. We expect that the interest rate on our senior secured loans generally will range between 2% and 10% over the London Interbank Offer Rate, or LIBOR.
In the case of our mezzanine and senior secured loan investments, we seek to tailor the terms of the investment to the facts and circumstances of the transaction and the prospective portfolio company, negotiating a structure that protects our rights and manages our risk while creating incentives for the portfolio company to achieve its business plan and improve its profitability. For example, in addition to seeking a senior position in the capital structure of our portfolio companies, we seek to limit the downside potential of our investments by:
 
 
 
Our investments may include equity features, such as warrants or options to buy a minority interest in the portfolio company. Any warrants we receive with our debt securities generally require only a nominal cost to exercise, and thus, as a portfolio company appreciates in value, we may achieve additional investment return from this equity interest. We may structure the warrants to provide provisions protecting our rights as a minority-interest holder, as well as puts, or rights to sell such securities back to the company, upon the occurrence of specified events. In many cases, we may also seek to obtain registration rights in connection with these equity interests, which may include demand and "piggyback" registration rights. With respect to preferred equity and
 
Table of Contents
common equity investments, we target an investment return of at least 14% and 20%, respectively. However, we can offer no assurance that we can achieve such a return with respect to any investment or our portfolio as a whole.
We expect to hold most of our investments to maturity or repayment, but we may sell certain of our investments earlier, including, if a liquidity event takes place such as the sale or recapitalization or worsening of credit quality of a portfolio company.
Managerial assistance
As a business development company, we offer, and must provide upon request, managerial assistance to our portfolio companies. This assistance could involve, among other things, monitoring the operations of our portfolio companies, participating in board and management meetings, consulting with and advising officers of portfolio companies and providing other organizational and financial guidance. We may receive fees for these services. Apollo Administration provides such managerial assistance on our behalf to portfolio companies that request this assistance.
Ongoing relationships with portfolio companies
Monitoring
Apollo Investment Management monitors our portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. Apollo Investment Management monitors the financial trends of each portfolio company to determine if each is meeting its respective business plans and to assess the appropriate course of action for each company.
Apollo Investment Management has several methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance and fair value of our investments, which can include, but are not limited to, the following:
 
 
 
 
 
In addition to various risk management and monitoring tools, Apollo Investment Management also uses an investment rating system to characterize and monitor our expected level of returns on each investment in our portfolio.
We use an investment rating scale of 1 to 5. The following is a description of the conditions associated with each investment rating:
 
 
Table of Contents
Apollo Investment Management monitors and, when appropriate, changes the investment ratings assigned to each investment in our portfolio. In connection with our valuation process, Apollo Investment Management reviews these investment ratings on a quarterly basis, and our board of directors affirms such ratings.
Valuation Process
The following is a description of the steps we take each quarter to determine the value of our portfolio. Many of our portfolio investments are recorded at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors. As a result, there is uncertainty as to the value of our portfolio investments. Investments for which market quotations are readily available are recorded in our financial statements at such market quotations. With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, our board of directors undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below:
 
 
 
 
 
When we make investments that involve deferrals of interest payable to us, any increase in the value of the investment due to the accrual or receipt of payment of interest is allocated to the increase in the cost basis of the investment, rather than to capital appreciation or gain.
Competition
Our primary competitors in providing financing to middle-market companies include public and private funds, commercial and investment banks, commercial financing companies, and, to the extent they provide an alternative form of financing, private equity funds. Additionally, because competition for investment opportunities generally has increased among alternative investment vehicles, such as hedge funds, those entities have begun to invest in areas they have not traditionally invested in, including investments in middle-market companies. As a result of these new entrants, competition for investment opportunities at middle-market companies has intensified. Some of our existing and potential competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. For example, some competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that are not available to us. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than us. Furthermore, many of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the 1940 Act imposes on us as a business development company. We expect to use the industry information of Apollo's investment professionals to which we have access to assess investment risks and determine appropriate pricing for our investments in portfolio companies. In addition, we believe that the relationships of the senior managers of Apollo Investment Management and of the senior partners of Apollo, enable us to learn about, and compete effectively for, financing opportunities with attractive middle-market companies in the industries in which we seek to invest.

Management fee
Pursuant to the investment advisory and management agreement, we pay Apollo Investment Management a fee for investment advisory and management services consisting of two componentsa base management fee and an incentive fee. For the year ended March 31, 2006, we paid base management fees in the aggregate total amount of $23.4 million to Apollo Investment Management for such investment advisory and management services. For the year ended March 31, 2006, we paid incentive fees in the amount of $22.3 million.
 
Table of Contents
The base management fee is calculated at an annual rate of 2.00% of our gross assets. For services that were rendered under the investment advisory and management agreement during the period commencing on the closing of our initial public offering through and including our first six months of operations, the base management fee was payable monthly in arrears. Thereafter, the base management fee has been payable quarterly in arrears. For the first quarter of our operations, the base management fee was calculated based on the initial value of our gross assets. The base management fee is now calculated based on the average value of our gross assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters, and appropriately adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the current calendar quarter. Base management fees for any partial month or quarter are appropriately pro rated.
The incentive fee has two parts, as follows: one part is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on our pre-incentive fee net investment income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter. For this purpose, pre-incentive fee net investment income means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees (other than fees for providing managerial assistance), such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that we receive from portfolio companies) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus our operating expenses for the quarter (including the base management fee, any expenses payable under the Administration Agreement, and any interest expense and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee). Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not include any realized capital gains computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation. Pre-incentive fee net investment income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, is compared to the hurdle rate of 1.75% per quarter (7% annualized). Our net investment income used to calculate this part of the incentive fee is also included in the amount of our gross assets used to calculate the 2% base management fee. We pay Apollo Investment Management an incentive fee with respect to our pre-incentive fee net investment income in each calendar quarter as follows:
 
 
 
The following is a graphical representation of the calculation of the income-related portion of the incentive fee:
 
Table of Contents
These calculations are appropriately pro rated for any period of less than three months and adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the relevant quarter. You should be aware that a rise in the general level of interest rates can be expected to lead to higher interest rates applicable to our debt investments. Accordingly, an increase in interest rates would make it easier for us to meet or exceed the incentive fee hurdle rate and may result in a substantial increase of the amount of incentive fees payable to our investment adviser with respect to pre-incentive fee net investment income.
The second part of the incentive fee is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Investment Advisory and Management Agreement, as of the termination date), commenced on December 31, 2004, and will equal 20.0% of our realized capital gains for each calendar year computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation and incorporating unrealized depreciation on a gross investment-by-investment basis at the end of such year. Capital gains with respect to any investment will equal the difference between the proceeds from the sale of such investment and the accreted or amortized cost basis of such investment.
The incentive fee determined as of December 31, 2004 was calculated for a period of shorter than twelve calendar months to take into account any realized capital gains computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation for the period ending December 31, 2004 and was determined to be zero.
Examples of Quarterly Incentive Fee Calculation

Assumptions
Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 1.25%
Hurdle rate (1) = 1.75%
Management fee (2) = 0.50%
Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.) (3) = 0.20%
Pre-incentive fee net investment income
(investment income  (management fee + other expenses)) = 0.55%
Pre-incentive net investment income does not exceed hurdle rate, therefore there is no incentive fee.

Assumptions
Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 2.70%
Hurdle rate (1) = 1.75%
Management fee (2) = 0.50%
Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.) (3) = 0.20%
Pre-incentive fee net investment income
(investment income  (management fee + other expenses)) = 2.00%
Incentive fee = 100%  pre-incentive fee net investment income, subject to the "catch-up" (4)

Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.) (3) = 0.20%
Pre-incentive fee net investment income

Incentive fee = (100%  0.4375%) + (20%  (2.3%  2.1875%))
= 0.4375% + (20%  0.1125%)

Duration and termination
The continuation of our investment advisory and management agreement was approved by our board of directors on March 15, 2006. Unless terminated earlier as described below, it will remain in effect from year to year if approved annually by our board of directors or by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities, including, in either case, approval by a majority of our directors who are not interested persons. The investment advisory and management agreement will automatically terminate in the event of its assignment. Either party may terminate the investment advisory and management agreement without penalty upon not more than 60 days' written notice to the other party. See "Risk FactorsRisks relating to our business and structureWe are dependent upon Apollo Investment Management's key personnel for our future success and upon their access to Apollo's investment professionals and partners."

Board approval of the Investment Advisory and Management Agreement
At a meeting of our board of directors held on March 15, 2006, the board of directors, including all of the directors who are not "interested persons" of the Company as defined in the 1940 Act, unanimously voted to approve the continuation of the investment advisory and management agreement. The independent directors had the opportunity to consult in executive session with their counsel regarding the approval of such agreement. In reaching a decision to approve the continuation of the investment advisory and management agreement, the board of directors reviewed a significant amount of information and considered, among other things:
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table of Contents
In approving the continuation of the investment advisory and management agreement, the entire board of directors, including all of the directors who are not "interested persons," made the following conclusions:
 
 
 
 
Based on the information reviewed and the discussions detailed above, the board of directors (including all of the directors who are not "interested persons") concluded that the investment advisory and management fee rates and terms are fair and reasonable in relation to the services provided and approved the continuation of investment advisory and management agreement with the investment adviser as being in the best interests of the company and its stockholders.
In view of the wide variety of factors that our board of directors considered in connection with its evaluation of the investment advisory and management agreement, it is not practical to quantify, rank or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors it considered in reaching its decision. The board of directors did not undertake to make any specific determination as to whether any particular factor, or any aspect of any particular factor, was favorable or unfavorable to the ultimate determination of the board of directors. Rather, our board of directors based its approval on the totality of information presented to, and the investigation review by, it. In considering the factors discussed above, individual directors may have given different weights to different factors.

ADMINISTRATION AGREEMENT
Pursuant to a separate administration agreement, Apollo Administration furnishes us with office facilities, equipment and clerical, bookkeeping and record keeping services at such facilities. Under the administration agreement, Apollo Administration also performs, or oversee the performance of, our required administrative services, which include, among other things, being responsible for the financial records which we are required to maintain and preparing reports to our stockholders and reports filed with the SEC. In addition, Apollo Administration assists us in determining and publishing our net asset value, oversees the preparation and filing of our tax returns and the printing and dissemination of reports to our stockholders, and generally oversees the payment of our expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to us by others. Payments under the administration agreement are equal to an amount based upon our allocable portion of Apollo Administration's overhead in performing its obligations under the administration agreement, including rent and our allocable portion of the cost of our chief compliance officer and chief financial officer and their respective staffs. Under the administration agreement, Apollo Administration also provides on our behalf managerial assistance to those portfolio companies to which we are required to provide such assistance. Either party may terminate the administration agreement without penalty upon 60 days' written notice to the other party.
For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006, we reimbursed Apollo Administration a total amount of $1.017 million of the $1.470 million of expenses accrued under the administration agreement.
Indemnification
The administration agreement provides that, absent willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of its duties or reckless disregard of its duties and obligations, Apollo Administration and its officers, manager, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons, members and any other person or entity affiliated with it are entitled to indemnification from Apollo Investment for any damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) arising from the rendering of Apollo Administration's services under the administration agreement or otherwise as administrator for Apollo Investment.

We have entered into the investment advisory and management agreement with Apollo Investment Management. Our senior management and our chairman of the board of directors have ownership and financial interests in Apollo Investment Management. Our senior management also serve as principals of other investment managers affiliated with Apollo Investment Management that may in the future manage investment funds with investment objectives similar to ours. In addition, our executive officers and directors and the partners of our investment adviser, Apollo Investment Management, serve or may serve as officers, directors or principals of entities that operate in the same or related line of business as we do or of investment funds managed by our affiliates. Accordingly, we may not be given the opportunity to participate in certain investments made by investment funds managed by advisers affiliated with Apollo Investment Management. However, our investment adviser and other members of Apollo intend to allocate investment opportunities in a fair and equitable manner consistent with our investment objectives and strategies so that we are not disadvantaged in relation to any other client. See "Risk FactorsRisks relating to our business and structureThere are significant potential conflicts of interest which could impact our investment returns."
We have entered into a license agreement with Apollo, pursuant to which Apollo has agreed to grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the name "Apollo." In addition, pursuant to the terms of the administration agreement, Apollo Administration provides us with the office facilities and administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations. Apollo Investment Management, our investment adviser, is the sole member of and controls Apollo Administration.
Apollo Investment Fund IV, LP (together with Apollo Overseas Partners IV, LP, an entity formed to co-invest with Apollo Investment Fund IV, LP), a private fund managed by an investment manager affiliated with Apollo Investment Management, owns approximately 14% of the outstanding common stock (on a fully diluted basis) of United Rentals, Inc. Michael S. Gross, our former president, chief executive officer and chairman of the board and a former managing partner of Apollo Investment Management, and Gerald Tsai Jr., one of our independent directors, are members of the board of directors of United Rentals, Inc.
We do not invest in any portfolio company in which Apollo or any affiliates has a pre-existing investment. We have in the past and expect in the future to co-invest on a concurrent basis with other affiliates of Apollo Investment, subject to compliance with existing regulatory guidance, applicable regulations and our allocation procedures. Certain types of negotiated co-investments may be made only if we receive an order from the SEC permitting us to do so. There can be no assurance that any such order will be obtained.

As of June 30, 2006, there were no persons that owned 25% or more of our outstanding voting securities, and no person would be deemed to control us, as such term is defined in the 1940 Act.
Our directors have been divided into two groupsinterested directors and independent directors. Interested directors are "interested persons" as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940.
The following table sets forth, as of June 30, 2006, certain ownership information with respect to our common stock for those persons who directly or indirectly own, control or hold with the power to vote, 5% or more of our outstanding common stock and all officers and directors, as a group. Unless otherwise indicated, we believe that each beneficial owner set forth in the table has sole voting and investment power.
 
The following table sets forth the dollar range of our equity securities beneficially owned through interests in Apollo Investment Management by each of our directors as of July 31, 2006. We are not part of a "family of investment companies," as that term is defined in the 1940 Act.
 
 
Table of Contents
The following is a listing of each portfolio company or its affiliate, together referred to as portfolio companies, in which we had an investment at June 30, 2006. Percentages shown for class of investment securities held by us represent percentage of the class owned and do not necessarily represent voting ownership. Percentages shown for equity securities, other than warrants or options, represent the actual percentage of the class of security held before dilution. Percentages shown for warrants and options held represent the percentage of class of security we may own assuming we exercise our warrants or options before dilution.
The portfolio companies are presented in three categories: "companies more than 25% owned" which represent portfolio companies where we directly or indirectly own more than 25% of the outstanding voting securities of such portfolio company and, therefore, are presumed to be controlled by us under the 1940 Act; "companies owned 5% to 25%" which represent portfolio companies where we directly or indirectly own 5% to 25% of the outstanding voting securities of such portfolio company or where we hold one or more seats on the portfolio company's board of directors and, therefore, are deemed to be an affiliated person under the 1940 Act; and "companies less than 5% owned" which represent portfolio companies where we directly or indirectly own less than 5% of the outstanding voting securities of such portfolio company and where we have no other affiliations with such portfolio company. We make available significant managerial assistance to our portfolio companies. We generally request and may receive rights to observe the meetings of our portfolio companies' board of directors.

The net asset value per share of our outstanding shares of common stock is determined quarterly by dividing the value of total assets minus liabilities by the total number of shares outstanding.
In calculating the value of our total assets, we value investments for which market quotations are readily available at such market quotations. Debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded or whose market price is not readily available are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors. As a general rule, we do not value our loans or debt securities above cost, but loans and debt securities are subject to fair value write-downs when the asset is considered impaired. With respect to private equity securities, each investment is valued using comparisons of financial ratios of the portfolio companies that issued such private equity securities to peer companies that are public. The value is then discounted to reflect the illiquid nature of the investment, as well as our minority, non-control position. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, we use the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate our private equity valuation. Because we believe that there is not a readily available market value for a significant portion of the investments in our portfolio, we value substantially all of our portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors under a valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments, and the differences could be material.
With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, our board of directors undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below:
 
 
 
 
 
The types of factors that we may take into account in fair value pricing our investments include, as relevant, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company's ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flow, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparison to publicly traded securities and other relevant factors.
Determination of fair values involves subjective judgments and estimates not susceptible to substantiation by auditing procedures. Accordingly, under current auditing standards, the notes to our financial statements refer to the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of such valuations, and any change in such valuations, on our financial statements.
 
Table of Contents
We have adopted a dividend reinvestment plan that provides for reinvestment of our dividend distributions on behalf of our stockholders, unless a stockholder elects to receive cash as provided below. As a result, if our board of directors authorizes, and we declare, a cash dividend, then our stockholders who have not opted out' of our dividend reinvestment plan will have their cash dividends automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock, rather than receiving the cash dividends.
No action is required on the part of a registered stockholder to have their cash dividend reinvested in shares of our common stock. A registered stockholder may elect to receive an entire dividend in cash by notifying American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, the plan administrator and our transfer agent and registrar, in writing so that such notice is received by the plan administrator no later than the record date for dividends to stockholders. The plan administrator will set up an account for shares acquired through the plan for each stockholder who has not elected to receive dividends in cash and hold such shares in non-certificated form. Upon request by a stockholder participating in the plan, received in writing not less than 10 days prior to the record date, the plan administrator will, instead of crediting shares to the participant's account, issue a certificate registered in the participant's name for the number of whole shares of our common stock and a check for any fractional share.
Those stockholders whose shares are held by a broker or other financial intermediary may receive dividends in cash by notifying their broker or other financial intermediary of their election.
We intend to use primarily newly issued shares to implement the plan, whether our shares are trading at a premium or at a discount to net asset value. However, we reserve the right to purchase shares in the open market in connection with our implementation of the plan. The number of shares to be issued to a stockholder is determined by dividing the total dollar amount of the dividend payable to such stockholder by the market price per share of our common stock at the close of regular trading on The Nasdaq National Market on the valuation date for such dividend. Market price per share on that date will be the closing price for such shares on The Nasdaq National Market or, if no sale is reported for such day, at the average of their reported bid and asked prices. The number of shares of our common stock to be outstanding after giving effect to payment of the dividend cannot be established until the value per share at which additional shares will be issued has been determined and elections of our stockholders have been tabulated.
There will be no brokerage charges or other charges to stockholders who participate in the plan. The plan administrator's fees under the plan will be paid by us. If a participant elects by written notice to the plan administrator to have the plan administrator sell part or all of the shares held by the plan administrator in the participant's account and remit the proceeds to the participant, the plan administrator is authorized to deduct a $15 transaction fee plus a 10 per share brokerage commissions from the proceeds.
Stockholders who receive dividends in the form of stock are subject to the same federal, state and local tax consequences as are stockholders who elect to receive their dividends in cash. A stockholder's basis for determining gain or loss upon the sale of stock received in a dividend from us will be equal to the total dollar amount of the dividend payable to the stockholder. Any stock received in a dividend will have a new holding period for tax purposes commencing on the day following the day on which the shares are credited to the U.S. stockholder's account.
Participants may terminate their accounts under the plan by notifying the plan administrator via its website at www.amstock.com, by filling out the transaction request form located at bottom of their statement and sending it to the plan administrator at P.O. Box 922, Wall Street Station, NY, NY 10269-0560 or by calling the plan administrator's Interactive Voice Response System at 1-888-777-0324.
The plan may be terminated by us upon notice in writing mailed to each participant at least 30 days prior to any record date for the payment of any dividend by us. All correspondence, including requests for additional information, concerning the plan should be directed to the plan administrator by mail at American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, 59 Maiden Lane, New York, NY 10007 or by telephone at (718) 921-8200.

The following discussion is a general summary of the material U.S. federal income tax considerations applicable to us and to an investment in shares of our common stock. This summary does not purport to be a complete description of the income tax considerations applicable to such an investment. For example, we have not described tax consequences that we assume to be generally known by investors or certain considerations that may be relevant to certain types of holders subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws, including stockholders subject to the alternative minimum tax, tax-exempt organizations, insurance companies, dealers in securities, pension plans and trusts, and financial institutions. This summary assumes that investors hold our common stock as capital assets (within the meaning of the Code). The discussion is based upon the Code, Treasury regulations, and administrative and judicial interpretations, each as of the date of this prospectus and all of which are subject to change, possibly retroactively, which could affect the continuing validity of this discussion. We have not sought and will not seek any ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") regarding this offering. This summary does not discuss any aspects of U.S. estate or gift tax or foreign, state or local tax. It does not discuss the special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws that could result if we invested in tax-exempt securities or certain other investment assets.
This summary does not discuss the consequences of an investment in shares of our preferred stock, debt securities or warrants representing rights to purchase shares of our common stock, preferred stock or debt securities. The tax consequences of such an investment will be discussed in a relevant prospectus supplement.
A "U.S. stockholder" is a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes:
 
 
 
A "Non-U.S. stockholder" is a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock that is neither a U.S. stockholder nor a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
If a partnership (including an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) holds shares of our common stock, the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. A prospective stockholder that is a partner of a partnership holding shares of our common stock should consult its tax advisors with respect to the purchase, ownership and disposition of shares of our common stock.
Tax matters are very complicated and the tax consequences to an investor of an investment in our shares will depend on the facts of his, her or its particular situation. We encourage investors to consult their own tax advisors regarding the specific consequences of such an investment, including tax reporting requirements, the applicability of federal, state, local and foreign tax laws, eligibility for the benefits of any applicable tax treaty and the effect of any possible changes in the tax laws.
Election to be Taxed as a RIC
As a business development company, we have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As a RIC, we generally will not have to pay corporate-level federal income taxes on any ordinary income or capital gains that we distribute to our stockholders as dividends. To qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements (as described below). In addition, to
 
Table of Contents
obtain RIC tax treatment we must distribute to our stockholders, for each taxable year, at least 90% of our "investment company taxable income," which is generally our ordinary income plus the excess of realized net short-term capital gains over realized net long-term capital losses (the "Annual Distribution Requirement").
Taxation as a RIC
If we:
 
 
then we will not be subject to federal income tax on the portion of our investment company taxable income and net capital gain (, realized net long-term capital gains in excess of realized net short-term capital losses) we distribute to stockholders with respect to that year. We will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the regular corporate rates on any income or capital gain not distributed (or deemed distributed) to our stockholders.
i.e.
We will be subject to a 4% nondeductible federal excise tax on certain undistributed income of RICs unless we distribute in a timely manner an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98% of our ordinary income for each calendar year, (2) 98% of our capital gain net income for the one-year period ending October 31 in that calendar year and (3) any income realized, but not distributed, in preceding years (the "Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement"). We will not be subject to excise taxes on amounts on which we are required to pay corporate income taxes (such as retained net capital gains).
In order to qualify as a RIC for federal income tax purposes, we must, among other things:
 
 
 
 
 
We may be required to recognize taxable income in circumstances in which we do not receive cash. For example, if we hold debt obligations that are treated under applicable tax rules as having original issue discount (such as debt instruments with payment-in-kind interest or, in certain cases, increasing interest rates or issued with warrants), we must include in income each year a portion of the original issue discount that accrues over the life of the obligation, regardless of whether cash representing such income is received by us in the same taxable
 
Table of Contents
year. Because any original issue discount accrued will be included in our investment company taxable income for the year of accrual, we may be required to make a distribution to our stockholders in order to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, even though we will not have received any corresponding cash amount.
Gain or loss realized by us from the sale or exchange of warrants acquired by us as well as any loss attributable to the lapse of such warrants generally will be treated as capital gain or loss. Such gain or loss generally will be long-term or short-term, depending on how long we held a particular warrant.
Although we do not presently expect to do so, we are authorized to borrow funds and to sell assets in order to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement. However, under the 1940 Act, we are not permitted to make distributions to our stockholders while our debt obligations and other senior securities are outstanding unless certain "asset coverage" tests are met. See "RegulationSenior securities." Moreover, our ability to dispose of assets to meet the Annual Distribution Requirements may be limited by (1) the illiquid nature of our portfolio and/or (2) other requirements relating to our status as a RIC, including the Diversification Tests. If we dispose of assets in order to meet the Annual Distribution Requirement or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement, we may make such dispositions at times that, from an investment standpoint, are not advantageous.
If we fail to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement or otherwise fail to qualify as a RIC in any taxable year, we will be subject to tax in that year on all of our taxable income, regardless of whether we make any distributions to our stockholders. In that case, all of our income will be subject to corporate-level federal income tax, reducing the amount available to be distributed to our stockholders. In contrast, assuming we qualify as a RIC, our corporate-level federal income tax should be substantially reduced or eliminated. See "Election to be taxed as a RIC" above.
The remainder of this discussion assumes that we qualify as a RIC and have satisfied the Annual Distribution Requirement.
Taxation of U.S. Stockholders
Distributions by us generally are taxable to U.S. stockholders as ordinary income or capital gains. Distributions of our "investment company taxable income" (which is, generally, our ordinary income plus realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses) will be taxable as ordinary income to U.S. stockholders to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, whether paid in cash or reinvested in additional common stock through our dividend reinvestment plan. To the extent such distributions paid by us to non-corporate stockholders (including individuals) are attributable to dividends from U.S. corporations and certain qualified foreign corporations, such distributions generally will be eligible for a maximum tax rate of 15% for taxable years beginning before 2011. In this regard, it is anticipated that distributions paid by us will generally not be attributable to dividends and, therefore, generally will not qualify for the 15% maximum rate. Distributions of our net capital gains (which is generally our realized net long-term capital gains in excess of realized net short-term capital losses) properly designated by us as "capital gain dividends" will be taxable to a U.S. stockholder as long-term capital gains (currently at a maximum rate of 15% in the case of individuals, trusts or estates), regardless of the U.S. stockholder's holding period for his, her or its common stock and regardless of whether paid in cash or reinvested in additional common stock. Distributions in excess of our earnings and profits first will reduce a U.S. stockholder's adjusted tax basis in such stockholder's common stock and, after the adjusted basis is reduced to zero, will constitute capital gains to such U.S. stockholder.
Although we currently intend to distribute any net capital gain at least annually, we may in the future decide to retain some or all of our net capital gain, but designate the retained amount as a "deemed distribution." In that case, among other consequences, we will pay tax on the retained amount, each U.S. stockholder will be required to include his, her or its share of the deemed distribution in income as if it had been actually distributed to the U.S. stockholder, and the U.S. stockholder will be entitled to claim a credit equal to his, her or its allocable share
 
Table of Contents
of the tax paid thereon by us. The amount of the deemed distribution net of such tax will be added to the U.S. stockholder's tax basis for his, her or its common stock. Since we expect to pay tax on any retained capital gains at our regular corporate tax rate, and since that rate is in excess of the maximum rate currently payable by individuals on long-term capital gains, the amount of tax that individual stockholders will be treated as having paid and for which they will receive a credit will exceed the tax they owe on the retained net capital gain. Such excess generally may be claimed as a credit against the U.S. stockholder's other federal income tax obligations or may be refunded to the extent it exceeds a stockholder's liability for federal income tax. A stockholder that is not subject to federal income tax or otherwise required to file a federal income tax return would be required to file a federal income tax return on the appropriate form in order to claim a refund for the taxes we paid. In order to utilize the deemed distribution approach, we must provide written notice to our stockholders prior to the expiration of 60 days after the close of the relevant taxable year. We cannot treat any of our investment company taxable income as a "deemed distribution."
For purposes of determining (1) whether the Annual Distribution Requirement is satisfied for any year and (2) the amount of capital gain dividends paid for that year, we may, under certain circumstances, elect to treat a dividend that is paid during the following taxable year as if it had been paid during the taxable year in question. If we make such an election, the U.S. stockholder will still be treated as receiving the dividend in the taxable year in which the distribution is made. However, any dividend declared by us in October, November or December of any calendar year, payable to stockholders of record on a specified date in such a month and actually paid during January of the following year, will be treated as if it had been received by our U.S. stockholders on December 31 of the year in which the dividend was declared.
If an investor purchases shares of our common stock shortly before the record date of a distribution, the price of the shares will include the value of the distribution and the investor will be subject to tax on the distribution even though it represents a return of his, her or its investment.
A stockholder generally will recognize taxable gain or loss if the stockholder sells or otherwise disposes of his, her or its shares of our common stock. Any gain arising from such sale or disposition generally will be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if the stockholder has held his, her or its shares for more than one year. Otherwise, it would be classified as short-term capital gain or loss. However, any capital loss arising from the sale or disposition of shares of our common stock held for six months or less will be treated as long-term capital loss to the extent of the amount of capital gain dividends received, or undistributed capital gain deemed received, with respect to such shares. In addition, all or a portion of any loss recognized upon a disposition of shares of our common stock may be disallowed if other shares of our common stock are purchased (whether through reinvestment of distributions or otherwise) within 30 days before or after the disposition.
In general, individual and other non-corporate U.S. taxable stockholders currently are subject to a maximum federal income tax rate of 15% on their net capital gain, i.e., the excess of realized net long-term capital gain over realized net short-term capital loss for a taxable year, including any long-term capital gain derived from an investment in our shares. Such rate is lower than the maximum rate on ordinary income currently applicable to individuals. Corporate U.S. stockholders currently are subject to federal income tax on net capital gain at the maximum 35% rate also applied to ordinary income. Non-corporate stockholders with net capital losses for a year (i.e., capital losses in excess of capital gains) generally may deduct up to $3,000 of such losses against their ordinary income each year; any net capital losses of a non-corporate stockholder in excess of $3,000 generally may be carried forward and used in subsequent years as provided in the Code. Corporate stockholders generally may not deduct any net capital losses against ordinary income for a year, but may carryback such losses for three years or carry forward such losses for five years.
We will send to each of our U.S. stockholders, as promptly as possible after the end of each calendar year, a notice detailing, on a per share and per distribution basis, the amounts includible in such U.S. stockholder's taxable income for such year as ordinary income and as long-term capital gain. In addition, the federal tax status of each year's distributions generally will be reported to the Internal Revenue Service (including the amount of
 
Table of Contents
dividends, if any, eligible for the 15% maximum rate). Distributions may also be subject to additional state, local and foreign taxes depending on a U.S. stockholder's particular situation. Dividends distributed by us generally will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction or the 15% maximum rate applicable to qualifying dividends.
We may be required to withhold federal income tax ("backup withholding") currently at a rate of 28% from all taxable distributions to any non-corporate U.S. stockholder (1) who fails to furnish us with a correct taxpayer identification number or a certificate that such stockholder is exempt from backup withholding, or (2) with respect to whom the IRS notifies us that such stockholder has failed to properly report certain interest and dividend income to the IRS and to respond to notices to that effect. An individual's taxpayer identification number is his or her social security number. Any amount withheld under backup withholding is allowed as a credit against the U.S. stockholder's federal income tax liability and may entitle such stockholder to a refund, provided that proper information is timely provided to the IRS.
Taxation of Non-U.S. Stockholders
Whether an investment in the shares is appropriate for a Non-U.S. stockholder will depend upon that person's particular circumstances. An investment in the shares by a Non-U.S. stockholder may have adverse tax consequences. Non-U.S. stockholders should consult their tax advisers before investing in our common stock.
Distributions of our "investment company taxable income" to Non-U.S. stockholders, subject to the discussion below, will be subject to withholding of federal tax at a 30% rate (or lower rate provided by an applicable treaty) to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits unless the distributions are effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business of the Non-U.S. stockholder, and, if an income tax treaty applies, attributable to a permanent establishment in the United States, in which case the distributions will be subject to federal income tax at the rates applicable to U.S. stockholders, and we will not be required to withhold federal tax if the Non-U.S. stockholder complies with applicable certification and disclosure requirements. However, pursuant to recently enacted legislation, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2004 and before January 1, 2008, certain "interest-related dividends" and "short-term capital gain dividends" paid by us to Non-U.S. stockholders would be eligible for an exemption from the 30% federal withholding tax. Interest-related dividends generally are dividends derived from certain interest income earned by us that would not be subject to such tax if earned by Non-U.S. stockholders directly. Short-term capital gain dividends generally are dividends derived from the excess of our net short-term capital gains over net long-term capital losses. Special certification requirements apply to a Non-U.S. stockholder that is a foreign partnership or a foreign trust, and such entities are urged to consult their own tax advisors.
Actual or deemed distributions of our net capital gains to a Non-U.S. stockholder, and gains realized by a Non-U.S. stockholder upon the sale of our common stock, will not be subject to federal withholding tax and generally will not be subject to federal income tax unless the distributions or gains, as the case may be, are effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business of the Non-U.S. stockholder and, if an income tax treaty applies, are attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the Non-U.S. stockholder in the United States.
If we distribute our net capital gains in the form of deemed rather than actual distributions (which we may do in the future), a Non-U.S. stockholder will be entitled to a federal income tax credit or tax refund equal to the stockholder's allocable share of the tax we pay on the capital gains deemed to have been distributed. In order to obtain the refund, the Non-U.S. stockholder must obtain a U.S. taxpayer identification number and file a federal income tax return even if the Non-U.S. stockholder would not otherwise be required to obtain a U.S. taxpayer identification number or file a federal income tax return. For a corporate Non-U.S. stockholder, distributions (both actual and deemed), and gains realized upon the sale of our common stock that are effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business may, under certain circumstances, be subject to an additional "branch profits tax" at a 30% rate (or at a lower rate if provided for by an applicable tax treaty). Accordingly, investment in the shares may not be appropriate for certain Non-U.S. stockholders.
 
Table of Contents
A Non-U.S. stockholder who is a non-resident alien individual, and who is otherwise subject to withholding of federal income tax, may be subject to information reporting and backup withholding of federal income tax on dividends unless the Non-U.S. stockholder provides us or the dividend paying agent with an IRS Form W-8BEN (or an acceptable substitute form) or otherwise meets documentary evidence requirements for establishing that it is a Non-U.S. stockholder or otherwise establishes an exemption from backup withholding.
Non-U.S. persons should consult their own tax advisors with respect to the U.S. federal income tax and withholding tax, and state, local and foreign tax consequences of an investment in the shares.
Failure to Qualify as a RIC
If we were unable to qualify for treatment as a RIC, we would be subject to tax on all of our taxable income at regular corporate rates. We would not be able to deduct distributions to stockholders, nor would they be required to be made. Distributions would generally be taxable to our stockholders as ordinary dividend income eligible for the 15% maximum rate for taxable years beginning before 2011 to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. Subject to certain limitations under the Code, corporate distributees would be eligible for the dividends received deduction. Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits would be treated first as a return of capital to the extent of the stockholder's tax basis, and any remaining distributions would be treated as a capital gain. Moreover, if the fund fails to qualify as a regulated investment company in any year, it must pay out its earnings and profits accumulated in that year in order to qualify again as a regulated investment company. If the fund fails to qualify as a regulated investment company for a period of greater than two taxable years, the fund may be required to recognize any net built-in gains with respect to certain of its assets (, the excess of the aggregate gains, including items of income, over aggregate losses that would have been realized with respect to such assets if the fund had been liquidated) if it qualifies as a regulated investment company in a subsequent year.

Table of Contents
The following description is based on relevant portions of the Maryland General Corporation Law and on our charter and bylaws. This summary is not necessarily complete, and we refer you to the Maryland General Corporation Law and our charter and bylaws for a more detailed description of the provisions summarized below.
Capital Stock
At August 8, 2006, our authorized capital stock consists of 400,000,000 shares of stock, par value $0.001 per share, all of which is initially designated as common stock. Our common stock is quoted on The Nasdaq National Market under the ticker symbol "AINV". There are no outstanding options or warrants to purchase our stock, and no stock has been authorized for issuance under any equity compensation plans. Under Maryland law, our stockholders generally are not personally liable for our debts or obligations. On August 8, 2006, the last reported closing market price of our common stock was $19.34 per share. As of August 8, 2006, we had 40 shareholders of record.
Under our charter, our board of directors is authorized to classify and reclassify any unissued shares of stock into other classes or series of stock and authorize the issuance of shares of stock without obtaining stockholder approval. As permitted by the Maryland General Corporation Law, our charter provides that the board of directors, without any action by our stockholders, may amend the charter from time to time to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that we have authority to issue.
The following table sets forth information of our capital stock as of August 8, 2006:
 
Common stock
All shares of our common stock have equal rights as to earnings, assets, dividends and voting and, when they are issued, will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. Distributions may be paid to the holders of our common stock if, as and when authorized by our board of directors and declared by us out of funds legally available therefor. Shares of our common stock have no preemptive, exchange, conversion or redemption rights and are freely transferable, except where their transfer is restricted by federal and state securities laws or by contract. In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of Apollo Investment, each share of our common stock would be entitled to share ratably in all of our assets that are legally available for distribution after we pay all debts and other liabilities and subject to any preferential rights of holders of our preferred stock, if any preferred stock is outstanding at such time. Each share of our common stock is entitled to one vote on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders, including the election of directors. Except as provided with respect to any other class or series of stock, the holders of our common stock will possess exclusive voting power. There is no cumulative voting in the election of directors, which means that holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock can elect all of our directors, and holders of less than a majority of such shares will be unable to elect any director.
Preferred stock
Our charter authorizes our board of directors to classify and reclassify any unissued shares of stock into other classes or series of stock, including preferred stock. Prior to issuance of shares of each class or series, the board of directors is required by Maryland law and by our charter to set the terms, preferences, conversion or
 
Table of Contents
other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends or other distributions, qualifications and terms or conditions of redemption for each class or series. Thus, the board of directors could authorize the issuance of shares of preferred stock with terms and conditions which could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for holders of our common stock or otherwise be in their best interest. You should note, however, that any issuance of preferred stock must comply with the requirements of the 1940 Act. The 1940 Act requires, among other things, that (1) immediately after issuance and before any dividend or other distribution is made with respect to our common stock and before any purchase of common stock is made, such preferred stock together with all other senior securities must not exceed an amount equal to 50% of our total assets after such issuance and after deducting the amount of such dividend, distribution or purchase price, as the case may be, and (2) the holders of shares of preferred stock, if any are issued, must be entitled as a class to elect two directors at all times and to elect a majority of the directors if dividends on such preferred stock are in arrears by two years or more. Certain matters under the 1940 Act require the separate vote of the holders of any issued and outstanding preferred stock. For example, holders of preferred stock would vote separately from the holders of common stock on a proposal to cease operations as a business development company. We believe that the availability for issuance of preferred stock will provide us with increased flexibility in structuring future financings and acquisitions.
Limitation on Liability of Directors and Officers; Indemnification and Advance of Expenses
Maryland law permits a Maryland corporation to include in its charter a provision limiting the liability of its directors and officers to the corporation and its stockholders for money damages except for liability resulting from (a) actual receipt of an improper benefit or profit in money, property or services or (b) active and deliberate dishonesty established by a final judgment as being material to the cause of action. Our charter contains such a provision which eliminates directors' and officers' liability to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law, subject to the requirements of the 1940 Act.
Our charter authorizes us and our bylaws obligate us, to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law and subject to the requirements of the 1940 Act, to indemnify any present or former director or officer or any individual who, while a director or officer and at our request, serves or has served another corporation, real estate investment trust, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise as a director, officer, partner or trustee, from and against any claim or liability to which that person may become subject or which that person may incur by reason of his or her status as a present or former director or officer and to pay or reimburse their reasonable expenses in advance of final disposition of a proceeding. The charter and bylaws also permit us to indemnify and advance expenses to any person who served a predecessor of us in any of the capacities described above and any of our employees or agents or any employees or agents of our predecessor. In accordance with the 1940 Act, we will not indemnify any person for any liability to which such person would be subject by reason of such person's willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of his or her office.
Maryland law requires a corporation (unless its charter provides otherwise, which our charter does not) to indemnify a director or officer who has been successful, on the merits or otherwise, in the defense of any proceeding to which he or she is made, or threatened to be made, a party by reason of his or her service in that capacity. Maryland law permits a corporation to indemnify its present and former directors and officers, among others, against judgments, penalties, fines, settlements and reasonable expenses actually incurred by them in connection with any proceeding to which they may be made, or threatened to be made, a party by reason of their service in those or other capacities unless it is established that (a) the act or omission of the director or officer was material to the matter giving rise to the proceeding and (1) was committed in bad faith or (2) was the result of active and deliberate dishonesty, (b) the director or officer actually received an improper personal benefit in money, property or services or (c) in the case of any criminal proceeding, the director or officer had reasonable cause to believe that the act or omission was unlawful. However, under Maryland law, a Maryland corporation may not indemnify for an adverse judgment in a suit by or in the right of the corporation or for a judgment of liability on the basis that a personal benefit was improperly received, unless in either case a court orders
 
Table of Contents
indemnification, and then only for expenses. In addition, Maryland law permits a corporation to advance reasonable expenses to a director or officer upon the corporation's receipt of (a) a written affirmation by the director or officer of his or her good faith belief that he or she has met the standard of conduct necessary for indemnification by the corporation and (b) a written undertaking by him or her or on his or her behalf to repay the amount paid or reimbursed by the corporation if it is ultimately determined that the standard of conduct was not met.
Provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law and Our Charter and Bylaws
The Maryland General Corporation Law and our charter and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a potential acquiror to acquire us by means of a tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise. These provisions are expected to discourage certain coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids and to encourage persons seeking to acquire control of us to negotiate first with our board of directors. We believe that the benefits of these provisions outweigh the potential disadvantages of discouraging any such acquisition proposals because, among other things, the negotiation of such proposals may improve their terms.
Classified board of directors
Our board of directors is divided into three classes of directors serving staggered three-year terms. The initial terms of the first, second and third classes have one, two and three years, respectively. At each annual meeting of our stockholders, the successors to the class of directors whose terms expire at such meeting will be elected to hold office for a term expiring at the annual meeting of stockholders held in the third year following the year of their election. Each director holds office for the term to which he or she is elected and until his or her successor is duly elected and qualifies. A classified board of directors may render a change in control of us or removal of our incumbent management more difficult. We believe, however, that the longer time required to elect a majority of a classified board of directors will help to ensure the continuity and stability of our management and policies.
Election of directors
Our charter and bylaws provide that the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote in the election of directors will be required to elect a director. Pursuant to the charter, our board of directors may amend the bylaws to alter the vote required to elect directors.
Number of directors; vacancies; removal
Our charter provides that the number of directors will be set only by the board of directors in accordance with our bylaws. Our bylaws provide that a majority of our entire board of directors may at any time increase or decrease the number of directors. However, unless our bylaws are amended, the number of directors may never be less than four nor more than eight. Our charter provides that, at such time as we have three independent directors and our common stock is registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"), we elect to be subject to the provision of Subtitle 8 of Title 3 of the Maryland General Corporation Law regarding the filling of vacancies on the board of directors. Accordingly, at such time, except as may be provided by the board of directors in setting the terms of any class or series of preferred stock, any and all vacancies on the board of directors may be filled only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors in office, even if the remaining directors do not constitute a quorum, and any director elected to fill a vacancy will serve for the remainder of the full term of the directorship in which the vacancy occurred and until a successor is elected and qualifies, subject to any applicable requirements of the 1940 Act.
Our charter provides that a director may be removed only for cause, as defined in our charter, and then only by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast in the election of directors.
 
Table of Contents
Action by stockholders
Under the Maryland General Corporation Law, stockholder action can be taken only at an annual or special meeting of stockholders or by unanimous written consent in lieu of a meeting, unless the charter provides for stockholder action by less than unanimous written consent (which our charter does not). These provisions, combined with the requirements of our bylaws regarding the calling of a stockholder-requested special meeting of stockholders discussed below, may have the effect of delaying consideration of a stockholder proposal until the next annual meeting.
Advance notice provisions for stockholder nominations and stockholder proposals
Our bylaws provide that with respect to an annual meeting of stockholders, nominations of persons for election to the board of directors and the proposal of business to be considered by stockholders may be made only (1) pursuant to our notice of the meeting, (2) by the board of directors or (3) by a stockholder who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who has complied with the advance notice procedures of the bylaws. With respect to special meetings of stockholders, only the business specified in our notice of the meeting may be brought before the meeting. Nominations of persons for election to the board of directors at a special meeting may be made only (1) pursuant to our notice of the meeting, (2) by the board of directors or (3) provided that the board of directors has determined that directors will be elected at the meeting, by a stockholder who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who has complied with the advance notice provisions of the bylaws.
The purpose of requiring stockholders to give us advance notice of nominations and other business is to afford our board of directors a meaningful opportunity to consider the qualifications of the proposed nominees and the advisability of any other proposed business and, to the extent deemed necessary or desirable by our board of directors, to inform stockholders and make recommendations about such qualifications or business, as well as to provide a more orderly procedure for conducting meetings of stockholders. Although our bylaws do not give our board of directors any power to disapprove stockholder nominations for the election of directors or proposals recommending certain action, they may have the effect of precluding a contest for the election of directors or the consideration of stockholder proposals if proper procedures are not followed and of discouraging or deterring a third party from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect its own slate of directors or to approve its own proposal without regard to whether consideration of such nominees or proposals might be harmful or beneficial to us and our stockholders.
Calling of special meetings of stockholders
Our bylaws provide that special meetings of stockholders may be called by our board of directors and certain of our officers. Additionally, our bylaws provide that, subject to the satisfaction of certain procedural and informational requirements by the stockholders requesting the meeting, a special meeting of stockholders will be called by the secretary of the corporation upon the written request of stockholders entitled to cast not less than a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at such meeting.
Approval of extraordinary corporate action; amendment of charter and bylaws
Under Maryland law, a Maryland corporation generally cannot dissolve, amend its charter, merge, sell all or substantially all of its assets, engage in a share exchange or engage in similar transactions outside the ordinary course of business, unless approved by the affirmative vote of stockholders entitled to cast at least two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. However, a Maryland corporation may provide in its charter for approval of these matters by a lesser percentage, but not less than a majority of all of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. Our charter generally provides for approval of charter amendments and extraordinary transactions by the stockholders entitled to cast at least a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. Our charter also provides that certain charter amendments and any proposal for our conversion, whether by merger or otherwise, from a closed-end company to an open-end company or any proposal for our liquidation or dissolution requires the approval of the stockholders entitled to cast at least 80 percent of the votes entitled to be cast on such
 
Table of Contents
matter. However, if such amendment or proposal is approved by at least two-thirds of our continuing directors (in addition to approval by our board of directors), such amendment or proposal may be approved by a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on such a matter. The "continuing directors" are defined in our charter as our current directors as well as those directors whose nomination for election by the stockholders or whose election by the directors to fill vacancies is approved by a majority of the continuing directors then on the board of directors.
Our charter and bylaws provide that the board of directors will have the exclusive power to adopt, alter or repeal any provision of our bylaws and to make new bylaws.
No appraisal rights
Except with respect to appraisal rights arising in connection with the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act discussed below, as permitted by the Maryland General Corporation Law, our charter provides that stockholders will not be entitled to exercise appraisal rights.
Control share acquisitions
The Control Share Acquisition Act provides that control shares of a Maryland corporation acquired in a control share acquisition have no voting rights except to the extent approved by a vote of two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. Shares owned by the acquiror, by officers or by directors who are employees of the corporation are excluded from shares entitled to vote on the matter. Control shares are voting shares of stock which, if aggregated with all other shares of stock owned by the acquiror or in respect of which the acquiror is able to exercise or direct the exercise of voting power (except solely by virtue of a revocable proxy), would entitle the acquiror to exercise voting power in electing directors within one of the following ranges of voting power:
 
 
 
The requisite stockholder approval must be obtained each time an acquiror crosses one of the thresholds of voting power set forth above. Control shares do not include shares the acquiring person is then entitled to vote as a result of having previously obtained stockholder approval. A control share acquisition means the acquisition of control shares, subject to certain exceptions.
A person who has made or proposes to make a control share acquisition may compel the board of directors of the corporation to call a special meeting of stockholders to be held within 50 days of demand to consider the voting rights of the shares. The right to compel the calling of a special meeting is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including an undertaking to pay the expenses of the meeting. If no request for a meeting is made, the corporation may itself present the question at any stockholders meeting.
If voting rights are not approved at the meeting or if the acquiring person does not deliver an acquiring person statement as required by the statute, then the corporation may repurchase for fair value any or all of the control shares, except those for which voting rights have previously been approved. The right of the corporation to repurchase control shares is subject to certain conditions and limitations, including, as provided in our bylaws, compliance with the 1940 Act. Fair value is determined, without regard to the absence of voting rights for the control shares, as of the date of the last control share acquisition by the acquiror or of any meeting of stockholders at which the voting rights of the shares are considered and not approved. If voting rights for control shares are approved at a stockholders meeting and the acquiror becomes entitled to vote a majority of the shares entitled to vote, all other stockholders may exercise appraisal rights. The fair value of the shares as determined for purposes of appraisal rights may not be less than the highest price per share paid by the acquiror in the control share acquisition.
 
Table of Contents
The Control Share Acquisition Act does not apply (a) to shares acquired in a merger, consolidation or share exchange if the corporation is a party to the transaction or (b) to acquisitions approved or exempted by the charter or bylaws of the corporation.
Our bylaws contain a provision exempting from the Control Share Acquisition Act any and all acquisitions by any person of our shares of stock. There can be no assurance that such provision will not be amended or eliminated at any time in the future. However, we will amend our bylaws to be subject to the Control Share Acquisition Act only if the board of directors determines that it would be in our best interests based on our determination that our being subject to the Control Share Acquisition Act does not conflict with the 1940 Act.
Business combinations
Under Maryland law, "business combinations" between a Maryland corporation and an interested stockholder or an affiliate of an interested stockholder are prohibited for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. These business combinations include a merger, consolidation, share exchange or, in circumstances specified in the statute, an asset transfer or issuance or reclassification of equity securities. An interested stockholder is defined as:
 
 
A person is not an interested stockholder under this statute if the board of directors approved in advance the transaction by which he otherwise would have become an interested stockholder. However, in approving a transaction, the board of directors may provide that its approval is subject to compliance, at or after the time of approval, with any terms and conditions determined by the board of directors.
After the five-year prohibition, any business combination between the corporation and an interested stockholder generally must be recommended by the board of directors of the corporation and approved by the affirmative vote of at least:
 
 
These super-majority vote requirements do not apply if the corporation's common stockholders receive a minimum price, as defined under Maryland law, for their shares in the form of cash or other consideration in the same form as previously paid by the interested stockholder for its shares.
The statute permits various exemptions from its provisions, including business combinations that are exempted by the board of directors before the time that the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. Our board of directors has adopted a resolution that any business combination between us and any other person is exempted from the provisions of the Business Combination Act, provided that the business combination is first approved by the board of directors, including a majority of the directors who are not interested persons as defined in the 1940 Act. This resolution, however, may be altered or repealed in whole or in part at any time. If this resolution is repealed, or the board of directors does not otherwise approve a business combination, the statute may discourage others from trying to acquire control of us and increase the difficulty of consummating any offer.
 
Table of Contents
Conflict with 1940 Act
Our bylaws provide that, if and to the extent that any provision of the Maryland General Corporation Law, including the Control Share Acquisition Act (if we amend our bylaws to be subject to such Act) and the Business Combination Act, or any provision of our charter or bylaws conflicts with any provision of the 1940 Act, the applicable provision of the 1940 Act will control.
 
Table of Contents
In addition to shares of common stock, our charter authorizes the issuance of preferred stock. If we offer preferred stock under this prospectus, we will issue an appropriate prospectus supplement. We may issue preferred stock from time to time in one or more classes or series, without stockholder approval. Prior to issuance of shares of each class or series, our Board of Directors is required by Maryland law and by our charter to set the terms, preferences, conversion or other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends or other distributions, qualifications and terms or conditions of redemption for each class or series. Any such an issuance must adhere to the requirements of the 1940 Act, Maryland law and any other limitations imposed by law.
The 1940 Act requires, among other things, that (1) immediately after issuance and before any distribution is made with respect to common stock, the liquidation preference of the preferred stock, together with all other senior securities, must not exceed an amount equal to 50% of our total assets (taking into account such distribution) and (2) the holders of shares of preferred stock, if any are issued, must be entitled as a class to elect two directors at all times and to elect a majority of the directors if dividends on the preferred stock are in arrears by two years or more.
For any series of preferred stock that we may issue, our board of directors will determine and the prospectus supplement relating to such series will describe:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
All shares of preferred stock that we may issue will be identical and of equal rank except as to the particular terms thereof that may be fixed by our board of directors, and all shares of each series of preferred stock will be identical and of equal rank except as to the dates from which cumulative dividends, if any, thereon will be cumulative.
 
Table of Contents
The following is a general description of the terms of the warrants we may issue from time to time. Particular terms of any warrants we offer will be described in the prospectus supplement relating to such warrants.
We may issue warrants to purchase shares of our common stock. Such warrants may be issued independently or together with shares of common stock and may be attached or separate from such shares of common stock. We will issue each series of warrants under a separate warrant agreement to be entered into between us and a warrant agent. The warrant agent will act solely as our agent and will not assume any obligation or relationship of agency for or with holders or beneficial owners of warrants.
A prospectus supplement will describe the particular terms of any series of warrants we may issue, including the following:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
We and the warrant agent may amend or supplement the warrant agreement for a series of warrants without the consent of the holders of the warrants issued thereunder to effect changes that are not inconsistent with the provisions of the warrants and that do not materially and adversely affect the interests of the holders of the warrants.
Under the 1940 Act, we may generally only offer warrants provided that (1) the warrants expire by their terms within ten years; (2) the exercise or conversion price is not less than the current market value at the date of issuance; (3) our stockholders authorize the proposal to issue such warrants, and our board of directors approves such issuance on the basis that the issuance is in the best interests of Apollo Investment and its stockholders; and (4) if the warrants are accompanied by other securities, the warrants are not separately transferable unless no class of such warrants and the securities accompanying them has been publicly distributed. The 1940 Act also provides that the amount of our voting securities that would result from the exercise of all outstanding warrants at the time of issuance may not exceed 25% of our outstanding voting securities.
 
Table of Contents
We may issue debt securities in one or more series. The specific terms of each series of debt securities will be described in the particular prospectus supplement relating to that series. The prospectus supplement may or may not modify the general terms found in this prospectus and will be filed with the SEC. For a complete description of the terms of a particular series of debt securities, you should read both this prospectus and the prospectus supplement relating to that particular series.
As required by federal law for all bonds and notes of companies that are publicly offered, the debt securities are governed by a document called an "indenture". An indenture is a contract between us and JPMorgan Chase Bank, a financial institution acting as trustee on your behalf, and is subject to and governed by the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended. The trustee has two main roles. First, the trustee can enforce your rights against us if we default. There are some limitations on the extent to which the trustee acts on your behalf, described in the second paragraph under "Events of DefaultRemedies if an Event of Default Occurs". Second, the trustee performs certain administrative duties for us.
Because this section is a summary, it does not describe every aspect of the debt securities and the indenture. We urge you to read the indenture because it, and not this description, defines your rights as a holder of debt securities. For example, in this section, we use capitalized words to signify terms that are specifically defined in the indenture. Some of the definitions are repeated in this prospectus, but for the rest you will need to read the indenture. We have filed the form of the indenture with the SEC. See "Available Information" for information on how to obtain a copy of the indenture.
The prospectus supplement, which will accompany this prospectus, will describe the particular series of debt securities being offered by including:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table of Contents
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The debt securities may be secured or unsecured obligations. Under the provisions of the 1940 Act, we are permitted, as a business development company, to issue debt only in amounts such that our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, equals at least 200% after each issuance of debt. Unless the prospectus supplement states otherwise, principal (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, will be paid by us in immediately available funds.
General
The indenture provides that any debt securities proposed to be sold under this prospectus and the attached prospectus supplement ("offered debt securities") and any debt securities issuable upon the exercise of warrants or upon conversion or exchange of other offered securities ("underlying debt securities"), may be issued under the indenture in one or more series.
For purposes of this prospectus, any reference to the payment of principal of or premium or interest, if any, on debt securities will include additional amounts if required by the terms of the debt securities.
The indenture limits the amount of debt securities that may be issued thereunder from time to time. Debt securities issued under the indenture, when a single trustee is acting for all debt securities issued under the indenture, are called the "indenture securities". The indenture also provides that there may be more than one trustee thereunder, each with respect to one or more different series of indenture securities. See "Resignation of Trustee" below. At a time when two or more trustees are acting under the indenture, each with respect to only certain series, the term "indenture securities" means the one or more series of debt securities with respect to which each respective trustee is acting. In the event that there is more than one trustee under the indenture, the powers and trust obligations of each trustee described in this prospectus will extend only to the one or more series of indenture securities for which it is trustee. If two or more trustees are acting under the indenture, then the indenture securities for which each trustee is acting would be treated as if issued under separate indentures.
The indenture does not contain any provisions that give you protection in the event we issue a large amount of debt or we are acquired by another entity.
We refer you to the prospectus supplement for information with respect to any deletions from, modifications of or additions to the Events of Default or our covenants that are described below, including any addition of a covenant or other provision providing event risk or similar protection.
We have the ability to issue indenture securities with terms different from those of indenture securities previously issued and, without the consent of the holders thereof, to reopen a previous issue of a series of indenture securities and issue additional indenture securities of that series unless the reopening was restricted when that series was created.
 
Table of Contents
Conversion and Exchange
If any debt securities are convertible into or exchangeable for other securities, the prospectus supplement will explain the terms and conditions of the conversion or exchange, including the conversion price or exchange ratio (or the calculation method), the conversion or exchange period (or how the period will be determined), if conversion or exchange will be mandatory or at the option of the holder or us, provisions for adjusting the conversion price or the exchange ratio and provisions affecting conversion or exchange in the event of the redemption of the underlying debt securities. These terms may also include provisions under which the number or amount of other securities to be received by the holders of the debt securities upon conversion or exchange would be calculated according to the market price of the other securities as of a time stated in the prospectus supplement.
Issuance of Securities in Registered Form
We may issue the debt securities in registered form, in which case we may issue them either in book-entry form only or in "certificated" form. Debt securities issued in book-entry form will be represented by global securities. We expect that we will usually issue debt securities in book-entry only form represented by global securities.
We also will have the option of issuing debt securities in non-registered form as bearer securities if we issue the securities outside the United States to non-U.S. persons. In that case, the prospectus supplement will set forth the mechanics for holding the bearer securities, including the procedures for receiving payments, for exchanging the bearer securities, including the procedures for receiving payments, for exchanging the bearer securities for registered securities of the same series, and for receiving notices. The prospectus supplement will also describe the requirements with respect to our maintenance of offices or agencies outside the United States and the applicable U.S. federal tax law requirements.
Book-Entry Holders
We will issue registered debt securities in book-entry form only, unless we specify otherwise in the applicable prospectus supplement. This means debt securities will be represented by one or more global securities registered in the name of a depositary that will hold them on behalf of financial institutions that participate in the depositary's book-entry system. These participating institutions, in turn, hold beneficial interests in the debt securities held by the depositary or its nominee. These institutions may hold these interests on behalf of themselves or customers.
Under the indenture, only the person in whose name a debt security is registered is recognized as the holder of that debt security. Consequently, for debt securities issued in book-entry form, we will recognize only the depositary as the holder of the debt securities and we will make all payments on the debt securities to the depositary. The depositary will then pass along the payments it receives to its participants, which in turn will pass the payments along to their customers who are the beneficial owners. The depositary and its participants do so under agreements they have made with one another or with their customers; they are not obligated to do so under the terms of the debt securities.
As a result, investors will not own debt securities directly. Instead, they will own beneficial interests in a global security, through a bank, broker or other financial institution that participates in the depositary's book-entry system or holds an interest through a participant. As long as the debt securities are represented by one or more global securities, investors will be indirect holders, and not holders, of the debt securities.
Street Name Holders
In the future, we may issue debt securities in certificated form or terminate a global security. In these cases, investors may choose to hold their debt securities in their own names or in "street name". Debt securities held in
 
Table of Contents
street name are registered in the name of a bank, broker or other financial institution chosen by the investor, and the investor would hold a beneficial interest in those debt securities through the account he or she maintains at that institution.
For debt securities held in street name, we will recognize only the intermediary banks, brokers and other financial institutions in whose names the debt securities are registered as the holders of those debt securities and we will make all payments on those debt securities to them. These institutions will pass along the payments they receive to their customers who are the beneficial owners, but only because they agree to do so in their customer agreements or because they are legally required to do so. Investors who hold debt securities in street name will be indirect holders, and not holders, of the debt securities.
Legal Holders. Our obligations, as well as the obligations of the applicable trustee and those of any third parties employed by us or the applicable trustee, run only to the legal holders of the debt securities. We do not have obligations to investors who hold beneficial interests in global securities, in street name or by any other indirect means. This will be the case whether an investor chooses to be an indirect holder of a debt security or has no choice because we are issuing the debt securities only in book-entry form.
For example, once we make a payment or give a notice to the holder, we have no further responsibility for the payment or notice even if that holder is required, under agreements with depositary participants or customers or by law, to pass it along to the indirect holders but does not- do so. Similarly, if we want to obtain the approval of the holders for any purpose (for example, to amend an indenture or to relieve us of the consequences of a default or of our obligation to comply with a particular provision of an indenture), we would seek the approval only from the holders, and not the indirect holders, of the debt securities. Whether and how the holders contact the indirect holders is up to the holders.
When we refer to you, we mean those who invest in the debt securities being offered by this prospectus, whether they are the holders or only indirect holders of those debt securities. When we refer to your debt securities, we mean the debt securities in which you hold a direct or indirect interest.
Special Considerations for Indirect Holders
If you hold debt securities through a bank, broker or other financial institution, either in book-entry form or in street name, we urge you to check with that institution to find out:
 
 
 
 
 
 
Global Securities
Anoted above, we usually will issue debt securities as registered securities in book-entry form only. A global security represents one or any other number of individual debt securities. Generally, all debt securities represented by the same global securities will have the same terms.
s
 
Table of Contents
Each debt security issued in book-entry form will be represented by a global security that we deposit with and register in the name of a financial institution or its nominee that we select. The financial institution that we select for this purpose is called the depositary. Unless we specify otherwise in the applicable prospectus supplement, The Depository Trust Company, New York, New York, known as DTC, will be the depositary for all debt securities issued in book-entry form.
A global security may not be transferred to or registered in the name of anyone other than the depositary or its nominee, unless special termination situations arise. We describe those situations below under "Special Situations when a Global Security Will Be Terminated". As a result of these arrangements, the depositary, or its nominee, will be the sole registered owner and holder of all debt securities represented by a global security, and investors will be permitted to own only beneficial interests in a global security. Beneficial interests must be held by means of an account with a broker, bank or other financial institution that in turn has an account with the depositary or with another institution that has an account with the depositary. Thus, an investor whose security is represented by a global security will not be a holder of the debt security, but only an indirect holder of a beneficial interest in the global security.
Special Considerations for Global Securities
As an indirect holder, an investor's rights relating to a global security will be governed by the account rules of the investor's financial institution and of the depositary, as well as general laws relating to securities transfers. The depositary that holds the global security will be considered the holder of the debt securities represented by the global security.
If debt securities are issued only in the form of a global security, an investor should be aware of the following:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table of Contents
Special Situations when a Global Security Will Be Terminated
In a few special situations described below, a global security will be terminated and interests in it will be exchanged for certificates in non-book-entry form (certificated securities). After that exchange, the choice of whether to hold the certificated debt securities directly or in street name will be up to the investor. Investors must consult their own banks or brokers to find out how to have their interests in a global security transferred on termination to their own names, so that they will be holders. We have described the rights of holders and street name investors under "Holders of Registered Debt Securities" above.
The special situations for termination of a global security are as follows:
 
 
 
The prospectus supplement may list situations for terminating a global security that would apply only to the particular series of debt securities covered by the prospectus supplement. If a global security is terminated, only the depositary, and not we or the applicable trustee, is responsible for deciding the names of the institutions in whose names the debt securities represented by the global security will be registered and, therefore, who will be the holders of those debt securities.
Payment and Paying Agents
We will pay interest to the person listed in the applicable trustee's records as the owner of the debt security at the close of business on a particular day in advance of each due date for interest, even if that person no longer owns the debt security on the interest due date. That day, usually about two weeks in advance of the interest due date, is called the "record date". Because we will pay all the interest for an interest period to the holders on the record date, holders buying and selling debt securities must work out between themselves the appropriate purchase price. The most common manner is to adjust the sales price of the debt securities to prorate interest fairly between buyer and seller based on their respective ownership periods within the particular interest period. This prorated interest amount is called "accrued interest".
Payments on Global Securities
We will make payments on a global security in accordance with the applicable policies of the depositary as in effect from time to time. Under those policies, we will make payments directly to the depositary, or its nominee, and not to any indirect holders who own beneficial interests in the global security. An indirect holder's right to those payments will be governed by the rules and practices of the depositary and its participants, as described under "Special Considerations for Global Securities".
Payments on Certificated Securities
We will make payments on a certificated debt security as follows. We will pay interest that is due on an interest payment date by check mailed on the interest payment date to the holder at his or her address shown on the trustee's records as of the close of business on the regular record date. We will make all payments of
 
Table of Contents
principal and premium, if any, by check at the office of the applicable trustee in New York, NY and/or at other offices that may be specified in the prospectus supplement or in a notice to holders against surrender of the debt security.
Alternatively, if the holder asks us to do so, we will pay any amount that becomes due on the debt security by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account at a bank in New York City, on the due date. To request payment by wire, the holder must give the applicable trustee or other paying agent appropriate transfer instructions at least 15 business days before the requested wire payment is due. In the case of any interest payment due on an interest payment date, the instructions must be given by the person who is the holder on the relevant regular record date. Any wire instructions, once properly given, will remain in effect unless and until new instructions are given in the manner described above.
Payment When Offices Are Closed
If any payment is due on a debt security on a day that is not a business day, we will make the payment on the next day that is a business day. Payments made on the next business day in this situation will be treated under the indenture as if they were made on the original due date, except as otherwise indicated in the attached prospectus supplement. Such payment will not result in a default under any debt security or the indenture, and no interest will accrue on the payment amount from the original due date to the next day that is a business day.
Book-entry and other indirect holders should consult their banks or brokers for information on how they will receive payments on their debt securities.
Events of Default
You will have rights if an Event of Default occurs in respect of the debt securities of your series and is not cured, as described later in this subsection.
The term "Event of Default" in respect of the debt securities of your series means any of the following:
 
 
 
 
 
 
An Event of Default for a particular series of debt securities does not necessarily constitute an Event of Default for any other series of debt securities issued under the same or any other indenture. The trustee may withhold notice to the holders of debt securities of any default, except in the payment of principal, premium or interest, if it considers the withholding of notice to be in the best interests of the holders.
Remedies if an Event of Default Occurs
If an Event of Default has occurred and has not been cured, the trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the debt securities of the affected series may declare the entire principal amount of all the debt securities of that series to be due and immediately payable. This is called a declaration of acceleration of maturity. A declaration of acceleration of maturity may be canceled by the holders of a majority in principal amount of the debt securities of the affected series.
 
Table of Contents
Except in cases of default, where the trustee has some special duties, the trustee is not required to take any action under the indenture at the request of any holders unless the holders offer the trustee reasonable protection from expenses and liability (called an "indemnity"). (Section 315 of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939) If reasonable indemnity is provided, the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of the relevant series may direct the time, method and place of conducting any lawsuit or other formal legal action seeking any remedy available to the trustee. The trustee may refuse to follow those directions in certain circumstances. No delay or omission in exercising any right or remedy will be treated as a waiver of that right, remedy or Event of Default.
Before you are allowed to bypass your trustee and bring your own lawsuit or other formal legal action or take other steps to enforce your rights or protect your interests relating to the debt securities, the following must occur:
 
 
 
 
However, you are entitled at any time to bring a lawsuit for the payment of money due on your debt securities on or after the due date.
Holders of a majority in principal amount of the debt securities of the affected series may waive any past defaults other than
 
 
Book-entry and other indirect holders should consult their banks or brokers for information on how to give notice or direction to or make a request of the trustee and how to declare or cancel an acceleration of maturity.
Each year, we will furnish to each trustee a written statement of certain of our officers certifying that to their knowledge we are in compliance with the indenture and the debt securities, or else specifying any default.
Merger or Consolidation
Under the terms of the indenture, we are generally permitted to consolidate or merge with another entity. We are also permitted to sell all or substantially all of our assets to another entity. However, we may not take any of these actions unless all the following conditions are met:
 
 
 
Table of Contents
 
 
Modification or Waiver
There are three types of changes we can make to the indenture and the debt securities issued thereunder.
Changes Requiring Your Approval
First, there are changes that we cannot make to your debt securities without your specific approval. The following is a list of those types of changes:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Changes Not Requiring Approval
The second type of change does not require any vote by the holders of the debt securities. This type is limited to clarifications and certain other changes that would not adversely affect holders of the outstanding debt securities in any material respect. We also do not need any approval to make any change that affects only debt securities to be issued under the indenture after the change takes effect.
 
Table of Contents
Changes Requiring Majority Approval
Any other change to the indenture and the debt securities would require the following approval:
 
 
In each case, the required approval must be given by written consent.
The holders of a majority in principal amount of all of the series of debt securities issued under an indenture, voting together as one class for this purpose, may waive our compliance with some of our covenants in that indenture. However, we cannot obtain a waiver of a payment default or of any of the matters covered by the bullet points included above under "Changes Requiring Your Approval".
Further Details Concerning Voting
When taking a vote, we will use the following rules to decide how much principal to attribute to a debt security:
 
 
 
Debt securities will not be considered outstanding, and therefore not eligible to vote, if we have deposited or set aside in trust money for their payment or redemption. Debt securities will also not be eligible to vote if they have been fully defeased as described later under "DefeasanceFull Defeasance".
We will generally be entitled to set any day as a record date for the purpose of determining the holders of outstanding indenture securities that are entitled to vote or take other action under the indenture. If we set a record date for a vote or other action to be taken by holders of one or more series, that vote or action may be taken only by persons who are holders of outstanding indenture securities of those series on the record date and must be taken within eleven months following the record date.
Book-entry and other indirect holders should consult their banks or brokers for information on how- approval may be granted or denied if we seek to change the indenture or the debt securities or request a waiver.
Defeasance
The following provisions will be applicable to each series of debt securities unless we state in the applicable prospectus supplement that the provisions of covenant defeasance and full defeasance will not be applicable to that series.
Covenant Defeasance
Under current United States federal tax law, we can make the deposit described below and be released from some of the restrictive covenants in the indenture under which the particular series was issued. This is called "covenant defeasance". In that event, you would lose the protection of those restrictive covenants but would gain the protection of having money and government securities set aside in trust to repay your debt securities. If
 
Table of Contents
applicable, you also would be released from the subordination provisions described under "Indenture ProvisionsSubordination" below. In order to achieve covenant defeasance, we must do the following:
 
 
We must deliver to the trustee a legal opinion of our counsel stating that the above deposit does not require registration by us under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and a legal opinion and officers' certificate stating that all conditions precedent to covenant defeasance have been complied with.
If we accomplish covenant defeasance, you can still look to us for repayment of the debt securities if there were a shortfall in the trust deposit or the trustee is prevented from making payment. In fact, if one of the remaining Events of Default occurred (such as our bankruptcy) and the debt securities became immediately due and payable, there might be a shortfall. Depending on the event causing the default, you may not be able to obtain payment of the shortfall.
Full Defeasance
If there is a change in United States federal tax law, as described below, we can legally release ourselves from all payment and other obligations on the debt securities of a particular series (called "full defeasance") if we put in place the following other arrangements for you to be repaid:
 
 
 
If we ever did accomplish full defeasance, as described above, you would have to rely solely on the trust deposit for repayment of the debt securities. You could not look to us for repayment in the unlikely event of any shortfall. Conversely, the trust deposit would most likely be protected from claims of our lenders and other creditors if we ever became bankrupt or insolvent. If applicable, you would also be released from the subordination provisions described later under "Indenture ProvisionsSubordination".
Form, Exchange and Transfer of Certificated Registered Securities
If registered debt securities cease to be issued in book-entry form, they will be issued:
 
 
Table of Contents
 
Holders may exchange their certificated securities for debt securities of smaller denominations or combined into fewer debt securities of larger denominations, as long as the total principal amount is not changed.
Holders may exchange or transfer their certificated securities at the office of their trustee. We have appointed the trustee to act as our agent for registering debt securities in the names of holders transferring debt securities. We may appoint another entity to perform these functions or perform them ourselves.
Holders will not be required to pay a service charge to transfer or exchange their certificated securities, but they may be required to pay any tax or other governmental charge associated with the transfer or exchange. The transfer or exchange will be made only if our transfer agent is satisfied with the holder's proof of legal ownership.
If we have designated additional transfer agents for your debt security, they will be named in your prospectus supplement. We may appoint additional transfer agents or cancel the appointment of any particular transfer agent. We may also approve a change in the office through which any transfer agent acts.
If any certificated securities of a particular series are redeemable and we redeem less than all the debt securities of that series, we may block the transfer or exchange of those debt securities during the period beginning 15 days before the day we mail the notice of redemption and ending on the day of that mailing, in order to freeze the list of holders to prepare the mailing. We may also refuse to register transfers or exchanges of any certificated securities selected for redemption, except that we will continue to permit transfers and exchanges of the unredeemed portion of any debt security that will be partially redeemed.
If a registered debt security is issued in book-entry form, only the depositary will be entitled to transfer and exchange the debt security as described in this subsection, since it will be the sole holder of the debt security.
Resignation of Trustee
Each trustee may resign or be removed with respect to one or more series of indenture securities provided that a successor trustee is appointed to act with respect to these series. In the event that two or more persons are acting as trustee with respect to different series of indenture securities under the indenture, each of the trustees will be a trustee of a trust separate and apart from the trust administered by any other trustee.
Indenture ProvisionsLimitation on Liens
If we issue indenture securities that are denominated as senior debt securities, we covenant in the indenture that neither we nor any of our subsidiaries, if any, will pledge or subject to any lien any of our or their property or assets unless those senior debt securities issued under the indenture are secured by this pledge or lien equally and ratably with other indebtedness thereby secured. There are excluded from this covenant liens created to secure obligations for the purchase price of physical property, liens of a subsidiary securing indebtedness owed to us, liens existing on property acquired upon exercise of rights arising out of defaults on receivables acquired in the ordinary course of business, sales of receivables accounted for as secured indebtedness in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, certain liens not related to the borrowing of money and other liens not securing borrowed money aggregating less than $500,000.
Indenture ProvisionsSubordination
Upon any distribution of our assets upon our dissolution, winding up, liquidation or reorganization, the payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, on any indenture securities denominated as
 
Table of Contents
subordinated debt securities is to be subordinated to the extent provided in the indenture in right of payment to the prior payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness, but our obligation to you to make payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, on such subordinated debt securities will not otherwise be affected. In addition, no payment on account of principal (or premium, if any), sinking fund or interest, if any, may be made on such subordinated debt securities at any time unless full payment of all amounts due in respect of the principal (and premium, if any), sinking fund and interest on Senior Indebtedness has been made or duly provided for in money or money's worth.
In the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing, any payment by us is received by the trustee in respect of subordinated debt securities or by the holders of any of such subordinated debt securities before all Senior Indebtedness is paid in full, the payment or distribution must be paid over to the holders of the Senior Indebtedness or on their behalf for application to the payment of all the Senior Indebtedness remaining unpaid until all the Senior Indebtedness has been paid in full, after giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution to the holders of the Senior Indebtedness. Subject to the payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness upon this distribution by us, the holders of such subordinated debt securities will be subrogated to the rights of the holders of the Senior Indebtedness to the extent of payments made to the holders of the Senior Indebtedness out of the distributive share of such subordinated debt securities.
By reason of this subordination, in the event of a distribution of our assets upon our insolvency, certain of our senior creditors may recover more, ratably, than holders of any subordinated debt securities. The indenture provides that these subordination provisions will not apply to money and securities held in trust under the defeasance provisions of the indenture.
Senior Indebtedness is defined in the indenture as the principal of (and premium, if any) and unpaid interest on:
 
 
If this prospectus is being delivered in connection with the offering of a series of indenture securities denominated as subordinated debt securities, the accompanying prospectus supplement will set forth the approximate amount of our Senior Indebtedness outstanding as of a recent date.
The Trustee under the Indenture
JPMorgan Chase Bank will serve as the trustee under the indenture. JPMorgan Chase Bank is one of a number of banks with which we maintain ordinary banking relationships and from which we have obtained a senior secured credit facility and lines of credit.
Certain Considerations Relating to Foreign Currencies
Debt securities denominated or payable in foreign currencies may entail significant risks. These risks include the possibility of significant fluctuations in the foreign currency markets, the imposition or modification of foreign exchange controls and potential illiquidity in the secondary market. These risks will vary depending upon the currency or currencies involved and will be more fully described in the applicable prospectus supplement.
 
Table of Contents
We have elected to be treated as a business development company under the 1940 Act and have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. The 1940 Act contains prohibitions and restrictions relating to transactions between business development companies and their affiliates (including any investment advisers or sub-advisers), principal underwriters and affiliates of those affiliates or underwriters and requires that a majority of the directors be persons other than "interested persons," as that term is defined in the 1940 Act. In addition, the 1940 Act provides that we may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or to withdraw our election as, a business development company unless approved by a majority of our outstanding voting securities voting as a class.
We may invest up to 100% of our assets in securities acquired directly from issuers in privately negotiated transactions. With respect to such securities, we may, for the purpose of public resale, be deemed an "underwriter" as that term is defined in the Securities Act. Our intention is to not write (sell) or buy put or call options to manage risks associated with the publicly traded securities of our portfolio companies, except that we may enter into hedging transactions to manage the risks associated with interest rate and currency rate fluctuations. However, we may purchase or otherwise receive warrants to purchase the common stock of our portfolio companies in connection with acquisition financing or other investment. Similarly, in connection with an acquisition, we may acquire rights to require the issuers of acquired securities or their affiliates to repurchase them under certain circumstances. We also do not intend to acquire securities issued by any investment company that exceed the limits imposed by the 1940 Act. Under these limits, we generally cannot acquire more than 3% of the voting stock of any registered investment company, invest more than 5% of the value of our total assets in the securities of one investment company or invest more than 10% of the value of our total assets in the securities of more than one investment company. With regard to that portion of our portfolio invested in securities issued by investment companies, it should be noted that such investments might subject our stockholders to additional expenses. None of our policies are fundamental and all may be changed without stockholder approval.
Qualifying Assets
Under the 1940 Act, a business development company may not acquire any asset other than assets of the type listed in Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, which are referred to as qualifying assets, unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the company's total assets. The principal categories of qualifying assets relevant to our business are the following:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table of Contents
 
 
 
 
The SEC has proposed a regulation under the 1940 Act to expand the definition of eligible portfolio company in a manner that would promote the flow of capital to small, developing and financially troubled companies. This regulation would define eligible portfolio company with reference to whether a company has any class of securities listed on an exchange. We continue to monitor this issue closely and intend to adjust our investment focus as needed to comply with and/or take advantage of this rule if it is adopted or of any other future administrative position, judicial decision or legislative action.
Managerial Assistance to Portfolio Companies
In addition, a business development company must have been organized and have its principal place of business in the United States and must be operated for the purpose of making investments in the types of securities described in (1), (2) or (3) above. However, in order to count portfolio securities as qualifying assets for the purpose of the 70% test, the business development company must either control the issuer of the securities or must offer to make available to the issuer of the securities (other than small and solvent companies described above) significant managerial assistance; except that, where the business development company purchases such securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together, one of the other persons in the group may make available such managerial assistance. Making available managerial assistance means, among other things, any arrangement whereby the business development company, through its directors, officers or employees, offers to provide, and, if accepted, does so provide, significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company.
Temporary Investments
Pending investment in other types of "qualifying assets," as described above, our investments may consist of cash equivalents, U.S. Government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, which we refer to, collectively, as temporary investments, so that 70% of our assets are qualifying assets. Typically, we will invest in U.S. Treasury bills or in repurchase agreements, provided that such agreements are fully collateralized by cash or securities issued by the U.S. Government or its agencies. A repurchase agreement involves the purchase by an investor, such as us, of a specified security and the simultaneous agreement by the seller to repurchase it at an agreed-upon future date and at a price which is greater than the purchase price by an amount that reflects an agreed-upon interest rate. There is no percentage restriction on the proportion of our assets that may be invested in such repurchase agreements.
Senior Securities
We are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of stock senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 200%
 
Table of Contents
immediately after each such issuance. In addition, while any senior securities remain outstanding, we must make provisions to prohibit any distribution to our stockholders or the repurchase of such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the distribution or repurchase. We may also borrow amounts up to 5% of the value of our total assets for temporary or emergency purposes without regard to asset coverage. For a discussion of the risks associated with leverage, see "Risk FactorsRisks relating to our business and structureRegulations governing our operation as a business development company will affect our ability to, and the way in which we, raise additional capital."
Code of Ethics
We and Apollo Investment Management have each adopted a code of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act that establishes procedures for personal investments and restricts certain personal securities transactions. Personnel subject to each code may invest in securities for their personal investment accounts, including securities that may be purchased or held by us, so long as such investments are made in accordance with the code's requirements. For information on how to obtain a copy of each code of ethics, see "Available information."
Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures
SEC registered advisers that have the authority to vote (client) proxies (which authority may be implied from a general grant of investment discretion) are required to adopt policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that the adviser votes proxies in the best interests of its clients. Registered advisers also must maintain certain records on proxy voting. In most cases, Apollo Investment will invest in securities that do not generally entitle it to voting rights in its portfolio companies. When Apollo Investment does have voting rights, it will delegate the exercise of such rights to Apollo Investment Management. Apollo Investment Management's proxy voting policies and procedures are summarized below:
In determining how to vote, officers of our investment adviser will consult with each other and other investment professionals of Apollo, taking into account the interests of Apollo Investment and its investors as well as any potential conflicts of interest. Our investment adviser will consult with legal counsel to identify potential conflicts of interest. Where a potential conflict of interest exists, our investment adviser may, if it so elects, resolve it by following the recommendation of a disinterested third party, by seeking the direction of the independent directors of Apollo Investment or, in extreme cases, by abstaining from voting. While our investment adviser may retain an outside service to provide voting recommendations and to assist in analyzing votes, our investment adviser will not delegate its voting authority to any third party.
An officer of Apollo Investment Management will keep a written record of how all such proxies are voted. Our investment adviser will retain records of (1) proxy voting policies and procedures, (2) all proxy statements received (or it may rely on proxy statements filed on the SEC's EDGAR system in lieu thereof), (3) all votes cast, (4) investor requests for voting information, and (5) any specific documents prepared or received in connection with a decision on a proxy vote. If it uses an outside service, our investment adviser may rely on such service to maintain copies of proxy statements and records, so long as such service will provide a copy of such documents promptly upon request.
Our investment adviser's proxy voting policies are not exhaustive and are designed to be responsive to the wide range of issues that may be subject to a proxy vote. In general, our investment adviser will vote our proxies in accordance with these guidelines unless: (1) it has determined otherwise due to the specific and unusual facts and circumstances with respect to a particular vote, (2) the subject matter of the vote is not covered by these guidelines, (3) a material conflict of interest is present, or (4) we find it necessary to vote contrary to our general guidelines to maximize shareholder value or the best interests of Apollo Investment. In reviewing proxy issues, our investment adviser generally will use the following guidelines:
In general, our investment adviser will vote in favor of the management-proposed slate of directors. If there is a proxy fight for seats on a portfolio company's board of directors, or our investment
Elections of Directors:
 
Table of Contents
adviser determines that there are other compelling reasons for withholding our vote, it will determine the appropriate vote on the matter. We may withhold votes for directors that fail to act on key issues, such as failure to: (1) implement proposals to declassify a board of directors, (2) implement a majority vote requirement, (3) submit a rights plan to a shareholder vote or (4) act on tender offers where a majority of shareholders have tendered their shares. Finally, our investment adviser may withhold votes for directors of non-U.S. issuers where there is insufficient information about the nominees disclosed in the proxy statement.
We believe that a portfolio company remains in the best position to choose its independent auditors and our investment adviser will generally support management's recommendation in this regard.
Appointment of Auditors:
Changes in a portfolio company's charter or bylaws may be required by state or federal regulation. In general, our investment adviser will cast our votes in accordance with the management on such proposals. However, our investment adviser will consider carefully any proposal regarding a change in corporate structure that is not required by state or federal regulation.
Changes in Capital Structure:
We believe proxy votes dealing with corporate reorganizations are an extension of the investment decision. Accordingly, our investment adviser will analyze such proposals on a case-by-case basis and vote in accordance with its perception of our interests.
Corporate Restructurings, Mergers and Acquisitions:
We will generally vote in favor of proposals that give shareholders a greater voice in the affairs of a portfolio company and oppose any measure that seeks to limit such rights. However, when analyzing such proposals, our investment adviser will balance the financial impact of the proposal against any impairment of shareholder rights as well as of our investment in the portfolio company.
Proposals Affecting Shareholder Rights:
We recognize the importance of good corporate governance. Accordingly, our investment adviser will generally favor proposals that promote transparency and accountability within a portfolio company.
Corporate Governance:
Our investment adviser will evaluate, on a case-by-case basis, any proposals regarding anti-takeover measures to determine the measure's likely effect on shareholder value dilution.
Anti-Takeover Measures:
Our investment adviser will generally vote with management on stock split matters.
Stock Splits:
Our investment adviser will generally vote with management on matters that could adversely affect the limited liability of directors.
Limited Liability of Directors:
Our investment adviser will review proposals related to social, political and environmental issues to determine whether they may adversely affect shareholder value. Our investment adviser may abstain from voting on such proposals where they do not have a readily determinable financial impact on shareholder value.
Social and Corporate Responsibility:

protecting any director or officer against any liability to Apollo Investment or our stockholders arising from willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person's office.
We and Apollo Investment Management have adopted and implemented written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violation of the federal securities laws and intend to review these policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation. We have designated a chief compliance officer to be responsible for administering our policies and procedures.
Compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and The Nasdaq National Market Corporate Governance Regulations
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 imposes a wide variety of regulatory requirements on publicly-held companies and their insiders. Many of these requirements affect us. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act has required us to review our policies and procedures to determine whether we comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the new regulations promulgated thereunder. We will continue to monitor our compliance with all future regulations that are adopted under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and will take actions necessary to ensure that we are in compliance therewith.
In addition, The Nasdaq National Market has adopted or is in the process of adopting corporate governance changes to its listing standards. We believe we are in compliance with such corporate governance listing standards. We will continue to monitor our compliance with all future listing standards and will take actions necessary to ensure that we are in compliance therewith.

Since we generally acquire and dispose of our investments in privately negotiated transactions, we infrequently use brokers in the normal course of our business. From the commencement of our operations through June 30, 2006, we have not paid any brokerage commissions. Subject to policies established by our board of directors, our investment adviser is primarily responsible for the execution of the publicly traded securities portion of our portfolio transactions and the allocation of brokerage commissions. Our investment adviser does not execute transactions through any particular broker or dealer, but seeks to obtain the best net results for Apollo Investment, taking into account such factors as price (including the applicable brokerage commission or dealer spread), size of order, difficulty of execution, and operational facilities of the firm and the firm's risk and skill in positioning blocks of securities. While our investment adviser generally seeks reasonably competitive trade execution costs, Apollo Investment will not necessarily pay the lowest spread or commission available. Subject to applicable legal requirements, our investment adviser may select a broker based partly upon brokerage or research services provided to the investment adviser and Apollo Investment and any other clients. In return for such services, we may pay a higher commission than other brokers would charge if our investment adviser determines in good faith that such commission is reasonable in relation to the services provided.

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Apollo Investment Corporation:
We have completed an integrated audit of Apollo Investment Corporation's March 31, 2006 financial statements and of its internal control over financial reporting and an audit of its March 31, 2005 financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Our opinions, based on our audits, are presented below.
Financial statements
In our opinion, the accompanying statements of assets and liabilities, including the schedule of investments, and the related statements of operations, change in net assets and of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Apollo Investment Corporation (the "Company") at March 31, 2006 and March 31, 2005, and the results of its operations, changes in net assets and its cash flows for the year ended March 31, 2006 and for the period April 8, 2004 (inception) through March 31, 2005 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Internal control over financial reporting
Also, in our opinion, management's assessment, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A, that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2006 based on criteria established in issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material aspects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2006, based on criteria established in issued by the COSO. The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on management's assessment and on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An audit of internal control over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management's assessment, test and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Internal ControlIntegrated Framework
Internal ControlIntegrated Framework
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
 
Table of Contents
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Note 1. Organization
Apollo Investment Corporation ("Apollo Investment" or the "Company"), a Maryland corporation organized on February 2, 2004, is a closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that has filed an election to be treated as a business development company ("BDC") under the Investment Company Act of 1940. In addition, for tax purposes we have elected to be treated as a regulated investment company, or RIC, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Our investment objective is to generate both current income and capital appreciation through debt and equity investments. We invest primarily in middle-market companies in the form of mezzanine and senior secured loans, each of which may include an equity component, and, to a lesser extent, by making direct equity investments in such companies.
On April 8, 2004, Apollo Investment closed its initial public offering and sold 62,000,000 shares of its common stock at a price of $15.00 per share, less an underwriting discount and commissions totaling $0.9375 per share. We commenced operations on April 8, 2004 as we received $870.15 million in total net proceeds from the offering.
Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reported period. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining these estimates could cause actual results to differ.
Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP and pursuant to the requirements for reporting on Form 10-K and Regulation S-X. In accordance with Article 6-09 of Regulation S-X under the Exchange Act, we are providing a Statement of Changes in Net Assets in lieu of a Statement of Changes in Stockholders' Equity. Accordingly, certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting solely of normal recurring accruals, considered necessary for the fair presentation of financial statements, have been included.
The significant accounting policies consistently followed by Apollo Investment are:
 
 
 
Table of Contents
With respect to our investments for which market quotations are not readily available, our Board of Directors undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below:
 
 
 
 
 
The types of factors that we may take into account in fair value pricing our investments include, as relevant, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company's ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flow, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparison to publicly traded securities and other relevant factors.
Determination of fair values involves subjective judgments and estimates. Accordingly, these notes to our financial statements express the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of such valuations, and any change in such valuations, on our financial statements.

Note 3. Agreements
Apollo Investment has an Investment Advisory and Management Agreement with the Investment Adviser, Apollo Investment Management, L.P., under which the Investment Adviser, subject to the overall supervision of Apollo Investment's Board of Directors, will manage the day-to-day operations of, and provide investment advisory services to, Apollo Investment. For providing these services, the Investment Adviser receives a fee from Apollo Investment, consisting of two componentsa base management fee and an incentive fee. The base management fee is determined by taking the average value of Apollo Investment's gross assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters calculated at an annual rate of 2.00%. The incentive fee has two parts, as follows: one part is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on Apollo Investment's pre-incentive fee net investment income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter. For this purpose, pre-incentive fee net investment income means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees (other than fees for providing managerial assistance), such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that we receive from portfolio companies) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus Apollo Investment's operating expenses for the quarter (including the base management fee, any expenses payable under the Administration Agreement, and any interest expense and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee). Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not include any realized capital gains computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation. Pre-incentive fee net investment income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of Apollo Investment's net assets at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, is compared to the hurdle rate of 1.75% per quarter (7% annualized). Our net investment income used to calculate this part of the incentive fee is also included in the amount of our gross assets used to calculate the 2% base management fee. Apollo Investment pays the Investment Adviser an incentive fee with respect to Apollo Investment's pre-incentive fee net investment income in each calendar quarter as follows: (1) no incentive fee in any calendar quarter in which Apollo Investment's pre-incentive fee net investment income does not exceed the hurdle rate; (2) 100% of Apollo Investment's pre-incentive fee net investment income with respect to that portion of such pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than 2.1875% in any calendar quarter; and (3) 20% of the amount of Apollo Investment's pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds 2.1875% in any calendar quarter. These calculations are appropriately pro rated for any period of less than three months and adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the relevant quarter. The second part of the incentive fee is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Investment Advisory and Management Agreement, as of the termination date), commencing on December 31, 2004, and will equal 20% of Apollo Investment's cumulative realized capital gains less cumulative realized capital losses, unrealized capital depreciation (unrealized depreciation on a gross investment-by-investment basis at the end of each calendar year) and all capital gains upon which prior performance-based capital gains incentive fee payments were previously made to the advisor.
For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 and the period April 8, 2004 (commencement of operations) through March 31, 2005, the Investment Adviser received $23,408 and $17,315, respectively, in base investment advisory and management fees and $22,285 and $0, respectively, in performance-based net investment income incentive fees from Apollo Investment.

Apollo Investment has also entered into an Administration Agreement with Apollo Investment Administration, LLC (the "Administrator") under which the Administrator provides administrative services for Apollo Investment. For providing these services, facilities and personnel, Apollo Investment reimburses the Administrator for Apollo Investment's allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by Apollo Administration in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent and Apollo Investment's allocable portion of its chief financial officer and chief compliance officer and their respective staffs. The Administrator will also provide on Apollo Investment's behalf managerial assistance to these portfolio companies to which Apollo Investment is required to provide such assistance.
For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 and the period April 8, 2004 (commencement of operations) through March 31, 2005, the Administrator was reimbursed $1,017 and $674, respectively, from Apollo Investment on the $1,470 and $988, respectively, of expenses accrued under the Administration Agreement.
On April 14, 2005, Apollo Investment entered into an $800,000,000 Senior Secured Revolving Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement"), among Apollo Investment, the lenders party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. ("JPMorgan"), as administrative agent for the lenders. Effective December 29, 2005, lenders provided additional commitments in the amount of $100,000,000, increasing the total facility size to $900,000,000 on the same terms and conditions as the existing commitments. On March 31, 2006, Apollo Investment Corporation amended and restated its $900,000,000 senior secured, multi-currency, revolving credit facility due April 14, 2010. The amended Facility increases total commitments outstanding to $1,250,000,000 and extends the maturity date to April 13, 2011. The amended Facility also permits Apollo to seek additional commitments from new and existing lenders in the future, up to an aggregate amount not to exceed $2,000,000,000. Pricing remains at 100 basis points over LIBOR. The Facility will be used to supplement Apollo's equity capital to make additional portfolio investments. From time to time, certain of the lenders provide customary commercial and investment banking services to affiliates of Apollo Investment. JPMorgan also serves as custodian and fund accounting agent for Apollo Investment.
Note 4. Net Asset Value Per Share
At March 31, 2006, the Company's total net assets and net asset value per share were $1,229,855 and $15.15, respectively. This compares to total net assets and net asset value per share at March 31, 2005 of $892,885,683 and $14.27, respectively.

Note 7. Foreign Currency Transactions and Translations

Note 8. Expense Offset Arrangement
The Company benefits from an expense offset arrangement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. ("custodian bank") whereby the Company earns credits on any uninvested US dollar cash balances held by the custodian bank. These credits are applied by the custodian bank as a reduction of the monthly custody fees charged to the Company. The total amount of credits earned during the year ended March 31, 2006 is $50.
 
Table of Contents
Note 9. Cash Equivalents
Pending investment in longer-term portfolio holdings, Apollo Investment makes temporary investments in U.S. Treasury bills (of varying maturities) and repurchase agreements as outlined in our prospectus. These temporary investments are deemed cash equivalents by us and are included in our Schedule of Investments. At the end of each fiscal quarter, the Company typically takes proactive steps to prospectively preserve investment flexibility in the next quarter which is assessed against the Company's total assets at its most recent quarter end. The Company can accomplish this in many ways including its current practice of purchasing U.S. Treasury bills and closing out its position on a net cash basis subsequent to quarter end. The Company may also utilize repurchase agreements or other balance sheet transactions as it deems appropriate for this purpose and these amounts are excluded from total assets for purposes of computing the asset base upon which the management fee is determined. U.S. Treasury bills with maturities of greater than 60 days from the time of purchase are marked-to-market as per our valuation policy. U.S. Treasury bills settle "regular way" on trade date plus one.
Note 10. Repurchase Agreements
The Company enters into repurchase agreements as part of its investment program. The Company's custodian takes possession of collateral pledged by the counterparty. The collateral is marked-to-market daily to ensure that the value, plus accrued interest, is at least equal to the repurchase price. In the event of default of the obligor to repurchase, the Company has the right to liquidate the collateral and apply the proceeds in satisfaction of the obligation. Under certain circumstances, in the event of default or bankruptcy by the counterparty to the agreement, realization and/or retention of the collateral or proceeds may be subject to legal proceedings. There were no repurchase agreements outstanding at March 31, 2006.
Note 11. Financial Highlights
The following is a schedule of financial highlights for the year ended March 31, 2006 and the period April 8, 2004 (commencement of operations) through March 31, 2005:

Note 12. Credit Agreement and Borrowings
At March 31, 2006 and under the terms of the amended and restated credit Agreement, the lenders agreed to extend credit to Apollo Investment in an aggregate principal or face amount not exceeding $1.25 billion at any one time outstanding. The Credit Agreement is a five-year revolving facility (with a stated maturity date of April 14, 2011) and is secured by substantially all of the assets in Apollo Investment's portfolio, including cash and cash equivalents. Pricing is set at 100 basis points over LIBOR. The Credit Agreement contains affirmative and restrictive covenants, including: (a) periodic financial reporting requirements, (b) maintaining minimum shareholders' equity of the greater of (i) 40% of the total assets of Apollo Investment and its subsidiaries as at the last day of any fiscal quarter and (ii) the sum of (A) $300 million plus (B) 25% of the net proceeds from the sale of equity interests in Apollo Investment after the closing date of the Credit Agreement, (c) maintaining a ratio of total assets (less total liabilities) to total indebtedness, in each case of Apollo Investment and its subsidiaries, of not less than 2.0:1.0, (d) maintaining minimum liquidity, (e) limitations on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, (f) limitations on liens, (g) limitations on investments (other than in the ordinary course of Apollo Investment's business), (h) limitations on mergers and disposition of assets (other than in the normal course of Apollo Investment's business activities) and (i) limitations on the creation or existence of agreements that prohibit liens on properties of Apollo Investment's subsidiaries. In addition to the asset coverage ratio described
 
Table of Contents
in clause (c) of the preceding sentence, borrowings under the Credit Agreement (and the incurrence of certain other permitted debt) are subject to compliance with a borrowing base that applies different advance rates to different types of assets in Apollo Investment's portfolio. The Credit Agreement currently provides for the ability of Apollo Investment to seek additional commitments from lenders in an aggregate amount of up to $750 million. The Credit Agreement is used to supplement Apollo Investment's equity capital to make additional portfolio investments and for other general corporate purposes.

Our investment objective is to generate both current income and capital appreciation through debt and equity investments. We invest primarily in middle-market companies in the form of mezzanine and senior secured loans, each of which may include an equity component, and, to a lesser extent, by making direct equity investments in such companies.
On April 8, 2004, Apollo Investment closed its initial public offering and sold 62,000,000 shares of its common stock at a price of $15.00 per share, less an underwriting discount and commissions totaling $0.9375 per share. We commenced operations on April 8, 2004 as we received $870.15 million in total net proceeds from the offering.
Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reported period. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining these estimates could cause actual results to differ.
Interim financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP for interim financial information and pursuant to the requirements for reporting on Form 10-Q and Article 6 or 10 of Regulation S-X, as appropriate. In accordance with Article 6-09 of Regulation S-X under the Exchange Act, we are providing a Statement of Changes in Net Assets in lieu of a Statement of Changes in Stockholders' Equity. In addition, certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting solely of normal recurring accruals, considered necessary for the fair presentation of financial statements for the interim period, have been included.
The significant accounting policies consistently followed by Apollo Investment are:

With respect to our investments for which market quotations are not readily available, our Board of Directors undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below:
 
 
 
 
 
The types of factors that we may take into account in fair value pricing our investments include, as relevant, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company's ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flow, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparison to publicly traded securities and other relevant factors.
Determination of fair values involves subjective judgments and estimates. Accordingly, these notes to our financial statements express the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of such valuations, and any change in such valuations, on our financial statements.

Note 3. Agreements
Apollo Investment has an Investment Advisory and Management Agreement with the Investment Adviser, Apollo Investment Management, L.P., under which the Investment Adviser, subject to the overall supervision of Apollo Investment's Board of Directors, will manage the day-to-day operations of, and provide investment advisory services to, Apollo Investment. For providing these services, the Investment Adviser receives a fee from Apollo Investment, consisting of two componentsa base management fee and an incentive fee. The base management fee is determined by taking the average value of Apollo Investment's gross assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters calculated at an annual rate of 2.00%. The incentive fee has two parts, as follows: one part is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on Apollo Investment's pre-incentive fee net investment income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter. For this purpose, pre-incentive fee net investment income means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees (other than fees for providing managerial assistance), such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that we receive from portfolio companies) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus Apollo Investment's operating expenses for the quarter (including the base management fee, any expenses payable under the Administration Agreement, and any interest expense and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee). Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not include any realized capital gains computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation. Pre-incentive fee net investment income, expressed as a rate of return on the
 
Table of Contents
 
value of Apollo Investment's net assets at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, is compared to the hurdle rate of 1.75% per quarter (7% annualized). Our net investment income used to calculate this part of the incentive fee is also included in the amount of our gross assets used to calculate the 2% base management fee. Apollo Investment pays the Investment Adviser an incentive fee with respect to Apollo Investment's pre-incentive fee net investment income in each calendar quarter as follows: (1) no incentive fee in any calendar quarter in which Apollo Investment's pre-incentive fee net investment income does not exceed the hurdle rate; (2) 100% of Apollo Investment's pre-incentive fee net investment income with respect to that portion of such pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than 2.1875% in any calendar quarter; and (3) 20% of the amount of Apollo Investment's pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds 2.1875% in any calendar quarter. These calculations are appropriately pro rated for any period of less than three months and adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the relevant quarter.
The second part of the incentive fee is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Investment Advisory and Management Agreement, as of the termination date), commencing on December 31, 2004, and will equal 20% of Apollo Investment's cumulative realized capital gains less cumulative realized capital losses, unrealized capital depreciation (unrealized depreciation on a gross investment-by-investment basis at the end of each calendar year) and all capital gains upon which prior performance-based capital gains incentive fee payments were previously made to the advisor.
For the three months ended June 30, 2006 and June 30, 2005, the Investment Adviser received $8,476 and $4,490, respectively, in base investment advisory and management fees and $7,936 and $6,311, respectively, in performance-based net investment income incentive fees from Apollo Investment.
Apollo Investment has also entered into an Administration Agreement with Apollo Investment Administration, LLC (the "Administrator") under which the Administrator provides administrative services for Apollo Investment. For providing these services, facilities and personnel, Apollo Investment reimburses the Administrator for Apollo Investment's allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by Apollo Administration in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent and Apollo Investment's allocable portion of its chief financial officer and chief compliance officer and their respective staffs. The Administrator will also provide on Apollo Investment's behalf managerial assistance to these portfolio companies to which Apollo Investment is required to provide such assistance.
For the three months ended June 30, 2006 and June 30, 2005, the Administrator was reimbursed $293 and $518, respectively, from Apollo Investment on the $469 and $618, respectively, of expenses accrued under the Administration Agreement.
On April 14, 2005, Apollo Investment entered into an $800,000,000 Senior Secured Revolving Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement"), among Apollo Investment, the lenders party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. ("JPMorgan"), as administrative agent for the lenders. Effective December 29, 2005, lenders provided additional commitments in the amount of $100,000,000, increasing the total facility size to $900,000,000 on the same terms and conditions as the existing commitments. On March 31, 2006, Apollo Investment Corporation amended and restated its $900,000,000 senior secured, multi-currency, revolving credit facility due April 14, 2010. The amended Facility increased total commitments outstanding to $1,250,000,000 and extended the maturity date to April 13, 2011. The amended Facility also permits Apollo to seek additional commitments from new and existing lenders in the future, up to an aggregate amount not to exceed $2,000,000,000. Pricing remains at 100 basis points over LIBOR. The Facility will be used to supplement Apollo's equity capital to make additional portfolio investments. From time to time, certain of the lenders provide customary commercial and investment banking services to affiliates of Apollo Investment. JPMorgan also serves as custodian and fund accounting agent for Apollo Investment.

Note 4. Net Asset Value Per Share
At June 30, 2006, the Company's total net assets and net asset value per share were $1,272,282 and $15.59, respectively. This compares to total net assets and net asset value per share at March 31, 2006 of $1,229,855 and $15.15, respectively.
Note 5. Earnings Per Share
The following information sets forth the computation of basic and diluted per share net increase in net assets resulting from operations for the three months ended June 30, 2006 and June 30, 2005, respectively:
 
Note 6. Investments
Investments and cash equivalents consisted of the following as of June 30, 2006 and June 30, 2005, respectively:
 
Note 7. Foreign Currency Transactions and Translations
At June 30, 2006, the Company had an open foreign currency contract to sell euro forward and bears the market risk that arises from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Unrealized appreciation on the contract is reflected in the accompanying financial statements as follows:
 
 
Table of Contents
 
At June 30, 2006, the Company had outstanding non-US borrowings on its $1.25 billion multicurrency revolving credit facility denominated in euros, pounds sterling, and Canadian dollars. Unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on these outstanding borrowings is indicated in the table below:
 
Note 8. Expense Offset Arrangement
The Company benefits from an expense offset arrangement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. ("custodian bank") whereby the Company earns credits on any uninvested US dollar cash balances held by the custodian bank. These credits are applied by the custodian bank as a reduction of the monthly custody fees charged to the Company. The total amount of credits earned during the three months ended June 30, 2006 and June 30, 2005 is $12 and $0, respectively.
Note 9. Cash Equivalents
Pending investment in longer-term portfolio holdings, Apollo Investment makes temporary investments in U.S. Treasury bills (of varying maturities) and repurchase agreements as outlined in our prospectus. These temporary investments are deemed cash equivalents by us and are included in our Schedule of Investments. At the end of each fiscal quarter, the Company typically takes proactive steps to prospectively preserve investment flexibility in the next quarter which is assessed against the Company's total assets at its most recent quarter end. The Company can accomplish this in many ways including its current practice of purchasing U.S. Treasury bills and closing out its position on a net cash basis subsequent to quarter end. The Company may also utilize repurchase agreements or other balance sheet transactions as it deems appropriate for this purpose and these amounts are excluded from total assets for purposes of computing the asset base upon which the management fee is determined. U.S. Treasury bills with maturities of greater than 60 days from the time of purchase are marked-to-market as per our valuation policy. U.S. Treasury bills settle "regular way" on trade date plus one.
Note 10. Repurchase Agreements
The Company enters into repurchase agreements as part of its investment program. The Company's custodian takes possession of collateral pledged by the counterparty. The collateral is marked-to-market daily to ensure that the value, plus accrued interest, is at least equal to the repurchase price. In the event of default of the obligor to repurchase, the Company has the right to liquidate the collateral and apply the proceeds in satisfaction of the
 
Table of Contents
 
obligation. Under certain circumstances, in the event of default or bankruptcy by the counterparty to the agreement, realization and/or retention of the collateral or proceeds may be subject to legal proceedings. There were no repurchase agreements outstanding at June 30, 2006.

Note 12. Credit Agreement and Borrowings
At March 31, 2006 and under the terms of the amended and restated Credit Agreement, the lenders agreed to extend credit to Apollo Investment in an aggregate principal or face amount not exceeding $1.25 billion at any one time outstanding. The Credit Agreement is a five-year revolving facility (with a stated maturity date of April 14, 2011) and is secured by substantially all of the assets in Apollo Investment's portfolio, including cash and cash equivalents. Pricing is set at 100 basis points over LIBOR. The Credit Agreement contains affirmative and restrictive covenants, including: (a) periodic financial reporting requirements, (b) maintaining minimum shareholders' equity of the greater of (i) 40% of the total assets of Apollo Investment and its subsidiaries as at the last day of any fiscal quarter and (ii) the sum of (A) $300 million plus (B) 25% of the net proceeds from the sale of equity interests in Apollo Investment after the closing date of the Credit Agreement, (c) maintaining a ratio of total assets (less total liabilities) to total indebtedness, in each case of Apollo Investment and its subsidiaries, of not less than 2.0:1.0, (d) maintaining minimum liquidity, (e) limitations on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, (f) limitations on liens, (g) limitations on investments (other than in the ordinary course of Apollo Investment's business), (h) limitations on mergers and disposition of assets (other than in the normal course of Apollo Investment's business activities) and (i) limitations on the creation or existence of agreements that prohibit liens on properties of Apollo Investment's subsidiaries. In addition to the asset coverage ratio described in clause (c) of the preceding sentence, borrowings under the Credit Agreement (and the incurrence of certain other permitted debt) are subject to compliance with a borrowing base that applies different advance rates to different types of assets in Apollo Investment's portfolio. The Credit Agreement currently provides for the ability of Apollo Investment to seek additional commitments from lenders in an aggregate amount of up to $750 million. The Credit Agreement is used to supplement Apollo Investment's equity capital to make additional portfolio investments and for other general corporate purposes.
At June 30, 2006, the Company had $535,795 (at value) drawn on its $1,250,000 revolving credit facility. The weighted average annual interest cost for the three months ended June 30, 2006 was 4.75%, exclusive of 0.65% for commitment fees and for other prepaid expenses related to establishing the credit facility.

Portfolio and Investment Activity
During the quarter ended December 31, 2006, we expected and saw seasonally high transaction volumes in a highly competitive marketplace. The market's overall liquidity and investors' appetite for yield continued to drive average credit spreads generally lower. Accordingly, we remained steadfast to our investment disciplines against our broad pipeline selecting the relatively few investment opportunities that met or exceeded our risk-reward standards. Gross investments totaled $233.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2006 across 6 new and 2 existing portfolio companies. This compared to investing $257.3 million in 5 new and 2 existing portfolio companies for the three months ended December 31, 2005. Investment sales and pre-payment proceeds totaled $85.3 million during the quarter versus $102.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2005.
At December 31, 2006, our net portfolio consisted of 54 companies with an average investment size exceeding $41 million. Overall portfolio composition was distributed 65% in subordinated debt, 2% in preferred equity, 8% in common equity and 25% in senior secured loans versus 42 portfolio companies invested 60% in subordinated debt, 6% in common equity and 34% in senior secured loans at December 31, 2005. Our targeted investment size typically ranges between $20 million and $150 million, although this investment size may vary proportionately as the size of our capital base changes.
The weighted average yields on our subordinated debt portfolio, senior secured loan portfolio and total debt portfolio were 13.6%, 12.7% and 13.4%, respectively, at December 31, 2006 versus 13.4%, 11.3% and 12.6%, respectively, at December 31, 2005.
We remain highly cognizant of today's market conditions, including how excess capital and market liquidity continue to increase leverage levels and drive valuations higher," said John J. Hannan, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "As value investors, you should expect us to remain disciplined and highly selective of our investment opportunities."
Results of Operations
Results comparisons are for the three and nine months ended December 2006 and December 2005.
Investment Income
Gross investment income totaled $71.1 million and $190.8 million, respectively for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2006 compared to $37.6 million and $110.4 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2005. The increase in investment income for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2006 was primarily due to the continued growth and asset mix of our investment portfolio as compared to the year-ago period. A notable event impacting investment income in the current period included dividend income of $1.8 million from Sorenson Communications, Inc. Origination, closing and/or commitment fees associated with investments in portfolio companies are accreted into interest income over the respective terms of the applicable loans.
Expenses
Net expenses totaled $32.4 million and $86.6 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2006 versus $17.0 million and $43.9 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2005. Of these totals, for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2006, $7.2 million and $25.9 million, respectively, were performance-based incentive fees and $12.8 million and $26.7 million, respectively, were interest and other credit facility expenses. This compares to $5.1 million and $16.6 million in performance-based incentive fees and $4.2 million and $7.0 million in interest and other credit facility expenses for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2005. Expenses net of performance-based incentive fees, interest, and other credit facility expenses for the three months and nine months ended December 31, 2006 were $12.3 million and $34.0 million, respectively, versus $7.7 million and $20.3 million for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2005. These net expenses consist of
base investment advisory and management fees, insurance expenses, administrative services expenses, professional fees, directors' fees, audit and tax services expenses, and other general and administrative expenses. The increase in expenses was driven primarily by an increase in base investment advisory and management fees resulting from the growth of our investment portfolio. For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2006, excise tax expenses totaled $0.7 million. There was no excise tax expense for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2005.
Net Investment Income
The Company's net investment income totaled $38.0 million and $103.6 million or $0.46 per share and $1.27 per share, respectively, for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2006. For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2005, the Company's net investment income totaled $20.6 million and $66.5 million or $0.33 per share and $1.06 per share, respectively.
Net Realized Gains/Losses
The Company had investment sales totaling $85.3 million and $496.7 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2006 versus $102.6 million and $361.3 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2005. Total net realized losses and gains, respectively for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2006 were $0.5 million and $26.3 million versus total net realized gains for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2005 of $4.7 million and $10.9 million. Included in the total net realized gains or losses are currency losses of $3.5 million and $7.0 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2006 versus currency gains of $2.6 million and $5.4 million for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2005.
Net Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) on Investments and Foreign Currencies
For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2006, the Company's investments, foreign currencies and other assets and liabilities had a net increase in appreciation of $19.4 million and $79.5 million, respectively, versus a net increase in appreciation of $8.3 million and $0.7 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2005. At December 31, 2006, net unrealized appreciation totaled $117.8 million, of which $144.3 million was attributable to net unrealized appreciation on our subordinated debt and private equity (after considering the effects of foreign currency borrowing/hedging for our non-U.S. investments) and $26.5 million was attributable to net unrealized depreciation on our bank debt/senior secured debt.
Net Increase in Net Assets From Operations
For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2006, the Company had a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of $57.0 million and $209.4 million, respectively, versus an increase of $33.5 million and $78.1 million for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2005, respectively. The net change in net assets from operations per share was $0.69 and $2.57, respectively, for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2006 versus $0.53 and $1.25 for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2005, respectively.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
The Company's liquidity and capital resources are generated primarily through its senior secured, multi-currency $1.25 billion, five-year credit facility maturing in April 2011 as well as from cash flows from operations, including investment sales and prepayments of senior and subordinated loans and income earned from investments and cash equivalents. At December 31, 2006, the Company has $926 million in borrowings outstanding and had $324 million available for its use. Subsequent to the quarter ended December 31, 2006, we closed our follow-on equity offering and issued 18 million shares of common stock on January 18, 2007 receiving $386 million in net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions. In addition, on February 7, 2007, we issued 2.7 million shares of common stock to cover the underwriter's over-allotment option on the January 18, 2007 equity offering receiving approximately $58 million in net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions. In the future, the
Company may raise additional equity or debt capital off its shelf registration or may securitize a portion of its investments. It may also further access up to $750 million of additional credit commitments from new or existing lenders under the terms of its current credit facility and as the Company's equity capital base grows further. The primary use of funds will be investments in portfolio companies, cash distributions to our shareholders and for other general corporate purposes.
Dividends
Dividends paid to stockholders for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2006 totaled $41.0 million or $0.50 per share and $115.9 million or $1.42 per share, respectively. For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2005, dividends paid totaled $27.8 million or $0.44 per share and $74.1 million or $1.18 per share, respectively. Tax characteristics of all dividends will be reported to shareholders on Form 1099 after the end of the calendar year.
We have elected to be taxed as a regulated investment company under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. In order to maintain our status as a regulated investment company, we are required to (1) distribute at least 90% of our investment company taxable income and (2) distribute at least 98% of our income (both ordinary income and net capital gains) to avoid an excise tax. We also intend to make distributions of net realized capital gains, if any, at least annually.
We may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these distributions from time to time. In addition, we may be limited in our ability to make distributions due to the asset coverage test for borrowings when applicable to us as a business development company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and due to provisions in our credit facilities. If we do not distribute a certain percentage of our income annually, we will suffer adverse tax consequences, including possible loss of our status as a regulated investment company. We cannot assure stockholders that they will receive any distributions or distributions at a particular level.
With respect to the dividends paid to shareholders, income from origination, structuring, closing, commitment and other upfront fees associated with investments in portfolio companies is treated as taxable income and accordingly, distributed to shareholders. For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2006, upfront fees totaling $2.6 million and $6.1 million, respectively, are being amortized into income over the lives of their respective loans. For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2005, upfront fees totaled $1.1 million and $3.4 million, respectively.
In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FASB Interpretation No. ("FIN") 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. FIN 48 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. We are continuing to review the FASB's issuance of FIN 48 to determine if it will have a material impact on the Company's financial condition or results of operations. At this time, we do not believe that the Interpretation will have a material impact on the Company's financial condition or results of operations.

Note 1. Organization
Apollo Investment Corporation ("Apollo Investment", the "Company", or "We"), a Maryland corporation organized on February 2, 2004, is a closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that has filed an election to be treated as a business development company ("BDC") under the Investment Company Act of 1940. In addition, for tax purposes we have elected to be treated as a regulated investment company, or RIC, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Our investment objective is to generate both current income and capital appreciation through debt and equity investments. We invest primarily in middle-market companies in the form of mezzanine and senior secured loans, each of which may include an equity component, and, to a lesser extent, by making direct equity investments in such companies.
On April 8, 2004, Apollo Investment closed its initial public offering and sold 62,000,000 shares of its common stock at a price of $15.00 per share, less an underwriting discount and commissions totaling $0.9375 per share. We commenced operations on April 8, 2004 as we received $870.15 million in total net proceeds from the offering.
Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reported period. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining these estimates could cause actual results to differ materially.
Interim financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP for interim financial information and pursuant to the requirements for reporting on Form 10-Q and Article 6 or 10 of Regulation S-X, as appropriate. In accordance with Article 6-09 of Regulation S-X under the Exchange Act, we are providing a Statement of Changes in Net Assets in lieu of a Statement of Changes in Stockholders' Equity. In addition, certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting solely of normal recurring accruals, considered necessary for the fair presentation of financial statements for the interim period, have been included.
The significant accounting policies consistently followed by Apollo Investment are:
 
 
Table of Contents
With respect to our investments for which market quotations are not readily available, our Board of Directors undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below:
 
 
 
 
 
The types of factors that we may take into account in fair value pricing our investments include, as relevant, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company's ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flow, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparison to publicly traded securities and other relevant factors.
Determination of fair values involves subjective judgments and estimates. Accordingly, these notes to our financial statements express the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of such valuations, and any change in such valuations, on our financial statements.

Note 3. Agreements
Apollo Investment has an Investment Advisory and Management Agreement with the Investment Adviser, Apollo Investment Management, L.P., under which the Investment Adviser, subject to the overall supervision of Apollo Investment's Board of Directors, will manage the day-to-day operations of, and provide investment advisory services to, Apollo Investment. For providing these services, the Investment Adviser receives a fee from Apollo Investment, consisting of two componentsa base management fee and an incentive fee. The base management fee is determined by taking the average value of Apollo Investment's gross assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters calculated at an annual rate of 2.00%. The incentive fee has two parts, as follows: one part is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on Apollo Investment's pre-incentive fee net investment income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter. For this purpose, pre-incentive fee net investment income means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees (other than fees for providing managerial assistance), such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that we receive from portfolio companies) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus Apollo Investment's operating expenses for the quarter (including the base management fee, any expenses payable under the Administration Agreement, and any interest expense and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee). Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not include any realized capital gains computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation. Pre-incentive fee net investment income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of Apollo Investment's net assets at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, is compared to the hurdle rate of 1.75% per quarter (7% annualized). Our net investment income used to calculate this part of the incentive fee is also included in the amount of our gross assets used to calculate the 2% base management fee. Apollo Investment pays the Investment Adviser an incentive fee with respect to Apollo Investment's pre-incentive fee net investment income in each calendar quarter as follows: (1) no incentive fee in any calendar quarter in which Apollo Investment's pre-incentive fee net investment income does not exceed the hurdle rate; (2) 100% of Apollo Investment's pre-incentive fee net investment income with respect to that portion of such pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than 2.1875% in any calendar quarter; and (3) 20% of the amount of Apollo Investment's pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds 2.1875% in any calendar quarter. These calculations are appropriately pro rated for any period of less than three months and adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the relevant quarter. The second part of the incentive fee is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Investment Advisory and Management Agreement, as of the termination date), commencing on December 31, 2004, and will equal 20% of Apollo Investment's cumulative realized capital gains less cumulative realized capital losses, unrealized capital depreciation (unrealized depreciation on a gross investment-by-investment basis at the end of each calendar year) and all capital gains upon which prior performance-based capital gains incentive fee payments were previously made to the advisor.
For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2006, the Investment Adviser received $10,860 and $29,004 respectively, in base investment advisory and management fees and $9,046 and $25,898 respectively, in performance-based net investment income incentive fees from Apollo Investment. For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2005, the Investment Adviser received $6,421 and $16,222 respectively, in base investment advisory and management fees and $5,138 and $16,622 respectively, in performance-based net investment income incentive fees from Apollo Investment.
Apollo Investment has also entered into an Administration Agreement with Apollo Investment Administration, LLC (the "Administrator") under which the Administrator provides administrative services for Apollo Investment. For providing these services, facilities and personnel, Apollo Investment reimburses the Administrator for Apollo Investment's allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by Apollo Administration in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent and Apollo Investment's allocable portion of its chief financial officer and chief compliance officer and their respective staffs. The Administrator will also provide, on Apollo Investment's behalf, managerial assistance to those portfolio companies to which Apollo Investment is required to provide such assistance.
 
Table of Contents
For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2006, the Administrator was reimbursed $338 and $928 respectively, from Apollo Investment on $501 and $2,002, respectively, of expenses accrued under the Administration Agreement. For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2005, the Administrator was reimbursed $298 and $757, respectively, from Apollo Investment on the $359 and $1,074, respectively, of expenses accrued under the Administration Agreement.
On April 14, 2005, Apollo Investment entered into an $800 million Senior Secured Revolving Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement"), among Apollo Investment, the lenders party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. ("JPMorgan"), as administrative agent for the lenders. Effective December 29, 2005, lenders provided additional commitments in the amount of $100 million, increasing the total facility size to $900 million on the same terms and conditions as the existing commitments. On March 31, 2006, Apollo Investment Corporation amended and restated its $900 million senior secured, multi-currency, revolving credit facility due April 14, 2010. The amended Facility increased total commitments outstanding to $1.25 billion and extended the maturity date to April 13, 2011. The amended Facility also permits Apollo to seek additional commitments from new and existing lenders in the future, up to an aggregate amount not to exceed $2 billion. Pricing remains at 100 basis points over LIBOR. The Facility will be used to supplement Apollo's equity capital to make additional portfolio investments. From time to time, certain of the lenders provide customary commercial and investment banking services to affiliates of Apollo Investment. JPMorgan also serves as custodian and fund accounting agent for Apollo Investment.
Note 4. Net Asset Value Per Share
At December 31, 2006, the Company's total net assets and net asset value per share were $1,347,098 and $16.36, respectively. This compares to total net assets and net asset value per share at March 31, 2006 of $1,229,855 and $15.15, respectively.
Note 5. Earnings Per Share

Note 8. Expense Offset Arrangement
The Company benefits from an expense offset arrangement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. ("custodian bank") whereby the Company earns credits on any uninvested US dollar cash balances held by the custodian bank. These credits are applied by the custodian bank as a reduction of the monthly custody fees charged to the Company. The total amount of credits earned during the three and nine months ended December 31, 2006 is $17 and $82, respectively. The total amount of credits earned during the three and nine months ended December 31, 2005 is $30 and $30, respectively.
Note 9. Cash Equivalents
Pending investment in longer-term portfolio holdings, Apollo Investment makes temporary investments in U.S. Treasury bills (of varying maturities) and repurchase agreements as outlined in our prospectus. These temporary investments are deemed cash equivalents by us and are included in our Schedule of Investments. At the end of each fiscal quarter, the Company typically takes proactive steps to prospectively preserve investment flexibility in the next quarter which is assessed against the Company's total assets at its most recent quarter end. The Company can accomplish this in many ways including its current practice of purchasing U.S. Treasury bills and closing out its position on a net cash basis subsequent to quarter end. The Company may also utilize repurchase agreements or other balance sheet transactions as it deems appropriate for this purpose and these amounts are excluded from total assets for purposes of computing the asset base upon which the management fee is determined. U.S. Treasury bills with maturities of greater than 60 days from the time of purchase are marked-to-market as per our valuation policy. U.S. Treasury bills settle "regular way" on trade date plus one.
Note 10. Repurchase Agreements
The Company enters into repurchase agreements as part of its investment program. The Company's custodian takes possession of collateral pledged by the counterparty. The collateral is marked-to-market daily to ensure that the value, plus accrued interest, is at least equal to the repurchase price. In the event of default of the obligor to repurchase, the Company has the right to liquidate the collateral and apply the proceeds in satisfaction of the obligation. Under certain circumstances, in the event of default or bankruptcy by the counterparty to the agreement, realization and/or retention of the collateral or proceeds may be subject to legal proceedings. There were no repurchase agreements outstanding at December 31, 2006.

Note 12. Credit Agreement and Borrowings
At March 31, 2006 and under the terms of the amended and restated Credit Agreement, the lenders agreed to extend credit to Apollo Investment in an aggregate principal or face amount not exceeding $1.25 billion at any one time outstanding. The Credit Agreement is a five-year revolving facility (with a stated maturity date of April 14, 2011) and is secured by substantially all of the assets in Apollo Investment's portfolio, including cash and cash equivalents. Pricing is set at 100 basis points over LIBOR. The Credit Agreement contains affirmative and restrictive covenants, including: (a) periodic financial reporting requirements, (b) maintaining minimum shareholders' equity of the greater of (i) 40% of the total assets of Apollo Investment and its subsidiaries as at the last day of any fiscal quarter and (ii) the sum of (A) $300 million plus (B) 25% of the net proceeds from the sale of equity interests in Apollo Investment after the closing date of the Credit Agreement, (c) maintaining a ratio of total assets, less total liabilities (other than indebtedness) to total indebtedness, in each case of Apollo Investment and its subsidiaries, of not less than 2.0:1.0, (d) maintaining minimum liquidity, (e) limitations on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, (f) limitations on liens, (g) limitations on investments (other than in the ordinary course of Apollo Investment's business), (h) limitations on mergers and disposition of assets (other than in the normal course of Apollo Investment's business activities) and (i) limitations on the creation or existence of agreements that permit liens on properties of Apollo Investment's subsidiaries. In addition to the asset coverage ratio described in clause (c) of the preceding sentence, borrowings under the Credit Agreement (and the incurrence of certain other permitted debt) are subject to compliance with a borrowing base that applies different advance rates to different types of assets in Apollo Investment's portfolio. The Credit Agreement currently provides for the ability of Apollo Investment to seek additional commitments from lenders in an aggregate amount of up to $750 million. The Credit Agreement is used to supplement Apollo Investment's equity capital to make additional portfolio investments and for other general corporate purposes.
At December 31, 2006 and March 31, 2006, the Company had $926,434 (at value) and $323,852 (at value), respectively, drawn on its $1,250,000 revolving credit facility. The weighted average annual interest cost for the nine months ended December 31, 2006 was 5.48%, exclusive of 0.40% for commitment fees and for other prepaid expenses related to establishing the credit facility. This weighted average annual interest cost reflects the average interest cost for all borrowings, including EURIBOR, GBP LIBOR, CAD LIBOR, and USD LIBOR.
The average debt outstanding on the credit facility was $602,057 for the nine months ended December 31, 2006. The maximum amount borrowed during this period was $926,434. The remaining amount available under the facility was $323,566 at December 31, 2006.
At December 31, 2006, the Company was in compliance with all financial and operational covenants required by the Credit Agreement.

Note 13. Commitments and Contingencies
On October 12, 2006, the Company entered into a mezzanine investment with Serpering Investments B.V. (Casema), making an investment of 15,271. The Company also committed to making an additional investment of 16,879 at a later date, subject to various events and contingencies. This additional investment is currently expected to close in our fourth fiscal quarter.
Note 14. Subsequent Events
On January 18, 2007, we closed our follow-on equity offering and issued 18 million shares of common stock receiving approximately $385,744 in net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions. The Company expects to use the net proceeds of the offering to make investments in portfolio companies, repay amounts outstanding under its senior credit facility, and for general corporate purposes.
In addition, on February 7, 2007 we issued 2.7 million shares of common stock to cover the underwriter's over-allotment option on the January 18, 2007 equity offering receiving approximately $57,862 in net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions.

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
Apollo Investment Corporation
We have reviewed the accompanying statements of assets and liabilities of Apollo Investment Corporation (the "Company") as of December 31, 2006 and March 31, 2006, including the schedules of investments, the related statements of operations for the three and nine-month periods ended December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005 and of cash flows for the nine-month periods ended December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005 and the statements of changes in net assets for the nine-month period ended December 31, 2006 and for the year ended March 31, 2006. These interim financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.
We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.
Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying interim financial statements for them to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the statement of assets and liabilities as of March 31, 2006, and the related statements of operations, of cash flows and of changes in net assets for the year then ended, management's assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2006 and the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2006; and in our report dated June 9, 2006, we expressed unqualified opinions thereon. The financial statements and management's assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting referred to above are not presented herein. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities as of March 31, 2006, is fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the statement of assets and liabilities from which it has been derived.

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Certain statements in this report that relate to estimates or expectations of our future performance or financial condition may constitute "forward-looking statements" as defined under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, statements as to:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
We may use words such as "anticipates," "believes," "expects," "intends", "will", "should," "may" and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on currently available operating, financial and competitive information and are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our historical experience and our present expectations. Undue reliance should not be placed on such forward-looking statements, as such statements speak only as of the date on which they are made. Additional information regarding these and other risks and uncertainties is contained in our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Overview
Apollo Investment was incorporated under the Maryland General Corporation Law in February 2004. We have elected to be treated as a business development company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("1940 Act"). As such, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. For instance, we generally have to invest at least 70% of our total assets in "qualifying assets," including securities of private or thinly traded public U.S. companies, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less. In addition, for federal income tax purposes we have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Pursuant to this election and assuming we qualify as a RIC, we generally do not have to pay corporate-level federal income taxes on any income we distribute to our stockholders. On April 8, 2004, we completed our initial public offering as an externally managed, non-diversified, closed-end investment company that elected to be treated as a business development company under the 1940 Act. We commenced operations on April 8, 2004 upon receipt of $870 million in net proceeds from our initial public offering of common stock. On March 22, 2006, the Company closed on its second public offering and sold 17,250,000 shares of its common stock at a price of $17.85 per share, receiving $294 million in total net proceeds from the offering. And, most recently, on January 18, 2007, the Company closed on a follow-on offering selling 18,000,000 shares of its common stock at a price of $22.44 per share and received $386 million in total net proceeds.
Investments
Our level of investment activity can and does vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt and equity capital available to middle market companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity for such companies, the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make. Over the last twenty-four months, we believe that the availability of senior debt capital from banks for middle market companies has generally increased and has put downward pressure on interest rate spreads at the same time that base interest rates have risen. We do not expect this increased availability of capital to impair our ability to make longer-term investment allocations with our capital.
 
Table of Contents
As a business development company, we must not acquire any assets other than "qualifying assets" specified in the 1940 Act unless, at the time the acquisition is made, at least 70% of our total assets are qualifying assets (with certain limited exceptions). Qualifying assets include investments in "eligible portfolio companies." The SEC recently adopted new rules under the 1940 Act to expand the definition of "eligible portfolio company" to include all private companies and companies whose securities are not listed on a national securities exchange. The new rules also will permit us to include as qualifying assets certain follow-on investments in companies that were eligible portfolio companies at the time of initial investment but that no longer meet the definition. The new rules became effective November 30, 2006. Due to this new rule, we will no longer be required to determine the eligibility of a portfolio company by reference to whether or not it has outstanding marginable securities.
In addition to the adoption of the rules described above, the SEC also proposed for comment a rule that would include as eligible portfolio companies certain public companies that have listed their securities on a national securities exchange, as long as their public float and/or market capitalization are below a specified level. We will continue to monitor closely any developments with respect to the definition of eligible portfolio company, and intend to adjust our investment focus as needed to comply with and/or take advantage of the new rules as well as any other regulatory, legislative, administrative or judicial actions in this area.
Revenue
We generate revenue primarily in the form of interest income from the debt securities we hold and capital gains, if any, on investment securities that we may acquire in portfolio companies. Our debt investments, whether in the form of mezzanine or senior secured loans, generally have a stated term of five to ten years and bear interest at a fixed rate or a floating rate usually determined on the basis of a benchmark: LIBOR, EURIBOR, GBP LIBOR, CAD LIBOR, or the prime rate. While U.S. subordinated debt and corporate notes typically accrue interest at fixed rates, some of these investments may include zero coupon, payment-in-kind ("PIK") and/or step-up bonds that accrue income on a constant yield to call or maturity basis. Interest on debt securities is generally payable quarterly or semiannually. In some cases, some of our investments provide for deferred interest payments or PIK. The principal amount of the debt securities and any accrued but unpaid interest generally becomes due at the maturity date. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of dividends paid to us on equity investments as well as revenue in the form of commitment, origination, structuring and/or diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and, if applicable, consulting fees, etc.
Expenses
All investment professionals of the investment adviser and their staff, when and to the extent engaged in providing investment advisory and management services to us, and the compensation and routine overhead expenses of that personnel which is allocable to those services are provided and paid for by Apollo Investment Management. We bear all other costs and expenses of our operations and transactions, including those relating to:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table of Contents
 
 
 
 
 
 
We expect our general and administrative operating expenses related to our ongoing operations to remain generally stable or increase moderately in dollar terms, but decline slightly as a percentage of our total assets in future periods. Incentive fees, interest expense and costs relating to future offerings of securities, among others, would be additive.
Portfolio and Investment Activity
During the quarter ended December 31, 2006, we expected and saw seasonally high transaction volumes in a highly competitive marketplace. The market's overall liquidity and investors' appetite for yield continued to drive average credit spreads generally lower. Accordingly, we remained steadfast to our investment disciplines against our broad pipeline selecting the relatively few investment opportunities that met or exceeded our risk-reward standards. Gross investments totaled $233.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2006 across 6 new and 2 existing portfolio companies. This compared to investing $257.3 million in 5 new and 2 existing portfolio companies for the three months ended December 31, 2005. Investment sales and pre-payment proceeds totaled $85.3 million during the quarter versus $102.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2005.
At December 31, 2006, our net portfolio consisted of 54 companies with an average investment size exceeding $41 million. Overall portfolio composition was distributed 65% in subordinated debt, 2% in preferred equity, 8% in common equity and 25% in senior secured loans versus 42 portfolio companies invested 60% in subordinated debt, 6% in common equity and 34% in senior secured loans at December 31, 2005. Our targeted investment size typically ranges between $20 million and $150 million, although this investment size may vary proportionately as the size of our capital base changes.
The weighted average yields on our subordinated debt portfolio, senior secured loan portfolio and total debt portfolio were 13.6%, 12.7% and 13.4%, respectively, at December 31, 2006 versus 13.4%, 11.3% and 12.6%, respectively, at December 31, 2005.
Senior secured loans and European mezzanine loans typically accrue interest at variable rates determined on the basis of a benchmark: LIBOR, EURIBOR, GBP LIBOR, CAD LIBOR, or the prime rate, with stated maturities at origination that typically range from 5 to 10 years. While subordinated debt issued within the United States will typically accrue interest at fixed rates, some of these investments may include zero-coupon, PIK and/or step bonds that accrue income on a constant yield to call or maturity basis. At December 31, 2006, 58% or $1,203.8 million of our interest-bearing portfolio is fixed rate debt and 42% or $864.9 million is floating rate debt.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ materially. In addition to the discussion below, our critical accounting policies are further described in the notes to the financial statements.
Valuation of Portfolio Investments
As a business development company, we generally invest in illiquid securities including debt and equity securities of middle market companies. Under procedures established by our board of directors, we value investments, including certain subordinated debt, senior secured debt and other debt securities with maturities greater than 60 days, for which market quotations are readily available, at such market quotations. We obtain these market values from an independent pricing service or at the mean between the bid and ask prices obtained from at least two brokers or dealers (if available, otherwise by a principal market maker or a primary market dealer). Debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded or whose market prices are not readily available are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of our board of directors. Such determination of fair values may involve subjective judgments and estimates. Investments purchased within 60 days of maturity are valued at cost plus accreted discount, or minus amortized premium, which approximates value. With respect to unquoted securities, our board of directors, together with our independent valuation advisers value each investment considering, among other measures, discounted cash flow models, comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public and other factors. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, our board will use the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate and/or assist us in our valuation. Because we expect that there will not be a readily available market for many of the investments in our portfolio, we expect to value many of our portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of our board of directors using a documented valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value existed for such investments, and the differences could be material.
With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, our board of directors has approved a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below:
 
 
 
 
 
In September, 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") 157, Fair Value Measurements, which clarifies the definition of fair value and requires companies to expand their disclosure about the use of fair value to measure assets and liabilities in interim and annual periods subsequent to initial recognition. Adoption of SFAS 157 requires the use of the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. At this time, the Company is in the process of reviewing the Standard against its current valuation policies to determine future applicability.

Revenue Recognition
We record interest income on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. For loans and debt securities with contractual PIK interest, which represents contractual interest accrued and added to the loan balance that generally becomes due at maturity, we will not accrue PIK interest if the portfolio company valuation indicates that the PIK interest is not collectible. We do not accrue as a receivable interest on loans and debt securities if we have reason to doubt our ability to collect such interest. Loan origination fees, original issue discount, and market discount are capitalized and then we amortize such amounts as interest income. Upon the prepayment of a loan or debt security, any unamortized loan origination fees are recorded as interest income. We record prepayment premiums on loans and debt securities as interest income when we receive such amounts.
Net Realized Gains or Losses and Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation or Depreciation
We measure realized gains or losses by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment, without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized, but considering unamortized upfront fees and prepayment penalties. Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflects the change in portfolio investment values during the reporting period, including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation, when gains or losses are realized.
Within the context of these critical accounting policies, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported.
Results of Operations
Results comparisons are for the three and nine months ended December 2006 and December 2005.
Investment Income
Gross investment income totaled $71.1 million and $190.8 million, respectively for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2006 compared to $37.6 million and $110.4 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2005. The increase in investment income for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2006 was primarily due to the continued growth and asset mix of our investment portfolio as compared to the year-ago period. A notable event impacting investment income in the current period included dividend income of $1.8 million from Sorenson Communications, Inc. Origination, closing and/or commitment fees associated with investments in portfolio companies are accreted into interest income over the respective terms of the applicable loans.
Expenses
Net expenses totaled $32.4 million and $86.6 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2006 versus $17.0 million and $43.9 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2005. Of these totals, for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2006, $7.2 million and $25.9 million, respectively, were performance-based incentive fees and $12.8 million and $26.7 million, respectively, were interest and other credit facility expenses. This compares to $5.1 million and $16.6 million in performance-based incentive fees and $4.2 million and $7.0 million in interest and other credit facility expenses for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2005. Expenses net of performance-based incentive fees, interest, and other credit facility expenses for the three months and nine months ended December 31, 2006 were $12.3 million and $34.0 million, respectively, versus $7.7 million and $20.3 million for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2005. These net expenses consist of base investment advisory and management fees, insurance expenses, administrative services expenses, professional fees, directors' fees, audit and tax services expenses, and other general and administrative expenses. The increase in expenses was driven primarily by an increase in base investment advisory and management fees resulting from the growth of our investment portfolio. For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2006, excise tax expenses totaled $0.7 million. There was no excise tax expense for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2005.
Net Investment Income
The Company's net investment income totaled $38.0 million and $103.6 million or $0.46 per share and $1.27 per share, respectively, for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2006. For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2005, the Company's net investment income totaled $20.6 million and $66.5 million or $0.33 per share and $1.06 per share, respectively.
 
Table of Contents
Net Realized Gains/Losses
The Company had investment sales totaling $85.3 million and $496.7 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2006 versus $102.6 million and $361.3 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2005. Total net realized losses and gains, respectively for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2006 were $0.5 million and $26.3 million versus total net realized gains for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2005 of $4.7 million and $10.9 million. Included in the total net realized gains or losses are currency losses of $3.5 million and $7.0 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2006 versus currency gains of $2.6 million and $5.4 million for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2005.
Net Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) on Investments and Foreign Currencies
For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2006, the Company's investments, foreign currencies and other assets and liabilities had a net increase in appreciation of $19.4 million and $79.5 million, respectively, versus a net increase in appreciation of $8.3 million and $0.7 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2005. At December 31, 2006, net unrealized appreciation totaled $117.8 million, of which $144.3 million was attributable to net unrealized appreciation on our subordinated debt and private equity (after considering the effects of foreign currency borrowing/hedging for our non-U.S. investments) and $26.5 million was attributable to net unrealized depreciation on our bank debt/senior secured debt.
Net Increase in Net Assets From Operations
For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2006, the Company had a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of $57.0 million and $209.4 million, respectively, versus an increase of $33.5 million and $78.1 million for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2005, respectively. The net change in net assets from operations per share was $0.69 and $2.57, respectively, for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2006 versus $0.53 and $1.25 for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2005, respectively.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
The Company's liquidity and capital resources are generated primarily through its senior secured, multi-currency $1.25 billion, five-year credit facility maturing in April 2011 as well as from cash flows from operations, including investment sales and prepayments of senior and subordinated loans and income earned from investments and cash equivalents. At December 31, 2006, the Company has $926 million in borrowings outstanding and had $324 million available for its use. Subsequent to the quarter ended December 31, 2006, we closed our follow-on equity offering and issued 18 million shares of common stock on January 18, 2007 receiving $386 million in net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions. In addition, on February 7, 2007 we issued 2.7 million shares of common stock to cover the underwriter's over-allotment option on the January 18, 2007 equity offering receiving approximately $58 million in net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions. In the future, the Company may raise additional equity or debt capital off its shelf registration or may securitize a portion of its investments. It may also further access $750 million of additional credit commitments available under the terms of its current credit facility and as the Company's equity capital base grows further. The primary use of funds will be investments in portfolio companies, cash distributions to our shareholders and for other general corporate purposes.
Contractual Obligations
We have entered into two contracts under which we have future commitments: the investment advisory and management agreement, pursuant to which Apollo Investment Management has agreed to serve as our investment adviser, and the administration agreement, pursuant to which Apollo Administration has agreed to furnish us with the facilities and administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations and provide on our behalf managerial assistance to those portfolio companies to which we are required to provide such assistance. Payments under the investment advisory and management agreement are equal to (1) a percentage of the value of our gross assets and (2) a two-part incentive fee. Payments under the administration agreement are equal to an amount based upon our allocable portion of Apollo Administration's overhead in performing its obligations under the administration agreement, including rent, technology systems, insurance and our allocable portion of the costs of our chief financial officer and chief compliance officer and their respective staffs. Either party may terminate each of the investment advisory and management agreement and administration agreement without penalty upon not more than 60 days' written notice to the other. Please see Note 3 within our financial statements for more information.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
On October 12, 2006, the Company entered into a mezzanine investment with Serpering Investments B.V. (Casema), making an investment of 15.3 million. The Company also committed to making an additional investment of 16.9 million at a later date, subject to various events and contingencies. This additional investment is currently expected to close in our fourth fiscal quarter.
At December 31, 2006, there are no additional off-balance sheet liabilities or other contractual obligations that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, other than the investment advisory and management agreement and the administration agreement.
Dividends
Dividends paid to stockholders for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2006 totaled $41.0 million or $0.50 per share and $115.9 million or $1.42 per share, respectively. For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2005, dividends paid totaled $27.8 million or $0.44 per share and $74.1 million or $1.18 per share, respectively. Tax characteristics of all dividends will be reported to shareholders on Form 1099 after the end of the calendar year.
We have elected to be taxed as a regulated investment company under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. In order to maintain our status as a regulated investment company, we are required to (1) distribute at least 90% of our investment company taxable income and (2) distribute at least 98% of our income (both ordinary income and net capital gains) to avoid an excise tax. We also intend to make distributions of net realized capital gains, if any, at least annually.
We may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these distributions from time to time. In addition, we may be limited in our ability to make distributions due to the asset coverage test for borrowings when applicable to us as a business development company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and due to provisions in our credit facilities. If we do not distribute a certain percentage of our income annually, we will suffer adverse tax consequences, including possible loss of our status as a regulated investment company. We cannot assure stockholders that they will receive any distributions or distributions at a particular level.
With respect to the dividends paid to shareholders, income from origination, structuring, closing, commitment and other upfront fees associated with investments in portfolio companies is treated as taxable income and accordingly, distributed to shareholders. For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2006, upfront fees totaling $2.6 million and $6.1 million, respectively, are being amortized into income over the lives of their respective loans. For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2005, upfront fees totaled $1.1 million and $3.4 million, respectively.
In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FASB Interpretation No. ("FIN") 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. FIN 48 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. We are continuing to review the FASB's issuance of FIN 48 to determine if it will have a material impact on the Company's financial condition or results of operations. At this time, we do not believe that the Interpretation will have a material impact on the Company's financial condition or results of operations.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. During the three and nine months ended December 31, 2006, many of the loans in our portfolio had floating interest rates. These loans are usually based on a floating LIBO rate and typically have durations of one to six months after which they reset to current market interest rates. As the percentage of our mezzanine and other subordinated loans increase as a percentage of our total investments, we expect that more of the loans in our portfolio will have fixed rates. Accordingly, we may hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using standard hedging instruments such as futures, options and forward contracts subject to the requirements of the 1940 Act. While hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates, they may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to our portfolio of investments. During the three and nine months ended December 31, 2006, we did not engage in interest rate hedging activities.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures
(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
As of December 31, 2006 (the end of the period covered by this report), we, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the 1934 Act). Based on that evaluation, our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and provided reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our periodic SEC filings is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC
'
s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. However, in evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of such possible controls and procedures.
(b) Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting
Management has not identified any change in the Company's internal control over financing reporting that occurred during the third quarter of fiscal 2007 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION
Item 1. Legal Proceedings
We, Apollo Investment Management and Apollo Investment Administration are not currently subject to any legal proceedings.
Item 1A. Risk Factors
A restated description of the risk factors associated with our business is set forth below. This description includes any changes (whether or not material) to, and supersedes, the description of the risk factors associated with our business previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006.
RISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS AND STRUCTURE
We can offer no assurance that we will be able to replicate the success of Apollo's private funds and our investment returns could be substantially lower than the returns achieved by those private funds.
Even though Apollo Investment Management is led by senior investment professionals of Apollo who apply the value-oriented philosophy and techniques used by the Apollo investment professionals in their private fund investing, our investment strategies and objectives differ from those of other private funds that are or have been managed by the Apollo investment professionals. Further, investors in Apollo Investment are not acquiring an interest in other Apollo funds. Further, while Apollo Investment may consider potential co-investment participation in portfolio investments with other Apollo funds, any such investment activity is subject to a number of limitations, including applicable allocation policies and regulatory limitations on certain types of co-investment activity. Certain types of negotiated co-investments may be made only if we receive an order from the SEC permitting us to do so. There can be no assurance that any such order will be obtained. Accordingly, we can offer no assurance that Apollo Investment will replicate Apollo's historical success, and we caution you that our investment returns could be substantially lower than the returns achieved by those private funds.
We are dependent upon Apollo Investment Management's key personnel for our future success and upon their access to Apollo's investment professionals and partners.
We depend on the diligence, skill and network of business contacts of the senior management of Apollo Investment Management. Members of our senior management may depart at any time. For a description of the senior management team, see "Management." We also depend, to a significant extent, on Apollo Investment Management's access to the investment professionals and partners of Apollo and the information and deal flow generated by the Apollo investment professionals in the course of their investment and portfolio management activities. The senior management of Apollo Investment Management evaluates, negotiates, structures, closes and monitors our investments. Our future success depends on the continued service of the senior management team of Apollo Investment Management. The departure of any of our directors or the senior managers of Apollo Investment Management, or of a significant number of the investment professionals or partners of Apollo, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our investment objective. In addition, we can offer no assurance that Apollo Investment Management will remain our investment adviser or that we will continue to have access to Apollo's partners and investment professionals or its information and deal flow.
Our financial condition and results of operation depend on our ability to manage future growth effectively.
Our ability to achieve our investment objective depends, in part, on our ability to grow, which depends, in turn, on Apollo Investment Management's ability to identify, invest in and monitor companies that meet our investment criteria. Accomplishing this result on a cost-effective basis is largely a function of Apollo Investment Management's structuring of the investment process, its ability to provide competent, attentive and efficient services to us and our access to financing on acceptable terms. The senior management team of Apollo Investment Management has substantial responsibilities under the investment advisory and management agreement, as well as in connection with their roles as officers of other Apollo funds. They may also be called upon to provide managerial assistance to our portfolio companies as principals of our administrator. These demands on their time may distract them or slow the rate of investment. In order to grow, we and Apollo Investment Management need to hire, train, supervise and manage new employees. Any failure to manage our future growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
Table of Contents
We operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities.
A number of entities compete with us to make the types of investments that we make in middle-market companies. We compete with public and private funds, commercial and investment banks, commercial financing companies, and, to the extent they provide an alternative form of financing, private equity funds. Additionally, because competition for investment opportunities generally has increased among alternative investment vehicles, such as hedge funds, those entities have begun to invest in areas they have not traditionally invested in, including investments in middle-market companies. As a result of these new entrants, competition for investment opportunities at middle-market companies has intensified and we expect that trend to continue. Some of our existing and potential competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. For example, some competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that are not available to us. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than us. Furthermore, many of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the 1940 Act imposes on us as a business development company. We cannot assure you that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Also, as a result of this existing and increasing competition, we may not be able to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities from time to time, and we can offer no assurance that we will be able to identify and make investments that are consistent with our investment objective.
We do not seek to compete primarily based on the interest rates we offer, and we believe that some of our competitors make loans with interest rates that are comparable to or lower than the rates we offer.
We may lose investment opportunities if we do not match our competitors' pricing, terms and structure. If we match our competitors' pricing, terms and structure, we may experience decreased net interest income and increased risk of credit loss.
Any failure on our part to maintain our status as a business development company would reduce our operating flexibility.
If we do not remain a business development company, we might be regulated as a closed-end investment company under the 1940 Act, which would subject us to substantially more regulatory restrictions under the 1940 Act and correspondingly decrease our operating flexibility.
We will be subject to corporate-level income tax if we are unable to qualify as a RIC.
To qualify as a RIC under the Code, we must meet certain source-of-income, asset diversification and annual distribution requirements. The annual distribution requirement for a RIC is satisfied if we distribute at least 90% of our ordinary income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any, to our stockholders on an annual basis. To the extent we use debt financing, we are subject to certain asset coverage ratio requirements under the 1940 Act and financial covenants under loan and credit agreements that could, under certain circumstances, restrict us from making distributions necessary to qualify as a RIC. If we are unable to obtain cash from other sources, we may fail to qualify as a RIC and, thus, may be subject to corporate-level income tax. To qualify as a RIC, we must also meet certain asset diversification requirements at the end of each calendar quarter. Failure to meet these tests may result in our having to dispose of certain investments quickly in order to prevent the loss of RIC status. Because most of our investments are in private companies, any such dispositions could be made at disadvantageous prices and may result in substantial losses. If we fail to qualify as a RIC for any reason and become subject to corporate income tax, the resulting corporate taxes could substantially reduce our net assets, the amount of income available for distribution and the amount of our distributions. Such a failure would have a material adverse effect on us and our stockholders.
We may have difficulty paying our required distributions if we recognize income before or without receiving cash representing such income.
For federal income tax purposes, we include in income certain amounts that we have not yet received in cash, such as original issue discount, which may arise if we receive warrants in connection with the making of a loan or possibly in other circumstances, or payment-in-kind interest, which represents contractual interest added to the loan balance and due at the end of the loan term. Such original issue discount, which could be significant relative to Apollo Investment's overall investment activities, or increases in loan balances as a result of payment-in-kind arrangements are included in income before we receive any corresponding cash payments. We also may be required to include in income certain other amounts that we do not receive in cash.
 
Table of Contents
That part of the incentive fee payable by us that relates to our net investment income is computed and paid on income that may include interest that has been accrued but not yet received in cash. If a portfolio company defaults on a loan that is structured to provide accrued interest, it is possible that accrued interest previously used in the calculation of the incentive fee will become uncollectible.
Since in certain cases we may recognize income before or without receiving cash representing such income, we may have difficulty meeting the tax requirement to distribute at least 90% of our ordinary income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any, to maintain our status as a RIC. Accordingly, we may have to sell some of our investments at times we would not consider advantageous, raise additional debt or equity capital or reduce new investment originations to meet these distribution requirements.
Regulations governing our operation as a business development company affect our ability to, and the way in which we, raise additional capital.
We may issue debt securities or preferred stock and/or borrow money from banks or other financial institutions, which we refer to collectively as "senior securities," up to the maximum amount permitted by the 1940 Act. Under the provisions of the 1940 Act, we are permitted, as a business development company, to issue senior securities only in amounts such that our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, equals at least 200% after each issuance of senior securities. If the value of our assets declines, we may be unable to satisfy this test. If that happens, we may be required to sell a portion of our investments and, depending on the nature of our leverage, repay a portion of our indebtedness at a time when such sales may be disadvantageous.
We are not generally able to issue and sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share. We may, however, sell our common stock at a price below the current net asset value of the common stock, or sell warrants, options or rights to acquire such common stock at a price below the current net asset value of the stock, if our board of directors determines that such sale is in the best interests of Apollo Investment and its stockholders, and our stockholders approve Apollo Investment's policy and practice of making such sales. In any such case, the price at which our securities are to be issued and sold may not be less than a price which, in the determination of our board of directors, closely approximates the market value of such securities (less any distributing commission or discount).
In addition to issuing securities to raise capital as described above, we may in the future seek to securitize our loans to generate cash for funding new investments. To securitize loans, we may create a wholly owned subsidiary and contribute a pool of loans to the subsidiary. This could include the sale of interests in the subsidiary on a non-recourse basis to purchasers who we would expect to be willing to accept a lower interest rate to invest in investment grade loan pools, and we would retain a portion of the equity in the securitized pool of loans. An inability to successfully securitize our loan portfolio could limit our ability to grow our business and fully execute our business strategy, and could decrease our earnings, if any. Moreover, the successful securitization of our loan portfolio might expose us to losses as the residual loans in which we do not sell interests may tend to be those that are riskier and more apt to generate losses.
We currently use borrowed funds to make investments and are exposed to the typical risks associated with leverage.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table of Contents
We fund a portion of our investments with borrowed money, which magnifies the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested and may increase the risk of investing in us.
Borrowings, also known as leverage, magnify the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested and, therefore, increase the risks associated with investing in our securities. We entered into a credit agreement in April 2005 with institutional banks and other lenders to facilitate such borrowing. Our lenders have fixed dollar claims on our consolidated assets that are superior to the claims of our common stockholders. If the value of our consolidated assets increases, then leveraging would cause the net asset value to increase more sharply than it would have had we not leveraged. Conversely, if the value of our consolidated assets decreases, leveraging would cause net asset value to decline more sharply than it otherwise would have had we not leveraged. Similarly, any increase in our consolidated income in excess of consolidated interest payable on the borrowed funds would cause our net income to increase more than it would without the leverage, while any decrease in our consolidated income would cause net income to decline more sharply than it would have had we not borrowed. Such a decline could negatively affect our ability to make common stock dividend payments. Leverage is generally considered a speculative investment technique.
Changes in interest rates may affect our cost of capital and net investment income.
Because we borrow money to make investments, our net investment income will depend, in part, upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest these funds. As a result, we can offer no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. In periods of rising interest rates, our cost of funds would increase, which could reduce our net investment income. Our long-term fixed-rate investments are financed primarily with equity and long-term debt. We may use interest rate risk management techniques in an effort to limit our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. Such techniques may include various interest rate hedging activities to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act. We have analyzed the potential impact of changes in interest rates on interest income net of interest expense. Assuming that the balance sheet were to remain constant and no actions were taken to alter the existing interest rate sensitivity, a hypothetical immediate 1% change in interest rates would have affected our net income over a one-year horizon. Although management believes that this estimated measure is indicative of our sensitivity to interest rate changes, it does not adjust for potential changes in credit quality, size and composition of the assets on the balance sheet and other business developments that could affect net increase in net assets resulting from operations, or net income. Accordingly, no assurances can be given that actual results would not differ materially from the potential outcome simulated by this estimate.
You should also be aware that a rise in the general level of interest rates can be expected to lead to higher interest rates applicable to our debt investments. Accordingly, an increase in interest rates would make it easier for us to meet or exceed the incentive fee hurdle rate and may result in a substantial increase of the amount of incentive fees payable to our investment adviser with respect to pre-incentive fee net investment income.
We need to raise additional capital to grow because we must distribute most of our income.
We may need additional capital to fund growth in our investments. We have issued equity securities and have borrowed from financial institutions. A reduction in the availability of new capital could limit our ability to grow. We must distribute at least 90% of our ordinary income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any, to our stockholders to maintain our regulated investment company status. As a result, such earnings are not available to fund investment originations. We expect to continue to borrow from financial institutions and issue additional debt and equity securities. If we fail to obtain funds from such sources or from other sources to fund our investments, it could limit our ability to grow, which may have an adverse effect on the value of our securities. In addition, as a business development company, we are generally required to maintain a ratio of at least 200% of total assets to total borrowings, which may restrict our ability to borrow in certain circumstances.
 
Table of Contents
Many of our portfolio investments are recorded at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors and, as a result, there is uncertainty as to the value of our portfolio investments.
A large percentage of our portfolio investments are in the form of securities that are not publicly traded. The fair value of securities and other investments that are not publicly traded may not be readily determinable. We value these securities quarterly at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors. However, we may be required to value our securities at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors to the extent necessary to reflect significant events affecting the value of our securities. Our board of directors utilizes the services of several independent valuation firms to aid it in determining the fair value of these securities. The types of factors that may be considered in fair value pricing of our investments include the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company's ability to make payments and its earnings, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparison to publicly traded companies, discounted cash flow and other relevant factors. Because such valuations, and particularly valuations of private securities and private companies, are inherently uncertain, may fluctuate over short periods of time and may be based on estimates, our determinations of fair value may differ materially from the values that would have been used if a ready market for these securities existed. Our net asset value could be adversely affected if our determinations regarding the fair value of our investments were materially higher than the values that we ultimately realize upon the disposal of such securities.
The lack of liquidity in our investments may adversely affect our business.
We generally make investments in private companies. Substantially all of these securities are subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or are otherwise less liquid than publicly traded securities. The illiquidity of our investments may make it difficult for us to sell such investments if the need arises. In addition, if we are required to liquidate all or a portion of our portfolio quickly, we may realize significantly less than the value at which we have previously recorded our investments. In addition, we may face other restrictions on our ability to liquidate an investment in a portfolio company to the extent that we or an affiliated manager of Apollo has material non-public information regarding such portfolio company.
We may experience fluctuations in our quarterly results.
We could experience fluctuations in our quarterly operating results due to a number of factors, including the interest rate payable on the debt securities we acquire, the default rate on such securities, the level of our expenses, variations in and the timing of the recognition of realized and unrealized gains or losses, the degree to which we encounter competition in our markets and general economic conditions. As a result of these factors, results for any period should not be relied upon as being indicative of performance in future periods.
There are significant potential conflicts of interest which could impact our investment returns.
Our executive officers and directors, and the partners of our investment adviser, Apollo Investment Management, serve or may serve as officers, directors or principals of entities that operate in the same or a related line of business as we do or of investment funds managed by our affiliates. Accordingly, they may have obligations to investors in those entities, the fulfillment of which might not be in the best interests of us or our stockholders. Moreover, we note that, notwithstanding the difference in principal investment objectives between Apollo Investment and other Apollo funds, such other Apollo sponsored funds, including new affiliated potential pooled investment vehicles or managed accounts not yet established, have and may from time to time have overlapping investment objectives with those of Apollo Investment and, accordingly, invest in, whether principally or secondarily, asset classes similar to those targeted by Apollo Investment. To the extent such other investment vehicles have overlapping investment objectives, the scope of opportunities otherwise available to us may be adversely affected and/or reduced. As a result, the partners of Apollo Investment Management may face conflicts in their time management and commitments as well as in the allocation of investment opportunities to other Apollo funds. We do not anticipate making an initial investment in any portfolio company in which Apollo or any affiliate has a pre-existing investment. In addition, in the event such investment opportunities are allocated among Apollo Investment and other investment vehicles affiliated with Apollo Investment Management, our desired investment portfolio may be adversely affected. Although Apollo Investment Management endeavors to allocate investment opportunities in a fair and equitable manner, it is possible that we may not be given the opportunity to participate in certain investments made by investment funds managed by investment managers affiliated with Apollo Investment Management.
 
Table of Contents
Apollo Investment Management and its affiliates and investment managers may determine that an investment is appropriate both for us and for one or more other funds. In such event, depending on the availability of such investment and other appropriate factors, Apollo Investment Management may determine that we should invest on a side-by-side basis with one or more other funds. We do not anticipate making an initial investment in any portfolio company in which Apollo or any affiliate has a pre-existing investment. We may make all such investments subject to compliance with applicable regulations and interpretations, and our allocation procedures. Certain types of negotiated co-investments may be made only if we receive an order from the SEC permitting us to do so. There can be no assurance that any such order will be obtained.
In the course of our investing activities, we pay management and incentive fees to Apollo Investment Management, and reimburse Apollo Investment Management for certain expenses it incurs. As a result, investors in our common stock invest on a "gross" basis and receive distributions on a "net" basis after expenses, resulting in, among other things, a lower rate of return than one might achieve through direct investments. As a result of this arrangement, there may be times when the management team of Apollo Investment Management has interests that differ from those of our stockholders, giving rise to a conflict.
Apollo Investment Management receives a quarterly incentive fee based, in part, on our pre-incentive fee income, if any, for the immediately preceding calendar quarter. This incentive fee is subject to a quarterly hurdle rate before providing an incentive fee return to the investment adviser. To the extent we or Apollo Investment Management are able to exert influence over our portfolio companies, the quarterly pre-incentive fee may provide Apollo Investment Management with an incentive to induce our portfolio companies to accelerate or defer interest or other obligations owed to us from one calendar quarter to another.
We have entered into a royalty-free license agreement with Apollo, pursuant to which Apollo has agreed to grant us a non-exclusive license to use the name "Apollo." Under the license agreement, we have the right to use the "Apollo" name for so long as Apollo Investment Management or one of its affiliates remains our investment adviser. In addition, we rent office space from Apollo Administration, an affiliate of Apollo Investment Management, and pay Apollo Administration our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by Apollo Administration in performing its obligations under the administration agreement, including our allocable portion of the cost of our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Compliance Officer and their respective staffs, which can create conflicts of interest that our board of directors must monitor.
Changes in laws or regulations governing our operations may adversely affect our business.
We and our portfolio companies are subject to regulation by laws at the local, state and federal levels. These laws and regulations, as well as their interpretation, may be changed from time to time. Accordingly, any change in these laws or regulations could have a material adverse affect on our business.
RISKS RELATED TO OUR INVESTMENTS
We may not realize gains from our equity investments.
When we invest in mezzanine or senior secured loans, we have and may continue to acquire warrants or other equity securities as well. In addition, we may invest directly in the equity securities of portfolio companies. Our goal is ultimately to dispose of such equity interests and realize gains upon our disposition of such interests. However, the equity interests we receive may not appreciate in value and, in fact, may decline in value. Accordingly, we may not be able to realize gains from our equity interests, and any gains that we do realize on the disposition of any equity interests may not be sufficient to offset any other losses we experience.
Our portfolio is concentrated in a limited number of portfolio companies, which subject us to a risk of significant loss if any of these companies defaults on its obligations under any of its debt securities.
As of December 31, 2006, we have investments in 54 companies. A consequence of this limited number of investments is that the aggregate returns we realize may be significantly adversely affected if a small number of investments perform poorly or if we need to write down the value of any one investment. Beyond our income tax diversification requirements, we do not have fixed guidelines for diversification, and our investments could be concentrated in relatively few portfolio companies.
 
Table of Contents
Our investments in prospective portfolio companies may be risky, and you could lose all or part of your investment.
Investment in middle-market companies involves a number of significant risks, including:
 
 
 
 
Economic recessions or downturns could impair our portfolio companies and harm our operating results.
Many of our portfolio companies may be susceptible to economic slowdowns or recessions and may be unable to repay our loans during these periods. Therefore, our non-performing assets are likely to increase and the value of our portfolio is likely to decrease during these periods. Adverse economic conditions also may decrease the value of collateral securing some of our loans and the value of our equity investments. Economic slowdowns or recessions could lead to financial losses in our portfolio and a decrease in revenues, net income and assets. Unfavorable economic conditions also could increase our funding costs, limit our access to the capital markets or result in a decision by lenders not to extend credit to us. These events could prevent us from increasing investments and harm our operating results.
A portfolio company's failure to satisfy financial or operating covenants imposed by us or other lenders could lead to defaults and, potentially, termination of its loans and foreclosure on its secured assets, which could trigger cross-defaults under other agreements and jeopardize our portfolio company's ability to meet its obligations under the debt securities that we hold. We may incur expenses to the extent necessary to seek recovery upon default or to negotiate new terms with a defaulting portfolio company. In addition, if one of our portfolio companies were to go bankrupt, even though we or one of our affiliates may have structured our interest as senior debt, depending on the facts and circumstances, including the extent to which we actually provided managerial assistance to that portfolio company, a bankruptcy court might re-characterize our debt holding and subordinate all or a portion of our claim to that of other creditors.
Our failure to make follow-on investments in our portfolio companies could impair the value of our portfolio.
Following an initial investment in a portfolio company, we may make additional investments in that portfolio company as "follow-on" investments, in order to: (1) increase or maintain in whole or in part our equity ownership percentage; (2) exercise warrants, options or convertible securities that were acquired in the original or subsequent financing or (3) attempt to preserve or enhance the value of our investment.
We may elect not to make follow-on investments or otherwise lack sufficient funds to make those investments. We have the discretion to make any follow-on investments, subject to the availability of capital resources. The failure to make follow-on investments may, in some circumstances, jeopardize the continued viability of a portfolio company and our initial investment, or may result in a missed opportunity for us to increase our participation in a successful operation. Even if we have sufficient capital to make a desired follow-on investment, we may elect not to make a follow-on investment because we may not want to increase our concentration of risk, because we prefer other opportunities, or because we are inhibited by compliance with business development company requirements or the desire to maintain our tax status.
 
Table of Contents
Because we generally do not hold controlling equity interests in our portfolio companies, we may not be in a position to exercise control over our portfolio companies or to prevent decisions by management of our portfolio companies that could decrease the value of our investments.
Although we may do so in the future, to date we have not taken controlling equity positions in our portfolio companies. As a result, we are subject to the risk that a portfolio company may make business decisions with which we disagree, and the stockholders and management of a portfolio company may take risks or otherwise act in ways that are adverse to our interests. Due to the lack of liquidity for the debt and equity investments that we typically hold in our portfolio companies, we may not be able to dispose of our investments in the event we disagree with the actions of a portfolio company, and may therefore suffer a decrease in the value of our investments.
An investment strategy focused primarily on privately-held companies presents certain challenges, including the lack of available information about these companies, a dependence on the talents and efforts of only a few key portfolio company personnel and a greater vulnerability to economic downturns.
We have invested and will continue to invest primarily in privately-held companies. Generally, little public information exists about these companies, and we are required to rely on the ability of Apollo Investment Management's investment professionals to obtain adequate information to evaluate the potential returns from investing in these companies. If we are unable to uncover all material information about these companies, we may not make a fully informed investment decision, and we may lose money on our investments. Also, privately-held companies frequently have less diverse product lines and smaller market presence than larger competitors. These factors could affect our investment returns.
Our portfolio companies may incur debt that ranks equally with, or senior to, our investments in such companies.
We have invested and intend to invest primarily in mezzanine and senior debt securities issued by our portfolio companies. The portfolio companies usually have, or may be permitted to incur, other debt that ranks equally with, or senior to, the debt securities in which we invest. By their terms, such debt instruments may provide that the holders are entitled to receive payment of interest or principal on or before the dates on which we are entitled to receive payments in respect of the debt securities in which we invest. Also, in the event of insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or bankruptcy of a portfolio company, holders of debt instruments ranking senior to our investment in that portfolio company would typically be entitled to receive payment in full before we receive any distribution in respect of our investment. After repaying such senior creditors, such portfolio company may not have any remaining assets to use for repaying its obligation to us. In the case of debt ranking equally with debt securities in which we invest, we would have to share on an equal basis any distributions with other creditors holding such debt in the event of an insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or bankruptcy of the relevant portfolio company. In addition, we may not be in a position to control any portfolio company by investing in its debt securities. As a result, we are subject to the risk that a portfolio company in which we invest may make business decisions with which we disagree and the management of such company, as representatives of the holders of their common equity, may take risks or otherwise act in ways that do not serve our interests as debt investors.
Our incentive fee may induce Apollo Investment Management to make certain investments, including speculative investments.
The incentive fee payable by us to Apollo Investment Management may create an incentive for Apollo Investment Management to make investments on our behalf that are risky or more speculative than would be the case in the absence of such compensation arrangement. The way in which the incentive fee payable to our investment adviser is determined, which is calculated as a percentage of the return on invested capital, may encourage our investment adviser to use leverage to increase the return on our investments. Under certain circumstances, the use of leverage may increase the likelihood of default, which would disfavor the holders of our common stock, including investors in offerings of common stock, securities convertible into our common stock or warrants representing rights to purchase our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock pursuant to this prospectus. In addition, the investment adviser receives the incentive fee based, in part, upon net capital gains realized on our investments. Unlike the portion of the incentive fee based on income, there is no hurdle rate applicable to the portion of the incentive fee based on net capital gains. As a result, the investment adviser may have a tendency to invest more in investments that are likely to result in capital gains as compared to income producing securities. Such a practice could result in our investing in more speculative securities than would otherwise be the case, which could result in higher investment losses, particularly during economic downturns.
 
Table of Contents
The incentive fee payable by us to Apollo Investment Management also may create an incentive for Apollo Investment Management to invest on our behalf in instruments that have a deferred interest feature. Under these investments, we would accrue the interest over the life of the investment but would not receive the cash income from the investment until the end of the term. Our net investment income used to calculate the income portion of our investment fee, however, includes accrued interest. Thus, a portion of this incentive fee would be based on income that we have not yet received in cash.
We may invest, to the extent permitted by law, in the securities and instruments of other investment companies, including private funds, and, to the extent we so invest, will bear our ratable share of any such investment company's expenses, including management and performance fees. We will also remain obligated to pay management and incentive fees to Apollo Investment Management with respect to the assets invested in the securities and instruments of other investment companies. With respect to each of these investments, each stockholder of Apollo Investment will bear his or her share of the management and incentive fee of Apollo Investment Management as well as indirectly bearing the management and performance fees and other expenses of any investment companies in which Apollo Investment invests.
Our investments in foreign securities may involve significant risks in addition to the risks inherent in U.S. investments.
Our investment strategy contemplates that a portion of our investments may be in securities of foreign companies. Investing in foreign companies may expose us to additional risks not typically associated with investing in U.S. companies. These risks include changes in exchange control regulations, political and social instability, expropriation, imposition of foreign taxes, less liquid markets and less available information than is generally the case in the United States, higher transaction costs, less government supervision of exchanges, brokers and issuers, less developed bankruptcy laws, difficulty in enforcing contractual obligations, lack of uniform accounting and auditing standards and greater price volatility.
Although most of our investments are denominated in U.S. dollars, our investments that are denominated in a foreign currency are subject to the risk that the value of a particular currency may change in relation to one or more other currencies. Among the factors that may affect currency values are trade balances, the level of short-term interest rates, differences in relative values of similar assets in different currencies, long-term opportunities for investment and capital appreciation, and political developments. We may employ hedging techniques to minimize these risks, but we can offer no assurance that we will, in fact, hedge currency risk or, that if we do, such strategies will be effective.
If we engage in hedging transactions, we may expose ourselves to risks associated with such transactions. We may utilize instruments such as forward contracts, currency options and interest rate swaps, caps, collars and floors to seek to hedge against fluctuations in the relative values of our portfolio positions from changes in currency exchange rates and market interest rates. Hedging against a decline in the values of our portfolio positions does not eliminate the possibility of fluctuations in the values of such positions or prevent losses if the values of such positions decline. However, such hedging can establish other positions designed to gain from those same developments, thereby offsetting the decline in the value of such portfolio positions. Such hedging transaction may also limit the opportunity for gain if the values of the underlying portfolio positions should increase. Moreover, it may not be possible to hedge against an exchange rate or interest rate fluctuation that is so generally anticipated that we are not able to enter into a hedging transaction at an acceptable price.
While we may enter into transactions to seek to reduce currency exchange rate and interest rate risks, unanticipated changes in currency exchange rates or interest rates may result in poorer overall investment performance than if we had not engaged in any such hedging transactions. In addition, the degree of correlation between price movements of the instruments used in a hedging strategy and price movements in the portfolio positions being hedged may vary. Moreover, for a variety of reasons, we may not seek to establish a perfect correlation between such hedging instruments and the portfolio holdings being hedged. Any such imperfect correlation may prevent us from achieving the intended hedge and expose us to risk of loss. In addition, it may not be possible to hedge fully or perfectly against currency fluctuations affecting the value of securities denominated in non-U.S. currencies because the value of those securities is likely to fluctuate as a result of factors not related to currency fluctuations.
 
Table of Contents
Provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law and of our charter and bylaws could deter takeover attempts and have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock.
The Maryland General Corporation Law, our charter and our bylaws contain provisions that may discourage, delay or make more difficult a change in control of Apollo Investment or the removal of our directors. We are subject to the Maryland Business Combination Act, subject to any applicable requirements of the 1940 Act. Our board of directors has adopted a resolution exempting from the Business Combination Act any business combination between us and any other person, subject to prior approval of such business combination by our board of directors, including approval by a majority of our disinterested directors. If the resolution exempting business combinations is repealed or our board of directors does not approve a business combination, the Business Combination Act may discourage third parties from trying to acquire control of us and increase the difficulty of consummating such an offer. Our bylaws exempt from the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act acquisitions of our common stock by any person. If we amend our bylaws to repeal the exemption from the Control Share Acquisition Act, the Control Share Acquisition Act also may make it more difficult for a third party to obtain control of us and increase the difficulty of consummating such an offer.
We have also adopted other measures that may make it difficult for a third party to obtain control of us, including provisions of our charter classifying our board of directors in three classes serving staggered three-year terms, and provisions of our charter authorizing our board of directors to classify or reclassify shares of our stock in one or more classes or series, to cause the issuance of additional shares of our stock, and to amend our charter, without stockholder approval, to increase or decrease the number of shares of stock that we have authority to issue. These provisions, as well as other provisions of our charter and bylaws, may delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders.
RISKS RELATING TO AN INVESTMENT IN OUR COMMON STOCK
Investing in our securities may involve an above average degree of risk.
The investments we make in accordance with our investment objective may result in a higher amount of risk than alternative investment options and volatility or loss of principal. Our investments in portfolio companies may be highly speculative and aggressive, therefore, an investment in our securities may not be suitable for someone with a low risk tolerance.
There is a risk that investors in our equity securities may not receive dividends or that our dividends may not grow over time and that investors in our debt securities may not receive all of the interest income to which they are entitled.
We intend to make distributions on a quarterly basis to our stockholders out of assets legally available for distribution. We cannot assure you that we will achieve investment results that will allow us to make a specified level of cash distributions or year-to-year increases in cash distributions. In addition, due to the asset coverage test applicable to us as a business development company, we may be limited in our ability to make distributions. Finally, if more stockholders opt to receive cash dividends rather than participate in our dividend reinvestment plan, we may be forced to liquidate some of our investments and raise cash in order to make dividend payments.
Our shares may trade at discounts from net asset value or at premiums that are unsustainable over the long term.
Shares of business development companies may trade at a market price that is less than the net asset value that is attributable to those shares. The possibility that our shares of common stock will trade at a discount from net asset value or at premiums that are unsustainable over the long term are separate and distinct from the risk that our net asset value will decrease. It is not possible to predict whether the shares offered hereby will trade at, above, or below net asset value.
 
Table of Contents
The market price of our securities may fluctuate significantly.
The market price and liquidity of the market for our securities may be significantly affected by numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control and may not be directly related to our operating performance. These factors include:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
We may allocate the net proceeds from future offerings in ways with which you may not agree.
We have significant flexibility in investing the net proceeds of offerings and may use the net proceeds from offerings in ways with which you may not agree or for purposes other than those contemplated at the time of the offering.
We may be unable to invest the net proceeds raised from offerings on acceptable terms, which would harm our financial condition and operating results.
Until we identify new investment opportunities, we intend to either invest the net proceeds of future offerings in interest-bearing deposits or other short-term instruments or use the net proceeds from such offerings to reduce then-outstanding obligations under our credit facility. We cannot assure you that we will be able to find enough appropriate investments that meet our investment criteria or that any investment we complete using the proceeds from an offering will produce a sufficient return.
Sales of substantial amounts of our securities may have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities.
Sales of substantial amounts of our securities, or the availability of such securities for sale, could adversely affect the prevailing market prices for our securities. If this occurs and continues, it could impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of securities should we desire to do so.

Portfolio and Investment Activity
During our fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, we invested $1.45 billion, across 24 new and several existing portfolio companies. This compares to investing $1.1 billion in 26 new and several existing portfolio companies for the previous fiscal year ended March 31, 2006. Investments prepaid during the fiscal years ended March 31, 2007 and March 31, 2006 totaled $725 million and $145 million, respectively. In addition, investments sold during the fiscal years ended March 31, 2007 and March 31, 2006 totaled $120 million and $307 million, respectively.
At March 31, 2007, our net portfolio consisted of 57 portfolio companies and was invested 61% in subordinated debt, 4% in preferred equity, 9% in common equity and warrants and 26% in senior secured loans versus 46 portfolio companies invested 60% in subordinated debt, 2% in preferred equity, 7% in common equity and 31% in senior secured loans at March 31, 2006.
The weighted average yields on our subordinated debt portfolio, senior secured loan portfolio and total debt portfolio were 13.5%, 12.3% and 13.1%, respectively, at March 31, 2007. At March 31, 2006, the yields were 13.6%, 12.2%, and 13.1%, respectively.
During the quarter, we selectively invested $432 million across eight new and five existing portfolio companies with both new and existing sponsor relationships. Our average debt investment for the quarter exceeded $35 million. Investments prepaid during the quarter totaled $288 million. We also sold or reduced our positions in several investments opportunistically. Investment sales totaled $61 million. Overall portfolio credit quality remains strong with no new loans on non-accrual status during the quarter.
In addition and pursuant to a sale and purchase agreement dated as of January 24, 2007, along with the GS Funds, GS Prysmian (including Apollo Investment's position in GS Prysmian Co-Invest LP) agreed to sell its remaining equity securities it owned in Prysmian (Lux) Sarl to a newly created entity for cash and new equity securities consideration totaling 85.6 million. This resulted in a $107.6 million realized capital gain included within our Statement of Operations. Apollo Investment is the sole limited partner of GS Prysmian Co-Invest L.P. ("GS Prysmian"), a limited partnership established under the laws of the Cayman Islands. Apollo Investment, through its limited partnership interest in GS Prysmian, indirectly owns approximately 4% of the common shares of Prysmian SpA (PRY. MI) ("Prysmian"), which commenced trading publicly in Milan on May 3, 2007, at 15 per share (for a total implied equity capitalization of approximately 2.7 billion as of May 3, 2007). Based on the IPO price, Apollo Investment's position in GS Prysmian Co-Invest L.P. is currently valued at approximately 114 million. Apollo Investment's shares in Prysmian owned through GS Prysmian are subject to a 180-day lock-up arrangement. After the 180-day lock-up period expires, the GS Prysmian partnership will dissolve and Apollo Investment will own its shares in Prysmian directly.
Also subsequent to quarter end on April 16, 2007, a press release was issued announcing that Innkeepers USA Trust ("Innkeepers"), a hotel real estate investment trust and a leading owner of upscale extended-stay hotel properties throughout the United States, including Residence Inns, Summerfield Suites and Hampton Inns, has entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by Apollo Investment Corporation through an affiliate for $17.75 per share in cash, plus the assumption of Innkeepers indebtedness. In connection with such transaction, we made a commitment of up to $200 million in common and preferred equity and agreed to pay certain fee obligations of the
purchaser under certain circumstances. The transaction is subject to the approval of the common shareholders of Innkeepers and other customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the second quarter of 2007.
"We continue to benefit from our strong relationships with middle market sponsors and with commercial and investment banks in attracting investment opportunities in a highly competitive marketplace," said John J. Hannan, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Total invested capital since our IPO now exceeds $3.4 billion and has generated an IRR in excess of 21%. Accordingly, we are extremely pleased with these results and remain well-positioned with significant capital resources and good dividend visibility heading into fiscal 2008."
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Results comparisons are for the quarters ended March 31, 2007 and March 31, 2006 and the fiscal years ended March 31, 2007 and March 31, 2006.
Investment Income
For the quarters ended March 31, 2007 and March 31, 2006, gross investment income totaled $75.3 million and $42.5 million, respectively. For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2007 and March 31, 2006, gross investment income totaled $266.1 million and $152.8 million, respectively. The continued increase in gross investment income for the quarters ended March 31, 2007 and 2006 and the fiscal years 2007 and 2006 was primarily due to the growth of our investment portfolio as compared to the previous fiscal period. Origination, closing and/or commitment fees associated with investments in portfolio companies are accreted into interest income over the respective terms of the applicable loans.
Expenses
For the quarters ended March 31, 2007 and March 31, 2006, net expenses totaled $53.1 million and $19.8 million, respectively. Of which, $32.0 million and $5.7 million, respectively, were performance-based incentive fees and $7.7 million and $6.0 million, respectively, were interest and other credit facility expenses. For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2007 and 2006, net expenses totaled $139.7 million and $63.7 million, respectively. Of which $57.9 million and $22.3 million, respectively, were performance-based incentive fees and $34.4 million and $13.0 million, respectively, were interest and other credit facility expenses. Expenses exclusive of performance-based incentive fees and interest and other credit facility expenses for the quarters ended March 31, 2007 and March 31, 2006 were $13.4 million and $8.2 million, respectively. For the years ended March 31, 2007 and March 31, 2006, expenses exclusive of performance-based incentive fees and interest and other credit facility expenses were $47.4 million and $28.4 million, respectively. Of these expenses, general and administrative expenses totaled $1.8 million and $1.0 million, respectively, for the quarters ended March 31, 2007 and 2006 and $6.8 million and $5.0 million, respectively, for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2007 and 2006. Excise tax expense totaled $0.4 million and $0, respectively, for the quarters ended March 31, 2007 and March 31, 2006 and $1.1 million and $0, respectively, for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2007 and March 31, 2006. Expenses consist of base investment advisory and management fees, insurance expenses, administrative services fees, professional fees, directors' fees, audit and tax services expenses, and other general and administrative expenses. The increase in net expenses from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 was primarily related to an accrual of $21.3 million in net realized capital gain incentive fees and an increase in base management fees and other general and administrative expenses related to the growth of our investment portfolio as compared to the previous period.
Net Investment Income
The Company's net investment income totaled $21.7 million and $22.7 million, respectively for the quarters ended March 31, 2007 and 2006 and $125.3 million and $89.1 million, respectively, for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2007 and 2006. Due to significant gains realized during the quarter and fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, a net realized capital gains based incentive fee of $21.3 million was accrued within operating expenses lowering net investment income during those periods. The amount actually payable by the Company will be determined as-of the end of the calendar year.
Net Realized Gains
The Company had investment sales and prepayments totaling $349 million and $91 million, respectively, for the quarters ended March 31, 2007 and 2006 and $845 million and $452 million, respectively, for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2007 and 2006. Net realized gains for the quarters ended March 31, 2007 and 2006 were $106.6 million and $0.3 million, respectively and $132.9 million and $11.2 million, respectively, for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2007 and 2006. The increase in net realized gains from fiscal year 2006 to fiscal year 2007 was primarily due to a gain of $107.6 million realized from GS Prysmian Co-Invest LP (pursuant to a sale and purchase agreement dated as of January 24, 2007, along with the GS Funds, GS Prysmian Co-Invest LP agreed to sell its remaining equity securities it owned in Prysmian (Lux) Sarl to a newly created entity for cash and equity securities consideration totaling 85.6 million).
Net Unrealized Appreciation on Investments and Foreign Currencies
For the quarters ended March 31, 2007 and March 31, 2006, net unrealized appreciation on the Company's investments, foreign currencies and other assets and liabilities decreased $25.6 million and increased $19.3 million, respectively. For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2007 and 2006, net unrealized appreciation on the Company's investments, foreign currencies and other assets and liabilities increased $54.0 million and $20.1 million, respectively. The decrease in net unrealized appreciation was primarily due to the reversal of significant unrealized gains on GS Prysmian Co-Invest LP during the quarter ended March 31, 2007. At March 31, 2007, net unrealized appreciation totaled $92.2 million of which $21.6 million was attributable to net unrealized depreciation on our bank debt/senior secured debt and $113.8 million was attributable to net unrealized appreciation on our subordinated debt, preferred stock and private equity (after considering the effects of foreign currency borrowing/hedging for our non-U.S. investments).
Net Increase in Net Assets From Operations
For the quarters ended March 31, 2007 and March 31, 2006, the Company had a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of $102.8 million and $42.3 million, respectively. For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company had a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of $312.2 million and $120.4 million, respectively. The net change in net assets from operations per share was $1.04 and $0.65, respectively, for the quarters ended March 31, 2007 and 2006 and $3.64 and $1.90, respectively, for the years ended March 31, 2007 and 2006.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
The Company's liquidity and capital resources are generated primarily through its senior secured, multi-currency, five-year, revolving credit facility maturing in April 2011 as well as from cash flows from operations, including investment sales and prepayments of senior and subordinated loans and income earned from investments and cash equivalents. During the quarter ended March 31, 2007, we closed on a follow-on equity offering and, including the underwriters' over-allotment option, issued 20.7 million shares of common stock receiving $443 million in net proceeds. We also increased our total commitments under our multi-currency, revolving credit facility during the quarter to $1.7 billion. The interest rate applicable to borrowings remains at LIBOR plus 100 basis points. At March 31, 2007, the Company has $492 million in borrowings outstanding and had $1.208 billion available for its use. In the future, the Company may raise additional equity or debt capital off its shelf registration or may securitize a portion of its investments. The Company may also further access $300 million of additional credit commitments available to it under the terms of its existing credit facility and as the Company's equity capital base grows. The primary use of funds will be investments in portfolio companies, cash distributions to our shareholders and for other general corporate purposes.
Dividends
Dividends paid to stockholders for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2007, 2006 and for the period April 8, 2004 (commencement of operations) through March 31, 2005 totaled $168.4 million or $1.93 per share, $102.7 million or $1.63 per share, and $30.2 million or $0.485 per share, respectively. The following table summarizes our quarterly dividends paid to shareholders for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively:

Portfolio and Investment Activity
During the months of April and May 2007, the markets offered limited opportunities as we sought to identify value and protect principal. Refinancings continued to occur, resulting in full prepayments on several of our higher yielding vintage credits. As we entered June, we were presented with a variety of improved value opportunities and ultimately, we were active investors late in the quarter. We were also excited to have closed on our $208 million common and preferred equity investments in Grand Prix Holdings, LLC (Innkeepers USA). All totaled for the three months ended June 30, 2007, we invested $738.6 million across 13 new and 5 existing portfolio companies. This compared to investing $286.8 million in 4 new and 5 existing portfolio companies for the three months ended June 30, 2006. Investments sold or prepaid during the three months ended June 30, 2007 totaled $346.9 million versus $124.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2006.
At June 30, 2007, our net portfolio consisted of 64 portfolio companies and was invested 56% in subordinated debt, 6% in preferred equity, 16% in common equity and warrants and 22% in senior secured loans versus 48 portfolio companies invested 63% in subordinated debt, 3% in preferred equity, 9% in common equity and warrants, and 25% in senior secured loans at June 30, 2006.
Considering the effect of prepayments experienced early in the June quarter, the weighted average yields on our subordinated debt portfolio, senior secured loan portfolio and total debt portfolio declined to 13.1%, 11.9% and 12.8%, respectively, as compared to 13.5%, 12.3% and 13.1% at March 31, 2007 and 13.6%, 12.7% and 13.3% at June 30, 2006.
"The current dislocation in the credit markets combined with our conservative balance sheet positions us well to add high-quality assets to our investment portfolio," said John J. Hannan, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer. "We also continue to be pleased with the performance of our investment portfolio which has generated strong absolute and relative performance. On over $4.1 billion of invested capital since our IPO in April 2004, we have generated an IRR exceeding 24% through June 30, 2007."
Results of Operations
Results comparisons are for the three months ended June 30, 2007 and June 30, 2006.
Investment Income
For the three months ended June 30, 2007 and June 30, 2006, gross investment income totaled $88.9 million and $55.9 million, respectively. The increase in investment income for the three months ended June 30, 2007 was primarily due to the growth of our investment portfolio as compared to the previous period and the receipt of a $10.0 million structuring fee related to our investment in Grand Prix Holdings, LLC. Origination and commitment fees associated with investments in portfolio companies are accreted into interest income over the respective terms of the applicable loans and accelerated into interest income upon exit, as applicable.
Expenses
Net expenses totaled $34.2 million and $24.1 million, respectively, for the three months ended June 30, 2007 and June 30, 2006, of which $10.8 million and $7.9 million, respectively, were performance-based incentive fees and $7.6 million and $5.6 million, respectively, were interest and other credit facility expenses. Included in the $10.8 million in performance-based incentive fees for the quarter ended June 30, 2007 is a reduction of $2.3 million from the previous quarter's net realized capital gain incentive fee accrual. The current accrual for the net realized capital gain incentive fee is $19.0 million. Expenses exclusive of performance-based incentive fees, interest, and other credit facility expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2007 and June 30, 2006 were $15.7 million and $10.6 million, respectively. Of these expenses, general and administrative expenses totaled $2.8 million and $2.1 million, respectively, for the three months ended June 30, 2007 and June 30, 2006. Expenses consist of base investment advisory and management fees, insurance expenses, administrative services expenses, professional fees, directors' fees, audit and tax services expenses, and other general and administrative expenses. The increase in net expenses was primarily due to an increase in base management fees and performance-based incentive fees, as well as other general and administrative expenses related to the growth of our investment portfolio as compared to the previous period.
Net Investment Income
The Company's net investment income totaled $54.8 million and $31.7 million or $0.53 per share and $0.39 per share, respectively, for the three months ended June 30, 2007 and June 30, 2006.
Net Realized Gains/Losses
The Company had investment sales and prepayments totaling $346.9 million and $124.1 million, respectively, for the three months ended June 30, 2007 and June 30, 2006. Net realized losses for the three months ended June 30, 2007 were $20.7 million, of which $20.1 million was previously recognized as unrealized losses on our interest in Diam International. Net realized losses were $3.0 million for the three month comparative period ended June 30, 2006.
Net Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) on Investments, Cash Equivalents and Foreign Currencies
For the three months ended June 30, 2007 and June 30, 2006, the Company's investments, foreign currencies and other assets and liabilities had a net increase in appreciation of $143.7 million and $42.4 million, respectively. A primary component of the $143.7 million was an increase in appreciation on our investment in GS Prysmian Co-Invest LP. At June 30, 2007, net unrealized appreciation totaled $235.9 million, of which $252.5 million was attributable to net unrealized appreciation on our subordinated debt, preferred stock and private equity and $16.6 million was attributable to net unrealized depreciation on our bank debt/senior secured debt (after considering the effects of foreign currency borrowing/hedging for our non-U.S. investments).
Net Increase in Net Assets From Operations
For the three months ended June 30, 2007 and June 30, 2006, the Company had a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of $177.7 million and $71.2 million, respectively. The net change in net assets from operations per share was $1.72 and $0.88, respectively, for the three months ended June 30, 2007 and June 30, 2006.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
The Company's liquidity and capital resources are generated primarily through its senior secured, multi-currency $1.7 billion, five-year, revolving credit facility maturing in April 2011 as well as from cash flows from operations, including investment sales and prepayments of senior and subordinated loans and income earned from investments and cash equivalents. At June 30, 2007, the Company had $791 million in borrowings outstanding and had $909 million available for its use. In the future, the Company may raise additional equity or debt capital off its shelf registration or may securitize a portion of its investments. The Company may also further access $300 million of additional credit commitments available to it under the terms of its existing credit facility and as the Company's equity capital base grows. The primary use of funds will be investments in portfolio companies, cash distributions to our shareholders and for other general corporate purposes.
 
Dividends
Dividends paid to stockholders for the three months ended June 30, 2007 and June 30, 2006 totaled $52.8 million or $0.51 per share versus $36.5 million or $0.45 per share, respectively. Tax characteristics of all dividends will be reported to shareholders on Form 1099 after the end of the calendar year.
We intend to continue to distribute quarterly dividends to our stockholders. Our quarterly dividends, if any, will be determined by our board of directors.
We have elected to be taxed as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. To maintain our RIC status, we must distribute at least 90% of our ordinary income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any, out of the assets legally available for distribution. In addition, although we currently intend to distribute realized net capital gains (, net long-term capital gains in excess of short-term capital losses), if any, at least annually, out of the assets legally available for such distributions, we may in the future decide to retain such capital gains for investment.
i.e.
We maintain an "opt out" dividend reinvestment plan for our common stockholders. As a result, if we declare a dividend, then stockholders' cash dividends will be automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock, unless they specifically "opt out" of the dividend reinvestment plan so as to receive cash dividends.
We may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make dividends and distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these dividends and distributions from time to time. In addition, we may be limited in our ability to make dividends and distributions due to the asset coverage test for borrowings when applicable to us as a business development company under the 1940 Act and due to provisions in future credit facilities. If we do not distribute a certain percentage of our income annually, we will suffer adverse tax consequences, including possible loss of our RIC status. We cannot assure stockholders that they will receive any dividends and distributions or dividends and distributions at a particular level.
With respect to the dividends paid to shareholders, income from origination, commitment and certain other upfront fees associated with investments in portfolio companies is treated as taxable income and accordingly, distributed to shareholders. For the three months ended June 30, 2007, we received upfront fees totaling $0.1 million, which are being amortized into income over the lives of their respective loans. For the three months ended June 30, 2006, we received upfront fees totaling $2.7 million.

Portfolio and Investment Activity
During the three months ended September 30, 2007, we invested $454.1 million across 7 new and 5 existing portfolio companies. This compares to investing $493.8 million in 6 new and 6 existing portfolio companies for the three months ended September 30, 2006. Investments sold or prepaid during the three months ended September 30, 2007 totaled $141.9 million versus $287.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2006.
At September 30, 2007, our net portfolio consisted of 67 portfolio companies and was invested 53% in subordinated debt, 6% in preferred equity, 17% in common equity and warrants and 24% in senior secured loans versus 51 portfolio companies invested 64% in subordinated debt, 3% in preferred equity, 8% in common equity and warrants, and 25% in senior secured loans at September 30, 2006.
The weighted average yields on our subordinated debt portfolio, senior secured loan portfolio and total debt portfolio were 13.1%, 11.9% and 12.7%, respectively, at September 30, 2007 versus 13.5%, 12.8% and 13.3%, respectively, at September 30, 2006.
Senior secured loans and European mezzanine loans typically accrue interest at variable rates determined on the basis of a benchmark: LIBOR, EURIBOR, GBP LIBOR, or the prime rate, with stated maturities at origination that typically range from 5 to 10 years. While subordinated debt issued within the United States will typically accrue interest at fixed rates, some of these investments may include zero-coupon, PIK and/or step bonds that accrue income on a constant yield to call or maturity basis. At September 30, 2007, 58% or $1.5 billion of our interest-bearing portfolio is fixed rate and 42% or $1.1 billion is floating rate. At September 30, 2006, 57% or $1.1 billion of our interest-bearing portfolio is fixed rate debt and 43% or $808.1 million is floating rate debt.
"Our successful access to the equity capital markets in September provides us with significant liquidity at a truly opportunistic time in the market," said John J. Hannan, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer. "With approximately $4 billion in assets, we are extremely well positioned to offer financial sponsors significant capital at a time when most other capital providers are balance sheet constrained. Looking ahead, expect us to manage our portfolio for continued improvement in security structures, terms and conditions, information rights and more. Also expect us to remain disciplined and not simply chase higher yields."
Results of Operations
Results comparisons are for the three and six months ended September 30, 2007 and September 30, 2006.
Investment Income
For the three and six months ended September 30, 2007 and September 30, 2006, gross investment income totaled $86.1 million and $175.0 million, respectively, as compared to $63.9 million and $119.8 million for the comparative periods a year earlier. The increase in investment income for the three and six months ended September 30, 2007 was primarily due to the continued growth of our investment portfolio as compared to the previous period. Origination and commitment fees associated with investments in portfolio companies are typically accreted into interest income over the respective terms of the applicable loans and accelerated into interest income only upon prepayment, as applicable.
Expenses
For the three and six months ended September 30, 2007, net expenses totaled $24.4 million and $58.6 million, respectively. Included in net expenses were base management fees and performance based incentive fees totaling $7.5 million and $31.3 million, interest and other credit facility related expenses totaling $15.1 million and $22.7 million, and general and administrative expenses totaling $1.8 million and $4.6 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended September 30, 2007. For the comparative three and six month periods a year earlier, net expenses totaled $30.1 million and $54.2 million, respectively. Included in net expenses were base management fees and performance based incentive fees totaling $20.4 million and $36.8 million, interest and other credit facility related expenses totaling $8.2 million and $13.8 million, and general and administrative expenses totaling $1.5 million and $3.6 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended September 30, 2006. Expenses consist of base investment advisory and management fees, performance based incentive fees, insurance expenses, administrative services expenses, professional fees, directors' fees, audit and tax services expenses, and other general and administrative expenses. A general increase in net expenses was primarily due to an increase in base management fees as well as an increase in other general and administrative expenses related to the growth of our investment portfolio as compared to the previous period. Expense increases were offset by a reduction in the accrual for the net realized capital gain incentive fee during the quarter.
Net Investment Income
The Company's net investment income totaled $61.6 million and $116.4 million or $0.58 per share and $1.11 per share, respectively, for the three and six months ended September 30, 2007. For the three and six months ended September 30, 2006, net investment income totaled $33.8 million and $65.6 million or $0.41 per share and $0.81 per share, respectively.
Net Realized Gains/Losses
The Company had investment sales and prepayments totaling $141.9 million and $488.8 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended September 30, 2007. For the three and six months ended September 30, 2006, investment sales and prepayments totaled $287.3 million and $411.4 million, respectively. Net realized losses for the three and six months ended September 30, 2007 were $0.9 million and $21.6 million versus net realized gains of $29.7 million and $26.7 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended September 30, 2006. For the six months ended September 30, 2007, $20.1 million of the $21.6 million in losses was previously recognized as unrealized losses on our interest in Diam International.
Net Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) on Investments, Cash Equivalents and Foreign Currencies
For the three and six months ended September 30, 2007, the Company's investments, cash equivalents, foreign currencies and other assets and liabilities had a net decrease in appreciation of $83.9 million and a net increase in appreciation of $59.8 million, respectively. For the three and six months ended September 30, 2006, the Company's investments, cash equivalents, foreign currencies and other assets and liabilities had a net increase in appreciation of $17.7 million and $60.1 million, respectively. At September 30, 2007, net unrealized appreciation totaled $152.1 million versus $98.4 million at September 30, 2006.
Net Increase/Decrease in Net Assets From Operations
For the three months ended September 30, 2007, the Company had a net decrease in net assets resulting from operations of $23.2 million. For the six months ended September 30, 2007, the Company had a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of $154.5 million. For the three and six months ended September 30, 2006, the Company had a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of $81.3 million and $152.4 million, respectively. On a weighted average per share basis, there was a decrease of $0.22 and an increase of $1.47, respectively, for the three and six months ended September 30, 2007 versus an increase of $1.00 and $1.87 per share, respectively, for the three and six months ended September 30, 2006.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
On September 18, 2007, the Company closed on its most recent public offering of common stock selling 14.95 million shares of common stock at $20.00 per share raising approximately $285.5 million in net proceeds. The Company's liquidity and capital resources are also generated and available through its senior secured, multi-currency $1.7 billion, five-year, revolving credit facility maturing in April 2011 as well as from cash flows from operations, investment sales and prepayments of senior and subordinated loans and income earned from investments and cash equivalents. At September 30, 2007, the Company has $834 million in borrowings outstanding and had $866 million available for its use. In the future, the Company may raise additional equity or debt capital off its shelf registration or may securitize a portion of its investments. The primary use of funds will be investments in portfolio companies, cash distributions to our shareholders and for other general corporate purposes.
Dividends
Dividends paid to stockholders for the three and six months ended September 30, 2007 totaled $54.0 million or $0.52 per share versus $106.8 million or $1.03 per share, respectively. For the three and six months ended September 30, 2006, dividends totaled $38.4 million or $0.47 per share and $74.9 million or $0.92 per share, respectively. Tax characteristics of all dividends will be reported to shareholders on Form 1099 after the end of the calendar year.
We intend to continue to distribute quarterly dividends to our stockholders. Our quarterly dividends, if any, will be determined by our board of directors.
We have elected to be taxed as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. To maintain our RIC status, we must distribute at least 90% of our ordinary income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any, out of the assets legally available for distribution. In addition, although we currently intend to distribute realized net capital gains (, net long-term capital gains in excess of short-term capital losses), if any, at least annually, out of the assets legally available for such distributions, we may in the future decide to retain such capital gains for investment.
i.e.
 
We maintain an "opt out" dividend reinvestment plan for our common stockholders. As a result, if we declare a dividend, then stockholders' cash dividends will be automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock, unless they specifically "opt out" of the dividend reinvestment plan so as to receive cash dividends.
We may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make dividends and distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these dividends and distributions from time to time. In addition, we may be limited in our ability to make dividends and distributions due to the asset coverage test for borrowings when applicable to us as a business development company under the 1940 Act and due to provisions in future credit facilities. If we do not distribute a certain percentage of our income annually, we will suffer adverse tax consequences, including possible loss of our RIC status. We cannot assure stockholders that they will receive any dividends and distributions or dividends and distributions at a particular level.
With respect to the dividends paid to shareholders, income from origination, commitment and certain other upfront fees associated with investments in portfolio companies is treated as taxable income and accordingly, distributed to shareholders. For the three and six months ended September 30, 2007, we received upfront fees totaling $0.0 million and $0.1 million, which are being amortized into income over the lives of their respective loans. For the three and six months ended September 30, 2006, we received upfront fees totaling $0.8 million and $3.5 million, respectively.

Portfolio and Investment Activity
During the three months ended December 31, 2007, we invested $360.0 million across 5 new and 10 existing portfolio companies. This compares to investing $233.9 million in 6 new and 2 existing portfolio companies for the three months ended December 31, 2006. Investments sold or prepaid during the three months ended December 31, 2007 totaled $122.7 million versus $85.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2006.
At December 31, 2007, our net portfolio consisted of 70 portfolio companies and was invested 24% in senior secured loans, 55% in subordinated debt, 5% in preferred equity and 16% in common equity and warrants versus 54 portfolio companies invested 25% in senior secured loans, 65% in subordinated debt, 2% in preferred equity and 8% in common equity and warrants at December 31, 2006.
The weighted average yields on our senior secured loan portfolio, subordinated debt portfolio, and total debt portfolio were 11.6%, 13.0% and 12.6%, respectively, at December 31, 2007 versus 12.7%, 13.6% and 13.4%, respectively, at December 31, 2006.
Since the initial public offering of Apollo Investment Corporation in April 2004 and through December 31, 2007, total invested capital exceeds $5.0 billion in 110 portfolio companies. Over the same period, Apollo Investment has also completed transactions with 80 different financial sponsors.
Results of Operations
Results comparisons are for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006.
Investment Income
For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2007, gross investment income totaled $92.9 million and $267.9 million, respectively, as compared to $71.1 million and $190.8 million for the comparative periods a year earlier. The increase in investment income for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2007 was primarily due to the continued growth of our investment portfolio as compared to the previous periods. Origination and commitment fees associated with investments in portfolio companies are accreted into interest income over the respective terms of the applicable loans and accelerated into interest income upon exit, as applicable.
Expenses
For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2007, net expenses totaled $49.7 million and $108.3 million, respectively.

Expenses consist of base investment advisory and management fees, performance based incentive fees, insurance expenses, administrative services expenses, professional fees, directors' fees, audit and tax services expenses, and other general and administrative expenses. A general increase in net expenses was primarily due to an increase in base management and net realized capital gain incentive fees as well as an increase in other general and administrative expenses related to the growth of our investment portfolio as compared to the previous period. For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2007, excise tax expenses totaled $1.7 million. For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2006, excise tax expenses totaled $0.7 million.

The Company's liquidity and capital resources are also generated and available through its senior secured, multi-currency $1.7 billion, five-year, revolving credit facility maturing in April 2011 as well as from cash flows from operations, investment sales and prepayments of senior and subordinated loans and income earned from investments and cash equivalents. At December 31, 2007, the Company has $1.1 billion in borrowings outstanding and had $0.6 billion available for its use. In the future, the Company may raise additional equity or debt capital off its shelf registration or may securitize a portion of its investments among other considerations. The primary use of funds will be investments in portfolio companies, cash distributions to our shareholders and for other general corporate purposes.
 
 
Dividends
Dividends paid to stockholders for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2007 totaled $62.0 million or $0.52 per share and $168.9 million or $1.55 per share, respectively. For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2006, dividends totaled $41.0 million or $0.50 per share and $115.9 million or $1.42 per share, respectively. Tax characteristics of all dividends will be reported to shareholders on Form 1099 after the end of the calendar year.
We intend to continue to distribute quarterly dividends to our stockholders. Our quarterly dividends, if any, will be determined by our board of directors.
We have elected to be taxed as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. To maintain our RIC status, we must distribute at least 90% of our ordinary income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any, out of the assets legally available for distribution. In addition, although we currently intend to distribute realized net capital gains (, net long-term capital gains in excess of short-term capital losses), if any, at least annually, out of the assets legally available for such distributions, we may in the future decide to retain such capital gains for investment.
i.e.
We maintain an "opt out" dividend reinvestment plan for our common stockholders. As a result, if we declare a dividend, then stockholders' cash dividends will be automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock, unless they specifically "opt out" of the dividend reinvestment plan so as to receive cash dividends.
We may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make dividends and distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these dividends and distributions from time to time. In addition, we may be limited in our ability to make dividends and distributions due to the asset coverage test for borrowings when applicable to us as a business development company under the 1940 Act and due to provisions in future credit facilities. If we do not distribute a certain percentage of our income annually, we will suffer adverse tax consequences, including possible loss of our RIC status. We cannot assure stockholders that they will receive any dividends and distributions or dividends and distributions at a particular level.

Portfolio and Investment Activity
During the quarter ended March 31, 2008, we were cautious and patient investors, especially early in the quarter where we saw a prolonged, material weakness in the technical drivers of the credit markets. More importantly, the markets began to trough toward the back half of the quarter and we were able to make add-on investments to five existing portfolio company investments at attractive values. During the quarter we also invested in two new portfolio companies and participated in one existing portfolio company's refinancing in support of an acquisition. Investments totaled $203 million for the quarter. Sales and prepayments totaled $103 million for the quarter which included the full prepayment of one of our successful European mezzanine investments in early January 2008.
Total investments for the entire fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 amounted to $1.8 billion across 27 new and numerous existing portfolio companies. This compares to investing $1.4 billion in 24 new and several existing portfolio companies for the previous fiscal year ended March 31, 2007. Investments sold and prepaid during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 totaled $714 million versus $845 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007.
At March 31, 2008, our net portfolio consisted of 71 portfolio companies and was invested 22% in senior secured loans, 57% in subordinated debt, 6% in preferred equity and 15% in common equity and warrants versus 57 portfolio companies invested 26% in senior secured loans, 61% in subordinated debt, 4% in preferred equity and 9% in common equity and warrants at March 31, 2007.
The weighted average yields on our senior secured loan portfolio, subordinated debt portfolio and total debt portfolio at our current cost basis were 10.0%, 12.8% and 12.0%, respectively, at March 31, 2008. At March 31, 2007, the yields were 12.3%, 13.5%, and 13.1%, respectively.
Since the initial public offering of Apollo Investment Corporation in April 2004 and through March 31, 2008, total invested capital exceeds $5.2 billion in 112 portfolio companies. Over the same period, Apollo Investment has also completed transactions with 80 different financial sponsors.
Senior secured loans and European mezzanine loans typically accrue interest at variable rates determined on the basis of a benchmark: LIBOR, EURIBOR, GBP LIBOR, or the prime rate, with stated maturities at origination that typically range from 5 to 10 years. While subordinated debt issued within the United States will typically accrue interest at fixed rates, some of these investments may include zero-coupon and/or step bonds that accrue income on a constant yield to call or maturity basis. At March 31, 2008, 62% or $1.6 billion of our interest-bearing investment portfolio is fixed rate debt and 38% or $1.0 billion is floating rate debt. At March 31, 2007, 64% or $1.4 billion of our interest-bearing investment portfolio was fixed rate debt and 36% or $0.8 billion was floating rate debt.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Results comparisons are for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2008, March 31, 2007 and March 31, 2006.
Investment Income
For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2008, March 31, 2007 and March 31, 2006, gross investment income totaled $357.9 million, $266.1 million and $152.8 million, respectively. The continued increase in gross investment income for fiscal years 2007 and 2008 was primarily due to the growth of our investment portfolio as compared to previous fiscal periods. Origination, closing and/or commitment fees associated with investments in portfolio companies are accreted into interest income over the respective terms of the applicable loans.
Expenses
Net expenses totaled $154.4 million, $139.7 million and $63.7 million, respectively, for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2008, March 31, 2007 and March 31, 2006, of which $30.4 million, $57.9 million and $22.3 million, respectively, were performance-based incentive fees and $55.8 million, $34.4 million and $13.0 million, respectively, were interest and other credit facility expenses. Net expenses exclusive of performance-based incentive fees and interest and other credit facility expenses for the years ended March 31, 2008, March 31, 2007 and March 31, 2006 were $68.2 million, $47.4 million and $28.4 million, respectively. Of these expenses, general and administrative expenses totaled $8.3 million, $6.8 million and $5.0 million, respectively, for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. In addition, excise tax expense totaled $1.9 million, $1.1 million, and $0 for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. Expenses consist of base investment advisory and management fees, insurance expenses, administrative services fees, professional fees, directors' fees, audit and tax services expenses, and other general and administrative expenses. The increases in net expenses from fiscal 2006 to 2007 and fiscal 2007 to 2008 were primarily related to increases in base management fees and other general and administrative expenses related to the growth of our investment portfolio as compared to the previous periods.
Net Investment Income

Portfolio and Investment Activity
During the three months ended June 30, 2008, we invested $184.7 million, across 6 new and 8 existing portfolio companies. This compares to investing $738.6 million in 13 new and 5 existing portfolio companies for the three months ended June 30, 2007. Investments sold or prepaid during the three months ended June 30, 2008 totaled $89.1 million versus $346.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2007.
At June 30, 2008, our net portfolio consisted of 74 portfolio companies and was invested 23% in senior secured loans, 54% in subordinated debt, 7% in preferred equity and 16% in common equity and warrants versus 64 portfolio companies invested 22% in senior secured loans, 56% in subordinated debt, 6% in preferred equity and 16% in common equity and warrants at June 30, 2007.
The weighted average yields on our senior secured loan portfolio, subordinated debt portfolio and total debt portfolio at our current cost basis were 9.7%, 12.9% and 12.0%, respectively, at June 30, 2008. At June 30, 2007, the yields were 13.1%, 11.9%, and 12.8%, respectively.
Since the initial public offering of Apollo Investment Corporation in April 2004 and through June 30, 2008, total invested capital exceeds $5.3 billion in 118 portfolio companies. Over the same period, Apollo Investment has also completed transactions with 81 different financial sponsors.
Senior secured loans and European mezzanine loans typically accrue interest at variable rates determined on the basis of a benchmark: LIBOR, EURIBOR, GBP LIBOR, or the prime rate, with stated maturities at origination that typically range from 5 to 10 years. While subordinated debt issued within the United States will typically accrue interest at fixed rates, some of these investments may include zero-coupon, PIK and/or step bonds that accrue income on a constant yield to call or maturity basis. At June 30, 2008, 60% or $1.7 billion of our interest-bearing investment portfolio is fixed rate debt and 40% or $1.1 billion is floating rate debt. At June 30, 2007, 66% or $1.6 billion of our interest-bearing investment portfolio was fixed rate debt and 34% or $830.7 million was floating rate debt.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Results comparisons are for the three months ended June 30, 2008 and June 30, 2007.
Investment Income
For the three months ended June 30, 2008 and June 30, 2007, gross investment income totaled $91.0 million and $88.9 million, respectively. The increase in gross investment income for the three months ended June 30, 2008 was primarily due to the growth of our investment portfolio as compared to the previous period. Origination, closing and/or commitment fees associated with investments in portfolio companies are accreted into interest income over the respective terms of the applicable loans.
Expenses
Net expenses totaled $44.6 million and $34.2 million, respectively, for the three months ended June 30, 2008 and June 30, 2007, of which $11.6 million and $10.8 million, respectively, were performance-based incentive fees and $13.9 million and $7.6 million, respectively, were interest and other credit facility expenses. Net expenses exclusive of performance-based incentive fees and interest and other credit facility expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2008 and June 30, 2007 were $19.2 million and $15.7 million, respectively. Of these expenses, general and administrative expenses totaled $3.1 million and $2.8 million, respectively, for the three months ended June 30, 2008 and 2007. Expenses consist of base investment advisory and management fees, insurance expenses, administrative services fees, professional fees, directors' fees, audit and tax services expenses, and other general and administrative expenses. The increases in net expenses from the three month period ended June 30, 2007 to the three month period ended June 30, 2008 were primarily related to increases in base management fees and other general and administrative expenses from the growth of our investment portfolio as compared to the previous periods.
Net Investment Income
The Company's net investment income totaled $46.3 million and $54.8 million or $0.35 per share and $0.53 per share, respectively, for the three months ended June 30, 2008 and June 30, 2007.
Net Realized Gains (Losses)
The Company had investment sales and prepayments totaling $89.1 million and $346.9 million, respectively, for the three months ended June 30, 2008 and 2007. Net realized losses for the three months ended June 30, 2008 and June 30, 2007 were $29.8 million and $20.7 million, respectively. During the three months ended June 30, 2008, losses were derived primarily from the sale of American Asphalt which realized a loss of $26.0 million, reversing an unrealized loss of $25.4 million as of March 31, 2008.
Net Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) on Investments, Cash Equivalents and Foreign Currencies
For the three months ended June 30, 2008 the Company recognized net unrealized appreciation on its investments, cash equivalents, foreign currencies and other assets and liabilities totaling $55.3 million. For the three months ended June 30, 2007, net unrealized appreciation on the Company's investments, cash equivalents, foreign currencies and other assets and liabilities increased $143.7 million. At June 30, 2008, net unrealized depreciation totaled $141.8 million versus net unrealized appreciation of $235.9 million at June 30, 2007.
Net Increase (Decrease) in Net Assets From Operations
For the three months ended June 30, 2008, the Company had a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of $71.8 million. For the three months ended June 30, 2007 the Company had a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of $177.7 million. The net increase in net assets from operations per share was $0.55 for the three months ended June 30, 2008. For the three months ended June 30, 2007, the net increase in net assets from operations per share was $1.72.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
The Company's liquidity and capital resources are generated and available through periodic follow-on equity offerings, through its senior secured, multi-currency $1.7 billion, five-year, revolving credit facility maturing in April 2011, through investments in special purpose entities in which we hold and finance particular investments on a non-recourse basis, as well as from cash flows from operations, investment sales and prepayments of senior and subordinated loans and income earned from investments and cash equivalents. At June 30, 2008, the Company has $0.97 billion in borrowings outstanding and $0.73 billion remaining unused. In the future, the Company may raise additional equity or debt capital off its shelf registration or may securitize a portion of its investments among other considerations. The primary use of funds will be investments in portfolio companies, cash distributions to our stockholders and for other general corporate purposes. On May 16, 2008, the Company closed on its most recent follow-on public equity offering of 22.3 million shares of common stock at $17.11 per share raising approximately $369.6 million in net proceeds.
Dividends
Dividends paid to stockholders for the three months ended June 30, 2008 and June 30, 2007 totaled $74.0 million or $0.52 per share versus $52.8 million or $0.51 per share, respectively. Tax characteristics of all dividends will be reported to shareholders on Form 1099 after the end of the calendar year.
We intend to continue to distribute quarterly dividends to our stockholders. Our quarterly dividends, if any, will be determined by our Board of Directors.
We have elected to be taxed as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. To maintain our RIC status, we must distribute at least 90% of our ordinary income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any, out of the assets legally available for distribution. In addition, although we currently intend to distribute realized net capital gains (, net long-term capital gains in excess of short-term capital losses), if any, at least annually, out of the assets legally available for such distributions, we may in the future decide to retain such capital gains for investment.
i.e.
We maintain an "opt out" dividend reinvestment plan for our common stockholders. As a result, if we declare a dividend, then stockholders' cash dividends will be automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock, unless they specifically "opt out" of the dividend reinvestment plan so as to receive cash dividends.
We may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make dividends and distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these dividends and distributions from time to time. In addition, we may be limited in our ability to make dividends and distributions due to the asset coverage test for borrowings when applicable to us as a business development company under the 1940 Act and due to provisions in future credit facilities. If we do not distribute a certain percentage of our income annually, we will suffer adverse tax consequences, including possible loss of our RIC status. We cannot assure stockholders that they will receive any dividends and distributions or dividends and distributions at a particular level.

The weighted average yields on our senior secured loan portfolio, subordinated debt portfolio and total debt portfolio at our current cost basis were 10.2%, 13.4% and 12.5%, respectively, at September 30, 2008. At September 30, 2007, the yields were 11.9%, 13.1%, and 12.7%, respectively.
Since the initial public offering of Apollo Investment Corporation in April 2004 and through September 30, 2008, total invested capital exceeds $5.5 billion in 123 portfolio companies. Over the same period, Apollo Investment has also completed transactions with 85 different financial sponsors.
Senior secured loans and European mezzanine loans typically accrue interest at variable rates determined on the basis of a benchmark: LIBOR, EURIBOR, GBP LIBOR, or the prime rate, with stated maturities at origination that typically range from 5 to 10 years. While subordinated debt issued within the United States will typically accrue interest at fixed rates, some of these investments may include zero-coupon, PIK and/or step bonds that accrue income on a constant yield to call or maturity basis. At September 30, 2008, 66% or $1.8 billion of our interest-bearing investment portfolio is fixed rate debt and 34% or $0.9 billion is floating rate debt at value. At September 30, 2007, 58% or $1.5 billion of our interest-bearing investment portfolio was fixed rate debt and 42% or $1.1 billion was floating rate debt at value.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Results comparisons are for the three and six months ended September 30, 2008 and September 30, 2007.

The increase in gross investment income for the three and six months ended September 30, 2008 was primarily due to the growth of our investment portfolio as compared to the previous period. Origination and/or commitment fees associated with investments in portfolio companies are accreted into interest income over the respective terms of the applicable loans.

The increases in net expenses from the three and six month period ended September 30, 2007 to the three and six month period ended September 30, 2008 were primarily related to increases in base management and incentive fees and other general and administrative expenses from the growth of our investment portfolio as compared to the previous periods.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
The Company's liquidity and capital resources are generated and available through periodic follow-on equity offerings, through its senior secured, multi-currency $1.7 billion, five-year, revolving credit facility maturing in April 2011, through investments in special purpose entities in which we hold and finance particular investments on a non-recourse basis, as well as from cash flows from operations, investment sales of liquid assets and prepayments of senior and subordinated loans and income earned from investments and cash equivalents. At September 30, 2008, the Company has $1.66 billion in borrowings outstanding and $0.04 billion remaining unused. In the future, the Company may raise additional equity or debt capital off its shelf registration or may securitize a portion of its investments among other considerations. The primary use of funds will be investments in portfolio companies, cash distributions to our stockholders and for other general corporate purposes. On May 16, 2008, the Company closed on its most recent follow-on public equity offering of 22.3 million shares of common stock at $17.11 per share raising approximately $369.6 million in net proceeds. Cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2008 totaled $411.2 million.
Dividends
Dividends paid to stockholders for the three and six months ended September 30, 2008 totaled $74.0 million or $0.52 per share and $147.9 million or $1.04 per share, respectively. For the three and six months ended September 30, 2007 dividends totaled $54.0 million or $0.52 per share and $106.8 million or $1.03 per share, respectively. Tax characteristics of all dividends will be reported to shareholders on Form 1099 after the end of the calendar year.
We intend to continue to distribute quarterly dividends to our stockholders. Our quarterly dividends, if any, will be determined by our Board of Directors.
We have elected to be taxed as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. To maintain our RIC status, we must distribute at least 90% of our ordinary income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any, out of the assets legally available for distribution. In addition, although we currently intend to distribute realized net capital gains (, net long-term capital gains in excess of short-term capital losses), if any, at least annually, out of the assets legally available for such distributions, we may in the future decide to retain such capital gains for investment.
i.e.
We maintain an "opt out" dividend reinvestment plan for our common stockholders. As a result, if we declare a dividend, then stockholders' cash dividends will be automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock, unless they specifically "opt out" of the dividend reinvestment plan so as to receive cash dividends.
We may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make dividends and distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these dividends and distributions from time to time. In addition, we may be limited in our ability to make dividends and distributions due to the asset coverage test for borrowings when applicable to us as a business development company under the 1940 Act and due to provisions in future credit facilities. If we do not distribute a certain percentage of our income annually, we will suffer adverse tax consequences, including possible loss of our RIC status. We cannot assure stockholders that they will receive any dividends and distributions or dividends and distributions at a particular level.

Exhibit 99.1
NEW YORKFebruary 5, 2009Apollo Investment Corporation (NASDAQ-GS: AINV) today announces financial results for its fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2008. Additionally, Apollo Investment Corporation announces that its Board of Directors has declared its fourth fiscal quarter 2009 dividend of $0.26 per share, payable on April 2, 2009 to stockholders of record as of March 19, 2009. The dividend will be paid from taxable earnings whose specific tax characteristics will be reported to stockholders on Form 1099 after the end of the calendar year.
Like many other companies in this current environment, including those within the financial services industry, we believe reducing our quarterly dividend is prudent and appropriate, and therefore in the best interest of Apollo Investment Corporation and its stockholders. We expect that a dividend reduction to $0.26 will further strengthen our balance sheet in the near term by increasing retained earnings and improving our liquidity in this volatile market. At December 31, 2008, we were in compliance with our regulatory asset coverage with a debt to equity ratio of 0.83 to 1.0. In addition, we were in compliance with all financial covenants of our credit facility.

PORTFOLIO AND INVESTMENT ACTIVITY
During the three months ended December 31, 2008, we invested $21.9 million, across 1 new and 3 existing portfolio companies. This compares to investing $360.0 million in 5 new and 10 existing portfolio companies for the three months ended December 31, 2007. Investments sold or prepaid during the three months ended December 31, 2008 totaled $144.3 million versus $122.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2007. (For additional information, please see the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section.)
At December 31, 2008, our net portfolio consisted of 73 portfolio companies and was invested 24% in senior secured loans, 59% in subordinated debt, 4% in preferred equity and 13% in common equity and warrants versus 70 portfolio companies invested 24% in senior secured loans, 55% in subordinated debt, 5% in preferred equity and 16% in common equity and warrants at December 31, 2007.
The weighted average yields on our senior secured loan portfolio, subordinated debt portfolio and total debt portfolio at our current cost basis were 9.0%, 13.3% and 12.1%, respectively, at December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2007, the yields were 11.6%, 13.0%, and 12.6%, respectively.
Since the initial public offering of Apollo Investment Corporation in April 2004 and through December 31, 2008, total invested capital exceeded $5.5 billion in 124 portfolio companies. Over the same period, Apollo Investment has also completed transactions with more than 85 different financial sponsors.
Senior secured loans and European mezzanine loans typically accrue interest at variable rates determined on the basis of a benchmark: LIBOR, EURIBOR, GBP LIBOR, or the prime rate, with stated maturities at origination that typically range from 5 to 10 years. While subordinated debt issued within the United States will typically accrue interest at fixed rates, some of these investments may include zero-coupon, PIK and/or step bonds that accrue income on a constant yield-to-call or maturity basis. At December 31, 2008, 70% or $1.6 billion of our interest-bearing investment portfolio was fixed rate debt and 30% or $0.7 billion was floating rate debt at value. At December 31, 2007, 57% or $1.6 billion of our interest-bearing investment portfolio was fixed rate debt and 43% or $1.2 billion was floating rate debt at value.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Results comparisons are for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007.
Investment Income
For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2008, gross investment income totaled $97.5 million and $292.0 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2007, gross investment income totaled $92.9 million and $267.9 million, respectively. The increase in gross investment income for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2008 was primarily due to the growth of our investment portfolio as compared to the previous period. Origination and/or commitment fees associated with investments in portfolio companies are accreted into interest income over the respective terms of the applicable loans.
Expenses
Net expenses totaled $43.9 million and $135.6 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2008, of which $27.9 million and $86.0 million, respectively, were base management fees and performance-based incentive fees and $13.7 million and $42.0 million, respectively, were interest and other credit facility expenses. Of these expenses, general and administrative expenses totaled $2.3 million and $7.7 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2008. Net expenses totaled $49.7 million and $108.3 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2007, of which $32.0 million and $63.4 million, respectively, were base management fees and performance-based incentive fees and $16.0 million and $38.7 million, respectively, were interest and other credit facility expenses. Of these expenses, general and administrative expenses totaled $1.7 million and $6.2 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2007. Expenses consist of base investment advisory and management fees, insurance expenses, administrative services fees, professional fees, directors' fees, audit and tax services expenses, and other general and administrative expenses. The decrease in net expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2007 to the three months ended December 31, 2008 was primarily related to decreases in base management and incentive fees and decreases in interest and other credit facility expenses. The increase in net expenses from the nine months ended December 31, 2007 to the nine months ended December 31, 2008 was primarily related to increases in base management and incentive fees and other general and administrative expenses from the growth of our investment portfolio as compared to the previous period. For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2008, excise tax expenses accrued totaled $0.9 million. For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2007, excise tax expenses totaled $1.7 million.
Net Investment Income
The Company's net investment income totaled $52.8 million and $155.6 million or $0.37 per share and $1.12 per share, respectively, for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2008. For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2007, net investment income totaled $41.5 million and $157.9 million or $0.35 per share and $1.44 per share, respectively.
Net Realized Gains (Losses)
The Company had investment sales and prepayments totaling $144.3 million and $254.7 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2008. For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2007, investment sales and prepayments totaled $122.7 million and $611.5 million, respectively. Net realized losses for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2008 were $3.6 million and $63.4 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2007, net realized gains totaled $80.5 million and $58.9 million, respectively.
Net Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) on Investments, Cash Equivalents and Foreign Currencies
For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2008 net change in unrealized depreciation on the Company's investments, cash equivalents, foreign currencies and other assets and liabilities totaled $524.8 million and $733.9 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2007, net change in unrealized depreciation on the Company's investments, cash equivalents, foreign currencies and other assets and liabilities totaled $147.6 million and $87.8 million, respectively. A material increase in unrealized depreciation was recognized for the quarter from significantly lower fair value determinations on many of our investments. Lower fair values were driven primarily from the general market dislocation, the illiquid capital markets, and the current market expectations for pricing increased credit risk and default assumptions.
Net Increase (Decrease) in Net Assets From Operations
For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2008, the Company had a net decrease in net assets resulting from operations of $475.5 million and $641.7 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2007 the Company had a net decrease in net assets resulting from operations of $25.6 million and a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of $128.9 million, respectively. The loss per share was $3.34 and $4.63 for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2008. For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2007, there was a loss per share of $0.21 and earnings per share of $1.18, respectively.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
The Company's liquidity and capital resources are generated and generally available through periodic follow-on equity offerings, through its senior secured, multi-currency $1.7 billion, five-year, revolving credit facility maturing in April 2011, through investments in special purpose entities in which we hold and finance particular investments on a non-recourse basis, as well as from cash flows from operations, investment sales of liquid assets and prepayments of senior and subordinated loans and income earned from investments and cash equivalents. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $1.16 billion in borrowings outstanding and $0.54 billion remained unused. Given our asset coverage requirements, use of our capital resources has been significantly curtailed due to the significant increase in our deemed leverage from depreciating asset values. Accordingly, we expect any current liquidity needs to be met from continued cash flows from operations, investment sales of liquid assets, and managing the Company's dividend policy, among other factors. In the future, the Company may raise additional equity or debt capital off its shelf registration or may securitize a portion of its investments, among other considerations. The primary use of funds will be investments in portfolio companies, cash distributions to our stockholders, reductions in debt outstanding and other general corporate purposes. On May 16, 2008, the Company closed on its most recent follow-on public equity offering of 22.3 million shares of common stock at $17.11 per share raising approximately $369.6 million in net proceeds.
Dividends
Dividends paid to stockholders for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2008 totaled $74.0 million or $0.52 per share and $221.9 million or $1.56 per share, respectively. For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2007 dividends totaled $62.0 million or $0.52 per share and $168.9 million or $1.55 per share, respectively. Tax characteristics of all dividends will be reported to shareholders on Form 1099 after the end of the calendar year. Our quarterly dividends, if any, will be determined by our Board of Directors.
We have elected to be taxed as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. To maintain our RIC status, we must distribute at least 90% of our ordinary income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any, out of the assets legally available for distribution. In addition, although we currently intend to distribute realized net capital gains (, net long-term capital gains in excess of short-term capital losses), if any, at least annually, out of the assets legally available for such distributions, we may in the future decide to retain such capital gains for investment.
i.e.
We maintain an "opt out" dividend reinvestment plan for our common stockholders. As a result, if we declare a dividend, then stockholders' cash dividends will be automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock, unless they specifically "opt out" of the dividend reinvestment plan so as to receive cash dividends.
We may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these distributions from time to time. In addition, due to the asset coverage test applicable to us as a business development company, we may in the future be limited in our ability to make distributions. Also, our revolving credit facility may limit our ability to declare dividends if we default under certain provisions. If we do not distribute a certain percentage of our income annually, we will suffer adverse tax consequences, including possible loss of the tax benefits available to us as a regulated investment company. In addition, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and tax regulations, we include in income certain amounts that we have not yet received in cash, such as contractual payment-in-kind interest, which represents contractual interest added to the loan balance that becomes due at the end of the loan term, or the accrual of original issue or market discount. Since we may recognize income before or without receiving cash representing such income, we may have difficulty meeting the requirement to distribute at least 90% of our investment company taxable income to obtain tax benefits as a regulated investment company.

Portfolio and Investment Activity
During our fiscal year ended March 31, 2009, we invested $435 million across 12 new and 13 existing portfolio companies. This compares to investing $1.8 billion in 27 new and 15 existing portfolio companies for the previous fiscal year ended March 31, 2008. Investments sold or prepaid during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 totaled $340 million versus $714 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008.
At March 31, 2009, our net portfolio consisted of 72 portfolio companies and was invested 27% in senior secured loans, 59% in subordinated debt, 4% in preferred equity and 10% in common equity and warrants measured at fair value versus 71 portfolio companies invested 22% in senior secured loans, 57% in subordinated debt, 6% in preferred equity and 15% in common equity and warrants at March 31, 2008.
The weighted average yields on our senior secured loan portfolio, subordinated debt portfolio and total debt portfolio at our current cost basis were 8.2%, 13.2% and 11.7%, respectively, at March 31, 2009. At March 31, 2008, the yields were 10.0%, 12.8%, and 12.0%, respectively.
Since the initial public offering of Apollo Investment Corporation in April 2004 and through March 31, 2009, invested capital totals $5.6 billion in 124 portfolio companies. Over the same period, Apollo Investment Corporation has completed transactions with more than 85 different financial sponsors.
At March 31, 2009, 69% or $1.5 billion of our interest-bearing investment portfolio is fixed rate debt and 31% or $0.7 billion is floating rate debt, measured at fair value. At March 31, 2008, 62% or $1.6 billion of our interest-bearing investment portfolio was fixed rate debt and 38% or $1.0 billion was floating rate debt.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Results comparisons are for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2009, March 31, 2008 and March 31, 2007.
Investment Income
For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2009, March 31, 2008 and March 31, 2007, gross investment income totaled $377.3 million, $357.9 million and $266.1 million, respectively. The increase in gross investment income from fiscal year 2008 to fiscal year 2009 was primarily due to changes in the composition of the portfolio as compared to the previous fiscal year. The increase in gross investment income from fiscal year 2007 to fiscal year 2008 was primarily due to the growth of our investment portfolio as compared to the previous fiscal year. Origination, closing and/or commitment fees associated with investments in portfolio companies are accreted into interest income over the respective terms of the applicable loans.
Expenses
Net operating expenses totaled $170.5 million, $154.4 million and $139.7 million, respectively, for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2009, March 31, 2008 and March 31, 2007, of which $111.3 million, $90.3 million and $98.5 million, respectively, were base management fees and performance-based incentive fees and $48.9 million, $55.8 million and $34.4 million, respectively, were interest and other credit facility expenses. Of these net operating expenses, general and administrative expenses totaled $10.3 million, $8.3 million and $6.8 million, respectively, for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. Net expenses consist of base investment advisory and management fees, insurance expenses, administrative services fees, legal fees, directors' fees, audit and tax
services expenses, and other general and administrative expenses. The increase in net expenses from fiscal 2008 to 2009 was primarily related to the increase in performance-based incentive expenses accrued during fiscal 2009 as compared to those accrued during fiscal 2008. Accrued performance-based incentive expenses for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 reflect an accrual reduction of $16.0 million attributable to the difference between the amount of net realized capital gains based incentive fees accrued at March 31, 2007 and what was earned and paid at December 31, 2007. The increase in net expenses from fiscal 2007 to 2008 were primarily related to increases in base management fees, performance-based incentive fees and other general and administrative expenses related to the growth of our investment portfolio as compared to the previous period. In addition, excise tax expense totaled $0.5 million, $1.9 million, and $1.1 million for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007.
Net Investment Income
The Company's net investment income totaled $206.3 million, $201.6 million and $125.3 million, or $1.48, $1.82, and $1.49, on a per share basis, respectively, for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007.
Net Realized Gains
The Company had investment sales and prepayments totaling $340 million, $714 million and $845 million, respectively, for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. Net realized losses for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 were $83.7 million. Net realized gains for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2008 and 2007 were $54.3 million and $132.9 million, respectively.
Net Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) on Investments, Cash Equivalents and Foreign Currencies
For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2009 and 2008, net change in unrealized depreciation on the Company's investments, cash equivalents, foreign currencies and other assets and liabilities totaled $734.5 million and $289.3 million, respectively. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, net change in unrealized appreciation on the Company's investments, cash equivalents, foreign currencies and other assets and liabilities totaled $54.0 million. A material increase in unrealized depreciation was recognized for the most recent fiscal year from significantly lower fair value determinations on many of our investments. Lower fair values were driven primarily from the general market dislocation, the illiquid capital markets, and the current market expectations for pricing increased credit risk and default assumptions.
Net Increase (Decrease) in Net Assets From Operations
For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company had a net decrease in net assets resulting from operations of $611.9 million and $33.4 million, respectively. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, the Company had a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of $312.2 million. The loss per share was $4.39 and $0.30 for the years ended March 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. For the year ended March 31, 2007, earnings per share were $3.64.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
The Company's liquidity and capital resources are generated and generally available through periodic follow-on equity offerings, through its senior secured, multi-currency $1.7 billion, five-year, revolving credit facility maturing in April 2011, through investments in special purpose entities in which we hold and finance particular investments on a non-recourse basis, as well as from cash flows from operations, investment sales of liquid assets and prepayments of senior and subordinated loans and income earned from investments and cash equivalents. At March 31, 2009, the Company had $1.06 billion in borrowings outstanding and $0.64 billion of unused capacity. Given our asset coverage requirements, use of the capital resources available to us has been significantly curtailed due to the effect of unrealized depreciation on our leverage ratio. In addition, we currently expect any present liquidity needs to be met from continued cash flows from operations and investment sales and prepayments, among other actions. In the future, the Company may raise additional equity or debt capital off its shelf registration, among other considerations. The primary use of funds will be investments in portfolio companies, cash distributions to our stockholders, reductions in debt outstanding and other general corporate purposes. On May 16, 2008, the Company closed on its most recent follow-on public equity offering of 22.3 million shares of common stock at $17.11 per share raising approximately $369.6 million in net proceeds.

Portfolio and Investment Activity
During the three months ended June 30, 2009, we invested $61.0 million across 4 existing portfolio companies. This compares to investing $184.7 million in 6 new and 8 existing portfolio companies for the three months ended June 30, 2008. Investments sold or prepaid during the three months ended June 30, 2009 totaled $70.4 million versus $89.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2008.
At June 30, 2009, our net portfolio consisted of 72 portfolio companies and was invested 26% in senior secured loans, 58% in subordinated debt, 3% in preferred equity and 13% in common equity and warrants measured at fair value versus 74 portfolio companies invested 23% in senior secured loans, 54% in subordinated debt, 7% in preferred equity and 16% in common equity and warrants at June 30, 2008.
The weighted average yields on our senior secured loan portfolio, subordinated debt portfolio and total debt portfolio at our current cost basis were 7.9%, 13.4% and 11.8%, respectively, at June 30, 2009. At June 30, 2008, the yields were 9.7%, 12.9%, and 12.0%, respectively.
Since the initial public offering of Apollo Investment Corporation in April 2004 and through June 30, 2009, invested capital totals $5.6 billion in 124 portfolio companies. Over the same period, Apollo Investment completed transactions with more than 85 different financial sponsors.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Results comparisons are for the three months ended June 30, 2009 and June 30, 2008.
Investment Income
For the three months ended June 30, 2009 and June 30, 2008, gross investment income totaled $82.6 million and $91.0 million, respectively. The decrease in gross investment income from the June 2008 quarter to the June 2009 quarter was primarily due to two main factors: the reduction of the size of the income producing portfolio year over year and the reduction in the yield of the overall income producing portfolio on a year over year basis with LIBOR decreasing over 200 basis points. Origination, closing and/or commitment fees associated with investments in portfolio companies are accreted into interest income over the respective terms of the applicable loans.
Expenses
Net operating expenses totaled $33.2 million and $44.6 million, respectively, for the three months ended June 30, 2009 and June 30, 2008, of which $25.1 million and $27.6 million, respectively, were base management fees and performance-based incentive fees and $5.1 million and $13.9 million, respectively, were interest and other credit facility expenses. Of these net operating expenses, general and administrative expenses totaled $3.1 million and $3.1 million, respectively, for the three months ended June 30, 2009 and June 30, 2008. Net expenses consist of base investment advisory and management fees, insurance expenses, administrative services fees, legal fees, directors' fees, audit and tax services expenses, and other general and administrative expenses. The decrease in net expenses from the June 2008 quarter to the June 2009 quarter was primarily related to the decrease in the weighted average interest expense on our revolving credit facility on a year over year basis. This decrease in weighted average interest expense is due primarily to LIBOR decreasing over 200 basis points.
Net Investment Income
The Company's net investment income totaled $49.3 million and $46.3 million, or $0.35, and $0.35, on a per average share basis, respectively, for the three months ended June 30, 2009 and June 30, 2008.
Net Realized Losses
The Company had investment sales and prepayments totaling $70.4 million and $89.1 million, respectively, for the three months ended June 30, 2009 and June 30, 2008. Net realized losses for the three months ended June 30, 2009 and June 30, 2008 were $98.2 million and $29.8 million, respectively.
Net Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) on Investments, Cash Equivalents and Foreign Currencies
For the three months ended June 30, 2009 and June 30, 2008, net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on the Company's investments, cash equivalents, foreign currencies and other assets and liabilities totaled $133.4 million and $55.3 million, respectively. A net decrease in unrealized depreciation was recognized for the quarter ended June 30, 2009. This change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) was primarily due to improving capital market conditions and net changes in specific portfolio company fundamentals.
Net Increase in Net Assets From Operations
For the three months ended June 30, 2009 and June 30, 2008, the Company had a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of $84.5 million and $71.8 million, respectively. The earnings per share were $0.59 and $0.55 for the three months ended June 30, 2009 and June 30, 2008, respectively.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
The Company's liquidity and capital resources are generated and generally available through periodic follow-on equity offerings, through its senior secured, multi-currency $1.7 billion, five-year, revolving credit facility maturing in April 2011, through investments in special purpose entities in which we hold and finance particular investments on a non-recourse basis, as well as from cash flows from operations, investment sales of liquid assets and prepayments of senior and subordinated loans and income earned from investments and cash equivalents.

The preceding summary of the changes effected by the adoption of the Amended Bylaws is qualified in its entirety by reference to a copy of the Amended Bylaws filed as exhibit 3(ii) to this current report and incorporated by reference herein.

Subject to subsection (b) of this Section 3, a special meeting of stockholders shall also be called by the secretary of the Corporation to act on any matter that may properly be considered at a meeting of stockholders upon the written request of stockholders entitled to cast not less than a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on such matter at such meeting. Subject to subsection (b) of this Article II, Section 3, any special meeting shall be held at such place, date and time as may be designated by the Chairman of the Board, the president or the Board of Directors, whoever shall have called the meeting. In fixing a date for any special meeting, the Chairman of the Board, the president or the Board of Directors may consider such factors as he, she or it deems relevant, including, without limitation, the nature of the matters to be considered, the facts and circumstances surrounding any request for the meeting and any plan of the Board of Directors to call an annual meeting or a special meeting.
General
(b) . (1) Any stockholder of record seeking to have stockholders request a special meeting shall, by sending written notice to the secretary (the "Record Date Request Notice") by registered mail, return receipt requested, request the Board of Directors to fix a record date to determine the stockholders entitled to request a special
Stockholder Requested Special Meetings
meeting (the "Request Record Date"). The Record Date Request Notice shall set forth the purpose of the meeting and the matters proposed to be acted on at it, shall be signed by one or more stockholders of record as of the date of signature (or their agents duly authorized in a writing accompanying the Record Date Request Notice), shall bear the date of signature of each such stockholder (or such agent) and shall set forth all information relating to each such stockholder and each matter proposed to be acted on at the meeting that would be required to be disclosed in connection with the solicitation of proxies for election of directors in an election contest (even if an election contest is not involved), or would otherwise be required in connection with such a solicitation, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A (or any successor provision) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). Upon receiving the Record Date Request Notice, the Board of Directors may fix a Request Record Date. The Request Record Date shall not precede and shall not be more than ten days after the close of business on the date on which the resolution fixing the Request Record Date is adopted by the Board of Directors. If the Board of Directors, within ten days after the date on which a valid Record Date Request Notice is received, fails to adopt a resolution fixing the Request Record Date, the Request Record Date shall be the close of business on the tenth day after the first date on which the Record Date Request Notice is received by the secretary.
(2) In order for any stockholder to request a special meeting to act on any matter that may properly be considered at a meeting of stockholders, one or more written requests for a special meeting (collectively, the "Special Meeting Request") signed by stockholders of record (or their agents duly authorized in a writing accompanying the request) as of the Request Record Date entitled to cast not less than a majority of all of the votes entitled to be cast on such matter at such meeting (the "Special Meeting Percentage") shall be delivered to the secretary. In addition, the Special Meeting Request shall (a) set forth the purpose of the meeting and the matters proposed to be acted on at it (which shall be limited to those lawful matters set forth in the Record Date Request Notice received by the secretary), (b) bear the date of signature of each such stockholder (or such agent) signing the Special Meeting Request, (c) set forth (i) the name and address, as they appear in the Corporation's books, of each stockholder signing such request (or on whose behalf the Special Meeting Request is signed), (ii) the class, series and number of all shares of stock of the Corporation which are owned (beneficially or of record) by such stockholder and (iii) the nominee holder for, and number of, shares of stock of the Corporation owned beneficially but not of record by such stockholder, (d) be sent to the secretary by registered mail, return receipt requested, and (e) be received by the secretary within 60 days after the Request Record Date. Any requesting stockholder (or agent duly authorized in a writing accompanying the revocation or the Special Meeting Request) may revoke his, her or its request for a special meeting at any time by written revocation delivered to the secretary.
(3) The secretary shall inform the requesting stockholders of the reasonably estimated cost of preparing and delivering the notice of the meeting (including the Corporation's proxy materials). The secretary shall not be required to call a special meeting upon stockholder request and such meeting shall not be held unless, in addition to the documents required by
 
paragraph (2) of this Section 3(b), the secretary receives payment of such reasonably estimated cost prior to the preparation and mailing or delivery of such notice of the meeting.
(4) In the case of any special meeting called by the secretary upon the request of stockholders (a "Stockholder-Requested Meeting"), such meeting shall be held at such place, date and time as may be designated by the Board of Directors; , however, that the date of any Stockholder-Requested Meeting shall be not more than 90 days after the record date for such meeting (the "Meeting Record Date"); and that if the Board of Directors fails to designate, within ten days after the date that a valid Special Meeting Request is actually received by the secretary (the "Delivery Date"), a date and time for a Stockholder-Requested Meeting, then such meeting shall be held at 2:00 p.m. local time on the 90
provided
provided further
th
day after the Meeting Record Date or, if such 90
th
day is not a Business Day (as defined below), on the first preceding Business Day; and that in the event that the Board of Directors fails to designate a place for a Stockholder-Requested Meeting within ten days after the Delivery Date, then such meeting shall be held at the principal executive office of the Corporation. In the case of any Stockholder-Requested Meeting, if the Board of Directors fails to fix a Meeting Record Date that is a date within 30 days after the Delivery Date, then the close of business on the 30
provided further
th
day after the Delivery Date shall be the Meeting Record Date. The Board of Directors may revoke the notice for any Stockholder-Requested Meeting in the event that the requesting stockholders fail to comply with the provisions of paragraph (3) of this Section 3(b).
(5) If written revocations of the Special Meeting Request have been delivered to the secretary and the result is that stockholders of record (or their agents duly authorized in writing), as of the Request Record Date, entitled to cast less than the Special Meeting Percentage have given, and not revoked, requests for a special meeting to the secretary: (i) if the notice of meeting has not already been given, the secretary shall refrain from giving the notice of the meeting and send to all requesting stockholders who have not revoked such requests written notice of any revocation of a request for a special meeting on the matter, or (ii) if the notice of meeting has been given and if the secretary first sends to all requesting stockholders who have not revoked requests for a special meeting on the matter written notice of any revocation of a request for the special meeting and written notice of the Corporation's intention to revoke the notice of the meeting or for the chairman of the meeting to adjourn the meeting without action on the matter, (A) the secretary may revoke the notice of the meeting at any time before ten days before the commencement of the meeting or (B) the chairman of the meeting may call the meeting to order and adjourn the meeting without acting on the matter. Any request for a special meeting received after a revocation by the secretary of a notice of a meeting shall be considered a request for a new special meeting.
(6) The Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board or the president may appoint regionally or nationally recognized independent inspectors of elections to act as the agent of the Corporation for the purpose of promptly performing a ministerial review of the validity of any purported Special Meeting Request received by the secretary. For the purpose of permitting the inspectors to perform such review, no such purported Special Meeting Request shall be deemed to have been delivered to the secretary until the earlier of (i) five Business Days
 
after receipt by the secretary of such purported request and (ii) such date as the independent inspectors certify to the Corporation that the valid requests received by the secretary represent, as of the Request Record Date, stockholders of record entitled to cast not less than the Special Meeting Percentage. Nothing contained in this paragraph (6) shall in any way be construed to suggest or imply that the Corporation or any stockholder shall not be entitled to contest the validity of any request, whether during or after such five Business Day period, or to take any other action (including, without limitation, the commencement, prosecution or defense of any litigation with respect thereto, and the seeking of injunctive relief in such litigation).
(7) For purposes of these Bylaws, "Business Day" shall mean any day other than a Saturday, a Sunday or a day on which banking institutions in the State of New York are authorized or obligated by law or executive order to close.
Section 4. . Not less than ten nor more than 90 days before each meeting of stockholders, the secretary shall give to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting and to each stockholder not entitled to vote who is entitled to notice of the meeting notice in writing or by electronic transmission stating the time and place of the meeting and, in the case of a special meeting or as otherwise may be required by any statute, the purpose for which the meeting is called, either by mail, by presenting it to such stockholder personally, by leaving it at the stockholder's residence or usual place of business or by any other means permitted by Maryland law. If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be given when deposited in the United States mail addressed to the stockholder at the stockholder's address as it appears on the records of the Corporation, with postage thereon prepaid. If transmitted electronically, such notice shall be deemed to be given when transmitted to the stockholder by an electronic transmission to any address or number of the stockholder at which the stockholder receives electronic transmissions. The Corporation may give a single notice to all stockholders who share an address, which single notice shall be effective as to any stockholder at such address, unless a stockholder objects to receiving such single notice or revokes a prior consent to receiving such single notice. Failure to give notice of any meeting to one or more stockholders, or any irregularity in such notice, shall not affect the validity of any meeting fixed in accordance with this Article II or the validity of any proceedings at any such meeting.
NOTICE OF MEETINGS
Subject to Section 11(a) of this Article II, any business of the Corporation may be transacted at an annual meeting of stockholders without being specifically designated in the notice, except such business as is required by any statute to be stated in such notice. No business shall be transacted at a special meeting of stockholders except as specifically designated in the notice. The Corporation may postpone or cancel a meeting of stockholders by making a public announcement (as defined in Section 11(c)(3) of this Article II) of such postponement or cancellation prior to the meeting. Notice of the date, time and place to which the meeting is postponed shall be given not less than ten days prior to such date and otherwise in the manner set forth in this section.
 
Section 5. . Every meeting of stockholders shall be conducted by an individual appointed by the Board of Directors to be chairman of the meeting or, in the absence of such appointment, by the Chairman of the Board, if any, or, in the case of a vacancy in the office or absence of the Chairman of the Board, by one of the following officers present at the meeting in the following order: the Vice Chairman of the Board, if any, the president, any Vice presidents in order of their rank and seniority, the secretary, the Treasurer or, in the absence of such officers, a chairman chosen by the stockholders by the vote of a majority of the votes cast by stockholders present in person or by proxy. The secretary, or, in the secretary's absence, an assistant secretary, or, in the absence of both the secretary and assistant secretaries, an individual appointed by the Board of Directors or, in the absence of such appointment, an individual appointed by the chairman of the meeting shall act as secretary. In the event that the secretary presides at a meeting of the stockholders, an assistant secretary, or, in the absence of assistant secretaries, an individual appointed by the Board of Directors or the chairman of the meeting, shall record the minutes of the meeting. The order of business and all other matters of procedure at any meeting of stockholders shall be determined by the chairman of the meeting. The chairman of the meeting may prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and take such action as, in the discretion of such chairman and without any action by the stockholders, are appropriate for the proper conduct of the meeting, including, without limitation, (a) restricting admission to the time set for the commencement of the meeting; (b) limiting attendance at the meeting to stockholders of record of the Corporation, their duly authorized proxies and other such individuals as the chairman of the meeting may determine; (c) limiting participation at the meeting on any matter to stockholders of record of the Corporation entitled to vote on such matter, their duly authorized proxies and other such individuals as the chairman of the meeting may determine; (d) limiting the time allotted to questions or comments by participants; (e) determining when and for how long the polls should be open and when the polls should be closed; (f) maintaining order and security at the meeting; (g) removing any stockholder or any other individual who refuses to comply with meeting procedures, rules or guidelines as set forth by the chairman of the meeting; (h) concluding a meeting or recessing or adjourning the meeting to a later date and time and at a place announced at the meeting; and (i) complying with any state and local laws and regulations concerning safety and security. Unless otherwise determined by the chairman of the meeting, meetings of stockholders shall not be required to be held in accordance with the rules of parliamentary procedure.
ORGANIZATION AND CONDUCT
Section 6. . The presence in person or by proxy of the holders of shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to cast a majority of the votes entitled to be cast (without regard to class) shall constitute a quorum at any meeting of the stockholders, except with respect to any such matter that, under applicable statutes or regulatory requirements, requires approval by a separate vote of one or more classes of stock, in which case the presence in person or by proxy of the holders of shares entitled to cast a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by each such class on such a matter shall constitute a quorum. This section shall not affect any requirement under any statute or the charter of the Corporation for the vote necessary for the adoption of any measure.
QUORUM
 
If, however, such quorum shall not be present at any meeting of the stockholders, the chairman of the meeting may adjourn the meeting or from time to time to a date not more than 120 days after the original record date without notice other than announcement at the meeting. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified.
sine die
The stockholders present either in person or by proxy, at a meeting which has been duly called and at which a quorum has been established, may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal from the meeting of enough stockholders to leave fewer than required to establish a quorum.
Section 7. . A nominee for director shall be elected as a director only if such nominee receives the affirmative vote of a majority of the total votes cast for and affirmatively withheld as to such nominee at a meeting of stockholders duly called and at which a quorum is present. However, directors shall be elected by a plurality of votes cast at a meeting of stockholders duly called and at which a quorum is present for which (i) the secretary of the Corporation receives notice that a stockholder has nominated an individual for election as a director in compliance with the requirements of advance notice of stockholder nominees for director set forth in Article II, Section 11 of these Bylaws, and (ii) such nomination has not been withdrawn by such stockholder on or before the close of business on the tenth day before the date of filing of the definitive proxy statement of the Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and, as a result of which, the number of nominees is greater than the number of directors to be elected at the meeting. Each share may be voted for as many individuals as there are directors to be elected and for whose election the share is entitled to be voted. A majority of the votes cast at a meeting of stockholders duly called and at which a quorum is present shall be sufficient to approve any other matter which may properly come before the meeting, unless a different vote is required by statute or by the charter of the Corporation. Unless otherwise provided by statute or in the charter, each outstanding share, regardless of class, shall be entitled to one vote on each matter submitted to a vote at a meeting of stockholders.
VOTING
Section 8. . A stockholder may cast the votes entitled to be cast by the holder of the shares of stock owned of record by the stockholder in person or by proxy executed by the stockholder or by the stockholder's duly authorized agent in any manner permitted by law. Such proxy or evidence of authorization of such proxy shall be filed with the secretary of the Corporation before or at the meeting. No proxy shall be valid more than eleven months after its date unless otherwise provided in the proxy.
PROXIES
Section 9. . Stock of the Corporation registered in the name of a corporation, partnership, trust or other entity, if entitled to be voted, may be voted by the president or a vice president, a general partner, trustee or managing member thereof, as the case may be, or a proxy appointed by any of the foregoing
VOTING OF STOCK BY CERTAIN HOLDERS
 
individuals, unless some other person who has been appointed to vote such stock pursuant to a bylaw or a resolution of the governing body of such corporation or other entity or agreement of the partners of a partnership presents a certified copy of such bylaw, resolution or agreement, in which case such person may vote such stock. Any director or fiduciary may vote stock registered in the name of such person in the capacity as such director or fiduciary, either in person or by proxy.
Shares of stock of the Corporation directly or indirectly owned by it shall not be voted at any meeting and shall not be counted in determining the total number of outstanding shares entitled to be voted at any given time, unless they are held by it in a fiduciary capacity, in which case they may be voted and shall be counted in determining the total number of outstanding shares at any given time.
The Board of Directors may adopt by resolution a procedure by which a stockholder may certify in writing to the Corporation that any shares of stock registered in the name of the stockholder are held for the account of a specified person other than the stockholder. The resolution shall set forth the class of stockholders who may make the certification, the purpose for which the certification may be made, the form of certification and the information to be contained in it; if the certification is with respect to a record date, the time after the record date within which the certification must be received by the Corporation; and any other provisions with respect to the procedure which the Board of Directors considers necessary or desirable. On receipt of such certification, the person specified in the certification shall be regarded as, for the purposes set forth in the certification, the holder of record of the specified stock in place of the stockholder who makes the certification.
Section 10. . The Board of Directors, in advance of any meeting, may, but need not, appoint one or more individual inspectors or one or more entities that designate individuals as inspectors to act at the meeting or any adjournment thereof. If an inspector or inspectors are not appointed, the person presiding at the meeting may, but need not, appoint one or more inspectors. In case any person who may be appointed as an inspector fails to appear or act, the vacancy may be filled by appointment made by the Board of Directors in advance of the meeting or at the meeting by the chairman of the meeting. The inspectors, if any, shall (i) determine the number of shares of stock represented at the meeting, in person or by proxy, and the validity and effect of proxies, (ii) receive and tabulate all votes, ballots or consents, (iii) report such tabulation to the chairman of the meeting, (iv) hear and determine all challenges and questions arising in connection with the right to vote, and (v) do such acts as are proper to fairly conduct the election or vote. Each such report shall be in writing and signed by the inspector or by a majority of them if there is more than one inspector acting at such meeting. If there is more than one inspector, the report of a majority shall be the report of the inspectors. The report of the inspector or inspectors on the number of shares represented at the meeting and the results of the voting shall be evidence thereof.

PORTFOLIO AND INVESTMENT ACTIVITY
During the three months ended September 30, 2009, we invested $38.8 million across 6 existing portfolio companies. This compares to investing $225.8 million in 5 new and 6 existing portfolio companies for the three months ended September 30, 2008. Investments sold or prepaid during the three months ended September 30, 2009 totaled $30.2 million versus $21.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2008.
At September 30, 2009, our portfolio consisted of 71 portfolio companies and was invested 26% in senior secured loans, 57% in subordinated debt, 4% in preferred equity and 13% in common equity and warrants measured at fair value versus 78 portfolio companies invested 23% in senior secured loans, 57% in subordinated debt, 4% in preferred equity and 16% in common equity and warrants at September 30, 2008.
The weighted average yields on our senior secured loan portfolio, subordinated debt portfolio and total debt portfolio at our current cost basis were 7.9%, 13.2% and 11.5%, respectively, at September 30, 2009. At September 30, 2008, the yields were 10.2%, 13.4%, and 12.5%, respectively.
Since the initial public offering of Apollo Investment Corporation in April 2004 and through September 30, 2009, invested capital totals $5.7 billion in 124 portfolio companies. Over the same period, the Company completed transactions with more than 85 different financial sponsors.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Results comparisons are for the three and six months ended September 30, 2009 and September 30, 2008.
Investment Income
For the three and six months ended September 30, 2009, gross investment income totaled $84.4 million and $167.0 million, respectively. For the three and six months ended September 30, 2008, gross investment income totaled $103.5 million and $194.5 million, respectively. The decrease in gross investment income for the three and six months ended September 30, 2009, was primarily due to two factors: the reduction of the size of the income producing portfolio for the three and six month periods as well as the reduction in the yield of the overall income producing portfolio with LIBOR decreasing over 300 basis points. Origination, closing and/or commitment fees associated with investments in portfolio companies are accreted into interest income over the respective terms of the applicable loans.
Expenses
Net operating expenses totaled $33.0 million and $66.2 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended September 30, 2009, of which $26.1 million and $51.1 million, respectively, were base management fees and performance-based incentive fees and $4.4 million and $9.5 million, respectively, were interest and other credit facility expenses. Of these net operating expenses, general and administrative expenses totaled $2.5 million and $5.7 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended September 30, 2009. Net operating expenses totaled $47.1 million and $91.7 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended September 30, 2008, of which $30.5 million and $58.1 million, respectively, were base management fees and performance-based incentive fees and $14.4 million and $28.3 million, respectively, were interest and other credit facility expenses. Of these net operating expenses, general and administrative expenses totaled $2.2 million and $5.3 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended September 30, 2008. Net expenses consist of base investment advisory and management fees, insurance expenses, administrative services fees, legal fees, directors' fees, audit and tax services expenses, and other general and administrative expenses. The decrease in net expenses for the three and six month periods ended September 30, 2009 versus the three and six month periods ended September 30, 2008 was primarily related to the decrease in the weighted average interest expense on our revolving credit facility. This decrease in weighted average interest expense is due primarily to LIBOR decreasing over 300 basis points.
Net Investment Income
The Company's net investment income totaled $51.4 million and $100.7 million, or $0.34, and $0.68 on a per average share basis, respectively, for the three and six months ended September 30, 2009. For the three and six months ended September 30, 2008, net investment income totaled $56.5 million and $102.8 million or $0.40 per share and $0.75 per share, respectively.
Net Realized Losses
The Company had investment sales and prepayments totaling $30.2 million and $100.6 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended September 30, 2009. For the three and six months ended September 30, 2008, investment sales and prepayments totaled $21.3 million and $110.4 million, respectively. Net realized losses for the three and six months ended September 30, 2009 were $3.1 million and $101.3 million, respectively. For the three and six months ended September 30, 2008, net realized losses totaled $30.0 million and $59.8 million, respectively.
Net Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) on Investments, Cash Equivalents and Foreign Currencies
For the three and six months ended September 30, 2009, the Company's investments, cash equivalents, foreign currencies and other assets and liabilities had net appreciation of $60.9 million and $194.2 million, respectively. For the three and six months ended September 30, 2008, the Company's investments, cash equivalents, foreign currencies and other assets and liabilities had net depreciation of $264.5 million and $209.1 million, respectively. This net unrealized appreciation was primarily due to improving capital market conditions and net changes in specific portfolio company fundamentals. At September 30, 2009, the Company's net unrealized depreciation totaled $737.3 million versus net unrealized depreciation of $406.2 million at September 30, 2008.
Net Increase in Net Assets From Operations
For the three and six months ended September 30, 2009, the Company had a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of $109.2 million and $193.6 million, respectively. For the three and six months ended September 30, 2008, the Company had a net decrease in net assets resulting from operations of $238.0 million and $166.1 million, respectively. The earnings per share were $0.71 and $1.31 for the three and six months ended September 30, 2009, respectively. For the three and six months ended September 30, 2008, the loss per share was $1.67 and $1.21, respectively.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
The Company's liquidity and capital resources are generated and generally available through periodic follow-on equity offerings, through its senior secured, multi-currency $1.7 billion, five-year, revolving credit facility maturing in April 2011, through investments in special purpose entities in which we hold and finance particular investments on a non-recourse basis, as well as from cash flows from operations, investment sales of liquid assets and prepayments of senior and subordinated loans and income earned from investments and cash equivalents. At September 30, 2009, the Company had $902 million in borrowings outstanding and $798 million of unused capacity. In the future, the Company may raise additional equity or debt capital off its shelf registration, among other considerations. The primary use of funds will be investments in portfolio companies, cash distributions to our stockholders, reductions in debt outstanding and other general corporate purposes. On August 18, 2009, the Company closed on its most recent follow-on public equity offering of 20.7 million shares of common stock at $8.75 per share raising approximately $173.0 million in net proceeds.

New York, NY  December 8, 2009  Apollo Investment Corporation (the "Company") (NASDAQ: AINV) announced today that it has received commitments from its existing lenders sufficient to effect the amendment of its existing senior secured, multi-currency, revolving credit facility (the "Facility").

Upon completion of the amended Facility, outstanding borrowings on the extended commitments will be priced at Libor + 300 basis points while outstanding borrowings on the remaining commitments will continue to be priced at Libor + 100. As of September 30, 2009, the Company had $902 million of outstanding borrowings on its Facility. The Facility will continue to complement the Company's equity capital to make additional portfolio investments and for general corporate purposes. Completion of the amended Facility is subject to lender review and approval of definitive documentation and is expected to close prior to year-end.

(ii) impose on any Lender or the Issuing Bank or the London interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement or Eurocurrency Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;

If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension.
Payments by the Borrower
All amounts owing under this Agreement (including commitment fees, payments required under Section 2.14, and payments required under Section 2.15 relating to any Loan denominated in Dollars, but not including principal of, and interest on, any Loan denominated in any Foreign Currency or payments relating to any such Loan required under Section 2.15, which are payable in such Foreign Currency) or under any other Loan Document (except to the extent otherwise provided therein) are payable in Dollars. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Borrower shall fail to pay any principal of any Loan when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration, by mandatory prepayment or otherwise), the unpaid portion of such Loan shall, if such Loan is not denominated in Dollars, automatically be redenominated in Dollars on the due date thereof (or, if such due date is a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor, on
 
 
the last day of such Interest Period) in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent thereof on the date of such redenomination and such principal shall be payable on demand; and if the Borrower shall fail to pay any interest on any Loan that is not denominated in Dollars, such interest shall automatically be redenominated in Dollars on the due date therefor (or, if such due date is a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor, on the last day of such Interest Period) in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent thereof on the date of such redenomination and such interest shall be payable on demand.
(b) . If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees of a Class then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, to pay interest and fees of such Class then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees of such Class then due to such parties, and (ii) second, to pay principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements of such Class then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements of such Class then due to such parties.
Application of Insufficient Payments

Except to the extent otherwise provided herein: (i) each Syndicated Borrowing of a Class shall be made from the Lenders of such Class, each payment of commitment fee under Section 2.11 shall be made for account of the Lenders of the applicable Class, and each termination or reduction of the amount of the Commitments of a Class under Section 2.08 shall be applied to the respective Commitments of the Lenders of such Class, pro rata according to the amounts of their respective Commitments of such Class; (ii) each Syndicated Borrowing of a Class shall be allocated pro rata among the Lenders of such Class according to the amounts of their respective Commitments of such Class (in the case of the making of Syndicated Loans) or their respective Loans of such Class that are to be included in such Borrowing (in the case of conversions and continuations of Loans); (iii) each payment or prepayment of principal of Syndicated Loans of a Class by the Borrower shall be made for account of the Lenders of such Class pro rata in accordance with the respective unpaid principal amounts of the Syndicated Loans of such Class held by them; and (iv) each payment of interest on Syndicated Loans of a Class by the Borrower shall be made for account of the Lenders of such Class pro rata in accordance with the amounts of interest on such Loans of such Class then due and payable to the respective Lenders.
Pro Rata Treatment
(other than any reduction of the Commitments on the Amendment No. 1 Effective Date as set forth in Schedule I to Amendment No. 1)
(d) . If any Lender of any Class shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Syndicated Loans, or participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans, of such Class resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Syndicated Loans, and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, and accrued interest thereon of such Class then due than the proportion received by any other Lender of such Class, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Syndicated Loans, and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, of other Lenders of such Class to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders of such Class ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Syndicated Loans, and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, of such Class; that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of
Sharing of Payments by Lenders
provided
 
 
the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.
(e) . Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for account of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or the Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Effective Rate.
Presumptions of Payment
(f) . If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.04(c), 2.05(e), 2.06(b) or 2.17(e), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.

Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders

The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.
Designation of a Different Lending Office

A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.
provided
SECTION 2.19. .

For purposes of computing extension fees of the Class B Multicurrency Lenders, the Class B Multicurrency Commitment shall be deemed to be used to the extent of the outstanding Syndicated Loans and LC Exposure of such Class B Multicurrency Lender (and the Swingline Exposure of such Class of such Class B Multicurrency Lender shall be disregarded for such purpose). All extension fees payable under this Section 2.19 shall be paid on the dates due, in Dollars and immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent for distribution to the Class B Dollar Lenders, the Class B Multicurrency Lenders and the Class C Multicurrency Lenders, as applicable.

The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon.

The Administrative Agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their respective Related Parties.

The Administrative Agent may resign at any time by notifying the Lenders, the Issuing Bank and the Borrower. Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, with the consent of the Borrower not to be unreasonably withheld (or, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing in consultation with the Borrower), to appoint a successor. If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent's resignation shall nonetheless become effective and (1) the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and (2) the Required Lenders shall perform the duties of the Administrative Agent (and all payments and communications provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender directly) until such time as the Required Lenders appoint a successor agent as provided for above in this paragraph. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring (or retired) Administrative Agent and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder (if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this paragraph). The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor. After the Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 9.03 shall continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as Administrative Agent.

PORTFOLIO AND INVESTMENT ACTIVITY
During the three months ended December 31, 2009, we invested $211.8 million across 2 new and several existing portfolio companies. This compares to investing $21.9 million in 1 new and 3 existing portfolio companies for the three months ended December 31, 2008. Investments sold or prepaid during the three months ended December 31, 2009, totaled $66.6 million versus $144.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2008.
At December 31, 2009, our portfolio consisted of 70 portfolio companies and was invested 28% in senior secured loans, 58% in subordinated debt, 3% in preferred equity and 11% in common equity and warrants measured at fair value versus 73 portfolio companies invested 24% in senior secured loans, 59% in subordinated debt, 4% in preferred equity and 13% in common equity and warrants at December 31, 2008.
The weighted average yields on our senior secured loan portfolio, subordinated debt portfolio and total debt portfolio at our current cost basis were 8.2%, 13.4% and 11.6%, respectively, at December 31, 2009. At December 31, 2008, the yields on our senior secured loan portfolio, subordinated debt portfolio and total debt portfolio were 9.0%, 13.3%, and 12.1%, respectively.
Since the initial public offering of Apollo Investment Corporation in April 2004 and through December 31, 2009, invested capital totaled $5.9 billion in 126 portfolio companies. Over the same period, the Company completed transactions with more than 85 different financial sponsors.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Results comparisons are for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008.
Investment Income
For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2009, gross investment income totaled $85.6 million and $252.6 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2008, gross investment income totaled $97.5 million and $292.0 million, respectively. The decrease in gross investment income for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2009, was primarily due to two factors: the reduction of the size of the income producing portfolio for the three and nine month periods as well as the reduction in the yield of the overall income producing portfolio with average LIBOR decreasing approximately 200 basis points. Origination, closing and/or commitment fees associated with investments in portfolio companies are accreted into interest income over the respective terms of the applicable loans.
Expenses
Net operating expenses totaled $34.2 million and $100.5 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2009, of which $26.4 million and $77.6 million, respectively, were base management fees and performance-based incentive fees and $5.0 million and $14.5 million, respectively, were interest and other credit facility expenses. Of these net operating expenses, general and administrative expenses totaled $2.8 million and $8.4 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2009. Net operating expenses totaled $43.9 million and $135.6 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2008, of which $27.9 million and $86.0 million, respectively, were base management fees and performance-based incentive fees and $13.7 million and $42.0 million, respectively, were interest and other credit facility expenses. Of these net operating expenses, general and administrative expenses totaled $2.3 million and $7.7 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2008. Net expenses consist of base investment advisory and management fees, insurance expenses, administrative services fees, legal fees, directors' fees, audit and tax services expenses, and other general and administrative expenses. The decrease in net expenses for the three and nine month periods ended December 31, 2009 versus the three and nine month periods ended December 31, 2008 was primarily related to the decrease in the weighted average interest expense on our revolving credit facility. This decrease in weighted average interest expense is due primarily to average LIBOR decreasing by approximately 200 basis points. For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2009, accrued excise tax expenses totaled $1.2 million. For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2008, accrued excise tax expenses totaled $0.9 million.
Net Investment Income
The Company's net investment income totaled $50.2 million and $150.9 million or $0.30 and $0.99 per average share, respectively, for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2009. For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2008, net investment income totaled $52.8 million and $155.6 million or $0.37 and $1.12 per average share, respectively.
Net Realized Gains (Losses) on Investments, Cash Equivalents and Foreign Currencies
The Company had investment sales and prepayments totaling $66.6 million and $167.1 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2009. For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2008, investment sales and prepayments totaled $144.3 million and $254.7 million, respectively. Net realized losses for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2009 were $152.0 million and $253.4 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2008, net realized losses totaled $3.6 million and $63.4 million, respectively.
Net Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) on Investments, Cash Equivalents and Foreign Currencies
For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2009, the Company's investments, cash equivalents, foreign currencies and other assets and liabilities had net appreciation of $181.4 million and $375.6 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2008, the Company's investments, cash equivalents, foreign currencies and other assets and liabilities had net depreciation of $524.8 million and $733.9 million, respectively. This net unrealized appreciation was primarily due to improving capital market conditions and net changes in specific portfolio company fundamentals.
Net Increase (Decrease) in Net Assets From Operations
For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2009, the Company had a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of $79.5 million and $273.2 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2008, the Company had a net decrease in net assets resulting from operations of $475.5 million and $641.7 million, respectively. The earnings per average share were $0.48 and $1.78 for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2009, respectively. For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2008, the loss per average share was $3.34 and $4.63, respectively.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
The Company's liquidity and capital resources are generated and generally available through periodic follow-on equity offerings, through its senior secured, multi-currency $1.56 billion revolving credit facility, through investments in special purpose entities in which we hold and finance particular investments on a non-recourse basis, as well as from cash flows from operations, investment sales of liquid assets and prepayments of senior and subordinated loans and income earned from investments and cash equivalents. At December 31, 2009, the Company had $948 million in borrowings outstanding and $611 million of unused capacity. In the future, the Company may raise additional equity or debt capital off its shelf registration, among other considerations. The primary use of funds will be investments in portfolio companies, cash distributions to our stockholders, reductions in debt outstanding and other general corporate purposes. On December 15, 2009, the Company closed on its most recent follow-on public equity offering of 11.5 million shares of common stock at $9.82 per share raising approximately $107.8 million in net proceeds.

Accordingly, Innkeepers also announced that it had retained the services of financial and legal advisors to assist the company in an evaluation of financial alternatives, including a potential restructuring of the company's balance sheet.
"Innkeepers has a long history as a leader in the branded extended-stay hotel segment," commented Marc Beilinson, chief restructuring officer of Innkeepers. "It is our goal to preserve the company's reputation as a leader in the industry and continue to serve our guests at each of our 73 hotels." Beilinson said that all hotels owned by Innkeepers are open and operating in the ordinary course of business and that all hotel and corporate employees will continue to be paid and receive benefits as usual.
The company will have no further comment at this time about this matter beyond what is contained in this press release.

PORTFOLIO AND INVESTMENT ACTIVITY
During our fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, we invested $716 million across 5 new and 24 existing portfolio companies, primarily through opportunistic secondary market purchases. This compares to investing $435 million in 12 new and 13 existing portfolio companies for the previous fiscal year ended March 31, 2009. Investments sold or prepaid during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 totaled $452 million versus $340 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009.
At March 31, 2010, our net portfolio consisted of 67 portfolio companies and was invested 30% in senior secured loans, 59% in subordinated debt, 1% in preferred equity and 10% in common equity and warrants measured at fair value versus 72 portfolio companies invested 26% in senior secured loans, 58% in subordinated debt, 5% in preferred equity and 11% in common equity and warrants at March 31, 2009.
The weighted average yields on our senior secured loan portfolio, subordinated debt portfolio and total debt portfolio as of March 31, 2010 at our current cost basis were 8.5%, 13.5% and 11.8%, respectively. At March 31, 2009, the yields were 8.2%, 13.2%, and 11.7%, respectively.
Since the initial public offering of Apollo Investment in April 2004 and through March 31, 2010, invested capital totaled $6.3 billion in 128 portfolio companies. Over the same period, Apollo Investment completed transactions with more than 85 different financial sponsors.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Results comparisons are for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2010, March 31, 2009 and March 31, 2008.
Investment Income
For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2010, March 31, 2009 and March 31, 2008, gross investment income totaled $340.2 million, $377.3 million and $357.9 million, respectively. The decrease in gross investment income from fiscal year 2009 to fiscal year 2010 was primarily due to two factors: the reduction in the size of the income-producing portfolio as compared to the previous fiscal year and the reduction in average LIBOR of over 150 basis points year over year. The increase in gross investment income from fiscal year 2008 to fiscal year 2009 was primarily due to changes in the composition of the portfolio as compared to the previous fiscal year.
Expenses
Net operating expenses totaled $139.6 million, $170.5 million and $154.4 million, respectively, for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2010, March 31, 2009 and March 31, 2008, of which $103.9 million, $111.3 million and $90.3 million, respectively, were base management fees and performance-based incentive fees and $24.5 million, $48.9 million and $55.8 million, respectively, were interest and other credit facility expenses. Of these net operating expenses, general and administrative expenses totaled $11.2 million, $10.3 million and $8.3 million, respectively, for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. Net expenses consist of base investment advisory and management fees, insurance expenses, administrative services fees, legal fees, directors' fees, audit and tax services
expenses, and other general and administrative expenses. The decrease in net expenses from fiscal 2009 to 2010 was primarily related to the decrease in interest and other credit facility expenses due to the reduction in average LIBOR in the year over year period coupled with the lower average outstanding balance on the credit facility during fiscal year 2010 as compared to fiscal year 2009. The increase in net expenses from fiscal 2008 to 2009 was primarily related to the increase in performance-based incentive expenses accrued during fiscal 2009 as compared to those accrued during fiscal 2008. In addition, excise tax expense totaled $1.2 million, $0.5 million, and $1.9 million for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.
Net Investment Income
The Company's net investment income totaled $199.4 million, $206.3 million and $201.6 million, or $1.26, $1.48, and $1.82, on a per average share basis, respectively, for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.
Net Realized Gains (Losses)
The Company had investment sales and prepayments totaling $452 million, $340 million and $714 million, respectively, for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. Net realized losses for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 were $473.0 million. Net realized losses for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 were $83.7 million and the net realized gains were $54.3 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008. Net realized losses incurred during fiscal year 2010 were primarily related to sales and restructurings of certain underperforming portfolio companies, various portfolio optimization measures, and our liquidity management strategy during the financial crisis early in our fiscal year. Net realized losses incurred in fiscal 2009 were mainly derived from selective exits of underperforming investments. Net realized gains for fiscal 2008 were mainly derived from exits from certain outperforming investments.
Net Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) on Investments, Cash Equivalents and Foreign Currencies
For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, net change in unrealized appreciation on the Company's investments, cash equivalents, foreign currencies and other assets and liabilities totaled $536.9 million. For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2009 and 2008, net change in unrealized depreciation on the Company's investments, cash equivalents, foreign currencies and other assets and liabilities totaled $734.5 million and $289.3 million, respectively. Net unrealized appreciation for fiscal 2010 was primarily due to the recognition of realized losses which reversed unrealized depreciation, net changes in specific portfolio company fundamentals, and improving capital market conditions. During fiscal 2009, a material increase in unrealized depreciation was recognized from significantly lower fair value determinations on many of our investments. These lower fair values were driven primarily from the general market dislocation, the illiquid capital markets, and the then current market expectations for pricing increased credit risk and default assumptions. For the fiscal 2008 period, unrealized depreciation generally stemmed from lower fair values on certain investments as compared to the prior fiscal year.
Net Increase (Decrease) in Net Assets From Operations
For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, the Company had a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of $263.3 million. For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company had a net decrease in net assets resulting from operations of $611.9 million and $33.4 million, respectively. For the year ended March 31, 2010, earnings per average share were $1.65. The loss per average share was $4.39 and $0.30 for the years ended March 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
The Company's liquidity and capital resources are generated and generally available through periodic follow-on equity offerings, our senior secured, multi-currency $1.56 billion revolving credit facility, investments in special purpose entities in which we hold and finance particular investments on a non-recourse basis, as well as from cash flows from operations, investment sales of liquid assets and prepayments of senior and subordinated loans and income earned from investments. At March 31, 2010, the Company had $1.06 billion in borrowings outstanding and $498 million of unused capacity on its revolving credit facility. In the future, the Company may raise additional equity or debt capital off its shelf registration, among other considerations. The primary use of funds will be investments in portfolio companies, reductions in debt outstanding
and other general corporate purposes. On April 27, 2010, the Company closed on its most recent follow-on public equity offering of 17.25 million shares of common stock at $12.40 per share raising approximately $204 million in net proceeds.

(d) Exhibits.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this Current Report on Form 8-K to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
PALM BEACH, FL, July 19, 2010 Innkeepers USA Trust (OTC: INKPP) ("Innkeepers" or the "Company"), a real estate investment trust and a leading owner of upscale extended-stay hotel properties throughout the United States, today announced that it has reached various agreements with certain of its key constituents regarding a comprehensive financial restructuring to be effectuated through a pre-arranged plan of reorganization under chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code.
Collectively, the agreements provide for a significant deleveraging of Innkeepers' balance sheet, and allow Innkeepers to maintain its valuable portfolio of hotel properties. Among other things, these agreements contemplate Lehman ALI Inc., one of Innkeepers' largest prepetition secured lenders, converting its secured claims to substantially all of the equity in the reorganized company. In addition, Marriott International, Inc., one of Innkeepers' significant franchisors, has agreed on the treatment of its franchise agreements, subject to Innkeepers' ability to perform enhancement projects on certain of its hotels. Innkeepers has secured commitments for two debtor-in-possession (DIP) credit facilities totaling approximately $67 million, which Innkeepers will invest in the improvement of its hotel portfolio.
"Our company is entering into this last phase of its ongoing restructuring process in order to return to a position of financial and operational strength," said Marc Beilinson, the Company's Chief Restructuring Officer. "We are generating positive operational cash flows and, along with our two DIP financing agreements, we have the resources to meet our ongoing financial needs. We and our third party managers will continue to operate our hotels and serve our guests in the ordinary course," said Beilinson.
Innkeepers has sought court relief designed to ensure a seamless transition into chapter 11 that will allow it to continue to manage its business and its commercial relationships in the ordinary course. As a result of these arrangements, Innkeepers expects to emerge from its court-supervised restructuring in short order. The Company is encouraged by its lenders' participation in the process; this will create an opportunity to work with all of its constituents to address its debt issues and internally reorganize its business on an expedited timeframe. Bryan Marsal, CEO of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and co-founder of global professional services and restructuring firm Alvarez & Marsal stated, "We are delighted to have reached an agreement that balances the needs of all parties. We look forward to actively working with Innkeepers to help it complete a successful restructuring and emerge from chapter 11."
"A sustainable, long-term capital structure and improved hotel properties will pave the way to success in the upscale extended-stay hotel market and in the other segments of the hotel business in which its properties compete," said Beilinson. "We are confident we will emerge from this process as a stronger, more competitive business with a rationalized financial structure and clearly enhanced fundamentals."
The chapter 11 cases are pending in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. For access to court documents and other general information about the chapter 11 cases, please visit .

PORTFOLIO AND INVESTMENT ACTIVITY
During the three months ended June 30, 2010, we invested $221 million across 3 new and 8 existing portfolio companies, through a mix of primary and opportunistic secondary market purchases. This compares to investing
$61 million in 4 existing portfolio companies for the three months ended June 30, 2009. Investments sold or prepaid during the three months ended June 30, 2010 totaled $114 million versus $70 million for the three months ended June 30, 2009.
At June 30, 2010, our net portfolio consisted of 68 portfolio companies and was invested 32% in senior secured loans, 57% in subordinated debt, 1% in preferred equity and 10% in common equity and warrants measured at fair value versus 72 portfolio companies invested 26% in senior secured loans, 58% in subordinated debt, 3% in preferred equity and 13% in common equity and warrants at June 30, 2009.
The weighted average yields on our senior secured loan portfolio, subordinated debt portfolio and total debt portfolio as of June 30, 2010 at our current cost basis were 8.8%, 13.3%, and 11.7%, respectively. At June 30, 2009, the yields were 7.9%, 13.4%, and 11.8%, respectively.
Since the initial public offering of Apollo Investment in April 2004 and through June 30, 2010, invested capital totaled $6.5 billion in 131 portfolio companies. Over the same period, Apollo Investment completed transactions with more than 85 different financial sponsors.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Results comparisons are for the three months ended June 30, 2010 and June 30, 2009.
Investment Income
For the three months ended June 30, 2010 and June 30, 2009, gross investment income totaled $78.2 million and $82.6 million, respectively. The decrease in gross investment income from the June 2009 quarter to the June 2010 quarter was primarily due to the reduction in the size of the income-producing portfolio as compared to the previous June quarter.
Expenses
Expenses totaled $37.4 million and $33.2 million, respectively, for the three months ended June 30, 2010 and June 30, 2009, of which $24.8 million and $25.1 million, respectively, were base management fees and performance-based incentive fees and $9.9 million and $5.1 million, respectively, were interest and other credit facility expenses. Of these expenses, general and administrative expenses totaled $2.8 million and $3.1 million, respectively, for the three months ended June 30, 2010 and 2009. Expenses consist of base investment advisory and management fees, insurance expenses, administrative services fees, legal fees, directors' fees, audit and tax services expenses, and other general and administrative expenses. The increase in expenses from the June 2009 to the June 2010 quarter was primarily related to the increase in interest and other credit facility expenses due to the December 2009 amendment to our revolving credit facility.
Net Investment Income
The Company's net investment income totaled $40.8 million and $49.3 million, or $0.22, and $0.35, on a per average share basis, respectively, for the three months ended June 30, 2010 and June 30, 2009.
Net Realized Gains (Losses)
The Company had investment sales and prepayments totaling $114 million and $70 million, respectively, for the three months ended June 30, 2010 and June 30, 2009. Net realized gains for the three months ended June 30, 2010 were $3.9 million. For the June 2009 quarter, net losses totaled $98.2 million. Net realized gains for the June 2010 quarter were primarily derived from foreign currencies. Net realized losses for the June 2009 quarter were primarily derived from selective exits of underperforming investments.
Net Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) on Investments, Cash Equivalents and Foreign Currencies
For the three months ended June 30, 2010, net change in unrealized depreciation on the Company's investments, cash equivalents, foreign currencies and other assets and liabilities totaled $129.0 million. For the three months ended June 30, 2009, net change in unrealized appreciation totaled $133.4 million. Net unrealized depreciation for the three months ended June 2010 was primarily due to net changes in specific portfolio company fundamentals and slightly weaker capital market conditions. For the three months ended June 2009, an increase in unrealized appreciation was recognized from higher fair value determinations on many of our investments. These higher fair values were driven primarily from improving conditions in the capital markets.
Net Increase (Decrease) in Net Assets From Operations
For the three months ended June 30, 2010, the Company had a net decrease in net assets resulting from operations of $84.3 million. For the three months ended June 30, 2009, the Company had a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of $84.5 million. For the three months ended June 30, 2010, loss per average share was $0.45. For the three months ended June 30, 2009, earnings per average share were $0.59.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
The Company's liquidity and capital resources are generated and generally available through periodic follow-on equity offerings, our senior secured, multi-currency $1.56 billion revolving credit facility, investments in special purpose entities in which we hold and finance particular investments on a non-recourse basis, as well as from cash flows from operations, investment sales of liquid assets and prepayments of senior and subordinated loans and income earned from investments. At June 30, 2010, the Company had $993 million in borrowings outstanding and $566 million of unused capacity on its revolving credit facility. In the future, the Company may raise additional equity or debt capital off its shelf registration, among other considerations. The primary use of funds will be investments in portfolio companies, reductions in debt outstanding and other general corporate purposes. On May 3, 2010, the Company closed on its most recent follow-on public equity offering of 17.25 million shares of common stock at $12.40 per share raising approximately $204 million in net proceeds.

PORTFOLIO AND INVESTMENT ACTIVITY
During the three months ended September 30, 2010, we invested $184 million across 2 new and 4 existing portfolio companies, through a mix of primary and opportunistic secondary market purchases. This compares to investing $39 million in 6 existing portfolio companies for the three months ended September 30, 2009. Investments sold or prepaid during the three months ended September 30, 2010 totaled $127 million versus $30 million for the three months ended September 30, 2009.
At September 30, 2010, our net portfolio consisted of 67 portfolio companies and was invested 31% in senior secured loans, 59% in subordinated debt, 1% in preferred equity and 9% in common equity and warrants measured at fair value versus 71 portfolio companies invested 26% in senior secured loans, 57% in subordinated debt, 4% in preferred equity and 13% in common equity and warrants at September 30, 2009.
The weighted average yields on our senior secured loan portfolio, subordinated debt portfolio and total debt portfolio as of September 30, 2010 at our current cost basis were 8.9%, 13.3%, and 11.7%, respectively. At September 30, 2009, the yields were 7.9%, 13.2%, and 11.5%, respectively.
Since the initial public offering of the Company in April 2004 and through September 30, 2010, invested capital totaled $6.6 billion in 133 portfolio companies. Over the same period, the Company completed transactions with more than 85 different financial sponsors.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Results comparisons are for the three and six months ended September 30, 2010 and September 30, 2009.
Investment Income
For the three and six months ended September 30, 2010, gross investment income totaled $91.5 million and $169.7 million, respectively. For the three and six months ended September 30, 2009, gross investment income totaled $84.4 million and $167.0 million, respectively. The increase in gross investment income for the three and six months ended September 30, 2010, was primarily due to a higher debt portfolio yield for the period as compared to the three and six months ended September 30, 2009.
Expenses
Expenses totaled $41.3 million and $78.7 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended September 30, 2010, of which $27.6 million and $52.3 million, respectively, were base management fees and performance-based incentive fees and $10.7 million and $20.6 million, respectively, were interest and other credit facility expenses. Of these expenses, general and administrative expenses totaled $3.0 million and $5.8 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended September 30, 2010. Expenses totaled $33.0 million and $66.2 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended September 30, 2009, of which $26.1 million and $51.1 million, respectively, were base management fees and performance-based incentive fees and $4.4 million and $9.5 million, respectively, were interest and other credit facility expenses.

Expenses consist of base investment advisory and management fees, insurance expenses, administrative services fees, legal fees, directors' fees, audit and tax services expenses, and other general and administrative expenses. The increase in expenses from the three and six months periods ended September 2010 versus the three and six months periods ended September 2009 was primarily related to the increase in interest and other credit facility expenses due to the December 2009 amendment to our revolving credit facility.
Net Investment Income

For the six months ended September 30, 2010, unrealized depreciation totaled $21.6 million. For the three and six months ended September 30, 2009, net change in unrealized appreciation totaled $60.9 million and $194.2 million, respectively. Net unrealized appreciation for the three months ended September 30, 2010 was primarily due to net changes in specific portfolio company fundamentals and stronger capital market conditions. For the six months ended September 30, 2010, net unrealized depreciation was recognized from weaker market conditions present earlier in the fiscal year. For the three and six months ended September 30, 2009, the increase in unrealized appreciation was derived from net changes in specific portfolio company fundamentals and stronger capital market conditions.

PORTFOLIO AND INVESTMENT ACTIVITY
During the three months ended December 31, 2010, we invested $382 million across 8 new and 3 existing portfolio companies, through a mix of primary and opportunistic secondary market purchases. This compares to investing $212 million in 2 new and several existing portfolio companies for the three months ended December 31, 2009. Investments sold or prepaid during the three months ended December 31, 2010 totaled $481 million versus $67 million for the three months ended December 31, 2009.
At December 31, 2010, our net portfolio consisted of 69 portfolio companies and was invested 29% in senior secured loans, 62% in subordinated debt, 1% in preferred equity and 8% in common equity and warrants measured at fair value versus 70 portfolio companies invested 28% in senior secured loans, 58% in subordinated debt, 3% in preferred equity and 11% in common equity and warrants at December 31, 2009.
The weighted average yields on our senior secured loan portfolio, subordinated debt portfolio and total debt portfolio as of December 31, 2010 at our current cost basis were 8.7%, 12.9%, and 11.5%, respectively. At December 31, 2009, the yields were 8.2%, 13.4%, and 11.6%, respectively.
Since the initial public offering of Apollo Investment in April 2004 and through December 31, 2010, invested capital totaled $7.0 billion in 140 portfolio companies. Over the same period, Apollo Investment completed transactions with more than 85 different financial sponsors.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Results comparisons are for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009.
Investment Income
For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2010, gross investment income totaled $94.3 million and $264.1 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2009, gross investment income totaled $85.6 million and $252.6 million, respectively. The increase in gross investment income for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2010, was primarily due to a higher average debt portfolio yield for the period as compared to the three and nine months ended December 31, 2009.
Expenses
Expenses totaled $44.2 million and $122.9 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2010, of which $27.7 million and $80.1 million, respectively, were base management fees and performance-based incentive fees and $13.4 million and $34.1 million, respectively, were interest and other debt expenses. Administrative services and other general and administrative expenses totaled $3.0 million and $8.8 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2010. Expenses totaled $34.2 million and $100.5 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2009, of which $26.4 million and $77.6 million, respectively, were base management fees and performance-based incentive fees and $5.0 million and $14.5 million, respectively, were interest and other debt expenses. Administrative services and other general and administrative expenses totaled $2.8 million and $8.4 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2009. Expenses consist of base investment advisory and management fees, insurance expenses, administrative services fees, legal fees, directors' fees, audit and tax services expenses, and other general and administrative expenses. The increase in expenses from the three and nine months periods ended December 2010 versus the three and nine months periods ended December 2009 was primarily related to the increase in interest and other debt expenses due to the December 2009 amendment to our revolving credit facility and our October issuance of senior secured notes. For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2010, accrued excise tax expenses totaled $0. For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2009, accrued excise tax expenses totaled $1.2 million.
Net Investment Income
The Company's net investment income totaled $50.1 million and $141.1 million, or $0.26, and $0.73, on a per average share basis, respectively, for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2010. For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2009, net investment income totaled $50.2 million and $150.9 million, or $0.30, and $0.99, on a per average share basis, respectively.
Net Realized Losses
The Company had investment sales and prepayments totaling $481 million and $722 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2010. For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2009, investment sales and prepayments totaled $67 million and $167 million, respectively. Net realized losses for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2010 were $64.9 million and $150.5 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2009, net realized losses totaled $152.0 million and $253.4 million, respectively. Net realized losses for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2010 and the three and nine months ended December 31, 2009 were primarily derived from selective exits and restructurings of underperforming investments.
Net Unrealized Appreciation on Investments, Cash Equivalents and Foreign Currencies
For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2010, net change in unrealized appreciation on the Company's investments, cash equivalents, foreign currencies and other assets and liabilities totaled $99.3 million and $77.7 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2009, net change in unrealized appreciation totaled $181.4 million and $375.6 million, respectively. Net unrealized appreciation for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2010 was primarily due to net changes in specific portfolio company fundamentals and stronger capital market conditions. For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2009, the increase in unrealized appreciation was also derived from net changes in specific portfolio company fundamentals and stronger capital market conditions.
Net Increase in Net Assets From Operations
For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2010, the Company had a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of $84.5 million and $68.4 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2009, the Company had a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of $79.5 million and $273.2 million, respectively. The earnings per average share were $0.43 and $0.36, respectively for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2010. For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2009, earnings per average share were $0.48 and $1.78, respectively.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
The Company's liquidity and capital resources are generated and generally available through periodic follow-on equity and debt offerings, our senior secured, multi-currency $1.58 billion revolving credit facility (the "Facility"), our senior secured notes, investments in special purpose entities in which we hold and finance particular investments on a non-recourse basis, as well as from cash flows from operations, investment sales of liquid assets and prepayments of senior and subordinated loans and income earned from investments. At December 31, 2010, the Company had $775 million in borrowings outstanding and $809 million of unused capacity on its Facility. On May 3, 2010, the Company closed on its most recent follow-on public equity offering of 17.25 million shares of common stock at $12.40 per share raising approximately $204 million in net proceeds. Additionally, on September 30, 2010, the Company entered into a note purchase agreement, providing for a private placement issuance of $225,000 in aggregate principal amount of five-year, senior secured notes with a fixed interest rate of 6.25% and a maturity date of October 4, 2015 (the "Senior Secured Notes"). On October 4, 2010, the Senior Secured Notes were sold to certain institutional accredited investors pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Interest on the Senior Secured Notes will be due semi-annually on April 4 and October 4, commencing on April 4, 2011. The proceeds from the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes were primarily used to reduce other outstanding borrowings and/or commitments on the Company's Facility. In the future, the Company may raise additional equity or debt capital, among other considerations. The primary use of funds will be investments in portfolio companies, reductions in debt outstanding and other general corporate purposes.
As of January 19, 2011, the Company received an additional lender commitment with a maturity date of April 12, 2013 of $50,000 under the Facility. As of January 19, 2011, aggregate lender commitments total $1,633,750.
On January 25, 2011, the Company closed a private offering of $200 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured convertible notes (the "Unsecured Notes"). The Unsecured Notes were issued in a private placement only to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Unsecured Notes bear interest at an annual rate of 5.75%, payable semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year, commencing on July 15, 2011. The Unsecured Notes will mature on January 15, 2016. Prior to December 15, 2015, the Unsecured Notes will be convertible only upon specified events and during specified periods and, thereafter, at any time. The Unsecured Notes will initially be convertible at a conversion rate of 72.7405 shares of the Company's common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Unsecured Notes, corresponding to an initial conversion price of approximately $13.75, which represents a premium of 17.5% to the $11.70 per share closing price of the Company's common stock on The NASDAQ Global Select Market on January 19, 2011. The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment upon certain events. The net proceeds from the offering of Unsecured Notes will be used to fund new portfolio investments, reduce outstanding borrowings on the Company's Facility and for general corporate purposes.

PORTFOLIO AND INVESTMENT ACTIVITY
During our fiscal year ended March 31, 2011, we invested $1.1 billion across 21 new and 18 existing portfolio companies through a combination of primary and secondary market purchases. This compares to investing $716 million in 5 new and 24 existing portfolio companies for the previous fiscal year ended March 31, 2010. Investments sold or prepaid during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011 totaled $977 million versus $452 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010.
At March 31, 2011, our net portfolio consisted of 69 portfolio companies and was invested 33% in senior secured loans, 58% in subordinated debt, 1% in preferred equity and 8% in common equity and warrants measured at fair value versus 67 portfolio companies invested 30% in senior secured loans, 59% in subordinated debt, 1% in preferred equity and 10% in common equity and warrants at March 31, 2010.
The weighted average yields on our senior secured loan portfolio, subordinated debt portfolio and total debt portfolio as of March 31, 2011 at our current cost basis were 9.0%, 13.1% and 11.6%, respectively. At March 31, 2010, the yields were 8.5%, 13.5% and 11.8%, respectively.
Since the initial public offering of Apollo Investment in April 2004 and through March 31, 2011, invested capital totaled over $7.3 billion in 147 portfolio companies. Over the same period, Apollo Investment completed transactions with more than 90 different financial sponsors.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Results comparisons are for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2011, March 31, 2010 and March 31, 2009.
Investment Income
For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, gross investment income totaled $358.8 million, $340.2 million and $377.3 million, respectively. The increase in gross investment income from fiscal year 2010 to fiscal year 2011 was primarily due to an increase in the size of the income-producing portfolio as compared to the previous fiscal year. The decrease in gross investment income from fiscal year 2009 to fiscal year 2010 was primarily due to two factors: the reduction in the size of the income-producing portfolio as compared to the previous fiscal year and the reduction in average LIBOR of over 150 basis points year over year.
Expenses
Net expenses totaled $167.6 million, $139.6 million and $170.5 million, respectively, for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, of which $107.6 million, $103.9 million and $111.3 million, respectively, were base management fees and performance-based incentive fees and $48.0 million, $24.5 million and $48.9 million, respectively, were interest and other debt expenses. Administrative services and other general and administrative expenses totaled $12.0 million, $11.2 million and $10.3 million, respectively, for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. Net expenses consist of base investment advisory and management fees, insurance expenses, administrative services fees, legal fees, directors' fees, audit and tax services expenses, and other general and administrative expenses. The increase in net expenses from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011 was primarily due to an increase in interest and other debt expenses as we added new sources of capital that increased our weighted average annual interest cost. The decrease in net expenses from fiscal 2009 to 2010 was primarily related to the decrease in
interest and other debt expenses due to the reduction in average LIBOR in the year over year period coupled with the lower average outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility during fiscal year 2010 as compared to fiscal year 2009. Accrued excise tax expenses totaled $0, $1.2 million, and $0.5 million for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009.
Net Investment Income
The Company's net investment income totaled $191.2 million, $199.4 million and $206.3 million, or $0.99, $1.26, and $1.48, on a per average share basis, respectively, for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009.
Net Realized Losses
The Company had investment sales and prepayments totaling $977 million, $452 million and $340 million, respectively, for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. Net realized losses for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 were $152.0 million, $473.0 million and $83.7 million, respectively. Net realized losses incurred during fiscal years 2011 and 2010 were primarily related to sales and restructurings of certain underperforming portfolio companies such as American Safety Razor, LVI Services and Pacific Crane Maintenance Company, various portfolio optimization measures, and our liquidity management strategy during the financial crisis early in the 2010 fiscal year. Net realized losses incurred in fiscal 2009 were mainly derived from selective exits of underperforming investments.
Net Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) on Investments, Cash Equivalents and Foreign Currencies
For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2011 and 2010 net change in unrealized appreciation on the Company's investments, cash equivalents, foreign currencies and other assets and liabilities totaled $141.3 million and $536.9 million, respectively. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009, net change in unrealized depreciation on the Company's investments, cash equivalents, foreign currencies and other assets and liabilities totaled $734.5 million. Net unrealized appreciation for fiscal 2011 and 2010 was primarily due to the recognition of realized losses which reversed unrealized depreciation, net changes in specific portfolio company fundamentals, and improving capital market conditions. During fiscal 2009, a material increase in unrealized depreciation was recognized from significantly lower fair value determinations on many of our investments. These lower fair values were driven primarily from the general market dislocation, the illiquid capital markets, and the then current market expectations for pricing increased credit risk and default assumptions.
Net Increase (Decrease) in Net Assets From Operations
For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company had a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of $180.4 million and $263.3 million, respectively. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009, the Company had a net decrease in net assets resulting from operations of $611.9 million. For the years ended March 31, 2011 and 2010, basic and diluted earnings per average share were $0.93 and $1.65, respectively. The loss per average share was $4.39 for the year ended March 31, 2009.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
The Company's liquidity and capital resources are generated and generally available through periodic follow-on equity and debt offerings, our senior secured, multi-currency $1.63 billion revolving credit (the "Facility"), our senior secured notes, investments in special purpose entities in which we hold and finance particular investments on a non-recourse basis, as well as from cash flows from operations, investment sales of liquid assets and prepayments of senior and subordinated loans and income earned from investments. The Company also has investments in its portfolio that contain payment-in-kind ("PIK") provisions. PIK investments offer issuers the option at each payment date of making payments in cash or in additional securities. When additional securities are received, they typically have the same terms, including maturity dates and interest rates as the original securities issued. On these payment dates, the Company capitalizes the accrued interest or dividends receivable (reflecting such amounts as the basis in the additional securities received). PIK generally becomes due at maturity of the investment or upon the investment being called by the issuer. In order to maintain the Company's status as a RIC, this non-cash source of income must be paid out to stockholders annually in the form of dividends, even though the Company has not yet collected the cash. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011, accrued PIK totaled $32.9 million, on total investment income of
$358.8 million. At March 31, 2011, the Company had $628 million in borrowings outstanding on its Facility and $1.0 billion of unused capacity. On April 13, 2011, $380 million of commitments on the Facility matured. As of April 13, 2011, aggregate lender commitments under the Facility total $1,253,750,000.
On September 30, 2010, the Company entered into a note purchase agreement, providing for a private placement issuance of $225 million in aggregate principal amount of five-year, senior secured notes with a fixed interest rate of 6.25% and a maturity date of October 4, 2015 (the "Senior Secured Notes"). On October 4, 2010, the Senior Secured Notes were sold to certain institutional accredited investors pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Interest on the Senior Secured Notes will be due semi-annually on April 4 and October 4, commencing on April 4, 2011. The proceeds from the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes were primarily used to reduce other outstanding borrowings and/or commitments on the Company's Facility.
On January 25, 2011, we closed a private offering of $200 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured convertible notes (the "Convertible Notes"). The Convertible Notes were issued in a private placement only to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933. The Convertible Notes bear interest at an annual rate of 5.75%, payable semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year, commencing on July 15, 2011. The Convertible Notes will mature on January 15, 2016 unless earlier converted or repurchased at the holder's option. Prior to December 15, 2015, the Convertible Notes will be convertible only upon certain corporate reorganizations, dilutive recapitalizations or dividends, or if, during specified periods our shares trade at more than 130% of the then applicable conversion price or the Convertible Notes trade at less than 97% of their conversion value and, thereafter, at any time. The Convertible Notes will be convertible by the holders into shares of common stock, initially at a conversion rate of 72.7405 shares of the Company's common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes (14,548,100 common shares) corresponding to an initial conversion price of approximately $13.75, which represents a premium of 17.5% to the $11.70 per share closing price of the Company's common stock on The NASDAQ Global Select Market on January 19, 2011. The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment upon certain events, such as stock splits and combinations, mergers, spin-offs, increases in dividends in excess of $0.28 per share per quarter and certain changes in control. Certain of these adjustments, including adjustments for increases in dividends, are subject to a conversion price floor of $11.70 per share. The Convertible Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to our existing and future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Convertible Notes; equal in right of payment to our existing and future unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness (including existing unsecured indebtedness that we later secure) to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all existing and future indebtedness (including trade payables) incurred by our subsidiaries, financing vehicles or similar facilities.
On May 3, 2010, the Company closed on its most recent follow-on public equity offering of 17.25 million shares of common stock at $12.40 per share raising approximately $204 million in net proceeds. In the future, the Company may raise additional equity or debt capital, among other considerations. The primary use of funds will be investments in portfolio companies, reductions in debt outstanding and other general corporate purposes.

PORTFOLIO AND INVESTMENT ACTIVITY
During the three months ended June 30, 2011, we invested $836 million across 9 new and 10 existing portfolio companies, through a combination of primary and secondary market purchases. This compares to investing $221 million in 3 new and 8 existing portfolio companies for the three months ended June 30, 2010. Investments sold or prepaid during the three months ended June 30, 2011 totaled $733 million versus $114 million for the three months ended June 30, 2010.
At June 30, 2011, our net portfolio consisted of 72 portfolio companies and was invested 32% in senior secured loans, 57% in subordinated debt, 1% in preferred equity and 10% in common equity and warrants measured at fair value versus 68 portfolio companies invested 32% in senior secured loans, 57% in subordinated debt, 1% in preferred equity and 10% in common equity and warrants at June 30, 2010.
The weighted average yields on our senior secured loan portfolio, subordinated debt portfolio and total debt portfolio as of June 30, 2011 at our current cost basis were 9.2%, 12.3% and 11.1%, respectively. At June 30, 2010, the yields were 8.8%, 13.3% and 11.7%, respectively.
Since the initial public offering of Apollo Investment in April 2004 and through June 30, 2011, invested capital totaled over $8.1 billion in 155 portfolio companies. Over the same period, Apollo Investment completed transactions with more than 100 different financial sponsors.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Results comparisons are for the three months ended June 30, 2011 and June 30, 2010.
Investment Income
For the three months ended June 30, 2011 and June 30, 2010, gross investment income totaled $94.6 million and $78.2 million, respectively. The increase in gross investment income for the June 2011 quarter was primarily due to an increase in the receipt of prepayment premiums and other deal related fees as compared to the prior June 2010 quarter.
Expenses
Expenses totaled $46.9 million and $37.4 million, respectively, for the three months ended June 30, 2011 and June 30, 2010, of which $24.3 million and $24.8 million, respectively, were base management fees and performance-based incentive fees and $16.0 million and $9.9 million, respectively, were interest and other debt expenses. Administrative services and other general and administrative expenses totaled $6.7 million and $2.8 million, respectively, for the three months June 30, 2011 and June 30, 2010, respectively. Expenses consist of base investment advisory and management fees, insurance expenses, administrative services fees, legal fees, directors' fees, audit and tax services expenses, and other general and administrative expenses. The increase in expenses from the June 2010 to the June 2011 quarter was primarily due to an increase in interest expense as our average interest cost in the current period is over 150 basis points higher than in the year ago period. This increase resulted from the issuance of two tranches of long-term fixed rate debt in periods subsequent to the three month period ended June 30, 2010. In addition, the Company recognized approximately $3.5 million in net non-recurring expenses, including legal and other professional expenses of $4.2 million net of a non-recurring reduction of administrative expenses.
Net Investment Income
The Company's net investment income totaled $47.7 million and $40.8 million, or $0.24 and $0.22, on a per average share basis, respectively, for the three months ended June 30, 2011 and June 30, 2010.
Net Realized Losses
The Company had investment sales and prepayments totaling $733 million and $114 million, respectively, for the three months ended June 30, 2011 and June 30, 2010. Net realized losses for the three months ended June 30, 2011 were $45.9 million. For the three months ended June 30, 2010, net realized gains totaled $3.9 million. Net realized
losses for the June 2011 quarter were primarily derived from the realization of previously reported unrealized losses on our investment in Playpower Holdings. Net realized gains for the June 2010 quarter were primarily derived from foreign currencies.
Net Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) on Investments, Cash Equivalents and Foreign Currencies
For the three months ended June 30, 2011 and June 30, 2010, net change in unrealized depreciation on the Company's investments, cash equivalents, foreign currencies and other assets and liabilities totaled $1.7 million and $129.0 million, respectively. For the three months ended June 30, 2011, the increase in unrealized depreciation was derived from a decline in general capital market conditions offset by the recognition of realized losses which reversed unrealized depreciation. For the three months ended June 30, 2010, depreciation was primarily due to net changes in specific portfolio company fundamentals and slightly weaker capital market conditions.
Net Increase in Net Assets From Operations
For the three months ended June 30, 2011, the Company had a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of $0.1 million. For the three months ended June 30, 2010, the Company had a net decrease in net assets resulting from operations of $84.3 million. For the three months ended June 30, 2011 basic and diluted earnings per average share were $0.00. The loss per average share was $0.45 for the three months ended June 30, 2010.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
The Company's liquidity and capital resources are generated and generally available through periodic follow-on equity and debt offerings, our senior secured, multi-currency $1.25 billion revolving credit facility (the "Facility"), our senior secured notes, investments in special purpose entities in which we hold and finance particular investments on a non-recourse basis, as well as from cash flows from operations, investment sales of liquid assets and prepayments of senior and subordinated loans and income earned from investments. The Company also has investments in its portfolio that contain PIK provisions. PIK investments offer issuers the option at each payment date of making payments in cash or in additional securities. When additional securities are received, they typically have the same terms, including maturity dates and interest rates as the original securities issued. On these payment dates, the Company capitalizes the accrued interest or dividends receivable (reflecting such amounts as the basis in the additional securities received). PIK generally becomes due at maturity of the investment or upon the investment being called by the issuer. In order to maintain the Company's status as a RIC, this non-cash source of income must be paid out to stockholders annually in the form of dividends, even though the Company has not yet collected the cash. For the three months ended June 30, 2011, accrued PIK totaled $3.5 million, on total investment income of $94.6 million. At June 30, 2011, the Company had $824 million in borrowings outstanding on its Facility and $430 million of unused capacity. On April 13, 2011, $380 million of commitments on the Facility matured. As of June 30, 2011, aggregate lender commitments under the Facility total $1,253,750,000.
On May 3, 2010, the Company closed on its most recent follow-on public equity offering of 17.25 million shares of common stock at $12.40 per share raising approximately $204 million in net proceeds. In the future, the Company may raise additional equity or debt capital, among other considerations. The primary use of funds will be investments in portfolio companies, reductions in debt outstanding and other general corporate purposes.
On September 30, 2010, the Company entered into a note purchase agreement, providing for a private placement issuance of $225 million in aggregate principal amount of five-year, senior secured notes with a fixed interest rate of 6.25% and a maturity date of October 4, 2015 (the "Senior Secured Notes"). On October 4, 2010, the Senior Secured Notes were sold to certain institutional accredited investors pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Interest on the Senior Secured Notes will be due semi-annually on April 4 and October 4, commencing on April 4, 2011. The proceeds from the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes were primarily used to reduce other outstanding borrowings and/or commitments on the Company's Facility.
On January 25, 2011, the Company closed a private offering of $200 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured convertible notes (the "Convertible Notes"). The Convertible Notes were issued in a private placement only to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933. The Convertible
Notes bear interest at an annual rate of 5.75%, payable semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year, commencing on July 15, 2011. The Convertible Notes will mature on January 15, 2016 unless earlier converted or repurchased at the holder's option. Prior to December 15, 2015, the Convertible Notes will be convertible only upon certain corporate reorganizations, dilutive recapitalizations or dividends, or if, during specified periods our shares trade at more than 130% of the then applicable conversion price or the Convertible Notes trade at less than 97% of their conversion value and, thereafter, at any time. The Convertible Notes will be convertible by the holders into shares of common stock, initially at a conversion rate of 72.7405 shares of the Company's common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes (14,548,100 common shares) corresponding to an initial conversion price of approximately $13.75, which represents a premium of 17.5% to the $11.70 per share closing price of the Company's common stock on The NASDAQ Global Select Market on January 19, 2011. The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment upon certain events, such as stock splits and combinations, mergers, spin-offs, increases in dividends in excess of $0.28 per share per quarter and certain changes in control. Certain of these adjustments, including adjustments for increases in dividends, are subject to a conversion price floor of $11.70 per share. The Convertible Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to our existing and future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Convertible Notes; equal in right of payment to our existing and future unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness (including existing unsecured indebtedness that we later secure) to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all existing and future indebtedness (including trade payables) incurred by our subsidiaries, financing vehicles or similar facilities.

NEW YORK August 11, 2011Apollo Investment Corporation (the Company) (NASDAQ-GS: AINV) announced today that it has adopted a plan for the purpose of repurchasing up to $200 million of its common stock in accordance with the guidelines specified in Rule 10b-18 and Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
 
The Companys plan is designed to allow it to repurchase its shares both during its open window periods and at times when it otherwise might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of self-imposed trading blackout periods. A broker selected by the Company will have the authority under the terms and limitations specified in the plan to repurchase shares on the Companys behalf in accordance with the terms of the plan. Repurchases are subject to SEC regulations as well as certain price, market volume and timing constraints specified in the plan.
 
The Companys Board has authorized the repurchase plan because it believes the recent market turmoil may cause the Companys common stock to be undervalued from time to time. The timing and amount of any share repurchases will depend on the terms and conditions of the repurchase plan and no assurance can be given that any particular amount of common stock will be repurchased.
 
James Zelter, the Companys Chief Executive Officer said This decision is consistent with our long term strategy of seeking to create shareholder value.

PORTFOLIO AND INVESTMENT ACTIVITY
During the three months ended September 30, 2011, we invested $403 million across 6 new and 8 existing portfolio companies, through a combination of primary and secondary market purchases. This compares to investing $184 million in 2 new and 4 existing portfolio companies for the three months ended September 30, 2010. Investments sold or prepaid during the three months ended September 30, 2011 totaled $387 million versus $127 million for the three months ended September 30, 2010.
At September 30, 2011, our portfolio consisted of 69 portfolio companies and was invested 30% in senior secured loans, 60% in subordinated debt, 1% in preferred equity and 9% in common equity and warrants measured at fair value versus 67 portfolio companies invested 31% in senior secured loans, 59% in subordinated debt, 1% in preferred equity and 9% in common equity and warrants at September 30, 2010.
The weighted average yields on our senior secured loan portfolio, subordinated debt portfolio and total debt portfolio as of September 30, 2011 at our current cost basis were 9.4%, 12.6% and 11.6%, respectively. At September 30, 2010, the yields were 8.9%, 13.3% and 11.7%, respectively.
Since the initial public offering of Apollo Investment in April 2004 and through September 30, 2011, invested capital totaled over $8.5 billion in 161 portfolio companies. Over the same period, Apollo Investment completed transactions with more than 100 different financial sponsors.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Results comparisons are for the three and six months ended September 30, 2011 and September 30, 2010.
Investment Income
For the three and six months ended September 30, 2011, gross investment income totaled $94.0 million and $188.6 million, respectively. For the three and six months ended September 30, 2010, gross investment income totaled $91.5 million and $169.7 million, respectively. The increase in gross investment income for the three and six months ended September 30, 2011 as compared to the three and six months ended September 30, 2010 was primarily due to an increase in the receipt of prepayment premiums and other deal related fees.
Expenses
Expenses totaled $48.4 million and $95.4 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended September 30, 2011, of which $26.9 million and $51.2 million, respectively, were base management fees and performance-based incentive fees and $17.3 million and $33.3 million, respectively, were interest and other debt expenses. Administrative services and other general and administrative expenses totaled $4.2 million and $10.8 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended September 30, 2011. Expenses totaled $41.3 million and $78.7 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended September 30, 2010, of which $27.6 million and $52.3 million, respectively, were base management fees and performance-based incentive fees and $10.7 million and $20.6 million, respectively, were interest and other debt expenses. Administrative services and other general and administrative expenses totaled $3.0 million and $5.8 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended September 30, 2010. Expenses consist of base investment advisory and management fees, insurance expenses, administrative services fees, legal fees, directors' fees, audit and tax services expenses, and other general and administrative expenses. The increase in expenses from the September 2010 periods to the September 2011 periods was primarily due to an increase in interest expense as our average interest cost in the current periods is over 125 basis points higher than in the year ago periods and the average debt outstanding is roughly $200 million higher on a year over year basis. The increase in average interest cost resulted from the issuance of three tranches of long-term fixed rate debt in periods subsequent to the three and six month periods ended September 30, 2010. In addition, in the six month period ended September 30, 2011, the Company recognized approximately $3.6 million in net non-recurring expenses, including legal and other professional expenses of $4.3 million net of a non-recurring reduction of administrative expenses.
Net Investment Income
The Company's net investment income totaled $45.5 million and $93.2 million, or $0.23 and $0.47, on a per average share basis, respectively, for the three and six months ended September 30, 2011. The Company's net investment income totaled $50.2 million and $91.0 million, or $0.26 and $0.48, on a per average share basis, respectively, for the three and six months ended September 30, 2010.
Net Realized Losses
The Company had investment sales and prepayments totaling $387 million and $1.1 billion, respectively, for the three and six months ended September 30, 2011. The Company had investment sales and prepayments totaling $127 million and $241 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended September 30, 2010. Net realized losses for the three and six months ended September 30, 2011 were $20.2 million and $66.1 million, respectively. For the three and six months ended September 30, 2010, net realized losses totaled $89.4 million and $85.5 million, respectively. Net realized losses for the three and six month periods ended September 30, 2011 were primarily derived from the exits of select investments, including Playpower Holdings, TL Acquisitions and FSC Holdings. A portion of the realized losses incurred upon the exit of these investments reversed out previously reported unrealized losses. Net realized losses for the three and six months ended September 30, 2010 were primarily derived from selective exits of underperforming investments.
Net Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) on Investments, Cash Equivalents and Foreign Currencies
For the three and six months ended September 30, 2011, net change in unrealized depreciation on the Company's investments, cash equivalents, foreign currencies and other assets and liabilities totaled $292.6 million and $294.3 million, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2010, net change in unrealized appreciation on the Company's investments, cash equivalents, foreign currencies and other assets and liabilities totaled $107.4 million. For the six months ended September 30, 2010, net change in unrealized depreciation on the Company's investments, cash equivalents, foreign currencies and other assets and liabilities totaled $21.6 million. For the three and six months ended September 30, 2011, the increase in unrealized depreciation was derived from a decline in general capital market conditions offset by the recognition of realized losses which reversed unrealized depreciation. For the three months ended September 30, 2010, net unrealized appreciation was impacted by net changes in specific portfolio company fundamentals and stronger capital market conditions. For the six months ended September 30, 2010, net unrealized depreciation was recognized due to weaker market conditions present earlier in the fiscal year.
Net Increase (Decrease) in Net Assets From Operations
For the three and six months ended September 30, 2011, the Company had a net decrease in net assets resulting from operations of $267.3 million and $267.2 million, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2010, the Company had a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of $68.2 million. For the six months ended September 30, 2010, the Company had a net decrease in net assets resulting from operations of $16.1 million. For the three and six months ended September 30, 2011 basic and diluted losses per average share were $1.36 and $1.36, respectively. The basic and diluted earnings per average share were $0.35 for the three months ended September 30, 2010. For the six months ended September 30, 2010, basic and diluted losses per average share totaled $0.08.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
The Company's liquidity and capital resources are generated and generally available through periodic follow-on equity and debt offerings, our senior secured, multi-currency $1.254 billion revolving credit facility (the "Facility"), our senior secured notes, investments in special purpose entities in which we hold and finance particular investments on a non-recourse basis, as well as from cash flows from operations, investment sales of liquid assets and prepayments of senior and subordinated loans and income earned from investments. The Company also has investments in its portfolio that contain PIK provisions. PIK investments offer issuers the option at each payment date of making payments in cash or in additional securities. When additional securities are received, they typically have the same terms, including maturity dates and interest rates as the original securities issued. On these payment dates, the Company capitalizes the accrued interest or dividends receivable (reflecting such amounts as the basis in the additional securities received). PIK generally becomes due at maturity of the investment or upon the investment being called by the issuer. In order to maintain the Company's status as a RIC, this non-cash source of income must be paid out to stockholders annually in the form of dividends, even though the Company has not yet collected the cash. For the six months ended September 30, 2011, accrued PIK totaled $8.4 million, on total investment income
of $188.6 million. On April 13, 2011, $380 million of commitments on the Facility matured. At September 30, 2011, the Company had $753 million in borrowings outstanding on its Facility and $500 million of unused capacity. As of September 30, 2011, aggregate lender commitments under the Facility total $1.254 billion.
On May 3, 2010, the Company closed on its most recent follow-on public equity offering of 17.25 million shares of common stock at $12.40 per share raising approximately $204 million in net proceeds. In the future, the Company may raise additional equity or debt capital, among other considerations. The primary use of funds will be investments in portfolio companies, reductions in debt outstanding and other general corporate purposes, including the payment of interest, fees or distributions to shareholders.
On September 30, 2010, the Company entered into a note purchase agreement, providing for a private placement issuance of $225 million in aggregate principal amount of five-year, senior secured notes with a fixed interest rate of 6.25% and a maturity date of October 4, 2015 (the "Senior Secured Notes"). On October 4, 2010, the Senior Secured Notes were sold to certain institutional accredited investors pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Interest on the Senior Secured Notes will be due semi-annually on April 4 and October 4, commencing on April 4, 2011. The proceeds from the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes were primarily used to reduce other outstanding borrowings and/or commitments on the Company's Facility.
On January 25, 2011, the Company closed a private offering of $200 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured convertible notes (the "Convertible Notes"). The Convertible Notes were issued in a private placement only to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933. The Convertible Notes bear interest at an annual rate of 5.75%, payable semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year, commencing on July 15, 2011. The Convertible Notes will mature on January 15, 2016 unless earlier converted or repurchased at the holder's option. Prior to December 15, 2015, the Convertible Notes will be convertible only upon certain corporate reorganizations, dilutive recapitalizations or dividends, or if, during specified periods our shares trade at more than 130% of the then applicable conversion price or the Convertible Notes trade at less than 97% of their conversion value and, thereafter, at any time. The Convertible Notes will be convertible by the holders into shares of common stock, initially at a conversion rate of 72.7405 shares of the Company's common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes (14,548,100 common shares) corresponding to an initial conversion price per share of approximately $13.75, which represents a premium of 17.5% to the $11.70 per share closing price of the Company's common stock on The NASDAQ Global Select Market on January 19, 2011. The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment upon certain events, such as stock splits and combinations, mergers, spin-offs, increases in dividends in excess of $0.28 per share per quarter and certain changes in control. Certain of these adjustments, including adjustments for increases in dividends, are subject to a conversion price floor of $11.70 per share. The Convertible Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to our existing and future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Convertible Notes; equal in right of payment to our existing and future unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness (including existing unsecured indebtedness that we later secure) to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all existing and future indebtedness (including trade payables) incurred by our subsidiaries, financing vehicles or similar facilities.
On August 11, 2011, the Company adopted a plan for the purpose of repurchasing up to $200 million of its common stock in accordance with the guidelines specified in Rule 10b-18 and Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company's plan was designed to allow it to repurchase its shares both during its open window periods and at times when it otherwise might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of self-imposed trading blackout periods. A broker selected by the Company will have the authority under the terms and limitations specified in the plan to repurchase shares on the Company's behalf in accordance with the terms of the plan. Repurchases are subject to SEC regulations as well as certain price, market volume and timing constraints specified in the plan. While the portion of the plan reliant on Rule 10b-18 remains in effect, the portion reliant on Rule 10b5-1 is subject to periodic renewal and is not currently in effect. As of September 30, 2011, no shares have been repurchased.
On September 29, 2011, the Company closed a private offering of $45 million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes (the "Notes") consisting of two series: (1) 5.875% Senior Secured Notes, Series A, of the Company due September 29, 2016 in the aggregate principal amount of $29 million; and (2) 6.250% Senior Secured Notes, Series B, of the Company due September 29, 2018, in the aggregate principal amount of $16 million. The Notes
were issued in a private placement only to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The net proceeds from the offering of Notes are intended to be used to fund new portfolio investments, reduce outstanding borrowings on the Company's Facility and for general corporate purposes, including the payment of interest, fees or distributions to shareholders.

Exhibit 99.1
 
NEW YORK February 8, 2012Apollo Investment Corporation (NASDAQ-GS: AINV) or the Company, Apollo Investment, we or our today announces financial results for its fiscal quarter ended December 30, 2011. Our net investment income was $0.20 per share for the quarter ended December 31, 2011 and net asset value (NAV) was $8.16 per share as of December 31, 2011.
 
The Board announced today that Mr. Edward Goldthorpe will be joining Apollo Investment Corporation as its President, succeeding Mr. Patrick Dalton, who formerly held positions as President and Chief Operating Officer.  Mr. Edward Goldthorpe will also replace Mr. Dalton as Chief Investment Officer of our investment adviser.  The Company announced that its Board of Directors has appointed Mr. James Zelter as the Company's interim President, effective immediately. He will also serve as interim CIO of Apollo Investment Management until Mr. Goldthorpe joins, which is expected to occur in the next 90 days.  Mr. Zelter will retain his position as Chief Executive Officer of the Company.  Apollo Investment also announced that its Board of Directors has appointed Mr. Gene Donnelly, Apollo Global Management, LLCs CFO, as interim CFO and Treasurer for the Company.  Mr. Donnelly succeeds Mr. Richard Peteka who formerly served as the Companys CFO and Treasurer.  Mr. Donnelly will serve as interim CFO and Treasurer until a permanent replacement has been appointed by the Board. The Board also named Ms. Eileen Patrick as the Executive Vice President of Corporate Strategyfor the CompanyIn this newly created role, Ms. Patrick will assist in the execution of Apollo Investment Corporations strategic expansion during this period of transition.
 
.  
 
In order to capitalize on various proprietary market opportunities and to maintain an appropriate capital structure, the Board has authorized management to explore whether the Company should raise up to $200 million of additional equity capital, which may be conducted, among other means, through either a marketed deal or a rights offering. Apollo Global Management has informed the Company that it intends to support AINVs equity capital raise, which in the case of a rights offering could include the exercise of oversubscription rights as a backstop for up to $50 million. In further support of an equity offering, Apollo Investment Management has informed the Company that it intends to waive its management and incentive fees associated with any shares issued through this offering. Additionally, Apollo Global Management may also purchase shares of AINV in the open market.
 
The Company also announced that its Board of Directors has declared for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2012 a dividend of $0.20 per share, payable on April 3, 2012 to stockholders of record as of February 18, 2012.  We believe having a dividend that is more closely aligned with net investment income per share is prudent and appropriate.  The specific tax characteristics of this dividend will be reported to stockholders on Form 1099 after the end of the calendar year.
 
 
 
 
Mr. Zelter, Apollo Investment Corporations Chief Executive Officer, said, Since the onset of the global credit crisis, we believe the role of business development companies such as Apollo Investment Corporation has become increasingly important, filling the gap left by banks and traditional financial services companies.  Prior to the credit crisis, AINV focused primarily onproviding acquisition financing to middle market private equity sponsors. Today, we believe the growing void in the capital markets creates attractive opportunities for our business.  Consequently, we intend to expand our footprint to provide a wider array of proprietary private financing solutions for companies across a broad spectrum of industries and situations. The changes we have announced today, including more closely aligning our dividend with our net investment income and our decision to explore the raising of additional equity capital, are designed to reposition us to grow our business in the current environment.
 
 
Mr. Zelter continued, We are very pleased that industry veteran Edward Goldthorpe has agreed to join the senior management team at AINV, and we are confident he will play a major role in driving growth and value creation for the Company. Broadly speaking, we believe the changes we have made will enable us to capitalize on the meaningful opportunities we see in the current market and generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders.

Since the initial public offering of Apollo Investment in April 2004 and through December 31, 2011, invested capital totaled over $8.6 billion in 164 portfolio companies. Over the same period, Apollo Investment completed transactions with more than 100 different financial sponsors.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
Results comparisons below are for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010.
 
Investment Income
 
For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2011, gross investment income totaled $83.8 million and $272.4 million, respectively.  For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2010, gross investment income totaled $94.3 million and $264.1 million, respectively.  The
 
 
 
 
decrease in gross investment income for the three months ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2010 was primarily due to a decrease in the receipt of prepayment premiums and other deal related income.  The increase in gross investment income for the nine months ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the nine months ended December 31, 2010 was primarily due to an increase in the receipt of prepayment premiums and other deal related income.
 
Expenses
Expenses totaled $45.3 million and $140.7 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2011, of which $24.3 million and $75.6 million, respectively, were base management fees and performance-based incentive fees and $16.9 million and $50.2 million, respectively, were interest and other debt expenses.  Administrative services and other general and administrative expenses totaled $4.0 million and $14.9 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2011. Expenses totaled $44.2 million and $122.9 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2010, of which $27.7 million and $80.1 million, respectively, were base management fees and performance-based incentive fees and $13.4 million and $34.1 million, respectively, were interest and other debt expenses.  Administrative services and other general and administrative expenses totaled $3.0 million and $8.8 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2010. Expenses consist of base investment advisory and management fees, insurance expenses, administrative services fees, legal fees, directors fees, audit and tax services expenses, and other general and administrative expenses.  The increase in expenses from the December 2010 periods to the December 2011 periods was primarily due to an increase in interest expense as our average interest cost in the current periods is over 100 basis points higher than in the year ago periods and the average debt outstanding is roughly $150 million higher on a year over year basis.  The increase in average interest cost resulted from the issuance of new tranches of long-term fixed rate debt in periods during and subsequent to the three and nine month periods ended December 31, 2010. In addition, in the nine month period ended December 31, 2011, the Company recognized approximately $4.0 million in net non-recurring expenses, including legal and other professional expenses of $4.7 million net of a non-recurring reduction of administrative expenses.
Net Investment Income
The Companys net investment income totaled $38.5 million and $131.7 million, or $0.20 and $0.67, per average basic share, respectively, for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2011. The Companys net investment income totaled $50.1 million and $141.1 million, or $0.26 and $0.73, per average basic share, respectively, for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2010.
Net Realized Losses
The Company had investment sales and prepayments totaling $175 million and $1.3 billion, respectively, for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2011. The Company had investment sales and prepayments totaling $481 million and $722 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2010.   Net realized losses for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2011 were $275.0 million and $341.1 million, respectively.  For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2010, net realized losses totaled $64.9 million and $150.5 million, respectively.  Net realized losses for the three and nine month periods ended December 31, 2011 were primarily derived from the exits of select investments, specifically Grand Prix Holdings, which accounted for $274 million of the realized loss totals, but also included Playpower Holdings, TL Acquisitions and FSC Holdings.  The realized losses incurred upon the exit of these investments reversed out previously reported unrealized losses.  Net
 
 
 
realized losses for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2010 were primarily derived from selective exits and restructurings of underperforming investments.
Net Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) on Investments, Cash Equivalents and Foreign Currencies
For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2011, net change in unrealized appreciation on the Companys investments, cash equivalents, foreign currencies and other assets and liabilities totaled $300.2 million and $5.9 million, respectively.  For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2010, net change in unrealized appreciation on the Companys investments, cash equivalents, foreign currencies and other assets and liabilities totaled $99.3 million and $77.7 million, respectively. For the three months ended December 31, 2011, the increase in unrealized appreciation was mainly derived from the reclassification of $274 million of previously recognized unrealized depreciation on our investment in Grand Prix Holdings to a realized loss.   For the nine months ended December 31, 2011, the change in unrealized depreciation was comprised of the impact from Grand Prix Holdings together with the general decline in capital market conditions during the period.  For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2010, net unrealized appreciation was impacted by net changes in specific portfolio company fundamentals and stronger capital market conditions.
Net Increase (Decrease) in Net Assets From Operations
For the three months ended December 31, 2011, the Company had a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of $63.7 million.  For the nine months ended December 31, 2011, the Company had a net decrease in net assets resulting from operations of $203.5 million.  For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2010, the Company had a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of $84.5 million and $68.4 million, respectively.  For the three months ended December 31, 2011 basic and diluted earnings per average share were $0.32 and $0.31, respectively.  For the nine months ended December 31, 2011, basic and diluted losses per average share were $1.04 and $1.04, respectively.  The basic and diluted earnings per average share were $0.43 and $0.36 for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2010.
 
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
The Companys liquidity and capital resources are generated and generally available through periodic follow-on equity and debt offerings, our senior secured, multi-currency $1.254 billion revolving credit facility maturing on April 12, 2013 (see note 10 within the Notes to Financial Statements) (the Facility), our senior secured notes, investments in special purpose entities in which we hold and finance particular investments on a non-recourse basis, as well as from cash flows from operations, investment sales of liquid assets and prepayments of senior and subordinated loans and income earned from investments.  The Company also has investments in its portfolio that contain PIK provisions. PIK investments offer issuers the option at each payment date of making payments in cash or in additional securities.  When additional securities are received, they typically have the same terms, including maturity dates and interest rates as the original securities issued.  On these payment dates, the Company capitalizes the accrued interest or dividends receivable (reflecting such amounts as the basis in the additional securities received). PIK generally becomes due at maturity of the investment or upon the investment being called by the issuer. In order to maintain the Companys status as a RIC, this non-cash source of income must be paid out to stockholders annually in the form of dividends, even though the Company has not yet collected the cash.  For the nine months ended December 31, 2011, accrued PIK totaled $13.1 million, on total investment income of $272.4 million.  On April 13, 2011, $380 million of commitments on the Facility matured.  At December 31, 2011, the Company had $743 million in
 
 
 
borrowings outstanding on its Facility and $511 million of unused capacity.  As of December 31, 2011, aggregate lender commitments under the Facility total $1.254 billion.
On May 3, 2010, the Company closed on its most recent follow-on public equity offering of 17.25 million shares of common stock at $12.40 per share raising approximately $204 million in net proceeds.  In the future, the Company may raise additional equity or debt capital, among other considerations.  The primary use of funds will be investments in portfolio companies, reductions in debt outstanding and other general corporate purposes, including the payment of interest, fees or distributions to shareholders.
On September 30, 2010, the Company entered into a note purchase agreement, providing for a private placement issuance of $225 million in aggregate principal amount of five-year, senior secured notes with a fixed interest rate of 6.25% and a maturity date of October 4, 2015 (the Senior Secured Notes).  On October 4, 2010, the Senior Secured Notes were sold to certain institutional accredited investors pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Interest on the Senior Secured Notes will be due semi-annually on April 4 and October 4, commencing on April 4, 2011. The proceeds from the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes were primarily used to reduce other outstanding borrowings and/or commitments on the Company's Facility.
On January 25, 2011, the Company closed a private offering of $200 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured convertible notes (the Convertible Notes).  The Convertible Notes were issued in a private placement only to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933.  The Convertible Notes bear interest at an annual rate of 5.75%, payable semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year, commencing on July 15, 2011.  The Convertible Notes will mature on January 15, 2016 unless earlier converted or repurchased at the holders option. Prior to December 15, 2015, the Convertible Notes will be convertible only upon certain corporate reorganizations, dilutive recapitalizations or dividends, or if, during specified periods our shares trade at more than 130% of the then applicable conversion price or the Convertible Notes trade at less than 97% of their conversion value and, thereafter, at any time.  The Convertible Notes will be convertible by the holders into shares of common stock, initially at a conversion rate of 72.7405 shares of the Companys common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes (14,548,100 common shares) corresponding to an initial conversion price per share of approximately $13.75, which represents a premium of 17.5% to the $11.70 per share closing price of the Companys common stock on The NASDAQ Global Select Market on January 19, 2011.  The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment upon certain events, such as stock splits and combinations, mergers, spin-offs, increases in dividends in excess of $0.28 per share per quarter and certain changes in control.  Certain of these adjustments, including adjustments for increases in dividends, are subject to a conversion price floor of $11.70 per share.  The Convertible Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to our existing and future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Convertible Notes; equal in right of payment to our existing and future unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness (including existing unsecured indebtedness that we later secure) to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all existing and future indebtedness (including trade payables) incurred by our subsidiaries, financing vehicles or similar facilities.  
On August 11, 2011, the Company adopted a plan for the purpose of repurchasing up to $200 million of its common stock in accordance with the guidelines specified in Rule 10b-18 and Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company's plan was designed to allow it to repurchase its shares both during its open window periods and at times when it otherwise might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of self-imposed trading blackout periods. A broker selected by the Company will have the authority under the terms and
 
 
 
limitations specified in the plan to repurchase shares on the Company's behalf in accordance with the terms of the plan. Repurchases are subject to SEC regulations as well as certain price, market volume and timing constraints specified in the plan.  While the portion of the plan reliant on Rule 10b-18 remains in effect, the portion reliant on Rule 10b5-1 is subject to periodic renewal and is not currently in effect. As of December 31, 2011, no shares have been repurchased.
On September 29, 2011, the Company closed a private offering of $45 million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes (the Notes) consisting of two series:  (1) 5.875% Senior Secured Notes, Series A, of the Company due September 29, 2016 in the aggregate principal amount of $29 million; and (2) 6.250% Senior Secured Notes, Series B, of the Company due September 29, 2018, in the aggregate principal amount of $16 million. The Notes were issued in a private placement only to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The net proceeds from the offering of Notes are intended to be used to fund new portfolio investments, reduce outstanding borrowings on the Companys Facility and for general corporate purposes, including the payment of interest, fees or distributions to shareholders.

If Securities of a series are issuable as Bearer Securities, any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided by this Indenture to be given or taken by Holders of Securities of such series may, alternatively, be embodied in and evidenced by the record of Holders of Securities of such series voting in favor thereof, either in person or by proxies duly appointed in writing, at any meeting of Holders of Securities of such series duly called and held in accordance with the provisions of Article Fifteen, or a combination of such instruments and any such record. Except as herein otherwise expressly provided, such action shall become effective when such instrument or instruments or record or both are delivered to the Trustee and, where it is hereby expressly required, to the Company. Such instrument or instruments and any such record (and the action embodied therein and evidenced thereby) are herein sometimes referred to as the "Act" of the Holders signing such instrument or instruments or so voting at any such meeting.

Where such execution is by a signer acting in a capacity other than his individual capacity, such certificate or affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of his authority. The fact and date of the execution of any such instrument or writing, or the authority of the Person executing the same, may also be proved in any other manner that the Trustee deems reasonably sufficient.

The Trustee and the Company may assume that such ownership of any Bearer Security continues until (1) another certificate or affidavit bearing a later date issued in respect of the same Bearer Security is produced, or (2) such Bearer Security is produced to the Trustee by some other Person, or (3) such Bearer Security is surrendered in exchange for a Registered Security, or (4) such Bearer Security is no longer Outstanding. The ownership of Bearer Securities may also be proved in any other manner that the Trustee deems reasonably sufficient.
(e) If the Company shall solicit from the Holders of Registered Securities any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act, the Company may, at its option, in or pursuant to a Board Resolution, fix in advance a record date for the determination of Holders entitled to give such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act, but the Company shall have no obligation to do so. Notwithstanding TIA Section 316(c), such record date shall be the record date specified in or pursuant to such Board Resolution, which shall be a date not earlier than the date 30 days prior to the first solicitation of Holders generally in connection therewith and not later than the date such solicitation is completed. If such a record date is fixed, such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act may be given before or after such record date, but only the Holders of record at the close of business on such record date shall be deemed to be Holders for the purposes of determining whether Holders of the requisite proportion of Outstanding Securities have authorized or agreed or consented to such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act, and for that purpose the Outstanding Securities shall be computed as of such record date; that no such authorization, agreement or consent by the Holders on such record date shall be deemed effective unless it shall become effective pursuant to the provisions of this Indenture not later than eleven months after the record date.
provided
(f) Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act of the Holder of any Security shall bind every future Holder of the same Security and the Holder of every Security issued upon the registration of transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof in respect of anything done, omitted or suffered to be done by the Trustee, any Security Registrar, any Paying Agent, any Authenticating Agent or the Company in reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such action is made upon such Security.

Any notice mailed to a Holder in the manner herein prescribed shall be conclusively deemed to have been received by such Holder, whether or not such Holder actually receives such notice.
If by reason of the suspension of or irregularities in regular mail service or by reason of any other cause it shall be impracticable to give such notice by mail, then such notification to Holders of Registered Securities as shall be made with the approval of the Trustee shall constitute a sufficient notification to such Holders for every purpose hereunder.

If by reason of the suspension of publication of any Authorized Newspaper or Authorized Newspapers or by reason of any other cause it shall be impracticable to publish any notice to Holders of Bearer Securities as provided above, then such notification to Holders of Bearer Securities as shall be given with the approval of the Trustee shall constitute sufficient notice to such Holders for every purpose hereunder. Neither the failure to give notice by publication to Holders of Bearer Securities as provided above, nor any defect in any notice so published, shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders of Bearer Securities or the sufficiency of any notice to Holders of Registered Securities given as provided herein.
Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent or waiver required or permitted under this Indenture shall be in the English language, except that any published notice may be in an official language of the country of publication.
Where this Indenture provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by the Person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by Holders shall be filed with the Trustee, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver.

The Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto shall be executed on behalf of the Company by its Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, or its President or one of its Vice Presidents, under its corporate seal reproduced thereon, and attested by its Secretary or one of its Assistant Secretaries. The signature of any of these officers on the Securities and coupons may be manual or facsimile signatures of the present or any future such authorized officer and may be imprinted or otherwise reproduced on the Securities.
Securities or coupons bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of individuals who were at any time the proper officers of the Company shall bind the Company, notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them have ceased to hold such offices prior to the authentication and delivery of such Securities or did not hold such offices at the date of such Securities or coupons.
At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this Indenture, the Company may deliver Securities of any series, together with any coupon appertaining thereto, executed by the Company, to the Trustee for authentication, together with a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of such Securities, and the Trustee in accordance with the Company Order shall authenticate and deliver such Securities; , , that, in connection with its original issuance, no Bearer Security shall be mailed or otherwise delivered to any location in the United States; and that, unless otherwise specified with respect to any series of Securities pursuant to Section 3.01, a Bearer Security may be delivered in connection with its original issuance only if the Person entitled to receive such Bearer Security

shall have furnished a certificate in the form set forth in Exhibit A-1 to this Indenture or such other certificate as may be specified with respect to any series of Securities pursuant to Section 3.01, dated no earlier than 15 days prior to the earlier of the date on which such Bearer Security is delivered and the date on which any temporary Security first becomes exchangeable for such Bearer Security in accordance with the terms of such temporary Security and this Indenture. If any Security shall be represented by a permanent global Bearer Security, then, for purposes of this Section and Section 3.04, the notation of a beneficial owner's interest therein upon original issuance of such Security or upon exchange of a portion of a temporary global Security shall be deemed to be delivery in connection with its original issuance of such beneficial owner's interest in such permanent global Security. Except as permitted by Section 3.06, the Trustee shall not authenticate and deliver any Bearer Security unless all appurtenant coupons for interest then matured have been detached and cancelled. If all the Securities of any series are not to be issued at one time and if the Board Resolution or supplemental indenture establishing such series shall so permit, such Company Order may set forth procedures acceptable to the Trustee for the issuance of such Securities and determining the terms of particular Securities of such series, such as interest rate, maturity date, date of issuance and date from which interest shall accrue. In authenticating such Securities, and accepting the additional responsibilities under this Indenture in relation to such Securities, the Trustee shall receive, and (subject to TIA Section 315(a) through 315(d)) shall be fully protected in relying upon,
(a) an Opinion of Counsel stating,
(i) that the form or forms of such Securities and any coupons have been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture;
(ii) that the terms of such Securities and any coupons have been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture; and
(iii) that such Securities, together with any coupons appertaining thereto, when completed by appropriate insertions and executed and delivered by the Company to the Trustee for authentication in accordance with this Indenture, authenticated and delivered by the Trustee in accordance with this Indenture and issued by the Company in the manner and subject to any conditions specified in such Opinion of Counsel, will constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization and other similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights, to general equitable principles and to such other qualifications as such counsel shall conclude do not materially affect the rights of Holders of such Securities and any coupons.
(b) an Officers' Certificate stating, to the best of the knowledge of the signers of such certificate, that no Event of Default with respect to any of the Securities shall have occurred and be continuing;
 
(c) a copy of the Board Resolutions pursuant to which the terms and form of the Securities were established; and
(d) an executed supplemental indenture, if any.
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3.01 and of this Section 3.03, if all the Securities of any series are not to be issued at one time, it shall not be necessary to deliver an Officers' Certificate otherwise required pursuant to Section 3.01 or the Company Order, Opinion of Counsel or Officers' Certificate otherwise required pursuant to the preceding paragraph at the time of issuance of each Security of such series, but such order, opinion and certificates, with appropriate modifications to cover such future issuances, shall be delivered at or before the time of issuance of the first Security of such series.
If such form or terms have been so established, the Trustee shall not be required to authenticate such Securities if the issue of such Securities pursuant to this Indenture will affect the Trustee's own rights, duties, obligations or immunities under the Securities and this Indenture or otherwise in a manner which is not reasonably acceptable to the Trustee. Notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, the Trustee will not be required to authenticate Securities denominated in a Foreign Currency if the Trustee reasonably believes that it would be unable to perform its duties with respect to such Securities.
Each Security shall be dated the date of its authentication.
No Security or coupon shall be entitled to any benefit under this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless there appears on such Security or Security to which such coupon appertains a certificate of authentication substantially in the form provided for herein duly executed by the Trustee or an Authenticating Agent by manual signature of an authorized signatory, and such certificate upon any Security shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Security has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder and is entitled to the benefits of this Indenture. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Security shall have been authenticated and delivered hereunder but never issued and sold by the Company, and the Company shall deliver such Security to the Trustee for cancellation as provided in Section 3.10 together with a written statement (which need not comply with Section 1.02 and need not be accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel) stating that such Security has never been issued and sold by the Company, for all purposes of this Indenture such Security shall be deemed never to have been authenticated and delivered hereunder and shall never be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture.
Section 3.04. Temporary Securities.
(a) Pending the preparation of definitive Securities of any series, the Company may execute, and upon Company Order the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver,
 
temporary Securities which are printed, lithographed, typewritten, mimeographed or otherwise produced, in any authorized denomination, substantially of the tenor of the definitive Securities in lieu of which they are issued, in registered form, or, if authorized, in bearer form with one or more coupons or without coupons, and with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as the officers executing such Securities may determine, as conclusively evidenced by their execution of such Securities. In the case of Securities of any series, such temporary Securities may be in global form.
Except in the case of temporary Securities in global form (which shall be exchanged in accordance with Section 3.04(b) or as otherwise provided in or pursuant to a Board Resolution), if temporary Securities of any series are issued, the Company will cause definitive Securities of that series to be prepared without unreasonable delay. After the preparation of definitive Securities of such series, the temporary Securities of such series shall be exchangeable for definitive Securities of such series upon surrender of the temporary Securities of such series at the office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment for that series, without charge to the Holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Securities of any series (accompanied by any non-matured coupons appertaining thereto), the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a like principal amount and like tenor of definitive Securities of the same series of authorized denominations; , , that no definitive Bearer Security shall be delivered in exchange for a temporary Registered Security; and that a definitive Bearer Security shall be delivered in exchange for a temporary Bearer Security only in compliance with the conditions set forth in Section 3.03. Until so exchanged, the temporary Securities of any series shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities of such series.

(b) Unless otherwise provided in or pursuant to a Board Resolution, this Section 3.04(b) shall govern the exchange of temporary Securities issued in global form. If temporary Securities of any series are issued in global form, any such temporary global Security shall, unless otherwise provided therein, be delivered to the London office of a depositary or common depositary (the "Common Depositary"), for the benefit of Euroclear and Clearstream, for credit to the respective accounts of the beneficial owners of such Securities (or to such other accounts as they may direct).
Without unnecessary delay but in any event not later than the date specified in, or determined pursuant to the terms of, any such temporary global Security (the "Exchange Date"), the Company shall deliver to the Trustee definitive Securities, in aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of such temporary global Security, executed by the Company. On or after the Exchange Date, such temporary global Security shall be surrendered by the Common Depositary to the Trustee, as the Company's agent for such purpose, or to the Security Registrar, to be exchanged, in whole or from time to time in part, for definitive Securities without charge, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in exchange for each portion of such temporary global Security, an equal aggregate principal amount of definitive Securities of the same series of authorized denominations and of like tenor as the portion of such temporary global Security to be exchanged. The definitive Securities to be delivered in exchange for any such temporary global
 
Security shall be in bearer form, registered form, permanent global bearer form or permanent global registered form, or any combination thereof, as specified as contemplated by Section 3.01, and, if any combination thereof is so specified, as requested by the beneficial owner thereof; , , that, unless otherwise specified in such temporary global Security, upon such presentation by the Common Depositary, such temporary global Security is accompanied by a certificate dated the Exchange Date or a subsequent date and signed by Euroclear as to the portion of such temporary global Security held for its account then to be exchanged and a certificate dated the Exchange Date or a subsequent date and signed by Clearstream as to the portion of such temporary global Security held for its account then to be exchanged, each in the form set forth in Exhibit A-2 to this Indenture or in such other form as may be established pursuant to Section 3.01; and that definitive Bearer Securities shall be delivered in exchange for a portion of a temporary global Security only in compliance with the requirements of Section 3.03.

Unless otherwise specified in such temporary global Security, the interest of a beneficial owner of Securities of a series in a temporary global Security shall be exchanged for definitive Securities of the same series and of like tenor following the Exchange Date when the account holder instructs Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, to request such exchange on his behalf and delivers to Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, a certificate in the form set forth in Exhibit A-1 to this Indenture (or in such other form as may be established pursuant to Section 3.01), dated no earlier than 15 days prior to the Exchange Date, copies of which certificate shall be available from the offices of Euroclear and Clearstream, the Trustee, any Authenticating Agent appointed for such series of Securities and each Paying Agent. Unless otherwise specified in such temporary global Security, any such exchange shall be made free of charge to the beneficial owners of such temporary global Security, except that a Person receiving definitive Securities must bear the cost of insurance, postage, transportation and the like unless such Person takes delivery of such definitive Securities in person at the offices of Euroclear or Clearstream. Definitive Securities in bearer form to be delivered in exchange for any portion of a temporary global Security shall be delivered only outside the United States.
Until exchanged in full as hereinabove provided, the temporary Securities of any series shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities of the same series and of like tenor authenticated and delivered hereunder, except that, unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.01, interest payable on a temporary global Security on an Interest Payment Date for Securities of such series occurring prior to the applicable Exchange Date shall be payable to Euroclear and Clearstream on such Interest Payment Date upon delivery by Euroclear and Clearstream to the Trustee or the applicable Paying Agent of a certificate or certificates in the form set forth in Exhibit A-2 to this Indenture (or in such other forms as may be established pursuant to Section 3.01), for credit without further interest on or after such Interest Payment Date to the respective accounts of Persons who are the beneficial owners of such temporary global Security on such Interest Payment Date and who have each delivered to Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, a certificate dated no earlier than 15 days prior to the Interest Payment Date occurring prior to such Exchange Date in the form set forth as Exhibit A-1 to this Indenture (or in such other forms as may be established pursuant to Section 3.01). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein contained, the
 
certifications made pursuant to this paragraph shall satisfy the certification requirements of the preceding two paragraphs of this Section 3.04(b) and of the third paragraph of Section 3.03 of this Indenture and the interests of the Persons who are the beneficial owners of the temporary global Security with respect to which such certification was made will be exchanged for definitive Securities of the same series and of like tenor on the Exchange Date or the date of certification if such date occurs after the Exchange Date, without further act or deed by such beneficial owners. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, no payments of principal (or premium, if any) or interest, if any, owing with respect to a beneficial interest in a temporary global Security will be made unless and until such interest in such temporary global Security shall have been exchanged for an interest in a definitive Security. Any interest so received by Euroclear and Clearstream and not paid as herein provided shall be returned to the Trustee or the applicable Paying Agent immediately prior to the expiration of two years after such Interest Payment Date in order to be repaid to the Company.
Section 3.05. Registration, Registration of Transfer and Exchange.
The Company shall cause to be kept at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee or in any office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment a register for each series of Securities (the registers maintained in such office or in any such office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment being herein sometimes referred to collectively as the "Security Register") in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company shall provide for the registration of Registered Securities and of transfers of Registered Securities. The Security Register shall be in written form or any other form capable of being converted into written form within a reasonable time. The Trustee, at its Corporate Trust Office, is hereby initially appointed "Security Registrar" for the purpose of registering Registered Securities and transfers of Registered Securities on such Security Register as herein provided, and for facilitating exchanges of temporary global Securities for permanent global Securities or definitive Securities, or both, or of permanent global Securities for definitive Securities, or both, as herein provided. In the event that the Trustee shall cease to be Security Registrar, it shall have the right to examine the Security Register at all reasonable times.
Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Registered Security of any series at any office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment for that series, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Registered Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of a like aggregate principal amount, bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding and containing identical terms and provisions.
At the option of the Holder, Registered Securities of any series may be exchanged for other Registered Securities of the same series, of any authorized denomination or denominations and of a like aggregate principal amount, containing identical terms and provisions, upon surrender of the Registered Securities to be exchanged at any such office or agency. Whenever any Registered Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Registered Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive. Unless otherwise specified with respect to any series of Securities as contemplated by Section 3.01, Bearer Securities may not be issued in exchange for Registered Securities.
 
If (but only if) permitted by the applicable Board Resolution and (subject to Section 3.03) set forth in the applicable Officers' Certificate, or in any indenture supplemental hereto, delivered as contemplated by Section 3.01, at the option of the Holder, Bearer Securities of any series may be exchanged for Registered Securities of the same series of any authorized denominations and of a like aggregate principal amount and tenor, upon surrender of the Bearer Securities to be exchanged at any such office or agency, with all unmatured coupons and all matured coupons in default thereto appertaining. If the Holder of a Bearer Security is unable to produce any such unmatured coupon or coupons or matured coupon or coupons in default, any such permitted exchange may be effected if the Bearer Securities are accompanied by payment in funds acceptable to the Company in an amount equal to the face amount of such missing coupon or coupons, or the surrender of such missing coupon or coupons may be waived by the Company and the Trustee if there is furnished to them such security or indemnity as they may require to save each of them and any Paying Agent harmless. If thereafter the Holder of such Security shall surrender to any Paying Agent any such missing coupon in respect of which such a payment shall have been made, such Holder shall be entitled to receive the amount of such payment; , , that, except as otherwise provided in Section 10.02, interest represented by coupons shall be payable only upon presentation and surrender of those coupons at an office or agency located outside the United States. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in case a Bearer Security of any series is surrendered at any such office or agency in a permitted exchange for a Registered Security of the same series and like tenor after the close of business at such office or agency on (i) any Regular Record Date and before the opening of business at such office or agency on the relevant Interest Payment Date, or (ii) any Special Record Date and before the opening of business at such office or agency on the related proposed date for payment of Defaulted Interest, such Bearer Security shall be surrendered without the coupon relating to such Interest Payment Date or proposed date for payment, as the case may be, and interest or Defaulted Interest, as the case may be, will not be payable on such Interest Payment Date or proposed date for payment, as the case may be, in respect of the Registered Security issued in exchange for such Bearer Security, but will be payable only to the Holder of such coupon when due in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture.

Whenever any Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.01, any permanent global Security shall be exchangeable only as provided in this paragraph. If any beneficial owner of an interest in a permanent global Security is entitled to exchange such interest for Securities of such series and of like tenor and principal amount of another authorized form and denomination, as specified as contemplated by Section 3.01 and that any applicable notice provided in the permanent global Security shall have been given, then without

On or after the earliest date on which such interests may be so exchanged, such permanent global Security shall be surrendered by the Common Depositary or such other depositary as shall be specified in the Company Order with respect thereto to the Trustee, as the Company's agent for such purpose, or to the Security Registrar, to be exchanged, in whole or from time to time in part, for definitive Securities of the same series without charge and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in exchange for each portion of such permanent global Security, an equal aggregate principal amount of definitive Securities of the same series of authorized denominations and of like tenor as the portion of such permanent global Security to be exchanged which, unless the Securities of the series are not issuable both as Bearer Securities and as Registered Securities, in which case the definitive Securities exchanged for the permanent global Security shall be issuable only in the form in which the Securities are issuable, as specified as contemplated by Section 3.01, shall be in the form of Bearer Securities or Registered Securities, or any combination thereof, as shall be specified by the beneficial owner thereof; , , that no such exchanges may occur during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before any selection of Securities to be redeemed and ending on the relevant Redemption Date if the Security for which exchange is requested may be among those selected for redemption; and that no Bearer Security delivered in exchange for a portion of a permanent global Security shall be mailed or otherwise delivered to any location in the United States. If a Registered Security is issued in exchange for any portion of a permanent global Security after the close of business at the office or agency where such exchange occurs on (i) any Regular Record Date and before the opening of business at such office or agency on the relevant Interest Payment Date, or (ii) any Special Record Date and before the opening of business at such office or agency on the related proposed date for payment of Defaulted Interest, interest or Defaulted Interest, as the case may be, will not be payable on such Interest Payment Date or proposed date for payment, as the case may be, in respect of such Registered Security, but will be payable on such Interest Payment Date or proposed date for payment, as the case may be, only to the Person to whom interest in respect of such portion of such permanent global Security is payable in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture.

All Securities issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities shall be valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same debt and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Securities surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange.

No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, but the Company or the Trustee may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, other than exchanges pursuant to Section 3.04, 9.06, 11.07 or 13.05 not involving any transfer.
The Company shall not be required (i) to issue, register the transfer of or exchange any Security if such Security may be among those selected for redemption during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the mailing of a notice of redemption of Securities to be redeemed under Section 11.03 and ending at the close of business on (A) if such Securities are issuable only as Registered Securities, the day of the mailing of the relevant notice of redemption and (B) if such Securities are issuable as Bearer Securities, the day of the first publication of the relevant notice of redemption or, if such Securities are also issuable as Registered Securities and there is no publication, the mailing of the relevant notice of redemption, or (ii) to register the transfer of or exchange any Registered Security so selected for redemption in whole or in part, except, in the case of any Registered Security to be redeemed in part, the portion thereof not to be redeemed, or (iii) to exchange any Bearer Security so selected for redemption except that such a Bearer Security may be exchanged for a Registered Security of that series and like tenor, that such Registered Security shall be simultaneously surrendered for redemption, or (iv) to issue, register the transfer of or exchange any Security which has been surrendered for repayment at the option of the Holder, except the portion, if any, of such Security not to be so repaid.

If there shall be delivered to the Company and to the Trustee (i) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Security or coupon, and (ii) such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them and any agent of either of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company or the Trustee that such Security or coupon has been acquired by a protected purchaser, the Company shall, subject to the following paragraph, execute and upon its request the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Security or in exchange for the Security to which a destroyed, lost or stolen coupon appertains (with all appurtenant coupons not destroyed, lost or stolen), a new Security of the same series and principal amount, containing identical terms and provisions and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding, with coupons corresponding to the coupons, if any, appertaining to such destroyed, lost or stolen Security or to the Security to which such destroyed, lost or stolen coupon appertains.
 
Notwithstanding the provisions of the previous two paragraphs, in case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security or coupon has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security, with coupons corresponding to the coupons, if any, appertaining to such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security or to the Security to which such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen coupon appertains, pay such Security or coupon, as the case may be; , , that payment of principal of (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, on Bearer Securities shall, except as otherwise provided in Section 10.02, be payable only at an office or agency located outside the United States and, unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.01, any interest on Bearer Securities shall be payable only upon presentation and surrender of the coupons appertaining thereto.
provided
however
Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith.
Every new Security of any series with its coupons, if any, issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Security, or in exchange for a Security to which a destroyed, lost or stolen coupon appertains, shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Security and its coupons, if any, or the destroyed, lost or stolen coupon shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities of that series and their coupons, if any, duly issued hereunder.
The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities or coupons.
Section 3.07. Payment of Interest; Interest Rights Preserved; Optional Interest Reset.
(a) Except as otherwise specified with respect to a series of Securities in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.01, interest, if any, on any Registered Security that is payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the Person in whose name that Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest at the office or agency of the Company maintained for such purpose pursuant to Section 10.02; , , that each installment of interest, if any, on any Registered Security may at the Company's option be paid by (i) mailing a check for such interest, payable to or upon the written order of the Person
provided
however
 
entitled thereto pursuant to Section 3.09, to the address of such Person as it appears on the Security Register or (ii) transfer to an account maintained by the payee located in the United States.
Unless otherwise provided as contemplated by Section 3.01 with respect to the Securities of any series, payment of interest, if any, may be made, in the case of a Bearer Security, by transfer to an account maintained by the payee with a bank located outside the United States.
Unless otherwise provided as contemplated by Section 3.01, every permanent global Security will provide that interest, if any, payable on any Interest Payment Date will be paid to each of Euroclear and Clearstream with respect to that portion of such permanent global Security held for its account by the Common Depositary, for the purpose of permitting each of Euroclear and Clearstream to credit the interest, if any, received by it in respect of such permanent global Security to the accounts of the beneficial owners thereof.
In case a Bearer Security of any series is surrendered in exchange for a Registered Security of such series after the close of business (at an office or agency in a Place of Payment for such series) on any Regular Record Date and before the opening of business (at such office or agency) on the next succeeding Interest Payment Date, such Bearer Security shall be surrendered without the coupon relating to such Interest Payment Date and interest will not be payable on such Interest Payment Date in respect of the Registered Security issued in exchange for such Bearer Security, but will be payable only to the Holder of such coupon when due in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture.
Except as otherwise specified with respect to a series of Securities in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.01, any interest on any Registered Security of any series that is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date (herein called "Defaulted Interest") shall forthwith cease to be payable to the registered Holder thereof on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder, and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company, at its election in each case, as provided in clause (1) or (2) below:
(1) The Company may elect to make payment of any Defaulted Interest to the Persons in whose names the Registered Securities of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed in the following manner. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each Registered Security of such series and the date of the proposed payment (which shall not be less than 20 days after such notice is received by the Trustee), and at the same time the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money in the Currency in which the Securities of such series are payable (except as otherwise specified pursuant to Section 3.01 for the Securities of such series and except, if applicable, as provided in Sections 3.12(b), 3.12(d) and 3.12(e)) equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or
 
shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit on or prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this clause provided. Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall be not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of such Special Record Date and, in the name and at the expense of the Company, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder of Registered Securities of such series at his address as it appears in the Security Register not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date. Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor having been mailed as aforesaid, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names the Registered Securities of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on such Special Record Date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the following clause (2). In case a Bearer Security of any series is surrendered at the office or agency in a Place of Payment for such series in exchange for a Registered Security of such series after the close of business at such office or agency on any Special Record Date and before the opening of business at such office or agency on the related proposed date for payment of Defaulted Interest, such Bearer Security shall be surrendered without the coupon relating to such proposed date of payment and Defaulted Interest will not be payable on such proposed date of payment in respect of the Registered Security issued in exchange for such Bearer Security, but will be payable only to the Holder of such coupon when due in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture.
(2) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest on the Registered Securities of any series in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which such Securities may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this clause, such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee.
(b) The provisions of this Section 3.07(b) may be made applicable to any series of Securities pursuant to Section 3.01 (with such modifications, additions or substitutions as may be specified pursuant to such Section 3.01). The interest rate (or the spread or spread multiplier used to calculate such interest rate, if applicable) on any Security of such series may be reset by the Company on the date or dates specified on the face of such Security (each an "Optional Reset Date"). The Company may exercise such option with respect to such Security by notifying the Trustee of such exercise at least 45 but not more than 60 days prior to an Optional Reset Date for such Security. Not later than 40 days prior to each Optional Reset Date, the Trustee shall transmit, in the manner provided for in Section 1.06, to the Holder of any such Security a notice (the "Reset Notice") indicating whether the Company has elected to reset the interest rate (or the spread or spread multiplier used to calculate such interest rate, if applicable), and if so (i) such new interest rate (or such new spread or spread multiplier, if
 
applicable) and (ii) the provisions, if any, for redemption during the period from such Optional Reset Date to the next Optional Reset Date or if there is no such next Optional Reset Date, to the Stated Maturity of such Security (each such period a "Subsequent Interest Period"), including the date or dates on which or the period or periods during which and the price or prices at which such redemption may occur during the Subsequent Interest Period.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, not later than 20 days prior to the Optional Reset Date, the Company may, at its option, revoke the interest rate (or the spread or spread multiplier used to calculate such interest rate, if applicable) provided for in the Reset Notice and establish a higher interest rate (or a spread or spread multiplier providing for a higher interest rate, if applicable) for the Subsequent Interest Period by causing the Trustee to transmit, in the manner provided for in Section 1.06, notice of such higher interest rate (or such higher spread or spread multiplier providing for a higher interest rate, if applicable) to the Holder of such Security. Such notice shall be irrevocable. All Securities with respect to which the interest rate (or the spread or spread multiplier used to calculate such interest rate, if applicable) is reset on an Optional Reset Date, and with respect to which the Holders of such Securities have not tendered such Securities for repayment (or have validly revoked any such tender) pursuant to the next succeeding paragraph, will bear such higher interest rate (or such higher spread or spread multiplier providing for a higher interest rate, if applicable).
The Holder of any such Security will have the option to elect repayment by the Company of the principal of such Security on each Optional Reset Date at a price equal to the principal amount thereof plus interest accrued to such Optional Reset Date. In order to obtain repayment on an Optional Reset Date, the Holder must follow the procedures set forth in Article Thirteen for repayment at the option of Holders except that the period for delivery or notification to the Trustee shall be at least 25 but not more than 35 days prior to such Optional Reset Date and except that, if the Holder has tendered any Security for repayment pursuant to the Reset Notice, the Holder may, by written notice to the Trustee, revoke such tender or repayment until the close of business on the tenth day before such Optional Reset Date.
Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section and Section 3.05, each Security delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Security shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Security.
Section 3.08. Optional Extension of Maturity.
The provisions of this Section 3.08 may be made applicable to any series of Securities pursuant to Section 3.01 (with such modifications, additions or substitutions as may be specified pursuant to such Section 3.01). The Stated Maturity of any Security of such series may be extended at the option of the Company for the period or periods specified on the face of such Security (each an "Extension Period") up to but not beyond the date (the "Final Maturity") set forth on the face of such Security. The Company may exercise such option with respect to any Security by notifying the Trustee of such exercise at least 45 but not more than 60 days prior to
 
the Stated Maturity of such Security in effect prior to the exercise of such option (the "Original Stated Maturity"). If the Company exercises such option, the Trustee shall transmit, in the manner provided for in Section 1.06, to the Holder of such Security not later than 40 days prior to the Original Stated Maturity a notice (the "Extension Notice"), prepared by the Company, indicating (i) the election of the Company to extend the Stated Maturity, (ii) the new Stated Maturity, (iii) the interest rate (or spread, spread multiplier or other formula to calculate such interest rate, if applicable), if any, applicable to the Extension Period and (iv) the provisions, if any, for redemption during such Extension Period. Upon the Trustee's transmittal of the Extension Notice, the Stated Maturity of such Security shall be extended automatically and, except as modified by the Extension Notice and as described in the next paragraph, such Security will have the same terms as prior to the transmittal of such Extension Notice.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, not later than 20 days before the Original Stated Maturity of such Security, the Company may, at its option, revoke the interest rate (or spread, spread multiplier or other formula to calculate such interest rate, if applicable) provided for in the Extension Notice and establish a higher interest rate (or spread, spread multiplier or other formula to calculate such higher interest rate, if applicable) for the Extension Period by causing the Trustee to transmit, in the manner provided for in Section 1.06, notice of such higher interest rate (or spread, spread multiplier or other formula to calculate such interest rate, if applicable) to the Holder of such Security. Such notice shall be irrevocable. All Securities with respect to which the Stated Maturity is extended will bear such higher interest rate.
If the Company extends the Stated Maturity of any Security, the Holder will have the option to elect repayment of such Security by the Company on the Original Stated Maturity at a price equal to the principal amount thereof, plus interest accrued to such date. In order to obtain repayment on the Original Stated Maturity once the Company has extended the Stated Maturity thereof, the Holder must follow the procedures set forth in Article Thirteen for repayment at the option of Holders, except that the period for delivery or notification to the Trustee shall be at least 25 but not more than 35 days prior to the Original Stated Maturity and except that, if the Holder has tendered any Security for repayment pursuant to an Extension Notice, the Holder may by written notice to the Trustee revoke such tender for repayment until the close of business on the tenth day before the Original Stated Maturity.
Section 3.09. Persons Deemed Owners.
Prior to due presentment of a Registered Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name such Registered Security is registered as the owner of such Registered Security for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of (and premium, if any) and (subject to Sections 3.05 and 3.07) interest, if any, on such Registered Security and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Registered Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
 
Title to any Bearer Security and any coupons appertaining thereto shall pass by delivery. The Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the bearer of any Bearer Security and the bearer of any coupon as the absolute owner of such Security or coupon for the purpose of receiving payment thereof or on account thereof and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Security or coupon be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
None of the Company, the Trustee, any Paying Agent or the Security Registrar will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests of a Security in global form or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any global temporary or permanent Security, nothing herein shall prevent the Company, the Trustee, or any agent of the Company or the Trustee, from giving effect to any written certification, proxy or other authorization furnished by any depositary, as a Holder, with respect to such global Security or impair, as between such depositary and owners of beneficial interests in such global Security, the operation of customary practices governing the exercise of the rights of such depositary (or its nominee) as Holder of such global Security.
Section 3.10. Cancellation.
All Securities and coupons surrendered for payment, redemption, repayment at the option of the Holder, registration of transfer or exchange or for credit against any sinking fund payment shall, if surrendered to any Person other than the Trustee, be delivered to the Trustee, and any such Securities and coupons and Securities and coupons surrendered directly to the Trustee for any such purpose shall be promptly cancelled by the Trustee. The Company may at any time deliver to the Trustee for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated and delivered hereunder which the Company may have acquired in any manner whatsoever, and may deliver to the Trustee (or to any other Person for delivery to the Trustee) for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated hereunder which the Company has not issued and sold, and all Securities so delivered shall be promptly cancelled by the Trustee. If the Company shall so acquire any of the Securities, however, such acquisition shall not operate as a redemption or satisfaction of the indebtedness represented by such Securities unless and until the same are surrendered to the Trustee for cancellation. No Securities shall be authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any Securities cancelled as provided in this Section, except as expressly permitted by this Indenture. Cancelled Securities and coupons held by the Trustee shall be cancelled by the Trustee in accordance with its customary procedures, unless by a Company Order the Company directs the Trustee to deliver a certificate of such cancellation to the Company or to return them to the Company.
 
Section 3.11. Computation of Interest.
Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.01 with respect to Securities of any series, interest, if any, on the Securities of each series shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months.
Section 3.12. Currency and Manner of Payments in Respect of Securities.
(a) Unless otherwise specified with respect to any Securities pursuant to Section 3.01, with respect to Registered Securities of any series not permitting the election provided for in paragraph (b) below or the Holders of which have not made the election provided for in paragraph (b) below, and with respect to Bearer Securities of any series, except as provided in paragraph (d) below, payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, on any Registered or Bearer Security of such series will be made in the Currency in which such Registered Security or Bearer Security, as the case may be, is payable. The provisions of this Section 3.12 may be modified or superseded with respect to any Securities pursuant to Section 3.01.
(b) It may be provided pursuant to Section 3.01 with respect to Registered Securities of any series that Holders shall have the option, subject to paragraphs (d) and (e) below, to receive payments of principal of (or premium, if any) or interest, if any, on such Registered Securities in any of the Currencies which may be designated for such election by delivering to the Trustee for such series of Registered Securities a written election with signature guarantees and in the applicable form established pursuant to Section 3.01, not later than the close of business on the Election Date immediately preceding the applicable payment date. If a Holder so elects to receive such payments in any such Currency, such election will remain in effect for such Holder or any transferee of such Holder until changed by such Holder or such transferee by written notice to the Trustee for such series of Registered Securities (but any such change must be made not later than the close of business on the Election Date immediately preceding the next payment date to be effective for the payment to be made on such payment date and no such change of election may be made with respect to payments to be made on any Registered Security of such series with respect to which an Event of Default has occurred or with respect to which the Company has deposited funds pursuant to Article Four or Fourteen or with respect to which a notice of redemption has been given by the Company or a notice of option to elect repayment has been sent by such Holder or such transferee). Any Holder of any such Registered Security who shall not have delivered any such election to the Trustee of such series of Registered Securities not later than the close of business on the applicable Election Date will be paid the amount due on the applicable payment date in the relevant Currency as provided in Section 3.12(a). The Trustee for each such series of Registered Securities shall notify the Exchange Rate Agent as soon as practicable after the Election Date of the aggregate principal amount of Registered Securities for which Holders have made such written election.
(c) Unless otherwise specified pursuant to Section 3.01, if the election referred to in paragraph (b) above has been provided for pursuant to Section 3.01, then, unless otherwise specified pursuant to Section 3.01, not later than the fourth Business Day after the Election Date for each payment date for Registered Securities of any series, the Exchange Rate
 
Agent will deliver to the Company a written notice specifying the Currency in which Registered Securities of such series are payable, the respective aggregate amounts of principal of (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, on the Registered Securities to be paid on such payment date, specifying the amounts in such Currency so payable in respect of the Registered Securities as to which the Holders of Registered Securities denominated in any Currency shall have elected to be paid in another Currency as provided in paragraph (b) above. If the election referred to in paragraph (b) above has been provided for pursuant to Section 3.01 and if at least one Holder has made such election, then, unless otherwise specified pursuant to Section 3.01, on the second Business Day preceding such payment date the Company will deliver to the Trustee for such series of Registered Securities an Exchange Rate Officer's Certificate in respect of the Dollar or Foreign Currency or Currencies payments to be made on such payment date. Unless otherwise specified pursuant to Section 3.01, the Dollar or Foreign Currency or Currencies amount receivable by Holders of Registered Securities who have elected payment in a Currency as provided in paragraph (b) above shall be determined by the Company on the basis of the applicable Market Exchange Rate in effect on the second Business Day (the "Valuation Date") immediately preceding each payment date, and such determination shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.
(d) If a Conversion Event occurs with respect to a Foreign Currency in which any of the Securities are denominated or payable other than pursuant to an election provided for pursuant to paragraph (b) above, then with respect to each date for the payment of principal of (and premium, if any) and interest, if any on the applicable Securities denominated or payable in such Foreign Currency occurring after the last date on which such Foreign Currency was used (the "Conversion Date"), the Dollar shall be the currency of payment for use on each such payment date. Unless otherwise specified pursuant to Section 3.01, the Dollar amount to be paid by the Company to the Trustee of each such series of Securities and by such Trustee or any Paying Agent to the Holders of such Securities with respect to such payment date shall be, in the case of a Foreign Currency other than a currency unit, the Dollar Equivalent of the Foreign Currency or, in the case of a currency unit, the Dollar Equivalent of the Currency Unit, in each case as determined by the Exchange Rate Agent in the manner provided in paragraph (f) or (g) below.
(e) Unless otherwise specified pursuant to Section 3.01, if the Holder of a Registered Security denominated in any Currency shall have elected to be paid in another Currency as provided in paragraph (b) above, and a Conversion Event occurs with respect to such elected Currency, such Holder shall receive payment in the Currency in which payment would have been made in the absence of such election; and if a Conversion Event occurs with respect to the Currency in which payment would have been made in the absence of such election, such Holder shall receive payment in Dollars as provided in paragraph (d) of this Section 3.12.
(f) The "Dollar Equivalent of the Foreign Currency" shall be determined by the Exchange Rate Agent and shall be obtained for each subsequent payment date by converting the specified Foreign Currency into Dollars at the Market Exchange Rate on the Conversion Date.
 
(g) The "Dollar Equivalent of the Currency Unit" shall be determined by the Exchange Rate Agent and subject to the provisions of paragraph (h) below shall be the sum of each amount obtained by converting the Specified Amount of each Component Currency into Dollars at the Market Exchange Rate for such Component Currency on the Valuation Date with respect to each payment.
(h) For purposes of this Section 3.12, the following terms shall have the following meanings:
A "" shall mean any currency which, on the Conversion Date, was a component currency of the relevant currency unit, including, but not limited to, the Euro.
Component Currency
A "" of a Component Currency shall mean the number of units of such Component Currency or fractions thereof which were represented in the relevant currency unit, including, but not limited to, the Euro, on the Conversion Date. If after the Conversion Date the official unit of any Component Currency is altered by way of combination or subdivision, the Specified Amount of such Component Currency shall be divided or multiplied in the same proportion. If after the Conversion Date two or more Component Currencies are consolidated into a single currency, the respective Specified Amounts of such Component Currencies shall be replaced by an amount in such single currency equal to the sum of the respective Specified Amounts of such consolidated Component Currencies expressed in such single currency, and such amount shall thereafter be a Specified Amount and such single currency shall thereafter be a Component Currency. If after the Conversion Date any Component Currency shall be divided into two or more currencies, the Specified Amount of such Component Currency shall be replaced by amounts of such two or more currencies, having an aggregate Dollar Equivalent value at the Market Exchange Rate on the date of such replacement equal to the Dollar Equivalent of the Specified Amount of such former Component Currency at the Market Exchange Rate immediately before such division, and such amounts shall thereafter be Specified Amounts and such currencies shall thereafter be Component Currencies. If, after the Conversion Date of the relevant currency unit, including, but not limited to, the Euro, a Conversion Event (other than any event referred to above in this definition of "Specified Amount") occurs with respect to any Component Currency of such currency unit and is continuing on the applicable Valuation Date, the Specified Amount of such Component Currency shall, for purposes of calculating the Dollar Equivalent of the Currency Unit, be converted into Dollars at the Market Exchange Rate in effect on the Conversion Date of such Component Currency.
Specified Amount
An "" shall mean the Regular Record Date for the applicable series of Registered Securities or at least 16 days prior to Maturity, as the case may be, or such other prior date for any series of Registered Securities as specified pursuant to clause 13 of Section 3.01 by which the written election referred to in Section 3.12(b) may be made.
Election Date
 
All decisions and determinations of the Exchange Rate Agent regarding the Dollar Equivalent of the Foreign Currency, the Dollar Equivalent of the Currency Unit, the Market Exchange Rate and changes in the Specified Amounts as specified above shall be in its sole discretion and shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive for all purposes and irrevocably binding upon the Company, the Trustee for the appropriate series of Securities and all Holders of such Securities denominated or payable in the relevant Currency. The Exchange Rate Agent shall promptly give written notice to the Company and the Trustee for the appropriate series of Securities of any such decision or determination.
In the event that the Company determines in good faith that a Conversion Event has occurred with respect to a Foreign Currency, the Company will immediately give written notice thereof to the Trustee of the appropriate series of Securities and to the Exchange Rate Agent (and such Trustee will promptly thereafter give notice in the manner provided in Section 1.06 to the affected Holders) specifying the Conversion Date. In the event the Company so determines that a Conversion Event has occurred with respect to the Euro or any other currency unit in which Securities are denominated or payable, the Company will immediately give written notice thereof to the Trustee of the appropriate series of Securities and to the Exchange Rate Agent (and such Trustee will promptly thereafter give notice in the manner provided in Section 1.06 to the affected Holders) specifying the Conversion Date and the Specified Amount of each Component Currency on the Conversion Date. In the event the Company determines in good faith that any subsequent change in any Component Currency as set forth in the definition of Specified Amount above has occurred, the Company will similarly give written notice to the Trustee of the appropriate series of Securities and to the Exchange Rate Agent.
The Trustee of the appropriate series of Securities shall be fully justified and protected in relying and acting upon information received by it from the Company and the Exchange Rate Agent and shall not otherwise have any duty or obligation to determine the accuracy or validity of such information independent of the Company or the Exchange Rate Agent.
Section 3.13. Appointment and Resignation of Successor Exchange Rate Agent.
(a) Unless otherwise specified pursuant to Section 3.01, if and so long as the Securities of any series (i) are denominated in a Foreign Currency or (ii) may be payable in a Foreign Currency, or so long as it is required under any other provision of this Indenture, then the Company will maintain with respect to each such series of Securities, or as so required, at least one Exchange Rate Agent. The Company will cause the Exchange Rate Agent to make the necessary foreign exchange determinations at the time and in the manner specified pursuant to Section 3.01 for the purpose of determining the applicable rate of exchange and, if applicable, for the purpose of converting the issued Foreign Currency into the applicable payment Currency for the payment of principal (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, pursuant to Section 3.12.
(b) No resignation of the Exchange Rate Agent and no appointment of a successor Exchange Rate Agent pursuant to this Section shall become effective until the acceptance of appointment by the successor Exchange Rate Agent as evidenced by a written instrument delivered to the Company and the Trustee of the appropriate series of Securities accepting such appointment executed by the successor Exchange Rate Agent.
 
(c) If the Exchange Rate Agent shall resign, be removed or become incapable of acting, or if a vacancy shall occur in the office of the Exchange Rate Agent for any cause, with respect to the Securities of one or more series, the Company, by or pursuant to a Board Resolution, shall promptly appoint a successor Exchange Rate Agent or Exchange Rate Agents with respect to the Securities of that or those series (it being understood that any such successor Exchange Rate Agent may be appointed with respect to the Securities of one or more or all of such series and that, unless otherwise specified pursuant to Section 3.01, at any time there shall only be one Exchange Rate Agent with respect to the Securities of any particular series that are originally issued by the Company on the same date and that are initially denominated and/or payable in the same Currency).
Section 3.14. CUSIP Numbers.
The Company in issuing the Securities may use "CUSIP" numbers (if then generally in use), and, if so, the Trustee shall indicate the respective "CUSIP" numbers of the Securities in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders; that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any notice of redemption and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Securities, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. The Company shall advise the Trustee as promptly as practicable in writing of any change in the CUSIP numbers.

Section 5.02. Acceleration of Maturity; Rescission and Annulment.
If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of any series at the time Outstanding occurs and is continuing, then and in every such case the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series may declare the principal (or, if any Securities are Original Issue Discount Securities or Indexed Securities, such portion of the principal as may be specified in the terms thereof) of all the Securities of that series to be due and payable immediately, by a notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by the Holders), and upon any such declaration such principal or specified portion thereof shall become immediately due and payable.
At any time after such a declaration of acceleration with respect to Securities of any series has been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee as hereinafter provided in this Article, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series, by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if:
(1) the Company has paid or deposited with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay in the Currency in which the Securities of such series are payable (except as otherwise specified pursuant to Section 3.01 for the Securities of such series and except, if applicable, as provided in Sections 3.12(b), 3.12(d) and 3.12(e)):
 
(A) all overdue installments of interest, if any, on all Outstanding Securities of that series and any related coupons,

(D) all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee hereunder and the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel; and
(2) all Events of Default with respect to Securities of that series, other than the nonpayment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on Securities of that series which have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in Section 5.13.
No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.
Section 5.03. Collection of Indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement by Trustee.
The Company covenants that if:
(1) default is made in the payment of any installment of interest on any Security of any series and any related coupon when such interest becomes due and payable and such default continues for a period of 30 days, or
 
(2) default is made in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) any Security of any series at its Maturity, then the Company will, upon demand of the Trustee, pay to the Trustee, for the benefit of the Holders of Securities of such series and coupons, the whole amount then due and payable on such Securities and coupons for principal (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, with interest upon any overdue principal (and premium, if any) and, to the extent that payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable, upon any overdue installments of interest, if any, at the rate or rates borne by or provided for in such Securities, and, in addition thereto, such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel.
If the Company fails to pay such amounts forthwith upon such demand, the Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, may institute a judicial proceeding for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, and may prosecute such proceeding to judgment or final decree, and may enforce the same against the Company or any other obligor upon Securities of such series and collect the moneys adjudged or decreed to be payable in the manner provided by law out of the property of the Company or any other obligor upon such Securities of such series, wherever situated.
If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of any series occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series and any related coupons by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy.
Section 5.04. Trustee May File Proofs of Claim.
In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial proceeding relative to the Company or any other obligor upon the Securities or the property of the Company or of such other obligor or their creditors, the Trustee (irrespective of whether the principal of the Securities of any series shall then be due and payable as therein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Trustee shall have made any demand on the Company for the payment of any overdue principal, premium or interest) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise:
(i) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of principal (or in the case of Original Issue Discount Securities or Indexed Securities, such portion of the principal as may be provided for in the terms thereof) (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, owing and unpaid in respect of the Securities and to file such other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel) and of the Holders allowed in such judicial proceeding, and
 
(ii) to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;
and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator (or other similar official) in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder of Securities of such series and coupons to make such payments to the Trustee, and in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due to it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee and any predecessor Trustee, their agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee or any predecessor Trustee under Section 6.06.
Subject to Article Eight and Section 9.02 and unless otherwise provided as contemplated by Section 3.01, nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder of a Security or coupon any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities or coupons or the rights of any Holder thereof, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder of a Security or coupon in any such proceeding.

Section 5.11. Delay or Omission Not Waiver.
No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Holder of any Security or coupon to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any Event of Default shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence therein. Every right and remedy given by this Article or by law to the Trustee or to the Holders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as may be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by the Holders of Securities or coupons, as the case may be.

If any such withholding shall be required, then such Officers' Certificate shall specify by country the amount, if any, required to be withheld on such payments to such Holders of Securities of that series or related coupons and the Company will pay to the Trustee or such Paying Agent the Additional
 
Amounts required by the terms of such Securities. In the event that the Trustee or any Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall not so receive the above-mentioned certificate, then the Trustee or such Paying Agent shall be entitled (i) to assume that no such withholding or deduction is required with respect to any payment of principal or interest with respect to any Securities of a series or related coupons until it shall have received a certificate advising otherwise and (ii) to make all payments of principal and interest with respect to the Securities of a series or related coupons without withholding or deductions until otherwise advised.

Section 14.01. Applicability of Article; Company's Option to Effect Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance.
If pursuant to Section 3.01 provision is made for either or both of (a) defeasance of the Securities of or within a series under Section 14.02 or (b) covenant defeasance of the Securities of or within a series under Section 14.03, then the provisions of such Section or Sections, as the case may be, together with the other provisions of this Article (with such modifications thereto as may be specified pursuant to Section 3.01 with respect to any Securities), shall be applicable to such Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto, and the Company may at its option by Board Resolution, at any time, with respect to such Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto, elect to have either Section 14.02 (if applicable) or Section 14.03 (if applicable) be applied to such Outstanding Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto upon compliance with the conditions set forth below in this Article.
Section 14.02. Defeasance and Discharge.
Upon the Company's exercise of the above option applicable to this Section with respect to any Securities of or within a series, the Company shall be deemed to have been discharged from its obligations with respect to such Outstanding Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto on and after the date the conditions set forth in Section 14.04 are satisfied (hereinafter, "defeasance"). For this purpose, such defeasance means that the Company shall be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire indebtedness represented by such Outstanding Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto, which shall thereafter be deemed to be "Outstanding" only for the purposes of Section 14.05 and the other Sections of this Indenture referred to in clauses (A) and (B) of this Section, and to have satisfied all its other obligations under such Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto and this Indenture insofar as such Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto are concerned (and the Trustee, at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging the same), except for the following which shall survive until otherwise terminated or discharged hereunder: (A) the rights of Holders of such
 
Outstanding Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto to receive, solely from the trust fund described in Section 14.04 and as more fully set forth in such Section, payments in respect of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, on such Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto when such payments are due, (B) the Company's obligations with respect to such Securities under Sections 3.05, 3.06, 10.02 and 10.03 and with respect to the payment of Additional Amounts, if any, on such Securities as contemplated by Section 10.04, (C) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee hereunder and (D) this Article. Subject to compliance with this Article Fourteen, the Company may exercise its option under this Section notwithstanding the prior exercise of its option under Section 14.03 with respect to such Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto. Following a defeasance, payment of such Securities may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default.
Section 14.03. Covenant Defeasance.
Upon the Company's exercise of the above option applicable to this Section with respect to any Securities of or within a series, the Company shall be released from its obligations under Section 10.06, and, if specified pursuant to Section 3.01, its obligations under any other covenant, with respect to such Outstanding Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto on and after the date the conditions set forth in Section 14.04 are satisfied (hereinafter, "covenant defeasance"), and such Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto shall thereafter be deemed to be not "Outstanding" for the purposes of any direction, waiver, consent or declaration or Act of Holders (and the consequences of any thereof) in connection with Section 10.06, or such other covenant, but shall continue to be deemed "Outstanding" for all other purposes hereunder. For this purpose, such covenant defeasance means that, with respect to such Outstanding Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto, the Company may omit to comply with and shall have no liability in respect of any term, condition or limitation set forth in any such Section or such other covenant, whether directly or indirectly, by reason of any reference elsewhere herein to any such Section or such other covenant or by reason of reference in any such Section or such other covenant to any other provision herein or in any other document and such omission to comply shall not constitute a Default or an Event of Default under Section 5.01(4) or 5.01(7) or otherwise, as the case may be, but, except as specified above, the remainder of this Indenture and such Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto shall be unaffected thereby. Following a covenant defeasance, payment of such Securities may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default solely by reference to such Sections specified above in this Section 15.03.

(e) In the case of an election under Section 14.03, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the Holders of such Outstanding Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto will not recognize income, gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of such covenant defeasance and will be subject to Federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such covenant defeasance had not occurred.

Section 14.05. Deposited Money and Government Obligations to Be Held in Trust; Other Miscellaneous Provisions.
Subject to the provisions of the last paragraph of Section 10.03, all money and Government Obligations (or other property as may be provided pursuant to Section 3.01) (including the proceeds thereof) deposited with the Trustee (or other qualifying trustee, collectively for purposes of this Section 14.05, the "Trustee") pursuant to Section 14.04 in respect of any Outstanding Securities of any series and any coupons appertaining thereto shall be held in trust and applied by the Trustee, in accordance with the provisions of such Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any Paying Agent (including the Company acting as its own Paying Agent) as the Trustee may determine, to the Holders of such Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto of all sums due and to become due thereon in respect of principal (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, but such money need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law.
Unless otherwise specified with respect to any Security pursuant to Section 3.01, if, after a deposit referred to in Section 14.04(a) has been made, (a) the Holder of a Security in respect of which such deposit was made is entitled to, and does, elect pursuant to Section 3.12(b) or the terms of such Security to receive payment in a Currency other than that in which the deposit pursuant to Section 14.04(a) has been made in respect of such Security, or (b) a Conversion Event occurs as contemplated in Section 3.12(d) or 3.12(e) or by the terms of any Security in respect of which the deposit pursuant to Section 14.04(a) has been made, the indebtedness represented by such Security and any coupons appertaining thereto shall be deemed to have been, and will be, fully discharged and satisfied through the payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, on such Security as the same becomes due out of the proceeds yielded by converting (from time to time as specified below in the case of any such election) the amount
 
or other property deposited in respect of such Security into the Currency in which such Security becomes payable as a result of such election or Conversion Event based on the applicable Market Exchange Rate for such Currency in effect on the second Business Day prior to each payment date, except, with respect to a Conversion Event, for such Currency in effect (as nearly as feasible) at the time of the Conversion Event.
The Company shall pay and indemnify the Trustee against any tax, fee or other charge imposed on or assessed against the money or Government Obligations deposited pursuant to Section 14.04 or the principal and interest received in respect thereof other than any such tax, fee or other charge which by law is for the account of the Holders of such Outstanding Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto.
Anything in this Article to the contrary notwithstanding, the Trustee shall deliver or pay to the Company from time to time upon Company Request any money or Government Obligations (or other property and any proceeds therefrom) held by it as provided in Section 14.04 which, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, are in excess of the amount thereof which would then be required to be deposited to effect a defeasance or covenant defeasance, as applicable, in accordance with this Article.

Nothing in this Article Sixteen shall apply to claims of, or payments to, the Trustee under or pursuant to Section 6.06.
 
Section 16.08. Modifications of Terms of Senior Indebtedness.
Any renewal or extension of the time of payment of any Senior Indebtedness or the exercise by the holders of Senior Indebtedness of any of their rights under any instrument creating or evidencing Senior Indebtedness, including, without limitation, the waiver of default thereunder, may be made or done all without notice to or assent from the Holders of the Subordinated Securities or the Trustee.

New York, NY  February 6, 2013Apollo Investment Corporation (NASDAQ: AINV) or the "Company," or "Apollo Investment," today announced financial results for its third fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2012. The Company's net investment income was $0.21 per share for the quarter ended December 31, 2012 compared to $0.22 for the quarter ended September 30, 2012. The Company's net asset value ("NAV") was $8.14 per share as of December 31, 2012 down from $8.46 at September 30, 2012. The decline in NAV was driven primarily by losses on two investments partially offset by appreciation on the remainder of the portfolio.
Additionally, the Company also announced that its Board of Directors has declared a dividend of $0.20 per share for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2013, payable on April 4, 2013 to stockholders of record as of March 21, 2013. The specific tax characteristics of this dividend will be reported to stockholders on Form 1099 after the end of the calendar year.
Mr. James Zelter, Apollo Investment Corporation's Chief Executive Officer, said, "We had our third highest origination quarter and we continued to sell select investments given the strength in the credit markets in the December quarter. Since we announced a variety of strategic initiatives one year ago, we believe we have made great strides in accomplishing many of our objectives including the migration of our portfolio to a greater amount of secured debt, renewing our credit facility on favorable terms, diversifying our funding sources with the issuance of unsecured debt, and expanding our specialist sourcing capabilities. Looking ahead, we will continue to focus on diversifying into additional investment strategies with attractive risk adjusted returns."

We have also assumed that the terms of the Notes have been established so as not to, and that the execution and delivery by the Company of the Transaction Agreements and the performance by the Company of its obligations thereunder, do not and will not violate, conflict with or constitute a default under (i) any agreement or instrument to which the Company or any of its properties are subject, (ii) any law, rule, or regulation to which the Company or any of its properties are subject (except that we do not make the assumption set forth in this clause (ii) with respect to the Opined-on Law (as defined below)), (iii) any judicial or regulatory order or decree of any governmental authority or (iv) any consent, approval, license, authorization or validation of, or filing, recording or registration with, any governmental authority. As to any facts material to the opinion expressed herein that we did not independently establish or verify, we have relied upon statements and representations of officers and other representatives of the Company and others and of public officials.
Our opinions set forth herein are limited to those laws of the State of New York that, in our experience, are normally applicable to transactions of the type contemplated by the Registration Statement and, to the extent that judicial or regulatory orders or decrees or consents, approvals, licenses, authorizations, validations, filings, recordings or registrations with governmental authorities are relevant, to those required under such laws (all of the foregoing being referred to as ""). We do not express any opinion with respect to the law of any jurisdiction other than Opined-on Law or as to the effect of any such non-Opined-on Law on the opinions herein stated.
Opined-on Law
Based upon the foregoing and subject to the limitations, qualifications, exceptions and assumptions set forth herein, we are of the opinion that:
1. Assuming the Notes are duly authenticated by the Trustee and issued and delivered by the Company against payment therefor in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture and the Second Supplemental Indenture, the Notes will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company, entitled to the benefits of the Indenture and the Second Supplemental Indenture and enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms.

2. Each of the Indenture and the Second Supplemental Indenture is a valid and binding obligation of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms.

(a) the opinions stated herein are limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer, preference and other similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally, and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in equity or at law); and
(b) to the extent any opinion relates to the enforceability of the choice of New York law and choice of New York forum provisions contained in any Transaction Agreement, our opinions stated herein are rendered solely in reliance upon New York General Obligations Law sections 5-1401 and 5-1402 and Rule 327(b) of New York Civil Practice Law and Rules and are subject to the qualification that such enforceability may be limited by, in each case, the terms of such sections 5-1401 and 5-1402, as well as by principles of public policy, comity or constitutionality.

This opinion is expressed as of the date hereof unless otherwise expressly stated, and we disclaim any undertaking to advise you of any subsequent changes in the facts stated or assumed herein or of any subsequent changes in applicable laws.
