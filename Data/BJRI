Item 8. Change in Fiscal Year
        On May 21, 2002, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a change in the Company's fiscal year end from December 31 to the Sunday closest to December 31 in each year (whether before or after such date) to report operating results using comparable periods always ending on a Sunday and to conform to restaurant industry practices. This change will be effective as of July 1, 2002 for fiscal year 2002, which will end on December 29, 2002. There will be no transition period for such change in fiscal year end due to the fact that the Company's second quarter end is Sunday, June 30, 2002.
        In connection with the change in fiscal year end, the Company will also realign its fiscal quarters. The first, second and third quarters will each consist of 13 weeks (4 weeks for periods 1 and 2 and 5 weeks for period 3). The fourth quarter will typically consist of 13 weeks, except approximately every fifth year it will consist of 14 weeks. The change in quarterly periods is also effective as of July 1, 2002 and the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2002 will include 13 weeks each. The first fiscal year to consist of a 14 week fourth quarter will be fiscal year ending January 2, 2005.
        Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
CHICAGO PIZZA & BREWERY, INC. REPORTS AN $828,000 PROFIT FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2003, AND A 37.0% INCREASE IN REVENUES.
 
Huntington Beach, CA April 29, 2003 - Chicago Pizza & Brewery, Inc. (NASDAQ: CHGO) released results for the first quarter ended March 30, 2003.
 
Highlights for the first quarter of 2003 relative to the same quarter last year were as follows:
 
Revenues increased 37.0% to $23.8 million
 - 
                 
BJ's comparable restaurant sales increased 2.7%
 - 
                 
Net income increased 12.5% to $828,000
 - 
                 
E.P.S. reached $0.04
 - 
                 
New restaurant opened in Clear Lake, Texas
 - 
                 
 
Revenues increased 37.0% to $23.8 million for the first quarter of 2003, from $17.4 million in the first quarter of 2002. The $6.4 million increase is primarily the result of new restaurant openings in Westlake, CA (August 2002), Oxnard, CA (September 2002), Lewisville, TX (November 2002), Cupertino, CA (December 2002) and Clear Lake, TX (January 2003). Also contributing to the revenue growth was an increase in BJ's same store sales of 2.7% for stores opened greater than eighteen months. These increases were partially offset by lower revenues from Pietro's due to two unit closings in February 2002 and the first period of 2003.
 
Net income increased 12.5% to $828,000, or $0.04 per share, in the first quarter of 2003, compared to $736,000, or $0.06 per share, in the same period of 2002. The weighed average diluted shares outstanding were 20,145,000 in the first quarter of 2003 compared to 12,923,000 in prior year period. The increase is primarily related to the exercise of 7,349,000 redeemable warrants in the first half of 2002 that provided $35.9 million in proceeds to the Company.
 
Paul Motenko, Co-CEO of Chicago Pizza & Brewery commented, "We are very pleased with our first quarter performance. Our new locations continue to perform very well. In addition, our overall revenue performance enabled us to leverage the general and administrative infrastructure investments we made in 2002. For the balance of 2003, we expect to open four to five additional BJ's, continue to drive comparable store sales and further leverage our general and administrative infrastructure."
 
The Company expects 2003 earnings per share of $0.21 to $0.23.
 
Chicago Pizza & Brewery, Inc. operates 30 casual dining restaurants, some of which incorporate brewpubs. Nineteen of the restaurants are located in California, with additional locations in Colorado, Arizona and Texas. In addition, the Company operates seven restaurants in Oregon, three of which are Pietro's pizzerias, and has a licensing interest in a BJ's restaurant in Lahaina, Maui.

On February 26, 2004, Chicago Pizza & Brewery, Inc., a California corporation (the "Registrant"), announced its financial results for the fourth quarter ended December 28, 2003. The press release issued by the Registrant in connection with the announcement is attached to this report as Exhibit 99.1.

Exhibit 99.1
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
CHICAGO PIZZA & BREWERY, INC. REPORTS A $3,593,000 PROFIT FOR FISCAL 2003, AND A 36.0% INCREASE IN REVENUES TO $103.0 MILLION
 
Huntington Beach, CA February 26, 2004Chicago Pizza & Brewery, Inc. (NASDAQ: CHGO) released results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 28, 2003.
 
Highlights for the fourth quarter of 2003, relative to the same quarter last year, were as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
 
Revenues totaled $27,008,000 for the fourth quarter of 2003, an increase of 28.7% as compared to the same period of 2002. Revenues increased primarily due to the 2003 openings of restaurants in Clear Lake, Texas, Addison, Texas, Cerritos, California and San Jose, California, as well as a full quarter of operations from restaurants opened during the fourth quarter of 2002 in Lewisville, Texas and Cupertino, California. Also contributing to revenue growth was an increase in BJ's same store sales of 5.1% and an increase in Pietro's same store sales of 2.0% for restaurants opened longer than eighteen months. These increases were partially offset by the closure of the Pietro's restaurant in Portland, Oregon (Lombard Street) during December 2002 and the BJ's Portland, Oregon restaurant (Stark Street) during June 2003.
 
The Company reported net income of $719,000 (or $0.03 diluted earnings per share) for the fourth quarter of 2003 as compared to a net loss of $393,000 (or $0.02 diluted loss per share) for the same period of 2002. Included in fourth quarter 2003 earnings and earnings per share results is a previously announced pre-tax charge of $950,000 for the tentative settlement of a meal and rest period class action case pending in California. The increase in net income quarter over quarter is primarily due to the 28.7% increase in sales combined with a reduction in labor, general and administrative and restaurant opening expenses as a percentage of sales, offset by higher cost of sales and operating expenses as a percentage of sales.
 
Revenues totaled $102,959,000 for fiscal 2003, an increase of 36.0% compared to fiscal 2002. Revenues increased primarily due to the 2003 openings of restaurants in Clear Lake, Texas, Addison, Texas, Cerritos, California and San Jose, California, as well as a full year of operations from restaurants opened during 2002 in Westlake, California, Oxnard, California, Lewisville, Texas and Cupertino, California. Also contributing to revenue growth was an increase in BJ's same store sales of 3.3% and an increase in Pietro's same store sales of 1.7% for restaurants opened greater than eighteen months. These increases were partially offset by the closure of the Pietro's restaurant in Portland, Oregon (Lombard Street) during December 2002 and the BJ's Portland, Oregon restaurant (Stark Street) during June 2003.
 
The Company reported net income of $3,593,000 (or $0.18 diluted earnings per share) for fiscal 2003 as compared to net income of $1,667,000 (or $0.09 diluted earnings per share) for fiscal 2002. Included in the 2003 earnings and earnings per share results is a previously announced pre-tax charge of $950,000 for the
 
tentative settlement of a meal and rest period class action case pending in California, or a net $0.03 per diluted share.
 
Paul Motenko, Co-CEO, commented, "We are pleased with our continued growth in 2003 and our development outlook for 2004 and beyond. We are on track to open 6 to 7 additional locations in 2004 and believe our profitability will continue to improve as our restaurants mature and we better leverage our general and administrative costs. Additionally, we are off to a strong start in 2004 as our comparable store sales have increased over 8% during the first two periods of 2004."
 
2004 Outlook
 
The Company anticipates 2004 revenues to be between $124 million and $128 million and 2004 diluted earnings per share of $0.30 to $0.33, including an approximate $0.05 per share after-tax gain from the sale of all three Pietro's restaurants and related assets. Expectations are based on 6 to 7 new BJ's Restaurant openings in 2004 and comparable restaurant revenue growth of 3.0% to 4.0%. Chicago Pizza & Brewery will have one additional week in fiscal 2004, a 53-week year versus the standard 52-week year, which is reflected in the guidance issued above.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
The following net income and earnings per share calculations before the class action settlement accrual has not been calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. We believe that the presentation of net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share before the class action settlement accrual provides a useful analysis of our ongoing operating trends and helps investors compare operating performance period to period.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
CHICAGO PIZZA & BREWERY, INC. REPORTS A $2,376,000 PROFIT FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2004, AND A 21.8% INCREASE IN REVENUES
 
Huntington Beach, CA April 27, 2004 - Chicago Pizza & Brewery, Inc. (NASDAQ: CHGO) released results for the first quarter ended March 28, 2004.
 
Highlights for the first quarter of 2004, relative to the same quarter last year, were as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
 
Revenues totaled $28,977,000 for the first quarter of 2004, an increase of 21.8% compared to the same quarter of 2003. Revenues increased primarily due to the 2003 restaurant openings in Addison, Texas, Cerritos, California and San Jose, California, and a full quarter of operations from Clear Lake, Texas, which opened during January 2003. In addition, the January 2004 opening of Willowbrook, Texas benefited revenues in the period. Also contributing to revenue growth was an increase in same store sales of 7.7% for BJ's restaurants opened greater than eighteen months. These increases were partially offset by the closure of the BJ's Portland, Oregon restaurant (Stark Street) during June 2003, and the sale of the three Pietro's restaurants, which was accomplished on March 15, 2004.
 
For the first quarter of 2004, the Company reported net income of $2,376,000, or $0.12 diluted earnings per share, as compared to net income of $828,000, or $0.04 diluted earnings per share for the same period of 2003. Included in first quarter 2004 earnings and earnings per share results is a previously announced pre-tax gain of $1,658,000 for the sale of the three Pietro's restaurants and related trademarks for the Pietro's brand, or a net $0.05 gain per diluted share. Excluding the Pietro's sale, the increase in net income quarter over quarter is primarily due to the increase in restaurant sales combined with a reduction in cost of sales, operating expenses, general and administrative and restaurant opening expenses as a percentage of sales, slightly offset by increases to labor and benefits, occupancy and depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of sales.
 
Paul Motenko, Chairman and Co-CEO, commented, "We are very pleased with our first quarter results, which reflect substantial revenue increases along with the success of our efforts at expense reduction. While the current cost environment is challenging, we are optimistic as our customer counts have been strong, and we anticipate profitability improvements at our newer restaurants and continued leverage to our general and administrative expenses. Additionally, we remain confident in our development schedule to open six or more units in 2004."
 
2004 Outlook
 
The Company maintains its projection for 2004 revenues to be between $124 million and $128 million and 2004 diluted earnings per share of $0.30 to $0.33, including the approximate $0.05 per share after-tax gain from
the sale of all three Pietro's restaurants and related assets. Expectations are based on 6 to 7 new BJ's Restaurant openings in 2004 and full-year comparable restaurant revenue growth of 3.0% to 4.0%. Chicago Pizza & Brewery will have one additional week in fiscal 2004, a 53-week year versus the standard 52-week year, which is reflected in the guidance issued above.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
The following net income and earnings per share calculations before the gain on sale of Pietro's restaurants have not been calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. We believe that the presentation of net income and earnings per share before the gain on sale of Pietro's restaurants provides a useful analysis of our ongoing operating trends and helps investors compare operating performance period to period.

Item 9. Regulation FD Disclosure
 
On July 27, 2004, Chicago Pizza & Brewery, Inc. a California corporation (the "Registrant"), announced its financial results for the second quarter ended June 27, 2004. The press release issued by the Registrant in connection with the announcement is attached to this report as Exhibit 99.1
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
CHICAGO PIZZA & BREWERY, INC. REPORTS A $1,403,000 PROFIT OR $0.07 PER SHARE FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2004
 
Huntington Beach, CA July 27, 2004 - Chicago Pizza & Brewery, Inc. (NASDAQ: CHGO) released results for the second quarter ended June 27, 2004.
 
Highlights for the second quarter of 2004, relative to the same quarter last year, were as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
 
Revenues totaled $29,315,000 for the second quarter of 2004, an increase of 15.4% compared with the same quarter of 2003. Revenues increased primarily due to the 2003 restaurant openings in Addison, Texas, Cerritos, California and San Jose, California. In addition, the January 2004 opening of Willowbrook, Texas and the June opening of Laguna Hills, California benefited revenues in the period. Also contributing to revenue growth was an increase in comparable restaurant sales of 4.4% for restaurants opened greater than eighteen months. These increases were partially offset by the closure of the BJ's Portland, Oregon restaurant during June 2003, and the sale of the three Pietro's restaurants, accomplished on March 15, 2004.
 
For the second quarter of 2004, the Company reported that net income increased 30.1% to $1,403,000, or $0.07 diluted earnings per share, as compared to net income of $1,078,000, or $0.05 diluted earnings per share for the same period of 2003. The increase in net income quarter over quarter is primarily due to the increase in restaurant sales combined with a reduction in cost of sales, labor and benefits, operating expenses and general and administrative as a percentage of sales; partially offset by increases to occupancy, depreciation and amortization and restaurant opening expenses as a percentage of sales.
 
Revenues totaled $58,292,000 for the six periods ended June 27, 2004; an increase of 18.5% compared to the six periods ended June 29, 2003. Revenues increased primarily due to the 2003 openings of restaurants in Clear Lake, Texas, Addison, Texas, Cerritos, California and San Jose, California, as well as the 2004 openings of Willowbrook, Texas and Laguna Hills, California. Also contributing to revenue growth was an increase in BJ's same store sales of 5.8% for restaurants opened greater than eighteen months. These increases were partially offset by the closure of the BJ's Portland, Oregon restaurant during June 2003, and the sale of the three Pietro's restaurants on March 15, 2004.
 
The Company reported net income of $3,779,000, or $0.18 diluted earnings per share, for the six periods ended June 27, 2004, compared to net income of $1,906,000, or $0.09 diluted earnings per share, for the six periods ended June 29, 2003. Included in first half 2004 earnings and earnings per share results is a pre-tax gain of $1,658,000 for the sale of the three Pietro's restaurants and related trademarks for the Pietro's brand, or a $0.05 after-tax gain per diluted share.
 
Paul Motenko, Chairman and Co-CEO, commented, "We were very pleased with our results in the second quarter, particularly our ability to maintain tight controls on cost of sales and labor in this very challenging cost
environment. We achieved a very successful opening at our Laguna Hills, California restaurant during the second quarter, and we have been extremely pleased with the guest response at our Summerlin, Nevada restaurant, which opened early in the third quarter. We continue to remain confident in our development schedule to open six or more units in 2004. In addition to restaurants the Company has opened year-to-date, we currently have ten signed leases for restaurants that we anticipate will open during either 2004 or 2005. Our current expectation is to open eight or more units in 2005."
 
2004 Outlook
 
The Company maintains its projection for 2004 revenues to be between $124 million and $128 million and 2004 diluted earnings per share of $0.30 to $0.33, including the approximate $0.05 per share after-tax gain from the sale of all three Pietro's restaurants and related assets during the first quarter. Expectations for 2004 are based on 6 to 7 new BJ's Restaurant openings and full-year comparable restaurant revenue growth of 3.0% to 4.0%. Chicago Pizza & Brewery will have one additional week in fiscal 2004, a 53-week year versus the standard 52-week year, which is reflected in the guidance issued above.

Revenues increased primarily due to the 2003 restaurant openings in Cerritos, California and San Jose, California and the January 2004 opening of Willowbrook, Texas, the June 2004 opening of Laguna Hills, California and Summerlin, Nevada as well as the August 2004 opening of Fresno, California. Also contributing to revenue growth was an increase in comparable restaurant sales of 2.9% for restaurants opened greater than eighteen months. These increases were partially offset by the sale of the three Pietro's restaurants, completed on March 15, 2004.
 
For the third quarter of 2004, the Company reported that net income increased 24.3% to $1,203,000, or $0.06 diluted earnings per share, as compared to net income of $968,000, or $0.05 diluted earnings per share for the same period of 2003. The increase in net income quarter over quarter is primarily due to the increase in restaurant sales combined with a reduction in cost of sales, occupancy, operating and general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales; partially offset by increases to labor and benefits, depreciation and amortization and restaurant opening expenses as a percentage of sales.
 
Revenues totaled $91,159,000 for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 26, 2004; an increase of 20.0% compared to the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2003. Revenues increased primarily due to the 2003 openings of restaurants in Clear Lake, Texas, Addison, Texas, Cerritos, California and San Jose, California, as well as the 2004 openings of Willowbrook, Texas, Laguna Hills, California, Summerlin, Nevada and Fresno, California. Also contributing to revenue growth for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 26, 2004 was an increase in our same store sales of 4.6% for restaurants opened greater than eighteen months. These increases were partially offset by the closure of our Portland, Oregon restaurant during June 2003, and the sale of the three Pietro's restaurants on March 15, 2004.
 
The Company reported net income of $4,982,000, or $0.24 diluted earnings per share, for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 26, 2004, compared to net income of $2,874,000, or $0.14 diluted earnings per share, for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2003. Included in the thirty-nine weeks ended September 26, 2004 earnings and earnings per share results is a pre-tax gain of $1,658,000 from the sale of the three Pietro's restaurants and related trademarks for the Pietro's brand, or a $0.05 after-tax gain per diluted share.
Paul Motenko, Chairman and Co-CEO, commented, "We were pleased with third quarter results, particularly our successful restaurant openings in Summerlin, Nevada and Fresno, California; both of which exceeded our initial revenue expectations. In addition, we have been extremely pleased with initial guest response at our San Bernardino, California restaurant, which opened early in the fourth quarter. With today's opening of our Folsom, California restaurant, we have successfully met our plan to open at least six units in 2004. For 2005, our current expectation is to open eight or more units, in-line with our objective of at least 20% annual unit growth."
 
2004 Outlook
 
The Company maintains its projection for 2004 revenues to be between $124 million and $128 million and 2004 diluted earnings per share of $0.30 to $0.33, including the approximate $0.05 per share after-tax gain from the sale of all three Pietro's restaurants and related assets during the first quarter. Expectations for 2004 are based on 6 to 7 new BJ's Restaurant openings and full-year comparable restaurant revenue growth of 3.0% to 4.0%. BJ's Restaurants will have one additional week in fiscal 2004, a 53-week year versus the standard 52-week year, which is reflected in the guidance issued above.

Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure
 
On February 23, 2005, BJ's Restaurants, Inc., a California corporation (the "Registrant"), announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended January 2, 2005. The press release issued by the Registrant in connection with the announcement is attached to this report as Exhibit 99.1.
 
Item 9.01 Exhibits
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
Huntington Beach, CA - February 23, 2005 - BJ's Restaurants, Inc. (NASDAQ: BJRI) reported record revenues and earnings for the fiscal quarter and year ended January 2, 2005.
 
Highlights for the quarter ended January 2, 2005, compared to the same quarter last year, were as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
 
Highlights for fiscal 2004 ended January 2, 2005, compared to fiscal 2003, were as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
 
The results for both the quarter and fiscal year ended January 2, 2005 included one additional week of operations when compared to the same periods of the prior year.
 
Revenues totaled $37.9 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, an increase of 40.3% compared to the fourth quarter of 2003. Revenues increased primarily due to the opening of seven new restaurants. Also contributing to revenue growth was an increase in BJ's comparable restaurant sales of 1.1% during the quarter. These increases were partially offset by impact from the sale of the three Pietro's restaurants, completed on March 15, 2004.
 
For the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company reported net income of $1,587,000, or $0.08 diluted earnings per share, as compared to net income of $719,000, or $0.03 diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2003. The increase in net income, quarter over quarter, is primarily due to the 40.3% increase in revenues, combined with a reduction in occupancy costs, operating expenses and labor and benefits as a percentage of revenues, offset by an increase to cost of sales, general and administrative, depreciation and restaurant opening expenses as a percentage of revenues. Additionally, the Company experienced a lower effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2004, due to additional utilization of FICA tip credits, combined with a reduction in the tax reserve and valuation allowance.
 
Revenues totaled $129.0 million for fiscal 2004, an increase of 25.3% compared to fiscal 2003. Revenues increased primarily due to seven new restaurants opened during 2004, as well as a full year of operations from the four restaurants the Company opened during 2003. Also contributing to revenue growth was an increase in BJ's comparable restaurant sales of 3.8% for restaurants open greater than eighteen months. These increases were partially offset by the closure of the Pietro's restaurant in Portland, Oregon during June 2003 and the sale of the three Pietro's restaurants on March 15, 2004.
The Company reported net income of $6,569,000, or $0.32 diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2004, compared to net income of $3,593,000, or $0.18 diluted earnings per share, for fiscal 2003. Included in the 53-weeks ended January 2, 2005, earnings and earnings per share results is a pre-tax gain of $1,658,000 from the sale of the three Pietro's restaurants and related trademarks for the Pietro's brand, or a $0.05 after-tax gain per diluted share. Like many other retail and restaurant companies as of late, the Company is in the process of completing its evaluation of its lease accounting practices in light of recent SEC interpretations.
 
Paul Motenko, Co-Chairman, commented, "We are very pleased with our 2004 operating results and particularly pleased with our restaurant class of 2004, which has provided some of the strongest average weekly sales in the Company's history. BJ's Restaurants, Inc. is on track to open at least 8 locations during 2005, in-line with our stated objectives of at least 20% annual restaurant growth. The Company currently has eleven signed leases in hand for restaurants that are anticipated to open during 2005 or 2006."
 
Jerry Deitchle, who joined the Company as President and CEO on February 1, 2005, commented, "My first three weeks on the job have solidly confirmed my belief that we have a strong opportunity to expand the BJ's concept in both existing and new markets. I am both honored and excited to have the opportunity to lead our Company as we move forward to execute our growth plan in a controlled, profitable manner with the objective of building long-term value for our guests, our staff members and our stockholders."

Item 4.02 Non-Reliance on Previously Issued Financial Statements or a Related Audit Report or Completed Interim Review.
 
On March 9, 2005, BJ's Restaurants, Inc., a California corporation (the "Registrant"), announced that it will adjust its accounting for "rent holidays" in its restaurant leases after the Company's review of the topic with its Audit Committee and consultation with its independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP. The press release issued by the Registrant in connection with the announcement is attached to this report as Exhibit 99.1 (incorporated herein by this reference).
 
Item 9.01 Exhibits
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
BJ'S RESTAURANTS, INC. ANNOUNCES CORRECTION IN ACCOUNTING FOR LEASES
 
Huntington Beach, California  March 9, 2005  Management of BJ's Restaurants, Inc. (Nasdaq: BJRI) today announced that it will adjust its accounting for "rent holidays" in its restaurant leases after the Company's review of the topic with its Audit Committee and consultation with its independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP.
 
Like many companies in the retail and restaurant industries, BJ's Restaurants, Inc. reviewed its policy of accounting for leases in light of the views expressed by the Chief Accountant of the Securities and Exchange Commission in a February 7, 2005 letter to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. The views expressed by the Chief Accountant on February 7th necessitated a reassessment of lease accounting methods. Based on the SEC's views, the Company has now concluded that its accounting treatment for "rent holidays" was not consistent with the SEC's recent pronouncement. With the exception of "rent holidays", BJ's Restaurants, Inc. believes it is in compliance with all other lease accounting views expressed in the SEC's recent letter.
 
In most cases, the term of the Company's restaurant leases starts at the commencement of restaurant operations rather than at the time the leased property is made available to the Company as the tenant, which allows time for constructing leasehold improvements necessary to operate the restaurant. This has been the standard industry practice for some time. It is also typical that there are no lease payments due during this build-out period, as the stated term of the lease has not yet begun. Therefore, the Company has not recorded lease expense during these build-out periods. Rather, the Company recorded straight-line rent expense as of the earlier of the commencement of operations or the commencement of the lease term. In the February 7th letter, the SEC deemed this approach inappropriate and clarified that these build-out periods should be considered "rent holidays," a term that the Company previously had considered applied only to periods of "free rent" within a stated lease term. As a result of this SEC view, the Company will adjust its financial statements to record non-cash rent expense during the build-out period, even though this period is in addition to the stated term of the lease. The effect of this adjustment will be to increase the pre-opening expense recorded in the Company's income statement, to reduce the ongoing rent expense that is reflected in occupancy costs, and to increase deferred rent.
 
Since the Company's management and its Audit Committee have concluded that the Company's accounting for "holiday rent" was not in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles as described in the SEC's recent letter, the Company's previously issued unaudited financial results included in the Company's press release issued February 23, 2005 should no longer be relied upon. Due to the immaterial effect of the lease accounting adjustment for "rent holidays" on the Company's financial statements, BJ's Restaurants, Inc. cumulative "rent holiday" adjustment will be recorded during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 as opposed to restating prior periods, subject to final discussions with our independent registered public accounting firm. The cumulative pre-tax adjustment to be recorded during fiscal 2004 will increase preopening expense by $499,000. Of this cumulative amount, the pretax adjustment amount applicable to fiscal 2004 results will be $224,000 (or $137,000 after tax), or slightly less than $0.01 per diluted share. The pretax adjustment amount applicable to fiscal years 2003 and prior will be $275,000 (or $168,000 after tax), or approximately $0.01 per diluted share. Related adjustments will also be made to certain balance sheet accounts. This accounting adjustment will not impact the overall cash flow economics of the Company's business or the restaurant leases themselves.
BJ's Restaurants, Inc. currently expects to file its Annual Report on Form 10-K on or before the original due date of March 18, 2005.
 
BJ's Restaurants, Inc. currently owns and operates 35 casual dining restaurants under the BJ's Restaurant and Brewery, BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse or BJ's Pizza & Grill brand names. BJ's restaurants offer an innovative menu featuring award-winning, signature deep dish pizza complemented with generously portioned salads, sandwiches, soups, pastas, entres and desserts. Quality, flavor, value, moderate prices and sincere service remain distinct attributes of the BJ's experience. The company operates ten microbreweries which produce and distribute BJ's critically acclaimed handcrafted beers throughout the chain. The Company's restaurants are located in California (24), Texas (5), Oregon (3), Arizona (1), Colorado (1) and Nevada (1). The Company also has a licensing interest in a BJ's restaurant in Lahaina, Maui. Visit BJ's Restaurants, Inc. on the web at .

Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings
Indemnified Party
Indemnifying Party
 
assume the defense thereof, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and the payment of all fees and expenses incurred in connection with defense thereof; provided, that the failure of any Indemnified Party to give such notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations or liabilities pursuant to this Agreement, except (and only) to the extent that it shall be finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction (which determination is not subject to appeal or further review) that such failure shall have materially prejudiced the Indemnifying Party.
 
An Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such Proceeding and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Party or Parties unless: (1) the Indemnifying Party has agreed in writing to pay such fees and expenses; (2) the Indemnifying Party shall have failed promptly to assume the defense of such Proceeding and to employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Party in any such Proceeding; or (3) the named parties to any such Proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both such Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, and such Indemnified Party shall have been advised by outside counsel that a material conflict of interest is likely to exist if the same counsel were to represent such Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party (in which case, if such Indemnified Party notifies the Indemnifying Party in writing that it elects to employ separate counsel at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to assume the defense thereof and such counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnifying Party; provided, however, that in the event one or more Investors is a party to such Proceeding, the Company shall only be required to pay the expenses of one law firm serving as counsel to said Investors).

. If the indemnification under Section 5(a) or 5(b) is unavailable to an Indemnified Party or insufficient to hold an Indemnified Party harmless for any Losses, then each Indemnifying Party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party in connection with the actions, statements or omissions that resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of such Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission of a material fact, has been taken or made by, or relates to information supplied by, such Indemnifying Party or Indemnified Party, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such action, statement or omission. The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of any Losses shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, any reasonable attorneys' or other reasonable fees or expenses incurred by such party in
Contribution
 
connection with any Proceeding to the extent such party would have been indemnified for such fees or expenses if the indemnification provided for in this Section was available to such party in accordance with its terms.
 
The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 5(d) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 5(d), no Holder shall be required to contribute, in the aggregate, any amount in excess of the amount by which the proceeds actually received by such Holder from the sale of the Registrable Securities subject to the Proceeding exceeds the amount of any damages that such Holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission, except in the case of fraud by such Holder.
 
The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Section are in addition to any liability that the Indemnifying Parties may have to the Indemnified Parties.
 
.
Additional Provisions
 
. Each Holder agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from the Company of the happening of any event requiring the preparation of a supplement or amendment to a prospectus relating to Registrable Securities so that, as thereafter delivered to the Holders, such prospectus shall not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, each Holder will forthwith discontinue disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to the registration statement contemplated herein until its receipt of copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus from the Company and, if so directed by the Company, each Holder shall deliver to the Company all copies, other than permanent file copies then in such Holder's possession, of the prospectus covering such Registrable Securities current at the time of receipt of such notice.
Corrections

Miscellaneous
 
. In the event of a breach by the Company or by a Holder, of any of their obligations under this Agreement, each Holder or the Company, as the case may be, in addition to being entitled to exercise all rights granted by law and under this Agreement, including recovery of damages, will be entitled to specific performance of its rights under this Agreement. The Company and each Holder agree that monetary damages would not provide adequate compensation for any losses incurred by reason of a breach by it of any of the provisions of this Agreement and hereby further agrees that, in the event of any action for specific performance in respect of such breach, it shall waive the defense that a remedy at law would be adequate.
Remedies
 
. Neither the Company nor any of its security holders (other than the Holders in such capacity pursuant hereto) may include securities of the Company in a Registration Statement other than the Registrable Securities. No Person has any right to cause the Company to effect the registration under the Securities Act of any securities of the Company. The Company shall not file any other registration statements until the Registration Statement required hereunder is declared effective by the Commission, provided that this Section 7(b) shall not prohibit the Company from filing amendments to registration statements already filed or from filing Registration Statements on Form S-8 relating to equity compensation plans or on Forms S-3 or S-4 relating to any acquisition by the Company.
No Piggyback on Registrations
 
. Each Holder covenants and agrees that it will comply with the prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act as applicable to it in connection with sales of Registrable Securities pursuant to the Registration Statement.
Compliance
 
. Each Holder agrees by its acquisition of such Registrable Securities that, upon receipt of a notice from the Company of the occurrence of any event of the kind described in Section 3(c), such Holder will forthwith discontinue disposition of such Registrable Securities under the Registration Statement until such Holder's receipt of the copies of the supplemented Prospectus and/or amended Registration Statement or until it is advised in writing (the "") by the Company that the use of the applicable Prospectus may be resumed, and, in either case, has received copies of any additional or supplemental filings that are incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference in such Prospectus or Registration Statement. The Company will use its best efforts to ensure that the use of the Prospectus may be resumed as promptly as it practicable. The Company agrees and acknowledges that any periods during which the Holder is required to discontinue the disposition of the Registrable Securities hereunder shall be subject to the provisions of Section 2(b).
Discontinued Disposition
Advice
 
. If at any time during the Effectiveness Period there is not an effective Registration Statement covering all of the Registrable Securities and the Company shall determine to prepare and file with the Commission a registration statement relating to an offering for its own account or the account of others under the Securities Act of any of its equity securities, other than on Form S-4 or Form S-8 (each as promulgated under the Securities Act) or their then equivalents relating to equity securities to be issued solely in connection with any acquisition of any entity or business or equity securities issuable in connection with the stock option or other employee benefit plans, then the Company shall send to each Holder a written notice of such determination and, if within fifteen days after the date of such notice, any such Holder shall so request in writing, the Company shall include in such registration statement all or any part of such Registrable Securities such Holder requests to be registered, subject to customary underwriter cutbacks applicable to all holders of registration rights.

Transfer Restrictions.
 
The Securities may only be disposed of in compliance with state and federal securities laws. In connection with any transfer of Securities other than pursuant to an effective registration statement or Rule 144, to the Company or to an affiliate of a Purchaser or in connection with a pledge as contemplated in Section 4.1(b), the Company may require the transferor thereof to provide to the Company an opinion of counsel selected by the transferor and reasonably acceptable to the Company, the form and substance of which opinion shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Company, to the effect that such transfer does not require registration of such transferred Securities under the Securities Act. As a condition of transfer, any such transferee shall agree in writing to be bound by the terms of this Agreement and shall have the rights of a Purchaser under this Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement.
 
The Purchasers agree to the imprinting, so long as is required by this Section 4.1(b), of a legend on any of the Securities in the following form:
 
THESE SECURITIES HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION OR THE SECURITIES COMMISSION OF ANY STATE IN RELIANCE UPON AN EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE "SECURITIES ACT"), AND, ACCORDINGLY, MAY NOT BE OFFERED OR SOLD EXCEPT PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OR PURSUANT TO AN AVAILABLE EXEMPTION FROM, OR IN A TRANSACTION NOT SUBJECT TO, THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS AS EVIDENCED BY A LEGAL OPINION OF COUNSEL TO THE TRANSFEROR TO SUCH EFFECT, THE SUBSTANCE OF WHICH SHALL BE REASONABLY ACCEPTABLE TO THE COMPANY. THESE SECURITIES MAY BE PLEDGED IN CONNECTION WITH A BONA FIDE MARGIN ACCOUNT WITH A REGISTERED BROKER-DEALER OR OTHER LOAN WITH A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION THAT IS AN "ACCREDITED INVESTOR" AS DEFINED IN RULE 501(a) UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT.
 
The Company acknowledges and agrees that a Purchaser may from time to time pledge pursuant to a bona fide margin agreement with a registered broker-dealer or grant a security interest in some or all of the Securities to a financial institution that is an "accredited investor" as defined in Rule 501(a) under the Securities Act and who agrees
 
to be bound by the provisions of this Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement and, if required under the terms of such arrangement, such Purchaser may transfer pledged or secured Securities to the pledgees or secured parties. Such a pledge or transfer would not be subject to approval of the Company and no legal opinion of legal counsel of the pledgee, secured party or pledgor shall be required in connection therewith, but such legal opinion may be required in connection with a subsequent transfer following default by the Investor transferee of the pledge. No notice shall be required of such pledge. At the appropriate Purchaser's expense, the Company will execute and deliver such reasonable documentation as a pledgee or secured party of Securities may reasonably request in connection with a pledge or transfer of the Securities, including, if the Securities are subject to registration pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, the preparation and filing of any required prospectus supplement under Rule 424(b)(3) under the Securities Act or other applicable provision of the Securities Act to appropriately amend the list of Selling Stockholders thereunder.
 
Certificates evidencing the Shares shall not contain any legend (including the legend set forth in Section 4.1(b)), (i) while a registration statement (including the Registration Statement) covering the resale of such security is effective under the Securities Act, or (ii) following any sale of such Shares pursuant to Rule 144, or (iii) if such Shares are eligible for sale under Rule 144(k), or (iv) if such legend is not required under applicable requirements of the Securities Act (including judicial interpretations and pronouncements issued by the Staff of the Commission). The Company shall cause its counsel to issue a legal opinion to the Company's transfer agent promptly after the Effective Date if required by the Company's transfer agent to effect the removal of the legend hereunder. The Company agrees that at such time as such legend is no longer required under this Section 4.1(c), it will, no later than three Trading Days following the delivery by a Purchaser to the Company or the Company's transfer agent of a certificate representing Shares, issued with a restrictive legend (such date, the ""), deliver or cause to be delivered to such Purchaser a certificate representing such Securities that is free from all restrictive and other legends. The Company may not make any notation on its records or give instructions to any transfer agent of the Company that enlarge the restrictions on transfer set forth in this Section. Certificates for Securities subject to legend removal hereunder shall be transmitted by the transfer agent of the Company to the Purchasers by crediting the account of the Purchaser's prime broker with the Depository Trust Company System.
Legend Removal Date
 
Each Purchaser, severally and not jointly with the other Purchasers, agrees that the removal of the restrictive legend from certificates representing Securities as set forth in this Section 4.1 is predicated upon the Company's reliance that the Purchaser will sell any Securities pursuant to either the registration requirements of the Securities Act, including any applicable prospectus delivery requirements, or an exemption therefrom.
 
Furnishing of Information. As long as any Purchaser owns Securities, the Company covenants to timely file (or obtain extensions in respect thereof and file within the applicable grace period) all reports required to be filed by the Company after the date hereof pursuant to the Exchange Act. As long as any Purchaser owns Securities, if the Company is not required to file reports pursuant to the Exchange Act, it will prepare and furnish to the Purchasers and make
 
publicly available in accordance with Rule 144(c) such information as is required for the Purchasers to sell the Securities under Rule 144. The Company further covenants that it will take such further action as any holder of Securities may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable such Person to sell such Securities without registration under the Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by Rule 144.
 
Integration. The Company shall not sell, offer for sale or solicit offers to buy or otherwise negotiate in respect of any security (as defined in Section 2 of the Securities Act) that would be integrated with the offer or sale of the Securities in a manner that would require the registration under the Securities Act of the sale of the Securities to the Purchasers or that would be integrated with the offer or sale of the Securities for purposes of the rules and regulations of any Trading Market such that it would require shareholder approval prior to the closing of such other transaction unless shareholder approval is obtained before the closing of such subsequent transaction.
 
Securities Laws Disclosure; Publicity. By 9:15 a.m. (New York time) on the Trading Day following the date hereof, the Company will issue a press release disclosing all material terms of the transactions contemplated hereby and by 3:00 p.m. (New York time) on the second Trading Day following the date hereof, the Company will file a Current Report on Form 8-K disclosing the material terms of the transactions contemplated hereby (and attach as exhibits thereto the Transaction Documents) in accordance with the applicable Commission rules and regulations. In addition, the Company will make such other filings and notices in the manner and time required by the Commission and the Trading Market on which the Common Stock is listed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not publicly disclose the name of any Purchaser, or include the name of any Purchaser in any filing with the Commission (other than the Registration Statement and any exhibits to filings made in respect of this transaction in accordance with periodic filing requirements under the Exchange Act) or any regulatory agency or Trading Market, without the prior written consent of such Purchaser, except to the extent such disclosure is required by law or Trading Market regulations, in which case the Company shall provide the Purchasers with prior notice of such disclosure.
 
[Intentionally Omitted].
 
Non-Public Information. The Company covenants and agrees that neither it nor any other Person acting on its behalf will provide any Purchaser or its agents or counsel with any information that the Company believes constitutes material non-public information, unless prior thereto such Purchaser shall have executed a written agreement regarding the confidentiality and use of such information. The Company understands and confirms that each Purchaser shall be relying on the foregoing representations in effecting transactions in securities of the Company.
 
Use of Proceeds. Except as set forth on Schedule 4.7 attached hereto, the Company shall use the net proceeds from the sale of the Securities hereunder for working capital purposes and not for the satisfaction of any portion of the Company's debt (other than payment in the ordinary course of the Company's business and prior practices), to redeem any Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents or to settle any outstanding litigation.
 
[Intentionally Omitted].
 
Indemnification of Purchasers. Subject to the provisions of this Section 4.9, the Company will indemnify and hold the Purchasers and their directors, officers, shareholders, partners, employees and agents (each, a "Purchaser Party") harmless from any and all losses, liabilities, obligations, claims, contingencies, damages, costs and expenses, including all judgments, amounts paid in settlements, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and costs of investigation that any such Purchaser Party may suffer or incur as a result of or relating to (a) any breach of any of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements made by the Company in this Agreement or in the other Transaction Documents or (b) any action instituted against a Purchaser, or any of them or their respective Affiliates, by any stockholder of the Company who is not an Affiliate of such Purchaser, with respect to any of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents (unless such action is based upon a breach of such Purchaser's representations, warranties or covenants under the Transaction Documents or any agreements or understandings such Purchaser may have with any such stockholder or any violations by the Purchaser of state or federal securities laws or any conduct by such Purchaser which constitutes fraud, gross negligence, willful misconduct or malfeasance). If any action shall be brought against any Purchaser Party in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to this Agreement, such Purchaser Party shall promptly notify the Company in writing, and the Company shall have the right to assume the defense thereof with counsel of its own choosing. Any Purchaser Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Purchaser Party except to the extent that (i) the employment thereof has been specifically authorized by the Company in writing, (ii) the Company has failed after a reasonable period of time to assume such defense and to employ counsel or (iii) in such action there is, in the reasonable opinion of such separate counsel, a material conflict on any material issue between the position of the Company and the position of such Purchaser Party. The Company will not be liable to any Purchaser Party under this Agreement (i) for any settlement by a Purchaser Party effected without the Company's prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; or (ii) to the extent, but only to the extent that a loss, claim, damage or liability is attributable to any Purchaser Party's breach of any of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements made by the Purchasers in this Agreement or in the other Transaction Documents.
 
Reservation of Common Stock. As of the date hereof, the Company has reserved and the Company shall continue to reserve and keep available at all times, free of preemptive rights, a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock for the purpose of enabling the Company to issue Shares pursuant to this Agreement.
 
Listing of Common Stock. The Company hereby agrees to use best efforts to maintain the listing of the Common Stock on a Trading Market, and as soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing (but not later than the earlier of the Effective Date and the first anniversary of the Closing Date) to list all of the Shares on such Trading Market. The Company further agrees, if the Company applies to have the Common Stock traded on any other Trading Market, it will include in such application all of the Shares, and will take such other action as is necessary to cause all of the Shares to be listed on such other Trading Market as promptly as possible. The
 
Company will comply in all respects with the Company's reporting, filing and other obligations under the bylaws or rules of the Trading Market.
 
Equal Treatment of Purchasers. No consideration shall be offered or paid to any person to amend or consent to a waiver or modification of any provision of any of the Transaction Documents unless the same consideration is also offered to all of the parties to the Transaction Documents. For clarification purposes, this provision constitutes a separate right granted to each Purchaser by the Company and negotiated separately by each Purchaser, and is intended to treat for the Company the Purchasers as a class and shall not in any way be construed as the Purchasers acting in concert or as a group with respect to the purchase, disposition or voting of Securities or otherwise.
 
Intentionally Omitted.
 
Subsequent Equity Sales.
 
From the date hereof until 60 days after the Effective Date, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary shall issue shares of Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents; provided, however, the 60 day period set forth in this Section 4.14 shall be extended for the number of Trading Days during such period in which (i) trading in the Common Stock is suspended by any Trading Market, or (ii) following the Effective Date, the Registration Statement is not effective or the prospectus included in the Registration Statement may not be used by the Purchasers for the resale of the Shares.
 
From the date hereof until two years from the Closing Date, the Company shall be prohibited from effecting or entering into an agreement to effect any Subsequent Financing involving a "Variable Rate Transaction". The term "Variable Rate Transaction" shall mean a transaction in which the Company issues or sells (i) any debt or equity securities that are convertible into, exchangeable or exercisable for, or include the right to receive additional shares of Common Stock either (A) at a conversion, exercise or exchange rate or other price that is based upon and/or varies with the trading prices of or quotations for the shares of Common Stock at any time after the initial issuance of such debt or equity securities, or (B) with a conversion, exercise or exchange price that is subject to being reset at some future date after the initial issuance of such debt or equity security or upon the occurrence of specified or contingent events directly or indirectly related to the business of the Company or the market for the Common Stock or (ii) enters into any agreement, including, but not limited to, an equity line of credit, whereby the Company may sell securities at a future determined price. Any Purchaser shall be entitled to obtain injunctive relief against the Company to preclude any such issuance, which remedy shall be in addition to any right to collect damages.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 4.14 shall not apply in respect of an Exempt Issuance, except that no Variable Rate Transaction shall be an Exempt Issuance.
 
Short Sales and Confidentiality. Each Purchaser covenants that neither it nor any affiliates acting on its behalf or pursuant to any understanding with it will execute any Short Sales during the period after the Discussion Time until prior to the time that the transactions
 
contemplated by this Agreement are first publicly announced as described in Section 4.4. Each Purchaser, severally and not jointly with the other Purchasers, covenants that until such time as the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are publicly disclosed by the Company as described in Section 4.4, such Purchaser will maintain, the confidentiality of all disclosures made to it in connection with this transaction (including the existence and terms of this transaction). Each Purchaser understands and acknowledges, severally and not jointly with any other Purchaser, that the Commission currently takes the position that coverage of short sales of shares of the Common Stock "against the box" prior to the Effective Date of the Registration Statement with the Securities is a violation of Section 5 of the Securities Act, as set forth in Item 65, Section 5 under Section A, of the Manual of Publicly Available Telephone Interpretations, dated July 1997, compiled by the Office of Chief Counsel, Division of Corporation Finance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Purchaser makes any representation, warranty or covenant hereby that it will not engage in Short Sales in the securities of the Company after the time that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are first publicly announced as described in Section 4.4; provided, however, that any such Short Sales must comply with applicable laws. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of a Purchaser that is a multi-managed investment vehicle whereby separate portfolio managers manage separate portions of such Purchaser's assets and the portfolio managers have no direct knowledge of the investment decisions made by the portfolio managers managing other portions of such Purchaser's assets, the covenant set forth above shall only apply with respect to the portion of assets managed by the portfolio manager that made the investment decision to purchase the Securities covered by this Agreement.
 
Delivery of Securities After Closing. The Company shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, the respective Shares purchased by each Purchaser to such Purchaser within 3 Trading Days of the Closing Date.
 
Acknowledgment Regarding RBC.

Each Purchaser further acknowledges that RBC has acted solely as agent of the Company in connection with the offering of the Securities by the Company.
 
Sales by Investors. Each Purchaser covenants to sell any Securities sold by it in compliance with applicable prospectus delivery requirements, if any, or otherwise in compliance with the requirements for an exemption from registration under the Securities Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. No Purchaser will make any sale, transfer or other disposition of the Securities in violation of federal or state securities laws.
 
 
Termination. This Agreement may be terminated by any Purchaser, as to such Purchaser's obligations hereunder only and without any effect whatsoever on the obligations between the Company and the other Purchasers, by written notice to the other parties, if the Closing has not been consummated on or before March , 2005; provided, however, that no
    
 
such termination will affect the right of any party to sue for any breach by the other party (or parties) prior to such termination.
 
Fees and Expenses. The Company shall reimburse RBC Capital Markets ("RBC") the sum of $ for its legal fees and expenses at Closing. The Company shall deliver, prior to the Closing, a completed and executed copy of the Closing Statement, attached hereto as Annex A. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, each party shall pay the fees and expenses of its advisers, counsel, accountants and other experts, if any, and all other expenses incurred by such party incident to the negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement. The Company shall pay all stamp and other taxes and duties levied in connection with the delivery of the Securities.
                
 
Entire Agreement.

Amendments; Waivers. No provision of this Agreement may be waived or amended except in a written instrument signed, (i) in the case of an amendment, by the Company and the Purchasers contributing two-thirds of the aggregate investments made by purchasers pursuant to this offering, except that if an amendment would adversely affect the rights of a Purchaser, the amendment must also be approved by such Purchaser, or (ii) in the case of a waiver, by the party against whom enforcement of any such waiver is sought. No waiver of any default with respect to any provision, condition or requirement of this Agreement shall be deemed to be a continuing waiver in the future or a waiver of any subsequent default or a waiver of any other provision, condition or requirement hereof, nor shall any delay or omission of either party to exercise any right hereunder in any manner impair the exercise of any such right.
 
Construction. The headings herein are for convenience only, do not constitute a part of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to limit or affect any of the provisions hereof. The language used in this Agreement will be deemed to be the language chosen by the parties to express their mutual intent, and no rules of strict construction will be applied against any party.

burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provisions of this Agreement or any of the Transaction Documents.
 
Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their successors and permitted assigns. The Company may not assign this Agreement or any rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each Purchaser. Any Purchaser may assign any or all of its rights under this Agreement to any Person to whom such Purchaser assigns or transfers any Securities, provided that such transferee agrees in writing to be bound, with respect to the transferred Securities, by the provisions hereof that apply to the "Purchasers".
 
No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement is intended for the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns and is not for the benefit of, nor may any provision hereof be enforced by, any other Person, except as otherwise set forth in Section 4.9.
 
5.9 Governing Law. All questions concerning the construction, validity, enforcement and interpretation of the Transaction Documents shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the internal laws of the State of New York, without regard to the principles of conflicts of law thereof. Each party agrees that all legal proceedings concerning the interpretations, enforcement and defense of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any other Transaction Documents (whether brought against a party hereto or its respective affiliates, directors, officers, shareholders, employees or agents) shall be commenced exclusively in the state and federal courts sitting in the City of New York. Each party hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts sitting in the City of New York, borough of Manhattan for the adjudication of any dispute hereunder or in connection herewith or with any transaction contemplated hereby or discussed herein (including with respect to the enforcement of any of the Transaction Documents), and hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert in any suit, action or proceeding, any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of any such court, that such suit, action or proceeding is improper or inconvenient venue for such proceeding. Each party hereby irrevocably waives personal service of process and consents to process being served in any such suit, action or proceeding by mailing a copy thereof via registered or certified mail or overnight delivery (with evidence of delivery) to such party at the address in effect for notices to it under this Agreement and agrees that such service shall constitute good and sufficient service of process and notice thereof. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to limit in any way any right to serve process in any manner permitted by law. The parties hereby waive all rights to a trial by jury. If either party shall commence an action or proceeding to enforce any provisions of the Transaction Documents, then the prevailing party in such action or proceeding shall be reimbursed by the other party for its attorneys' fees and other costs and expenses incurred with the investigation, preparation and prosecution of such action or proceeding.
 
5.10 Survival. The representations and warranties herein shall survive the Closing and delivery of the Shares for a period of three years following the Closing.
 
5.11 Execution. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, all of which when taken together shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
 
effective when counterparts have been signed by each party and delivered to the other party, it being understood that both parties need not sign the same counterpart. In the event that any signature is delivered by facsimile transmission, such signature shall create a valid and binding obligation of the party executing (or on whose behalf such signature is executed) with the same force and effect as if such facsimile signature page were an original thereof.
 
5.12 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable in any respect, the validity and enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby and the parties will attempt to agree upon a valid and enforceable provision that is a reasonable substitute therefor, and upon so agreeing, shall incorporate such substitute provision in this Agreement.
 
5.13 [Intentionally Omitted].
 
5.14 Replacement of Securities. If any certificate or instrument evidencing any Securities is mutilated, lost, stolen or destroyed, the Company shall issue or cause to be issued in exchange and substitution for and upon cancellation thereof, or in lieu of and substitution therefor, a new certificate or instrument, but only upon receipt of evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Company of such loss, theft or destruction and customary and reasonable indemnity, if requested. The applicants for a new certificate or instrument under such circumstances shall also pay any reasonable third-party costs associated with the issuance of such replacement Securities.
 
5.15 Remedies. In addition to being entitled to exercise all rights provided herein or granted by law, including recovery of damages, each of the Purchasers and the Company will be entitled to specific performance under the Transaction Documents. The parties agree that monetary damages may not be adequate compensation for any loss incurred by reason of any breach of obligations described in the foregoing sentence and hereby agrees to waive in any action for specific performance of any such obligation the defense that a remedy at law would be adequate.
 
5.16 Payment Set Aside. To the extent that the Company makes a payment or payments to any Purchaser pursuant to any Transaction Document or a Purchaser enforces or exercises its rights thereunder, and such payment or payments or the proceeds of such enforcement or exercise or any part thereof are subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside, recovered from, disgorged by or are required to be refunded, repaid or otherwise restored to the Company, a trustee, receiver or any other person under any law (including, without limitation, any bankruptcy law, state or federal law, common law or equitable cause of action), then to the extent of any such restoration the obligation or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such payment had not been made or such enforcement or setoff had not occurred.
 
5.17 Independent Nature of Purchasers' Obligations and Rights. The obligations of each Purchaser under any Transaction Document are several and not joint with the obligations of any other Purchaser, and no Purchaser shall be responsible in any way for the performance of the obligations of any other Purchaser under any Transaction Document. Nothing contained herein or in any Transaction Document, and no action taken by any Purchaser pursuant thereto, shall be deemed to constitute the Purchasers as a partnership, an association, a joint venture or any other
 
kind of entity, or create a presumption that the Purchasers are in any way acting in concert or as a group with respect to such obligations or the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents. Each Purchaser shall be entitled to independently protect and enforce its rights, including without limitation, the rights arising out of this Agreement or out of the other Transaction Documents, and it shall not be necessary for any other Purchaser to be joined as an additional party in any proceeding for such purpose. Each Purchaser has been represented by its own separate legal counsel in their review and negotiation of the Transaction Documents. For reasons of administrative convenience only, Purchasers and their respective counsel have chosen to communicate with the Company through FW. FW does not represent all of the Purchasers but only RBC. The Company has elected to provide all Purchasers with the same terms and Transaction Documents for the convenience of the Company and not because it was required or requested to do so by the Purchasers.
 
5.18 Liquidated Damages. The Company's obligations to pay any partial liquidated damages or other amounts owing under the Transaction Documents is a continuing obligation of the Company and shall not terminate until all unpaid partial liquidated damages and other amounts have been paid notwithstanding the fact that the instrument or security pursuant to which such partial liquidated damages or other amounts are due and payable shall have been canceled.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
BJ'S RESTAURANTS, INC. REPORTS STRONG FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2005
 
Huntington Beach, CA  April 27, 2005BJ's Restaurants, Inc. (NASDAQ: BJRI) today reported revenues and net income for the first fiscal quarter of 2005 ended April 3, 2005.
 
Highlights for the first quarter, compared to the same quarter last year, were as follows:
 
 
 
 
"Our management team was very pleased with our financial results for the first quarter," said Jerry Deitchle, President and CEO. "Despite near-record rainfall in California, where approximately two-thirds of our restaurants are currently located, our comparable restaurant sales increased a solid 2.8% during the quarter, successfully hurdling a 7.7% increase for the same quarter last year. Additionally, our average weekly sales for all restaurants increased approximately 11% during the quarter, after adjusting for the three disposed Pietro's restaurants in the same quarter last year. Our newer restaurants continue to achieve very strong sales volumes during their grand-opening "honeymoon" periods, and we believe these restaurants have a solid opportunity to eventually settle in with sustainable sales volumes in excess of our current average."
 
"Yesterday, we opened our 38
th
restaurant in Roseville, California (a suburb of Sacramento) and achieved strong first-day sales. We remain solidly on track to open a total of eight or more new restaurants during fiscal 2005. Our growth plan will remain carefully controlled to facilitate the consistent, high-quality performance of our new restaurants over the longer term. The $42 million equity offering that we successfully completed last month effectively primed our capital pipeline for the foreseeable future, and our real estate pipeline is currently in solid shape well into fiscal 2006. We remain very excited about our future growth prospects."

Item 1.01. Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On June 14, 2005, the shareholders of BJ's Restaurants, Inc. (the "Company") approved the BJ's Restaurants, Inc. 2005 Equity Incentive Plan (the "Plan").
 
The purpose of the Plan is to further the growth and success of the Company's business and attract and retain the most talented employees, officers, directors and consultants by aligning the long-term interest of such persons with those of the shareholders through equity-based compensation and by providing rewards for exceptional performance and long-term incentives for future contributions to the success of the Company. The Plan is intended to provide the Company with greater flexibility in designing stock and performance based incentives for employees and other eligible plan participants. Any employee, officer, consultant or director providing services to the Company or to any subsidiary of the Company is eligible to receive awards under the Plan. The Board believes that the Plan will provide an important tool for the Company with respect to the recruitment, motivation and retention of directors, officers, consultants, officers and directors.
 
The Compensation Committee of the Board will administer the Plan, with certain actions subject to the review and approval of the full Board or a panel consisting of all of the independent directors. The Committee will have full power and authority to determine when and to whom awards will be granted, including the type, amount, form of payment and other terms and conditions of each award, consistent with the provisions of the Plan. In addition the Committee has the authority to interpret the Plan and the awards granted under the Plan, and establish rules and regulations for the administration of the Plan. The Committee may delegate the administration of the Plan to the Company's officers, including the maintenance of records of the awards and the interpretation of the terms of the awards.
 
The aggregate number of shares of the Common Stock that may be issued as awards under the Plan is 3,500,000 shares of Common Stock plus any shares that were subject to options outstanding on June 14, 2005 that were granted under the Company's 1996 Stock Option Plan that are forfeited or expire without exercise. As of June 14, 2005 there were options to purchase approximately 2,140,000 shares of Common Stock outstanding under the 1996 Stock Option Plan. The aggregate number of shares of Common Stock which may be granted to any one participant in any one year under the Plan is 300,000. The maximum aggregate number of shares of Common Stock which may be granted as incentive stock options (ISOs) is 1,000,000. The aggregate number of shares with respect to awards may be granted to non-employee directors under the Plan shall be 500,000. If any shares of Common Stock subject to any award or to which an award relates, granted under the Plan, are forfeited, become unexercisable, or if any award terminates without the delivery of any shares, the shares of Common Stock previously set aside for such awards will be available for future awards under the Plan.
 
The Plan permits the grant of nonqualified stock options, incentive stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock, stock appreciation rights ("SARs"), performance shares and performance units. The aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued under the Plan will be reduced by 2.0 for each share delivered in settlement of any award of restricted stock, restricted stock unit, SAR, performance shares or performance units, and one share for each share delivered in settlement of an option.
 
In the event of a Change of Control of the Company (as defined in the Plan), subject to certain limitations and restrictions as more fully described in the Plan, (i) options and SARs may become fully vested and immediately exercisable for the greater of the time period specified in the original option or SAR award (but subject to termination upon termination of service to the Company) or one year following the date of the Change of Control, (ii) restriction periods and restrictions imposed on restricted stock or restricted stock units and performance-based awards may lapse, and (iii) restrictions and limitations and other conditions applicable to other awards may lapse, and the awards may become free of restrictions, limitations or conditions and become fully vested and transferable. Generally, accelerated vesting or lapse of restrictions on awards held by an employee will occur only if an employee's employment is terminated within a year after a Change in Control, the acquiring company does not assume outstanding awards or substitute equivalent awards or other conditions in the Plan are satisfied.
 
Vested awards granted under the Plan will expire, terminate, or otherwise be forfeited as follows: (i) three (3) months after the effective date of termination of a participant other than a non-employee director (in which case the date will be six months following the date such non-employee director cease to be a director), including voluntary termination by the participant, other than in the circumstances described below, (ii) upon termination of a participant for Misconduct (as defined in the Plan), (iii) twelve (12) months after the date on which a participant, other than a non-employee director, suffers total or permanent Disability (as defined in the Plan), (iv) twelve (12) months after the death of a participant, and (v) six (6) months after the date of the participant's Retirement (as defined in the Plan).
 
The Plan will terminate on June 14, 2015, unless terminated by the Board or the Committee earlier, or extended by an amendment approved by the Company's shareholders. No awards may be made after the termination date. However, unless otherwise expressly provided in an applicable award agreement, any award granted under the Plan prior to the expiration may extend beyond the end of such period through the award's normal expiration date.
 
The Board, and the Committee, may generally amend or terminate the plan as determined to be advisable. Shareholder approval may also be required for certain amendments by the Internal Revenue Code, the rules of Nasdaq, or rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Board or the Committee has specific authority to amend the plan without shareholder approval to comply with legal, regulatory and listing requirements and to avoid unanticipated consequences determined to be inconsistent with the purpose of the Plan or any award agreement.
 
Without the approval of the Company's shareholders, no option or SAR may be amended to reduce its exercise price or grant price and no option or SAR may be canceled and replaced with an option or SAR having a lower exercise price.
The Plan provides that the automatic stock option grants made to non-employee directors of the Company under the 1996 Stock Option Plan will continue under the Plan until such time as such grants are terminated or amended by the Board or the Governance and Nomination Committee thereof. As a result, the Plan provides that each non-employee director (an "Eligible Director") will receive, as an initial grant, on the date that the person becomes an Eligible Director, a nonqualified stock option to purchase 25,000 shares of Common Stock, which shall become exercisable as to 12,500 shares on or after the first anniversary date of the grant of such Option and as to the remaining 12,500 shares on or after the second anniversary date of the grant of such Option. In addition, after the initial option grant, each Eligible Director shall automatically receive, on January 15 of each year, an additional nonqualified stock option for that number of shares of Common Stock that shall result in an option value of $30,000 based on the Black-Scholes method of option valuation; provided that a director will not receive an additional annual grant on the first January 15 date that occurs after the initial grant unless the initial grant date is at least 270 days after the first January 15 date that occurs after the initial grant. Each additional nonqualified stock option granted to Eligible Directors shall become exercisable as to one-third (1/3) of the total number of shares covered thereby on or after the first anniversary date of the grant of such option, and an additional one-third (1/3) of such total number of shares on or after each consecutive anniversary date thereafter until the option has become exercisable as to all of such total number of shares.
 
Each nonqualified stock option granted to Eligible Directors pursuant to the automatic grant provisions will have an exercise price equal to 100% of the fair market value of a share of Common Stock on the grant date and shall expire upon the earliest of: (i) ten years from the date the option was granted, (ii) the termination of the Plan, and (iii) three months after the date on which the person ceases to be any of a director, consultant or employee of the Company and its subsidiaries, except that if the cessation of services was caused by the person's death or disability, the expiration of one year after the cessation of such services.

EFFECT OF COMMITTEE'S DECISION

.
SHARES SUBJECT TO THE PLAN
 
. The shares of Common Stock reserved under this Plan will include reserved shares of Common Stock as to which an option award granted has been forfeited or terminated without exercise under the Former Plan plus an additional Three Million Five Hundred Thousand (3,500,000) shares of Common Stock. Subject to the provisions of Sections 5 of the Plan, the maximum aggregate number of Shares (adjusted, proportionately, in the event of any stock split or stock dividend with respect to the Shares) which may be granted as Incentive Stock Options under the Plan shall not exceed One Million (1,000,000) Shares. The aggregate number of Shares available for issuance under the Plan will be reduced by one Share for each Share delivered in settlement of an Option and by two Shares for each Share delivered in settlement of any Award of Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, SARs, or Performance Shares or Performance Units unless a greater reduction is specified by the Committee with respect to a specific Award grant. If an Award expires, is forfeited or becomes unexercisable for any reason without having been exercised in full, the undelivered Shares which were subject thereto shall, unless the Plan shall have been terminated, become available for future Awards under the Plan. Shares available for issuance under the Plan shall be increased by any shares of Common Stock subject to outstanding awards under the Former Plan on the Effective Date that later cease to be subject to such awards for any reason other than such awards having been exercised, subject to adjustment from time to time as provided in Section 5, which shares of Common Stock shall, as of the date such shares cease to be subject to such awards, cease to be available for grant and issuance under the Former Plan, but shall be available for issuance under the Plan. The Shares may be authorized but unissued, or reacquired shares of Common Stock. The Company, during the term of this Plan, will at all times reserve and keep available such number of Shares as shall be sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Plan.
RESERVATION OF SHARES
 
. The date of grant of an Award shall, for all purposes, be the date on which the Company completes the corporate action relating to the grant of such Award and all conditions to the grant have been satisfied, provided that conditions to the exercise of an Award shall not defer the date of grant. Notice of a grant shall be given to each Participant to whom an Award is so granted within a reasonable time after the determination has been made.
TIME OF GRANTING AWARDS
 
. Shares shall not be issued pursuant to the exercise of an Award unless the exercise of such Award and the issuance and delivery of such Shares pursuant thereto shall comply with all relevant provisions of law, including, without
SECURITIES LAW COMPLIANCE
limitation, the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Exchange Act, the rules and regulations promulgated under either such Act, and the requirements of any stock exchange or quotation system upon which the Shares may then be listed or quoted, and shall be further subject to the approval of counsel for the Company with respect to such compliance.
 
. The Board or the Committee shall have the right to substitute or assume Awards in connection with mergers, reorganizations, separations, or other transactions to which Section 424(a) of the Code applies, provided such substitutions and assumptions are permitted by Section 424 of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder. The number of Shares reserved pursuant to Section 4(a) may be increased by the corresponding number of Awards assumed and, in the case of a substitution, by the net increase in the number of Shares subject to Awards before and after the substitution.
SUBSTITUTIONS AND ASSUMPTIONS
 
. If any change is made to the Shares by reason of any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, combination of shares, exchange of shares or other change affecting the outstanding Shares as a class without the Company's receipt of consideration, appropriate adjustments shall be made to (i) the maximum number and/or class of securities issuable under the Plan, (ii) the number and/or class of securities and/or the price per Share covered by outstanding Awards under the Plan and (iii) the Maximum Annual Participant Award. The Committee may also make adjustments described in (i)-(iii) of the previous sentence in the event of any distribution of assets to shareholders other than a normal cash dividend, if any. In determining adjustments to be made under this Section 5, the Committee may take into account such factors as it deems appropriate, including the restrictions of applicable law and the potential tax consequences of an adjustment, and in light of such factors may make adjustments that are not uniform or proportionate among outstanding Awards. Adjustments, if any, and any determinations or interpretations, including any determination of whether a distribution is other than a normal cash dividend, made by the Committee shall be final, binding and conclusive. For purposes of this Section 5, conversion of any convertible securities of the Company shall not be deemed to have been "effected without receipt of consideration."
ADJUSTMENTS TO SHARES SUBJECT TO THE PLAN
 
Except as expressly provided herein, no issuance by the Company of shares of any class, or securities convertible into shares of any class, shall affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with respect to, the number or price of Shares subject to an Award.
 
 
.
GENERAL ELIGIBILITY
 
. Awards may be granted to Participants who are Employees, Directors or Consultants; provided however that Incentive Stock Options may only be granted to Employees.
AWARDS
 
. The aggregate number of Shares with respect to which an Award or Awards may be granted to any one Participant in any one taxable year of the Company (the "Maximum Annual Participant Award") shall not exceed 300,000 shares of Common Stock (increased, proportionately, in the event of any stock split or stock dividend with respect to the Shares).
MAXIMUM ANNUAL PARTICIPANT AWARD
 
. Nothing in the Plan shall confer upon any Participant the right to an Award or to continue in service as an Employee or Consultant for any period of specific duration, or interfere with or otherwise restrict in any way the rights of the Company (or any Subsidiary employing or retaining such person), or of any Participant, which rights are hereby expressly reserved by each, to terminate such person's services at any time for any reason, with or without cause. ).
NO EMPLOYMENT/SERVICE RIGHTS
 
AWARDS TO NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS; CONTINUATION OF AUTOMATIC GRANTS. The aggregate number of Shares with respect to which Awards may be granted to Non-Employee Directors under the Plan shall be 500,000 shares of Common Stock (increased proportionately in the event of any stock split or stock dividend with respect to the Shares). Unless and until amended or terminated by the Board or the Governance and Nomination Committee thereof, the automatic Award grants to Non-Employee Directors contemplated by Section 17.6 of the Former Plan shall terminate under the Former Plan and continue under the Plan from and after the Effective Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Former Plan, unless otherwise determined by the Board or the Committee, all Non-Employee Directors shall be eligible to receive the automatic Award grants contemplated by Section 17.6 of the Former Plan.
 
.
PROCEDURE FOR EXERCISE OF AWARDS; RIGHTS AS A SHAREHOLDER
 
. An Award shall be exercised when written, electronic or verbal notice of exercise has been given to the Company, or the brokerage firm or firms approved by the Company to facilitate exercises and sales under this Plan, in accordance with the terms of the Award by the person entitled to exercise the Award and full payment for the Shares with respect to which the Award is exercised has been received by the Company or the brokerage firm or firms, as applicable. The notification to the brokerage firm shall be made in accordance with procedures of such brokerage firm approved by the Company. Full payment may, as authorized by the Committee, consist of any consideration and method of payment allowable under Section 7(b) of the Plan. The Company shall issue (or cause to be issued) such share certificate promptly upon exercise of the Award. In the event that the exercise of an Award is treated in part as the exercise of an Incentive Stock Option and in part as the exercise of a Nonqualified Stock Option pursuant to Section 10(a), the Company shall issue a share certificate evidencing the Shares treated as acquired upon the exercise of an Incentive Stock Option and a separate share certificate evidencing
PROCEDURE
the Shares treated as acquired upon the exercise of a Nonqualified Stock Option, and shall identify each such certificate accordingly in its share transfer records. No adjustment will be made for a dividend or other right for which the record date is prior to the date the share certificate is issued, except as provided in Section 5 of the Plan.
 
. The consideration to be paid for any Shares to be issued upon exercise or other required settlement of an Award, including the method of payment, shall be determined by the Committee at the time of settlement and which forms may include: (i) with respect to an Option and subject to any restrictions or limitations imposed under applicable law, a request that the Company or the designated brokerage firm conduct a cashless exercise of the Option; (ii) cash; and (iii) tender of shares of Common Stock owned by the Participant in accordance with rules established by the Committee from time to time. Shares used to pay the exercise price shall be valued at their Fair Market Value on the exercise date. Payment of the aggregate exercise price by means of tendering previously-owned shares of Common Stock shall not be permitted when the same may, in the reasonable opinion of the Company, cause the Company to record a loss or expense as a result thereof.
METHOD OF PAYMENT
 
. To the extent required by applicable federal, state, local or foreign law, the Committee may and/or a Participant shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Company for the satisfaction of any withholding tax obligations that arise with respect to any Incentive Stock Option, Nonqualified Stock Option, SAR, Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units, Performance Shares, Performance Units or any sale of Shares. The Company shall not be required to issue Shares or to recognize the disposition of such Shares until such obligations are satisfied. These obligations may be satisfied by having the Company withhold a portion of the Shares that otherwise would be issued to a Participant under such Award or by tendering Shares previously acquired by the Participant in accordance with rules established by the Committee from time to time.
WITHHOLDING OBLIGATIONS
 
. Except as otherwise provided in this Plan, until the issuance (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company) of the share certificate evidencing such Shares, no right to vote or receive dividends or any other rights as a shareholder shall exist with respect to the Shares subject to the Award, notwithstanding the exercise of the Award.
SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS
 
. An Award may not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred, or disposed of in exchange for consideration, except that an Award may be transferred by will or by the laws of descent or distribution and may be exercised, during the lifetime of the Participant, only by the Participant; unless the Committee permits further transferability, on a general or specific basis, in which case the Committee may impose conditions and limitations on any permitted transferability.
NON-TRANSFERABILITY OF AWARDS
 
.
EXPIRATION OF AWARDS
 
. Unless otherwise provided in the applicable Award Agreement or any severance agreement, vested Awards granted under this Plan shall expire, terminate, or otherwise be forfeited as follows:

three (3) months after the effective date of termination of Active Status for a Participant other than a Non-Employee Director, other than in circumstances covered by (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v) below; or six (6) months after the date a Non-Employee Director ceases to be a Director, other than in circumstances covered by (ii) and (iv) below:
 
immediately upon termination of a Participant's Active Status for Misconduct;
 
twelve (12) months after the date on which a Participant other than a Non-Employee Director ceased performing services as a result of his or her total and permanent Disability;
 
twelve (12) months after the date of the death of a Participant whose Active Status terminated as a result of his or her death; and
 
six (6) months after the date on which the Participant ceased performing services as a result of Retirement.
 
. Notwithstanding subsection (a) above, the Committee shall have the authority to extend the expiration date of any outstanding Option, other than an Incentive Stock Option, or SAR in circumstances in which it deems such action to be appropriate (provided that no such extension shall extend the term of an Option or SAR beyond the date on which the Option or SAR would have expired if no termination of the Employee's Active Status had occurred).
EXTENSION OF TERM
 
. Notwithstanding any other provision in the Plan to the contrary, the following provisions shall apply unless otherwise provided in the most recently executed agreement between the Participant and the Company, or specifically prohibited under applicable laws, or by the rules and regulations of any applicable governmental agencies or national securities exchanges or quotation systems.
EFFECT OF CHANGE OF CONTROL
 
. Awards of a Participant shall be Accelerated (as defined in Section 9(b) below) as follows:
ACCELERATION
 
With respect to Non-Employee Directors, upon the occurrence of a Change of Control described in Section 2(f);
 
With respect to any Employee, upon the occurrence of a Change of Control described in Section 2(f)(i);
With respect to any Employee who Resigns for Good Reason or whose Active Status is terminated, so long as such resignation or termination occurs within one year after a Change of Control described in Section 2(f)(ii), (iii) or (iv); and
 
With respect to any Employee, upon the occurrence of a Change of Control described in Section 2(f)(iv) in connection with which each Award is not assumed or an equivalent award substituted by such successor entity or a parent or subsidiary of such successor entity.
 
. For purposes of this Section 9, Awards of a Participant being "Accelerated" means, with respect to such Participant:
DEFINITION
 
any and all Options and SARs shall become fully vested and immediately exercisable, and shall remain exercisable for the greater of (1) the time period specified in the original Award (but subject to termination upon termination of Active Status in accordance with the terms of the original Award) or, (2) one year following the date of such acceleration;
 
any restriction periods and restrictions imposed on Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units that are not performance-based shall lapse;
 
any restriction periods and restrictions imposed on Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, and Performance Compensation Awards that are performance-based shall lapse, unless such performance-based Awards remain outstanding after the Change of Control (or are assumed by any successor entity) and the applicable Performance Criteria can be accurately tracked following the Change of Control; and
 
the restrictions and deferral limitations and other conditions applicable to any other Awards shall lapse, and such other Awards shall become free of all restrictions, limitations or conditions and become fully vested and transferable to the full extent of the original grant.
 
 
.
GRANT, TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF OPTIONS
 
. Each Option shall be designated in an Award Agreement as either an Incentive Stock Option or a Nonqualified Stock Option. However, notwithstanding such designations, to the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value of the Shares with respect to which Options designated as Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by any Employee during any calendar year (under all plans of the Company) exceeds $100,000, such excess Options shall be treated as Nonqualified Stock Options. Options shall be taken into account in the order in which they were granted.
DESIGNATION
 
. The term of each Option shall be no more than ten (10) years from the date of grant. However, in the case of an Incentive Stock Option granted to a Participant who, at the time the Option is granted, owns Shares representing more than ten percent (10%) of the voting power of all classes of shares of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, the term of the Option shall be no more than five (5) years from the date of grant.
TERMS OF OPTIONS

If granted to an Employee who, at the time of the grant of such Incentive Stock Option, owns shares representing more than ten percent (10%) of the voting power of all classes of shares of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, the per Share exercise price shall be no less than 110% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant.
 
If granted to any other Employee, the per Share exercise price shall be no less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant.
 
The per Share exercise price under a Nonqualified Stock Option or SAR shall be no less than one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant.
 
In no event shall the Board or the Committee be permitted to Reprice an Option after the date of grant without shareholder approval.
 
. To the extent Options vest and become exercisable in increments, such Options shall cease vesting as of the date of the Optionee's Disability or termination of such Optionee's Active Status for reasons other than Retirement or death, in each of which cases such Options shall immediately vest in full.
VESTING
. Any Option granted hereunder shall be exercisable at such times and under such conditions as determined by the Committee at the time of grant, and as are permissible under the terms of the Plan. An Option may not be exercised for a fraction of a Share.

PERFORMANCE BASED STOCK AWARDS
 
. Subject to the provisions of Section 9 of this Plan, unless the Committee determines otherwise, the Award Agreement shall provide for the forfeiture of the non-vested Shares underlying Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units upon the termination of a Participant's Active Status.

(iii) The distribution with respect to an exercised Stand-Alone SAR may be made in Shares valued at Fair Market Value on the exercise date, in cash, or partly in Shares and partly in cash, as the Committee shall deem appropriate.

ELIGIBILITY
Performance Compensation Award shall be decided solely in accordance with the provisions of this Section 13. Moreover, designation of a Participant eligible to receive a Performance Compensation Award hereunder for a particular Performance Period shall not require designation of such Participant eligible to receive a Performance Compensation Award hereunder in any subsequent Performance Period and designation of one person as a Participant eligible to receive a Performance Compensation Award hereunder shall not require designation of any other person as a Participant eligible to receive a Performance Compensation Award hereunder in such period or in any other period.

. The Committee is authorized at any time during the first ninety (90) days of a Performance Period (or, if shorter, within the maximum period allowed under Section 162(m) of the Code), or any time thereafter (but only to the extent the exercise of such authority after such 90-day period (or such shorter period, if applicable) would not cause the Performance Compensation Awards granted to any participant for the Performance Period to fail to qualify as "qualified performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code), in its sole discretion, to adjust or modify the calculation of a Performance Goal for such Performance Period to the extent permitted under Section 162(m) of the Code (i) in the event of, or in anticipation of, any unusual or extraordinary corporate item, transaction, event or development affecting the Company (to the extent applicable to such Performance Goal) or (ii) in recognition of, or in anticipation of, any other unusual or nonrecurring events affecting the Company (to the extent applicable to such Performance Goal), or the financial statements of the Company (to the extent applicable to such Performance Goal), or of changes in applicable rules, rulings, regulations or other requirements of any governmental body or securities exchange, accounting principles, law or business conditions.

(iii) Following the completion of a Performance Period, the Committee shall meet to review and certify in writing whether, and to what extent, the Performance Goals for the Performance Period have been achieved and, if so, to calculate and certify in writing that amount of the Performance Compensation Awards earned for the period based upon the Performance Formula. The Committee shall then determine the actual size of each Participant's Performance Compensation Award for the Performance Period.
 
(iv) [Intentionally omitted]
 
(v) The Performance Compensation Awards granted for a Performance Period shall be paid to Participants as soon as administratively possible following completion of the certifications required by Section 13(e)(iii), unless the Committee shall determine that any Performance Compensation Award shall be deferred.

Amended and Restated Employment Agreements
 
On June 27, 2005, BJ's Restaurants, Inc. (the "Company") entered into Amended and Restated Employment Agreements with each of Paul Motenko and Jeremiah Hennessy (the "Employment Agreements"). The forms of Employment Agreements were identical except that the agreement provides that Mr. Motenko will serve as the Co-Chairman, Secretary and as a Vice President of the Company whereas Mr. Hennessy's Employment Agreement provides that he will serve only as the Co-Chairman.
 
A brief summary of the terms of the Employment Agreements are set forth below. The description below is qualified in its entirely by the complete text of the Employment Agreements which are attached to this Form 8-k as exhibits 10.1 and 10.2.
 
. Unless earlier terminated, the term of Mr. Motenko and Mr. Hennessy's employment shall end on December 31, 2009; provided, however, that his employment term shall be extended for additional one year periods unless and until the Company or Mr. Motenko or Mr. Hennessy, as the case may be, gives notice of its or his intention not to renew.
Term
 
. Mr. Motenko shall serve as the Co-Chairman of the Company as well as a Vice President and Secretary. Mr. Hennessy shall serve as Co-Chairman of the Company. The Employment Agreements provide that the position of Co-Chairman shall be an executive office of the Company. During the term of the Agreement, the Company (and its Board of Directors) are obligated to take such reasonable actions within their control to cause Mr. Motenko and Mr. Hennessy to continue to be appointed or elected to the Board of Directors. In addition, should Gerald Deitchle, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, resign or be terminated, the Company has agreed to use its best efforts to cause Mr. Motenko and Mr. Hennessy to each be reinstated as Co-Chief Executive Officers of the Company.
Position
 
Base Salary, Bonus and Benefits.
 
Each of Mr. Motenko and Mr. Hennessy is entitled to receive annual cash compensation of $300,000, subject to escalation annually in accordance with the Consumer Price Index. In addition, each of Mr. Motenko and Mr. Hennessy is entitled to receive a lump sum payment equal to the amount by which the base salary paid to them from January 1, 2005 through the effective date of the Employment Agreements was less than the base salary that would have been paid to them under the Employment Agreements had they been in effect on January 1, 2005. Bonuses for 2005 and all bonuses thereafter shall be determined by the Board in its sole discretion.
 
Each of Mr. Motenko and Mr. Hennessy is entitled to certain other fringe benefits including use of a Company automobile or automobile allowance of $1,000 per month, a $1,000,000 life insurance policy (premiums for which shall not exceed $7,500 per year) on the life of Mr. Motenko and Mr. Hennessy, as the case may be, with the beneficiaries designated by Mr. Motenko or Mr. Hennessy. In addition, they are entitled to receive customary vacation benefits, family health insurance and the right to participate in the Company's customary executive benefit plans.
 
Termination.
 
The Company may terminate Mr. Motenko and/or Mr. Hennessy's employment at any time. If the termination is by the Company for "Cause" (as defined below), as a result of the death or "Disability" (as defined below) of Mr. Motenko or Mr. Hennessy, or by Mr. Motenko or Mr. Hennessy for reasons other than "Good Reason" (as defined below), Mr. Motenko and Mr. Hennessy, as the case may be, will be entitled to receive all amounts payable by the Company under his employment agreement to the date of termination (including a prorated portion of any accrued bonuses). In addition, if the termination is by the Company or Mr. Motenko or Hennessy, as the case may be, as a result of "Disability," to the extent that Mr Motenko or Hennessy is not covered by any other comprehensive insurance that provides a comparable level of benefits, the Company will pay an amount equivalent to the terminated executive's COBRA payments for up to 18 months following the termination or the maximum term allowable by then applicable law for coverage. For purposes hereof, "Disability" shall mean incapacity due to physical or mental illness which results in the executive being absent from the full-time performance of substantially all of his material duties with the Company for 90 consecutive days or 180 days in any 12 month period.
 
In the event of termination of employment by the Company without "Cause" or by Mr. Motenko or Mr. Hennessy for "Good Reason," Mr. Motenko or Mr. Hennessy, as the case may be, shall be entitled to receive the following: (i) such Base Salary, vacation, prorated bonus and other benefits as have been earned through the date of termination and, to the extent that the executive is not

In addition, in the event of a termination without "Cause" or for "Good Reason," the Options (as described and defined below) shall continue to vest and remain exercisable through the end of the remaining term of the employment agreement. In addition, in the event there is a Change of Control within 12 months following a termination by the Company without Cause, executive shall be entitled to a cash payment equal to the amount, if any, by which the aggregate fair market value of the shares subject to any unvested Options or subsequent stock options exceeds the aggregate exercise price of such options on the effective date of termination.
 
For purposes of the Employment Agreements, "Cause" means (i) an act or acts of dishonesty undertaken by the executive and intended to result in material personal gain or enrichment of him or others at the expense of the Company; (ii) gross misconduct that is willful or deliberate on the executive's part and that, in either event, is materially injurious to the Company, (iii) the conviction of the executive of a felony; or (iv) the material breach of any terms and conditions of his employment agreement by the executive, which breach has not been cured within 30 days after written notice thereof from the Company. The cessation of employment by Mr. Motenko or Mr. Hennessy, as the case may be, shall not be deemed to be for Cause unless and until there shall have been delivered to the executive in question, a copy of a resolution, duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than a majority of the entire membership of the Board (not including the executive in question) at a meeting of the Board called and held for such purpose (after reasonable notice to the executive and an opportunity for him, together with his counsel, to be heard before the Board), finding that, in the good faith opinion of the Board, one or more causes for termination exist and specifying the particulars thereof in detail.
 
For purposes of the Employment Agreements, "Good Reason" means
 
(i) any removal of the executive from, or any failure to nominate or re-elect the executive to, his current office and/or the Board, except in connection with termination of executive's employment for death, Disability or Cause,
 
(ii) the failure of the Company to obtain the assumption of the Employment Agreement by any successor to the Company, as provided in the Employment Agreement,
 
(iii) the material breach by the Company of any terms and conditions of the Employment Agreement, which breach has not been cured by the Company within thirty (30) days after written notice thereof to the Company from the executive,
 
(iv) the assignment to the executive of duties that represent or constitute a material adverse change in the executive's position, duties, responsibilities or status with the Company;
 
(v) the appointment of any person other than Gerald W. Deitchle as Chief Executive Officer of the Company (or an office having substantially the same responsibilities); or
 
(vi) in the event of certain events constituting a change in control of the Company
 
(a)(1) any reduction in the executive's then-current base salary or any material reduction in Mr. Motenko or Mr. Hennessy's, as the case may be, comprehensive benefit package (other than changes, if any, required by group insurance carriers applicable to all persons covered under such plans or changes required under applicable law), (2) the assignment to the executive of duties that represent or constitute a material adverse change in such executive's position, duties, responsibilities and status with the Company immediately prior to a change in control, or (3) a material adverse change in the executive's reporting responsibilities, titles, offices, or any removal of such executive from, or any failure to re-elect the executive to, any of such positions; except in connection with the termination of executive's employment for Cause, upon his Disability or death, or upon the voluntary termination by the executive;
 
(b) the relocation of Mr. Motenko or Mr. Hennessy's, as the case may be, place of employment from the location at which he was principally employed immediately prior to the date of the change in control to a location more than 50 miles from such location; or
 
(c) the failure of any successor to the Company to assume and agree to perform its obligations under the executive's employment agreement.
Pursuant to the terms of the Employment Agreements, each of Mr. Motenko and Mr. Hennessy received an initial grant of stock options to purchase 85,000 shares of the Company's common stock under the Company's 2005 Equity Incentive Plan (the "Options"). Each of the Options vests as follows: (i) 34,000 shares upon grant, (ii) 17,000 shares on December 31, 2007, (iii) 17,000 shares on December 31, 2008 and (iv) 17,000 shares on December 31, 2009. The option exercise price is the closing price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant.

2.2 The Company and the Board shall take all reasonable action within their control to cause Executive to continue to be appointed or elected to the Board during the term of this Agreement.

(ii) gross misconduct that is willful or deliberate on Executive's part and that, in either event, is materially injurious to the Company;
 
(iii) the conviction of Executive of a felony; or
 
(iv) the material breach of any terms and conditions of this Agreement by Executive, which breach has not been cured by Executive within thirty (30) days after written notice thereof to Executive from the Company.

Without Cause
 
comprehensive health insurance for Executive, his spouse and his dependants under Company benefit plans through the later of (i) eighteen (18) months following the termination of employment or (ii) the Termination Date or any Extended Termination Date; provided, however, that in the event Executive is not eligible for continuation of coverage thereunder, the Company shall reimburse Executive for the costs of maintaining comparable comprehensive health insurance for such period, (4) any Initial Options and subsequent options and any replacement options in any successor entity that were obtained by Executive in exchange for the Initial Options or subsequent options will continue to vest and remain exercisable until the later of the Termination Date or any Extended Termination Date, and (5) in the event Executive is living and a Change of Control occurs within twelve (12) months following any termination by the Company without Cause, Executive shall be entitled to receive, simultaneously with completion of any Change in Control transaction, a cash payment equal to the amount, if any, by which the aggregate fair market value (determined as of the Effective Date of Termination in accordance with the Plan) of the shares subject to any unvested Initial Options or subsequent options exceeds the aggregate exercise price of such options measured as of the Effective Date of Termination.
 
11.5 . Executive may terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days written notice to the Company.

Executive shall notify the Company in writing of any claim by the Internal Revenue Service that, if successful, would require the payment by the Company of the Gross-Up Payment. Such notification shall be given as soon as practicable after Executive is informed in writing of such claim.

determination of which in that respect shall be final, binding, and conclusive. No right to purchase fractional shares shall result from any adjustment of the Option pursuant to this Section.

Optionee may not transfer all or any part of the Option except by will, by the laws of descent and distribution, by instrument to an inter vivos or testamentary trust in which the options are to be passed to beneficiaries upon the death of the trustor (settlor), or by gift to "immediate family" as that term is defined in Title 17, Section 240.16a-1(e) of the Code of Federal Regulations.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
BJ'S RESTAURANTS, INC. REPORTS RECORD FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2005
 
Huntington Beach, CA  July 27, 2005 - BJ's Restaurants, Inc. (NASDAQ: BJRI) today reported record revenues and net income for the second fiscal quarter of 2005 ended July 3, 2005.
 
Highlights for the second quarter, compared to the same quarter last year, were as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
"We were pleased with our financial results for the second quarter of 2005," said Jerry Deitchle, President and CEO. "Our 4.8% increase in comparable sales for the quarter represented our 35th consecutive quarter of growth on this measure since our IPO in 1996. Sales volumes for our newly opened restaurants continue to exceed our initial expectations. Additionally, the eight restaurants in our comparable sales base that are outside our home state of California achieved a comparable sales increase of 6.7% during the quarter, which is very encouraging. Our management team has recently commenced several key initiatives that are intended to improve the quality of the BJ's dining experience, improve the quality and depth of our restaurant management talent base, and provide more modern, robust toolsets for our restaurant managers to help them run more productive and efficient operations. These initiatives should be gradually phased in during the next 12-24 months. We remain very excited about our prospects for continued profitable growth."
 
"We opened our 41st restaurant yesterday in Mesa, Arizona (a suburb of Phoenix) and were delighted with our opening day's sales," commented Deitchle. "Mesa represents our sixth new restaurant opened to date during 2005. We currently plan to open three additional restaurants during the remainder of 2005 (San Mateo, CA; Sugarland, TX; and San Bruno, CA). Our current restaurant growth objective is to achieve annual capacity increases of 20% to 25% in a careful, controlled manner with the goal of preserving our favorable unit-level economics as we grow. Our real estate pipeline for 2006 is in excellent shape at this point, and we are beginning to work on potential restaurant locations for fiscal 2007."
 
Effective with the fiscal third quarter of 2005, the Company will change its fiscal week-end from Sunday to Tuesday. This change should facilitate operational efficiencies by transferring certain administrative tasks away from the weekends when our restaurants are busiest. Accordingly, our fiscal third quarter of 2005 will contain two additional days and will end on October 4, 2005. Fiscal 2005 will end on Tuesday, January 3, 2006.

Re: Employment Agreement
 
Dear Greg:
 
This letter outlines the terms of your employment (the "Agreement") with BJ's Restaurants Inc. (the "Company"). Your employment will begin on September 6, 2005 (the "Effective Date"), contingent upon the results of a background investigation and your acceptance of these terms.
 
1. Duties. Company will employ you as Chief Financial Officer. In that capacity, you will perform such duties as the Company, in the exercise of its sole discretion, deems appropriate for that position. You will report to the Company's Chief Executive Officer (CEO).
 
2. Salary. You will receive a bi-weekly salary of $9,615.38, which annualizes to a yearly salary of $250,000 payable in accordance with the Company's payroll policies, as such policies may change from time to time (the "Salary"). Your salary is subject to modification during your employment in accordance with the Company's practices, policies and procedures and your performance. Your cash bonus percentage opportunity will be at 35% of your salary, with such cash bonus opportunity to be calculated on the basis of an entire fiscal year's performance, with any fiscal 2005 cash bonus to be prorated to the Effective Date. Your cash bonus opportunity will be driven by the degree of the Company's achievement of its net income goal for the year (approximately 80%) and the degree of your achievement, as determined by the CEO in his sole and absolute judgment, of certain key initiatives and objectives agreed upon by you and the CEO (approximately 20%). These approximate percentage components may change in subsequent fiscal years. If the Company terminates your employment without cause, on or after September 1, 2005, you will be eligible to receive a severance payment of six (6) months salary and, if you are not covered by any other comprehensive group medical insurance plan, the Company will also pay you an amount equivalent to your COBRA payments for a period of six (6) months. Any severance amounts paid will be based upon your then current salary at the time employment ends and will be paid in a lump sum, less applicable withholdings.
 
3. Cause. For the purpose of the severance payment provision in this Agreement only, "Cause" shall mean
 
(i) an act or acts of dishonesty undertaken by you and intended to result in material personal gain or enrichment of you or others at the expense of the Company;
(ii) gross misconduct that is willful or deliberate on your part and that, in either event, is materially injurious to the Company;
 
(iii) your conviction of a felony; or
 
(iv) the material breach of any terms and conditions of this Agreement by you, which breach has not been cured by you within 30 days after written notice thereof to you from the Company.
 
The cessation of employment by you shall not be deemed to be for Cause unless and until there shall have been delivered to you a written notice thereof by the CEO, after reasonable notice to you and an opportunity for you, together with your counsel, to be heard before the CEO, finding that, in the good faith opinion of the CEO, one or more causes for termination exist under this agreement and specifying the particulars thereof in detail. Any disputes as to whether Cause to dismiss you exists shall be resolved by arbitration conducted in Orange County, California in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association and by a single arbitrator reasonably acceptable to both you and the Company. In the event of termination for Cause, you will be entitled to receive such unpaid Salary, accrued vacation pay, and any other unpaid benefits as may have accrued under this Agreement through and on the date of your termination, but not any prorated cash bonus. You will also be permitted to exercise any vested stock options, in accordance with the terms of the stock option plan under which the options were granted, and to extend your group medical insurance coverage at your own expense for up to 18 months following your termination date or the maximum term allowable by then applicable law for coverage of you and your eligible dependents, but you will not be entitled to any other salary, benefits, cash bonuses or other compensation after such date.
 
4. Stock Options. Subject to applicable securities laws and the approval of the Company's Board of Directors, you shall be granted an option to purchase 100,000 shares of the Company's common stock, at a per share exercise price equal to the closing fair market value of the Company's common stock on the date of grant, which will be the Effective Date of your employment with Company, pursuant to the Company's 2005 Equity Incentive Plan. Vesting for this nonqualified stock option grant will be 20% for each year, beginning with the first anniversary of the Effective Date, over a total of five (5) years. You will be eligible for additional stock option grants from time to time at the discretion of the Board of Directors.
 
5. Other Benefits. You shall be entitled to participate in any benefit plan that the Company may offer to its employees from time to time, according to the terms of such plan, including, but not limited to, the Company's group medical insurance program, which will become effective the first of the month following 90 days from your Effective Date, and the Company will cover 100% of the expense for medical insurance for you and your dependents, but not for any taxable income realized by you as a result of that reimbursement. The Company will reimburse any COBRA expense incurred during the first 90 days for you and any dependents currently covered. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall affect the right of Company to terminate or modify any such plan or agreement, or other benefit, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time. You will also receive a monthly nonaccountable
 
automobile allowance of $1,000, less applicable withholdings. A Company-provided credit card, a cell phone and laptop will be issued to you for Company business purposes.
 
6. Vacation. Vacation shall be accrued at a rate of three (3) weeks per year. Sick leave shall accrue and will be treated in accordance with the Company's policies and procedures as may be amended from time to time.
 
7. Trade Secrets/Confidentiality. You hereby acknowledge that, as a result of your position with the Company, the Company will give you access to the Company's proprietary and confidential information and trade secrets. Therefore, as a condition of your employment and the Company's disclosing such proprietary and confidential information to you, you agree to sign and be bound by a Trade Secrets/Confidentiality Agreement.
 
8. You will be required to comply with the Company's policies and procedures, as they may be constituted from time to time. Notwithstanding, the terms set forth in this Agreement or any other written fully executed agreement between you and the Company shall prevail over conflicting Company policies and procedures.
 
9. Severability. If any provision contained in this Agreement is determined to be void, illegal or unenforceable, in whole or in part, then the other provisions contained herein shall remain in full force and effect as if the provision which was determined to be void, illegal, or unenforceable had not been contained herein.

BJ'S RESTAURANTS, INC. REPORTS RECORD FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2005
 
Huntington Beach, CA  October 27, 2005 - BJ's Restaurants, Inc. (NASDAQ: BJRI) today reported record revenues and net income for the third fiscal quarter of 2005 ended October 4, 2005.
 
Highlights for the third quarter, compared to the same quarter last year, were as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
"We were very pleased with our third quarter 2005 financial results," said Jerry Deitchle, President and CEO. "Our 5.5% comparable sales increase for the quarter represented our 36th consecutive quarter of growth in comparable restaurant sales since the Company's IPO in 1996. Additionally, we continue to be pleased with our positive sales momentum outside of our home state of California. The nine restaurants in our comparable base that are located outside of California achieved a 7.1% increase in comparable restaurant sales for the quarter. These solid sales increases provide a strong testimonial to BJ's ability to build its favorable reputation and gain market share in new markets over time."
 
The Company opened three new restaurants during the month of October 2005 (San Bruno, CA; Sugar Land, TX, and San Mateo, CA), bringing its total restaurant openings to nine for 2005 and thereby successfully achieving its stated goal to open eight or more restaurants during the year. The Company currently expects to open as many as 11 new restaurants during 2006. Signed leases or letters of intent are in hand for all of the potential 2006 openings, and several signed letters of intent are already in hand for potential 2007 openings. "We will continue to execute our restaurant growth plan in a careful, controlled manner with the goal of achieving a high quality 20% to 25% annual capacity increase for the next several years," commented Deitchle.
 
As previously announced, the results for both the fiscal third quarter and nine periods ended October 4, 2005 included two additional days of operations when compared to the same periods of the prior year. Effective in the third quarter, we changed our fiscal week-end from Sunday to Tuesday. This change was completed to facilitate operational efficiencies by transferring certain administrative tasks away from the weekends when our restaurants are busiest. Fiscal 2005 will end on Tuesday, January 3, 2006.

Exhibit 99.1 BJ's Restaurants, Inc. Reports Strong Financial Results for the Fourth Quarter of Fiscal 2005 HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Feb. 23, 2006--BJ's Restaurants, Inc. (NASDAQ:BJRI) today reported strong financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended January 3, 2006. Highlights for the 13-week fourth quarter of 2005 compared to the 14-week fourth quarter of 2004 were as follows: -- Revenues increased 30% to $49.3 million -- Comparable restaurant sales increased 5.3% -- Net income increased 80% to $2.3 million -- Diluted net income per share increased 67% to $0.10 Highlights for the 52-week fiscal year ended January 3, 2006 compared to the 53-week fiscal year ended January 2, 2005 were as follows: -- Revenues increased 38% to $178.2 million -- Comparable restaurant sales increased 4.6% -- Net income increased 33% to $8.4 million -- Net income of $8.4 million increased 65% excluding the one-time gain from the disposal of the Company's former Pietro's Restaurants in fiscal 2004 -- Diluted net income per share increased 20% to $0.36 -- Diluted net income of $0.36 per share increased 44% excluding the one-time gain from the disposal of the Company's former Pietro's Restaurants in fiscal 2004 "Our management team was very pleased with our financial results for the fourth quarter," commented Jerry Deitchle, President and CEO. "Comparable restaurant sales increased 5.3% during the quarter, which represented our 37th consecutive quarter of positive comparisons on that measure since our 1996 IPO. We were also pleased with the sales of our comparable restaurants located outside of our core market of California, which collectively achieved a sales increase of 7.8% during the quarter. Our Company also achieved record levels of new restaurant openings, revenues, net income and diluted net income per share during 2005. We continue to have solid confidence in our ability to continue executing our growth plan during the upcoming year in a carefully controlled and profitable manner." Three new BJ's Restaurants were opened during the fourth quarter of 2005 (San Bruno, CA; San Mateo, CA and Sugar Land, TX), bringing the total number of new restaurant openings during fiscal 2005 to nine. "We successfully achieved our stated goal at the beginning of 2005 to open as many as eight to nine new restaurants during the year," said Deitchle. "Sales volumes for substantially all of our 2005 openings have continued stronger than we initially expected." The Company's primary growth goal for 2006 is to achieve a 20%-25% increase in total restaurant operating weeks compared to 2005. "During 2006, we currently plan to open as many as 11 new restaurants, of which one has already opened and five more are currently under construction," commented Deitchle. "Additionally, we already have three signed leases and 11 signed letters of intent on hand for potential 2007 and 2008 openings, thanks to the hard work of our outstanding development team led by Greg Lynds. We are very pleased with the quality of all of our potential new restaurant locations." During fiscal 2005, the Company's operating margin expanded approximately 130 basis points to 6.2%, excluding the impact of the one-time gain from the disposal of the Company's former Pietro's Restaurants in fiscal 2004. Including this one-time gain, the operating margin expanded 10 basis points from 6.1% to 6.2%. "There is clearly room for further, gradual improvement in our operating margin over time," said Deitchle. "During fiscal 2006, we plan to install a streamlined kitchen display system (KDS), a powerful web-based labor scheduling and analysis system, and a new theoretical food cost system in substantially all of our restaurants. These state-of-the-art toolsets should provide our restaurant operators with a greater ability to process our business in a more productive and efficient manner, while simultaneously improving the quality and consistency of the BJ's dining experience for our guests." The results for both the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended January 3, 2006 and January 2, 2005 include the reclassification of certain non-food related costs from cost of sales to operating and occupancy expenses, and the reclassification of managers-in-training salaries from restaurant labor to general and administrative expenses. The reclassifications were made to conform to the prevalent practice in the casual dining industry for these costs and do not affect income from operations, net income or net income per share. Beginning with the first quarter of 2006, the Company will adopt FASB Staff Position (FSP) 13-1, "Accounting for Rental Costs Incurred During Construction" which was issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board on October 6, 2005. Under FSP 13-1, the Company will be required to expense non-cash rent during the construction period for its new restaurants. The typical BJ's restaurant takes approximately four months to construct, once the site has been made available. Accordingly, the Company anticipates that its adoption of FSP 13-1 will result in an increase in preopening costs per restaurant in the range of $50,000 to $60,000. However, these costs could vary from restaurant to restaurant, depending on the length of the actual construction period as a result of obtaining permits, weather and other issues that may be beyond the Company's control, as well as the specific terms of each restaurant's lease. Additionally, beginning with the first quarter of 2006, the Company is required to expense stock-based compensation in accordance with FASB 123R, "Share-Based Payment." Excluding any prospective equity award grants in 2006, equity-based compensation expense is currently estimated to approximate $1.5 million, net of taxes, or $0.06 per diluted share during 2006.

Exhibit 99.1 BJ's Restaurants Inc. Co-Chairmen Adopt Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--March 15, 2006--BJ's Restaurants Inc. (Nasdaq:BJRI) today announced that Co-Chairmen Paul Motenko and Jerry Hennessy have each established personal stock trading plans pursuant to, and intended to comply with, Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Under the terms of their plans, Motenko and Hennessy may each sell up to 80,000 shares during the period from March 14, 2006 through Dec. 31, 2006. The shares to be sold will be acquired through the exercise of employee stock options. If Motenko and Hennessy complete all the planned sales of shares under their Rule 10b5-1 plans, they would together continue to own approximately 1.3 million shares and vested options, representing approximately 5.8 percent of the company's outstanding stock (based on the most recently reported number of outstanding shares of the company). "Our optimism for the company's future growth prospects has never been stronger," commented Motenko. "Having said that, both Jerry Hennessy and I have the vast majority of our personal assets invested in company stock and our 10b5-1 plans are being adopted as part of a long-term strategy to diversify a portion of our personal assets." Rule 10b5-1 allows persons who may be considered company insiders to establish written pre-arranged stock trading plans when they do not have material, non-public information. The plans establish predetermined trading parameters that do not permit the person adopting the plan to exercise any subsequent influence over how, when or whether to affect trades. Implementation of these plans seeks to avoid concerns about executing stock transactions while in possession of material, non-public information and to minimize the market impact of stock trades by spreading them over an extended period of time. Transactions under these plans will be disclosed publicly through Form 144 and Form 4 filings as required by the SEC. BJ's Restaurants Inc. currently owns and operates 46 casual dining restaurants under the BJ's Restaurant and Brewery, BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse or BJ's Pizza & Grill brand names. BJ's restaurants offer an innovative and broad menu featuring award-winning, signature deep-dish pizza complemented with generously portioned salads, sandwiches, soups, pastas, entrees and desserts. Quality, flavor, value, moderate prices and sincere service remain distinct attributes of the BJ's experience.

Exhibit 99.1 BJ's Restaurants, Inc. Reports Strong Financial Results for the First Quarter of Fiscal 2006 HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 27, 2006--BJ's Restaurants, Inc. (NASDAQ:BJRI) today reported revenues and net income for the first fiscal quarter ended April 4, 2006. Highlights for the first quarter, compared to the same quarter last year, were as follows: -- Revenues increased 43% to $53.4 million -- Comparable restaurant sales increased 6.8% -- Net income increased 39% to $2.3 million -- Diluted net income per share increased 25% to $0.10 The Company adopted a new accounting standard titled FAS No. 123 (Revised), "Share-Based Payment" during the first quarter of fiscal 2006. FAS No. 123R requires the fair value measurement of all stock-based payments to employees, including grants of stock options, and recognition of those expenses in the Company's results of operations. Including the impact of FAS 123R on a pro-forma basis in the prior year's first quarter, net income increased 107% to $2.3 million compared to non-GAAP pro forma net income of $1.1 million, and diluted net income per share increased 100% to $0.10 compared to non-GAAP pro forma net income per share of $0.05 in the prior year's first quarter. "Our management team was very pleased with the Company's results for the first quarter of 2006," commented Jerry Deitchle, President and CEO. "Our 6.8% comparable sales increase during the first quarter represented our 38th consecutive quarter of positive comparisons on that measure since our 1996 IPO, which is a strong testament to the sustained popularity of the BJ's restaurant concept. Additionally, the 10 restaurants in our comparable sales base that are located outside of our home state of California achieved a strong 11.8% sales increase during the quarter. "We continued to make excellent progress during the quarter with respect to the planned implementation of our fiscal 2006 key initiatives," said Deitchle. "Among other things, our 2006 initiatives include the design, testing and rollout of state-of-the-art toolsets that are intended to help our restaurant operators execute with improved productivity and also achieve a simultaneous improvement in overall food and service quality. Two of these new toolsets, a kitchen display system (KDS) and a web-based labor scheduling program should be rolled out to substantially all of our restaurants by the end of the second quarter." The Company continues to expect to open as many as 11 new restaurants during 2006, of which three new restaurants opened during the first quarter (Vacaville, CA; Phoenix, AZ; and Westminster, CO). "Our real estate pipeline remains in excellent shape as of today," commented Deitchle. "We have signed leases in hand for as many as eight more openings during fiscal 2006. Of those eight potential new restaurants, five are currently under construction as of today. Additionally, we already have 15 signed leases or signed letters of intent in hand for potential 2007 and 2008 openings." In connection with its adoption of FAS 123R, the Company analyzed its share-based payments (stock option grants) and considered the related tax effects of those grants. In the past, the Company has granted both incentive stock options (ISO) and nonqualified stock options. All compensation expense resulting from the exercise of nonqualified stock options results in a tax benefit. However, the tax benefit of compensation expense relating to ISOs ultimately depends on the timing of when the option is exercised and when the acquired shares are subsequently sold. As a result, the Company anticipates an increase of approximately 200 basis points to its fiscal 2006 effective tax rate related to the potential non-deductibility of compensation expense related to its prior grants of incentive stock options. The Company now expects the total impact of FAS 123R on diluted net income per share to be approximately $0.08 during fiscal 2006, excluding any prospective share-based payments granted during fiscal 2006.

This pro forma non-GAAP financial information includes financial measures which the Company reconciles to the results reported in accordance with GAAP. The Company believes that pro forma non-GAAP reporting for prior periods, giving effect to the adjustments shown in the reconciliation below, is useful to investors to permit them to compare the Company's results to prior periods using consistent assumptions regarding stock-based compensation. In addition, the Company believes that its competitors report similar non-GAAP financial information and, as a result, investors, analysts and others in the investment community expect such information to be reported as it allows them to better compare the Company's results with those of its competitors. The Company uses such non-GAAP financial measures to analyze and compare the performance of its core business.

Exhibit 99.1 BJ's Restaurants Inc. Reports Strong Financial Results for the Second Quarter of Fiscal 2006 HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 27, 2006--BJ's Restaurants Inc. (NASDAQ:BJRI) today reported revenues and net income for the second quarter ended July 4, 2006. Highlights for the 13 weeks ended July 4, 2006, compared to the 13 weeks ended July 3, 2005, were as follows: -- Revenues increased approximately 32% to $57.8 million -- Comparable restaurant sales increased 5.9% -- Net income increased approximately 14% to $2.3 million -- Diluted net income per share increased 11% to $0.10 During the first quarter of fiscal 2006, the company adopted SFAS No. 123 (Revised), "Share-Based Payment." SFAS No. 123R requires the fair value measurement of all stock-based payments to employees, including grants of stock options, and recognition of those expenses in the company's results of operations. Including the impact of FAS No. 123R on a pro-forma basis in the prior year's second quarter, net income increased approximately 64% to $2.3 million compared to non-GAAP pro-forma net income of $1.4 million, and diluted net income per share increased approximately 67% to $0.10 compared to non-GAAP pro-forma net income per share of $0.06 in the prior year's second quarter. "We were pleased with our financial results for the second quarter of 2006," commented Jerry Deitchle, president and CEO. "Our 5.9% comparable sales increase during the second quarter represented our 39th consecutive quarter of positive comparisons on that measure since our 1996 IPO, and was achieved in spite of a very difficult sales and operating environment for casual dining restaurants in general. We believe that our positive sales trends can be principally attributed to BJ's continuing favorable price/value relationship as perceived by our guests, coupled with improving operational execution." The company completed the initial rollouts of its new kitchen display system (KDS) and Web-based labor scheduling system ahead of schedule during the second quarter. "These state-of-the-art toolsets should enable our restaurant operators to continue improving their execution in a more productive and efficient manner, while simultaneously improving the overall quality of the dining experience for our guests," said Deitchle. "Once we overcome the expected learning curve associated with these new tools during the next few months or so, we should begin to gradually realize their benefits going forward. Additionally, we continue to work on two additional operational tools -- an automated theoretical food cost system and an automated table management system -- that we anticipate testing in selected restaurants by the end of this year." During the second quarter, the company opened two new restaurants in the Sacramento market (Elk Grove, CA and Natomas, CA). "We remain on track to open as many as 11 new restaurants during fiscal 2006, of which six have already opened as of today and five more are currently under construction," commented Deitchle. "In addition to our strong opening in El Paso, TX on July 11, we currently anticipate one more restaurant opening during the upcoming third quarter in Temecula, CA in early September. Our remaining 2006 potential openings are currently expected to occur during the fourth quarter prior to Thanksgiving, which is on track with our initial fiscal 2006 development plan. "Our fiscal 2007 development plan is nearly completed, with five signed leases and several signed letters of intent already in hand for as many as 13 openings next year," said Deitchle. "Our primary growth goal is to achieve a 20 percent to 25 percent increase in total restaurant operating weeks during each of 2006 and 2007. We remain very confident that we can achieve that goal in a high-quality manner. BJ's stands for high-quality restauranteuring -- high-quality food, beverages, service, locations, facilities and ambience -- at an outstanding value for our guests. We will settle for nothing less as we continue to execute our growth plan."

This pro-forma non-GAAP financial information includes financial measures which the company reconciles to the results reported in accordance with GAAP. The company believes that pro-forma non-GAAP reporting for prior periods, giving effect to the adjustments shown in the reconciliation below, is useful to investors to permit them to compare the company's results to prior periods using consistent assumptions regarding stock-based compensation. In addition, the company believes that its competitors report similar non-GAAP financial information and, as a result, investors, analysts and others in the investment community expect such information to be reported as it allows them to better compare the company's results with those of its competitors. The company uses such non-GAAP financial measures to analyze and compare the performance of its core business. The pro-forma non-GAAP financial information presented herein should be considered supplemental to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.

Exhibit 99.1 BJ's Restaurants, Inc. Opens in Temecula, California and Comments on Current Business Trends HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sept. 6, 2006--BJ's Restaurants, Inc. (NASDAQ:BJRI) today announced the opening of its 51st restaurant in Temecula, California on September 5, 2006. The approximate 8,500 square foot BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse is located in the Overland Center at 26500 Ynez Road. The new restaurant has seating for 270 guests with hours of operation from 11:00 a.m. to 12:00 midnight Sunday through Thursday, and 11:00 a.m. to 1:00 a.m. Friday and Saturday. "We are excited to bring the BJ's restaurant concept to Temecula, which is in our core Southern California market," commented Jerry Deitchle, President and CEO. "First-day sales at Temecula set a new all time sales record for our Company. The Temecula restaurant represents our seventh new restaurant opening during 2006 and, with four restaurants currently under construction, we remain on track to achieve our stated goal to open as many as 11 new restaurants this year." "Our comparable restaurant sales for the current quarter remain solidly positive to date, in spite of the continuing challenging operating environment for most casual dining restaurant operations," said Deitchle. "Additionally, sales volumes for our 2006 openings continue to meet or exceed our expectations. We believe our continuing favorable sales trends are indicative of the attractive value that consumers recognize in the BJ's dining experience, coupled with steadily improving operational execution as a result of many of the key initiatives that we've implemented this year." The Company continues to target 2007 capacity growth of 20% to 25%, measured in terms of total restaurant operating weeks. "We currently have signed leases or letters of intent on hand to open as many as 13 new restaurants during 2007, and we expect to begin construction of four of those restaurants during the next 30 days," said Deitchle. "Additionally, we are well underway with identifying several specific locations for potential 2008 openings."

July 9, 2006
Mr. Tom Norton
525 Maryland Street
El Segundo, CA 90245
Dear Tom:
This letter outlines the terms of your employment (the "Agreement") with BJ's Restaurants Inc. (the "Company"). Your employment will begin on September 11, 2006 or on an earlier date if both of us agree (the "Effective Date"), contingent upon the results of a background investigation and your acceptance of these terms.
1. Duties. Company will employ you as Chief Human Resources Officer. In that capacity, you will perform such duties as the Company, in the exercise of its sole discretion, deem appropriate for that position. You will report to the Company's Chief Executive Officer (CEO).
2. Salary. You will receive a bi-weekly salary of $7,692.30 which annualizes to a yearly salary of $200,000 payable in accordance with the Company's payroll policies, as such policies may change from time to time (the "Salary"). Your salary is subject to modification during your employment in accordance with the Company's practices, policies and procedures and your performance. Your annual cash bonus percentage opportunity will be at 35% of your salary, with such salary and cash bonus opportunity to be calculated on the basis of an entire fiscal year, and with any fiscal 2006 ash bonus to be prorated to the Effective Date. Your Fiscal 2006 cash bonus opportunity will be based 80% on the Company's achievement of its pre-tax income goal for the year and 20% on your achievement, as determined by the CEO in his sole and absolute judgment, of certain key initiatives and objectives agreed upon by you and the CEO within 30 days of the Effective Date. These percentage components may change in subsequent fiscal years. If the Company terminates your employment without cause, on or after September 11, 2006, you will be eligible to receive a severance payment of six (6) months salary and, if you are not covered by any other comprehensive group medical insurance plan, the Company will also pay you an amount equivalent to your COBRA payments for a period of six (6) months. Any severance amounts paid will be based upon your then current salary at the time employment ends and will be paid in a lump sum, less applicable withholdings.
3. Cause. For the purpose of severance payment provision in this Agreement only, "Cause" shall mean
(i) an act or acts of dishonesty undertaken by you and intended to result in material personal gain or enrichment of you or others at the expense of the Company;
(ii) gross misconduct that is willful or deliberate on your part and that, in either event, is materially injurious to the Company;
(iii) your conviction of a felony; or
(iv) the material breach of any terms and conditions of this Agreement by you, which breach has not been cured by you within 30 days after written notice thereof to you from the Company.
The cessation of employment by you shall not be deemed to be for Cause unless and until there shall have been delivered to you a written notice thereof by the CEO, after reasonable notice to you and an opportunity for you, together with your counsel, to be heard before the CEO, finding that, in the good faith opinion of the CEO one or more causes for termination exist under this agreement and specifying the particulars thereof in detail.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
BJ'S RESTAURANTS APPOINTS NEW CHIEF HUMAN RESOURCES OFFICER
Huntington Beach, CA  September 11, 2006  BJ's Restaurants, Inc. (Nasdaq: BJRI) announced today the appointment of Tom Norton as Chief Human Resources Officer. Norton will have full responsibility for the Company's recruiting, talent development, training, compensation, benefits, performance evaluation and recognition strategies and programs, and will also serve as a key member of the Company's leadership team. Norton replaces Bill Streitberger, who will be leaving the Company at the end of September.
"We are delighted to welcome Tom to BJ's leadership team," said Jerry Deitchle, President and CEO. "Tom is very well qualified to lead the development and execution of our human resource strategies and programs as we continue to execute our aggressive national growth plan."
Since the commencement of his business career in 1992, Norton was employed by American Golf Corporation.

"Bill joined BJ's at a time when its human resource systems, processes and capabilities were typical of those of a very small company, and much work needed to be done. Bill led the installation of stronger HR systems and processes during the past four years and thereby facilitated the creation of a much stronger HR foundation to support the Company's future growth.

Our Aurora restaurant represents our second large format BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse in the Denver market, and our Arlington restaurant is our fourth restaurant in the Dallas market and our eighth in Texas.

Exhibit 99.1 BJ's Restaurants, Inc. Reports Strong Financial Results for the Third Quarter of Fiscal 2006 HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 26, 2006--BJ's Restaurants, Inc. (NASDAQ:BJRI) today reported revenues and net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2006 ended October 3, 2006. Highlights for the 13 weeks ended October 3, 2006, compared to the 13 weeks ended October 4, 2005, were as follows: -- Revenues increased approximately 30% to $61.8 million -- Comparable restaurant sales increased 5.3% -- Net income of approximately $2.4 million -- Diluted net income per share of $0.10 During the first quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123 (Revised), "Share-Based Payment." SFAS No. 123R requires the fair value measurement of all stock-based payments to employees, including grants of stock options, and recognition of those expenses in the Company's results of operations. The results for fiscal 2005 do not include the impact of SFAS 123R. If the impact of SFAS 123R was included on a pro-forma (non-GAAP) basis in the prior year's third quarter, net income and diluted net income per share for the third quarter of fiscal 2006 would have increased approximately 17% and 25% respectively. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP results are included in the accompanying financial data. "BJ's leadership team was very pleased with our strong performance during the third quarter," commented Jerry Deitchle, President and CEO. "Our comparable restaurant sales increased a strong 5.3% during the third quarter in spite of a very challenging sales and operating environment for casual dining restaurants in general and successfully rolled over a solid 5.5% increase achieved during the same quarter last year. BJ's has now achieved 40 consecutive quarters of positive comparable restaurant sales comparisons since our 1996 IPO, which is truly an impressive accomplishment. We believe our consistent strong sales growth during the past 10 years can be attributed to the unusually broad 'approachability' of the BJ's concept to all consumer demographics, coupled with our unwavering focus on delivering a higher quality dining experience at a price point that remains the same or lower than many of the 'mass market' casual dining restaurants with which we compete. We believe our favorable competitive positioning should continue to provide the 'oxygen' for BJ's future growth." During the third quarter, the Company opened two new restaurants (El Paso, TX and Temecula, CA) with initial sales volumes well in excess of expectations. Three new restaurants (Bakersfield, CA; Arlington, TX; and Aurora, CO) have already opened during the current fourth quarter, with two of those restaurants opening on the same day. The Company expects to open its 11th new restaurant during 2006 in Reno, NV prior to Thanksgiving. "We are very pleased to have accomplished our previously stated goal to open as many as 11 new restaurants during 2006," commented Deitchle. The Company continues to target capacity growth of 20% to 25% during fiscal 2007, measured in terms of total restaurant operating weeks. As many as 13 new restaurants are currently planned for 2007 openings. Nine signed leases or purchase agreements are already in hand for those potential openings (with four of those restaurants currently under construction). Another 15 signed letters of intent are already in hand for potential 2007/2008 openings. "We continue to be very pleased with the overall quality of our prospective restaurant sites, as well as the capabilities and depth of our restaurant construction and opening teams," said Deitchle. "We have solid confidence in our ability to execute our 2007 new restaurant opening plan." As previously noted in the Company's 2005 annual report and accompanying letter to shareholders, the Company is in the final stages of structuring a meaningful performance-based equity incentive plan, BJ's Gold Standard Stock Ownership Plan, for its restaurant general managers, executive kitchen managers and field supervision personnel. "The recruitment, retention and motivation of highly qualified restaurant management personnel remains absolutely critical to the successful execution of BJ's national restaurant expansion plan, as well as to help maintain and improve the talent necessary to provide consistent execution of our established high volume, operationally complex restaurants," commented Deitchle. The new equity incentive plan is currently expected to consist of awards of restricted stock units that will require five-year service and performance commitments. "This incentive plan will give us the ability to compete for the very best restaurant management talent available, and we are excited to offer it to our current restaurant management team as well," said Deitchle. The annualized non-cash pre-tax compensation expense associated with these awards is currently expected to average approximately $16,000 per restaurant on an ongoing basis. "We believe the modest cost of this plan will be recovered over time by improved operational execution and lower expenses related to restaurant manager turnover," commented Deitchle. Effective the fiscal third quarter of 2005, the Company changed its fiscal week-end from Sunday to Tuesday. This change was completed to facilitate operational efficiencies by transferring certain administrative tasks away from the weekends when its restaurants are busiest. Accordingly, the thirteen weeks ended October 3, 2006 contain 91 days as compared to 93 days for the thirteen weeks ended October 4, 2005. The two additional days of operations contributed $705,000 of additional revenues to the thirteen weeks ended October 4, 2005. Investor Conference Call and Webcast BJ's Restaurants, Inc. will conduct a conference call on its third quarter earnings release today, October 26, 2006, at 2:00 p.m. (Pacific).

This pro-forma non-GAAP financial information includes financial measures which the Company reconciles to the results reported in accordance with GAAP. The Company believes that pro-forma non-GAAP reporting for prior periods, giving effect to the adjustments shown in the reconciliation below, is useful to investors to permit them to compare the Company's results to prior periods using consistent assumptions regarding stock-based compensation. In addition, the Company believes that its competitors report similar non-GAAP financial information and, as a result, investors, analysts and others in the investment community expect such information to be reported as it allows them to better compare the Company's results with those of its competitors. The Company uses such non-GAAP financial measures to analyze and compare the performance of its core business. The pro-forma non-GAAP financial information presented herein should be considered supplemental to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
BJ'S RESTAURANTS, INC. REPORTS STRONG FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2006
Huntington Beach, CA  October 26, 2006 - BJ's Restaurants, Inc. (NASDAQ: BJRI) today reported revenues and net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2006 ended October 3, 2006.
Highlights for the 13 weeks ended October 3, 2006, compared to the 13 weeks ended October 4, 2005, were as follows:
 
 
 
 
During the first quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123 (Revised), "Share-Based Payment." SFAS No. 123R requires the fair value measurement of all stock-based payments to employees, including grants of stock options, and recognition of those expenses in the Company's results of operations. The results for fiscal 2005 do not include the impact of SFAS 123R. If the impact of SFAS 123R was included on a pro-forma (non-GAAP) basis in the prior year's third quarter, net income and diluted net income per share for the third quarter of fiscal 2006 would have increased approximately 17% and 25% respectively. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP results are included in the accompanying financial data.
"BJ's leadership team was very pleased with our strong performance during the third quarter," commented Jerry Deitchle, President and CEO. "Our comparable restaurant sales increased a strong 5.3% during the third quarter in spite of a very challenging sales and operating environment for casual dining restaurants in general and successfully rolled over a solid 5.5% increase achieved during the same quarter last year. BJ's has now achieved 40 consecutive quarters of positive comparable restaurant sales comparisons since our 1996 IPO, which is truly an impressive accomplishment. We believe our consistent strong sales growth during the past 10 years can be attributed to the unusually broad approachability' of the BJ's concept to all consumer demographics, coupled with our unwavering focus on delivering a higher quality dining experience at a price point that remains the same or lower than many of the mass market' casual dining restaurants with which we compete. We believe our favorable competitive positioning should continue to provide the oxygen' for BJ's future growth."
During the third quarter, the Company opened two new restaurants (El Paso, TX and Temecula, CA) with initial sales volumes well in excess of expectations. Three new restaurants (Bakersfield, CA; Arlington, TX; and Aurora, CO) have already opened during the current fourth quarter, with two of those restaurants opening on the same day. The Company expects to open its 11
th
new restaurant during 2006 in Reno, NV prior to Thanksgiving. "We are very pleased to have accomplished our previously stated goal to open as many as 11 new restaurants during 2006," commented Deitchle.
The Company continues to target capacity growth of 20% to 25% during fiscal 2007, measured in terms of total restaurant operating weeks. As many as 13 new restaurants are currently planned for 2007 openings. Nine signed leases or purchase agreements are already in hand for those potential openings (with four of those restaurants currently under construction). Another 15 signed letters of intent are already in hand for potential 2007/2008 openings. "We continue to be very pleased with the overall quality of our prospective restaurant sites, as well as the capabilities and depth of our restaurant construction and opening teams," said Deitchle. "We have solid confidence in our ability to execute our 2007 new restaurant opening plan."
As previously noted in the Company's 2005 annual report and accompanying letter to shareholders, the Company is in the final stages of structuring a meaningful performance-based equity incentive plan, BJ's Gold Standard Stock Ownership Plan, for its restaurant general managers, executive kitchen managers and field supervision personnel. "The recruitment, retention and motivation of highly qualified restaurant management personnel remains absolutely critical to the successful execution of BJ's national restaurant expansion plan, as well as to help maintain and improve the talent necessary to provide consistent execution of our established high volume, operationally complex restaurants," commented Deitchle. The new equity incentive plan is currently expected to consist of awards of restricted stock units that will require five-year service and performance commitments. "This incentive plan will give us the ability to compete for the very best restaurant management talent available, and we are excited to offer it to our current restaurant management team as well," said Deitchle. The annualized non-cash pre-tax compensation expense associated with these awards is currently expected to average
approximately $16,000 per restaurant on an ongoing basis. "We believe the modest cost of this plan will be recovered over time by improved operational execution and lower expenses related to restaurant manager turnover," commented Deitchle.
Effective the fiscal third quarter of 2005, the Company changed its fiscal week-end from Sunday to Tuesday. This change was completed to facilitate operational efficiencies by transferring certain administrative tasks away from the weekends when its restaurants are busiest. Accordingly, the thirteen weeks ended October 3, 2006 contain 91 days as compared to 93 days for the thirteen weeks ended October 4, 2005. The two additional days of operations contributed $705,000 of additional revenues to the thirteen weeks ended October 4, 2005.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The following table illustrates the effect on net income and net income per share if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of FAS 123R to all periods presented. This pro-forma non-GAAP financial information includes financial measures which the Company reconciles to the results reported in accordance with GAAP. The Company believes that pro-forma non-GAAP reporting for prior periods, giving effect to the adjustments shown in the reconciliation below, is useful to investors to permit them to compare the Company's results to prior periods using consistent assumptions regarding stock-based compensation. In addition, the Company believes that its competitors report similar non-GAAP financial information and, as a result, investors, analysts and others in the investment community expect such information to be reported as it allows them to better compare the Company's results with those of its competitors. The Company uses such non-GAAP financial measures to analyze and compare the performance of its core business. The pro-forma non-GAAP financial information presented herein should be considered supplemental to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.

Exhibit 99.1 BJ's Restaurants, Inc. Opens in Reno, Nevada HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 8, 2006--BJ's Restaurants, Inc. (NASDAQ:BJRI) today announced the opening of its newest BJ's Restaurant & Brewery in Reno, Nevada on November 7, 2006. The freestanding facility is located in the Summit Sierra Shopping Center, at the crossroads of S. Virginia Street and Mt. Rose Highway. The new restaurant contains approximately 7,500 square feet of dining space, with seating for 265 guests. The facility also includes a microbrewery that produces BJ's award-winning handcrafted beers. The restaurant's hours of operation are from 11:00 a.m. to 12:00 midnight Sunday through Thursday, and 11:00 a.m. to 1:00 a.m. Friday and Saturday. "We are excited to bring the BJ's concept to Reno," said Jerry Deitchle, President and CEO. "Sales for our first day of opening were stronger than we expected. Our Reno restaurant is our 11th restaurant opening during 2006, and successfully completes our previously stated development goal for the year. Now, we can devote the majority of our operational attention to driving sales and profits in our 55 restaurants during the upcoming holiday season." The new Reno restaurant includes a state-of-the-art brewery with estimated capacity to produce approximately 15,000 barrels of BJ's premium handcrafted beers each year. "The Reno brewery is now our largest internal brewery operation, with about three times the productive capacity of our next-largest breweries, and should be able to supply handcrafted beer to approximately 20 of our restaurants," commented Deitchle. "We plan to take advantage of the solid economies of scale available in our new brewery by gradually re-balancing all of our internal beer production during the first half of 2007 with the goal of achieving a lower delivered cost per barrel of beer to all of our restaurants thereafter." The Company reiterates its goal to open as many as 13 new restaurants during 2007 and thereby increase its total restaurant operating weeks by approximately 20% to 25% during the year. As of this date, nine of the potential 2007 new openings have been secured with signed leases or purchase agreements, and four of those restaurants are already under construction. In addition, the Company has an additional 15 signed letters of intent agreements in hand for potential restaurant openings in 2007 and 2008. BJ's Restaurants, Inc. currently owns and operates 55 casual dining restaurants under the BJ's Restaurant and Brewery, BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse or BJ's Pizza & Grill brand names. BJ's restaurants offer an innovative and broad menu featuring award-winning, signature deep-dish pizza complemented with generously portioned salads, sandwiches, soups, pastas, entrees and desserts. Quality, flavor, value, moderate prices and sincere service remain distinct attributes of the BJ's experience. The Company operates eleven microbreweries which produce and distribute BJ's critically acclaimed handcrafted beers throughout the chain. The Company's restaurants are located in California (35), Texas (8), Arizona (4), Colorado (3), Oregon (3) and Nevada (2).

,
The Registration Rights Agreement requires the Company to file a registration statement with the SEC within 30 calendar days after the closing of the Private Placement for the purpose of registering for resale the Shares. The Registration Statement is required to be declared effective no later than the 120

calendar day following the closing.

The foregoing summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the form of Registration Rights Agreement, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.2 to this report and incorporated herein by reference.

As a condition of transfer, any such transferee shall agree in writing to be bound by the terms of this Agreement and shall have the rights of a Purchaser under this Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement.
(b) The Purchasers agree to the imprinting, so long as is required by this Section 4.1, of a legend on any of the Securities in the following form:
THIS SECURITY HAS NOT BEEN REGISTERED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION OR THE SECURITIES COMMISSION OF ANY STATE IN RELIANCE UPON AN EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE "SECURITIES ACT"), AND, ACCORDINGLY, MAY NOT BE OFFERED OR SOLD EXCEPT PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OR PURSUANT TO AN AVAILABLE EXEMPTION FROM, OR IN A TRANSACTION NOT SUBJECT TO, THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS AS EVIDENCED BY A LEGAL OPINION OF COUNSEL TO THE TRANSFEROR TO SUCH EFFECT, THE SUBSTANCE OF WHICH SHALL BE REASONABLY ACCEPTABLE TO THE COMPANY.

Such a pledge or transfer would not be subject to approval of the Company and no legal opinion of legal counsel of the pledgee, secured party or pledgor shall be required in connection therewith, but such legal opinion may be required in connection with a subsequent transfer following default by the Investor transferee of the pledge. No notice shall be required of such pledge. At the appropriate Purchaser's expense, the Company will execute and deliver such reasonable documentation as a pledgee or secured party of Securities may reasonably request in connection with a pledge or transfer of the Securities, including, if the Securities are subject to registration pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, the preparation and filing of any required prospectus supplement under Rule 424(b)(3) under the Securities Act or other applicable provision of the Securities Act to appropriately amend the list of Selling Stockholders thereunder.
(c) Certificates evidencing the Shares shall not contain any legend (including the legend set forth in Section 4.1(b)), (i) while a registration statement (including the Registration Statement) covering the resale of such security is effective under the Securities Act, or (ii) following any sale of such Shares pursuant to Rule 144, or (iii) if such Shares are eligible for sale under Rule 144(k), or (iv) if such legend is not required under applicable requirements of the Securities Act (including judicial interpretations and pronouncements issued by the staff of the
 
Commission).

Indemnified Party
Indemnifying Party
 
An Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such Proceeding and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Party or Parties unless: (1) the Indemnifying Party has agreed in writing to pay such fees and expenses; (2) the Indemnifying Party shall have failed promptly to assume the defense of such Proceeding and to employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Party in any such Proceeding; or (3) the named parties to any such Proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both such Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, and counsel to the Indemnified Party shall have been advised by outside counsel that a material conflict of interest is likely to exist if the same counsel were to represent such Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party (in which case, if such Indemnified Party notifies the Indemnifying Party in writing that it elects to employ separate counsel at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to assume the defense thereof and such counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnifying Party; , , that in the event one or more Holders is a party to such Proceeding, the Company shall only be required to pay the expenses of one law firm serving as counsel to said Holders).

provided
however

If the indemnification under Section 5(a) or 5(b) is unavailable to an Indemnified Party or insufficient to hold an Indemnified Party harmless for any Losses, then each Indemnifying Party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party in connection with the actions, statements or omissions that resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of such Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission of a material fact, has been taken or made by, or relates to information supplied by, such Indemnifying Party or Indemnified Party, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such action, statement or omission. The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of any Losses shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, any reasonable attorneys' or other fees or expenses incurred by such party in connection with any Proceeding to the extent such party would have been indemnified for such fees or expenses if the indemnification provided for in this Section was available to such party in accordance with its terms.
Contribution

Each Selling Stockholder (the "") of the common stock and any of their pledgees, assignees and successors-in-interest may, from time to time, sell any or all of their shares of common stock on the Nasdaq Global Market or any other stock exchange, market or trading facility on which the shares are traded or in private transactions. These sales may be at fixed or negotiated prices. A Selling Stockholder may use any one or more of the following methods when selling shares:
Selling Stockholders
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Selling Stockholders may also sell shares under Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ""), if available, rather than under this prospectus.
Securities Act
Broker-dealers engaged by the Selling Stockholders may arrange for other brokers-dealers to participate in sales. Broker-dealers may receive commissions or discounts from the Selling Stockholders (or, if any broker-dealer acts as agent for the purchaser of shares, from the purchaser) in amounts to be negotiated, but, except as set forth in a supplement to this Prospectus, in the case of an agency transaction not in excess of a customary brokerage commission in compliance with NASDR Rule 2440; and in the case of a principal transaction a markup or markdown in compliance with NASDR IM-2440.
 
In connection with the sale of the common stock or interests therein, the Selling Stockholders may enter into hedging transactions with broker-dealers or other financial institutions, which may in turn engage in short sales of the Common Stock in the course of hedging the positions they assume. The Selling Stockholders may also sell shares of the common stock short and deliver these securities to close out their short positions, or loan or pledge the common stock to broker-dealers that in turn may sell these securities. The Selling Stockholders may also enter into option or other transactions with broker-dealers or other financial institutions or the creation of one or more derivative securities which require the delivery to such broker-dealer or other financial institution of shares offered by this prospectus, which shares such broker-dealer or other financial institution may resell pursuant to this prospectus (as supplemented or amended to reflect such transaction).
The Selling Stockholders and any broker-dealers or agents that are involved in selling the shares may be deemed to be "underwriters" within the meaning of the Securities Act in connection with such sales. In such event, any commissions received by such broker-dealers or agents and any profit on the resale of the shares purchased by them may be deemed to be underwriting commissions or discounts under the Securities Act. Each Selling Stockholder has informed the Company that it does not have any written or oral agreement or understanding, directly or indirectly, with any person to distribute the Common Stock. In no event shall any broker-dealer receive fees, commissions and markups which, in the aggregate, would exceed eight percent (8%).
The Company is required to pay certain fees and expenses incurred by the Company incident to the registration of the shares. The Company has agreed to indemnify the Selling Stockholders against certain losses, claims, damages and liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act.
Because Selling Stockholders may be deemed to be "underwriters" within the meaning of the Securities Act, they will be subject to the prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act including Rule 172 thereunder. In addition, any securities covered by this prospectus which qualify for sale pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act may be sold under Rule 144 rather than under this prospectus. There is no underwriter or coordinating broker acting in connection with the proposed sale of the resale shares by the Selling Stockholders.
We agreed to keep this prospectus effective until the earlier of (i) the date on which the shares may be resold by the Selling Stockholders without registration and without regard to any volume limitations by reason of Rule 144(k) under the Securities Act or any other rule of similar effect or (ii) all of the shares have been sold pursuant to this prospectus or Rule 144 under the Securities Act or any other rule of similar effect. The resale shares will be sold only through registered or licensed brokers or dealers if required under applicable state securities laws. In addition, in certain states, the resale shares may not be sold unless they have been registered or qualified for sale in the applicable state or an exemption from the registration or qualification requirement is available and is complied with.
Under applicable rules and regulations under the Exchange Act, any person engaged in the distribution of the resale shares may not simultaneously engage in market making activities with respect to the common stock for the applicable restricted period, as defined in Regulation
 
M, prior to the commencement of the distribution. In addition, the Selling Stockholders will be subject to applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, including Regulation M, which may limit the timing of purchases and sales of shares of the common stock by the Selling Stockholders or any other person. We will make copies of this prospectus available to the Selling Stockholders and have informed them of the need to deliver a copy of this prospectus to each purchaser at or prior to the time of the sale (including by compliance with Rule 172 under the Securities Act).
 
Annex B
The undersigned beneficial owner of common stock (the "") of BJ's Restaurants, Inc., a California corporation (the ""), understands that the Company has filed or intends to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "") a registration statement (the "") for the registration and resale under Rule 415 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ""), of the Registrable Securities, in accordance with the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement (the "") to which this document is annexed.

Exhibit 99.1 BJ's Restaurants, Inc. to Present at the 5th Annual Cowen and Company Consumer Conference and Also Provided a Revenue Update for the Fourth Quarter of 2006 HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 4, 2007--BJ's Restaurants, Inc. (NASDAQ:BJRI) will be presenting at the 5th Annual Cowen and Company Consumer Conference in New York City on Tuesday, January 9, 2007 at 10:30 am (Eastern). Jerry Deitchle, President and CEO; Greg Levin, CFO and Greg Lynds, Chief Development Officer will be presenting on behalf of the Company. The presentation will be broadcast over the Internet at the Company's website located at http://www.bjsrestaurants.com. The broadcast can be accessed by clicking on the "Investors" link from the Company's home page followed by the "Presentation" link. An archive of the presentation will be available following the live presentation for 30 days. The Company also provided a revenue update for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 that ended on January 2, 2007. Revenues for the fourth quarter increased approximately 34% to approximately $65.9 million compared to $49.2 million in the same quarter last year. Sales for comparable restaurants increased approximately 5.5% during the quarter and successfully hurdled a strong 5.3% increase in comparable restaurant sales for the same quarter last year. Additionally, the revenue contribution from the Company's newer restaurants exceeded management's expectations during the fourth quarter. "Our strong fourth quarter sales results continued the positive top-line momentum that BJ's has enjoyed during all of 2006," commented Jerry Deitchle, President and CEO. "Our comparable sales increase of approximately 5.5% for the fourth quarter marks our 41st straight quarter of positive comparisons on that metric. Additionally, during the fourth quarter, we set new Company records for the highest sales ever in both a single day and week at one of our comparable Southern California restaurants. Also, we were very pleased with BJ's gift card purchases by our restaurant guests during the fourth quarter. Purchases of gift cards increased approximately 8% in comparable restaurants during the fourth quarter, and total Company gift card purchases increased a very strong 60% compared to the same quarter last year. These strong gift card purchases have the potential to begin benefiting our top-line results in early 2007 when post-holiday card redemptions start to occur." The Company remains confident in its ability to open as many as 13 new restaurants during 2007 and thereby achieve its targeted growth rate of 20% to 25% in terms of total restaurant operating weeks during the year. All prospective locations for 2007 new restaurants have been identified and secured with signed leases, purchase agreements or letters of intent. As of this date, six restaurants are in various stages of actual construction for potential 2007 openings.

Exhibit 99.1 BJ's Restaurants, Inc. Reports Strong Financial Results for the Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year Ended 2006 HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Feb. 15, 2007--BJ's Restaurants, Inc. (NASDAQ:BJRI) today reported revenues and net income for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended January 2, 2007. Highlights for the 13 weeks ended January 2, 2007 compared to the 13 weeks ended January 3, 2006 were as follows: -- Revenues increased approximately 34% to $65.9 million -- Comparable restaurant sales increased 5.5% -- Net income increased approximately 22% to $2.8 million -- Diluted net income per share increased 10% to $0.11 Highlights for the 52 weeks ended January 2, 2007 compared to the 52 weeks ended January 3, 2006 were as follows: -- Revenues increased approximately 34% to $238.9 million -- Comparable restaurant sales increased 5.8% -- Net income increased approximately 18% to $9.8 million -- Diluted net income per share increased 14% to $0.41 During the first quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123 (Revised), "Share-Based Payment." SFAS No. 123R requires the fair value measurement of all stock-based payments to employees, including grants of stock options, and recognition of those expenses in the Company's results of operations. The results for fiscal 2005 do not include the impact of SFAS No. 123R. If the impact of SFAS No. 123R was included on a pro-forma non-GAAP basis in the prior year's fourth quarter, net income and diluted net income per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 would have increased approximately 41% and 38%, respectively. If the impact of SFAS No. 123R was included on a pro-forma non-GAAP basis for all of fiscal 2005, net income and diluted net income per share for fiscal 2006 would have increased approximately 52% and 46%, respectively. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP results are included in the accompanying financial data. "Our leadership team is very pleased with BJ's continued strong performance during the fourth quarter and for the full fiscal year," commented Jerry Deitchle, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Our 5.5% increase in comparable restaurant sales for the fourth quarter represents our 41st consecutive quarter of positive comparisons on that measure since our 1996 IPO, which is a strong testament to the broad consumer 'approachability' and sustained popularity of the BJ's concept. Additionally, during 2006, we successfully implemented several operational initiatives and toolsets, such as our automated kitchen display system and web-based labor scheduler and productivity analyzer, which enabled our restaurant operators to more efficiently process all of the business being offered to us and simultaneously improve the overall dining experience at BJ's." During the first six weeks of the first quarter of fiscal 2007, comparable sales increased approximately 5% and successfully hurdled an approximate 8% increase for the same period last year. "Of course, while quarter-to-date results may not be indicative of results for the entire quarter, we are very pleased with our continuing positive sales comparisons in a difficult operating environment," commented Greg Levin, Chief Financial Officer. "All of the great consumer growth companies are sales builders, first and foremost, and that is our unwavering mindset here at BJ's. We are implementing additional sales-building initiatives as we move through fiscal 2007 including, among other things, selected capacity additions to existing restaurants, complete re-launches of our off-premise and large-party sales channels, the rollout of an automated table management and seating system in our higher-volume restaurants and contemporary upgrades to our beverage offerings." Four new restaurants were opened during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 (Bakersfield, CA; Arlington, TX; Aurora, CO and Reno, NV), bringing the total number of new restaurant openings during fiscal 2006 to 11. "We successfully achieved our stated goal at the beginning of 2006 to open as many as 11 new restaurants during the year and, thereby, increased our total restaurant operating weeks by approximately 24%," said Greg Lynds, Chief Development Officer. "Additionally, as we previously announced, our new Reno restaurant includes a 15,000 barrel state-of-the-art brewery which should be able to provide BJ's premium handcrafted beer to as many as 20 of our restaurants. One of our key initiatives for fiscal 2007 is to take full advantage of the favorable production economies of scale available in our Reno brewery by rebalancing all of our internal beer production activities, with the opportunity to achieve a reduced delivered cost per barrel of beer to all of our restaurants during the second half of the year." The Company continues to target capacity growth of 20% to 25% during fiscal 2007, measured in terms of total restaurant operating weeks. As many as 13 new restaurants are currently planned for 2007 openings. All prospective locations for 2007 new restaurants have been identified and secured with signed leases, purchase agreements or letters of intent. Additionally, 10 signed letters of intent are already in hand for potential 2008 openings. Weather permitting, the Company currently expects to open two restaurants (Tampa, FL and Columbus, OH) in mid-March 2007, approximately four restaurants in the second quarter of 2007, approximately three new restaurants in the third quarter of 2007 and approximately four new restaurants in the fourth quarter of 2007. The actual timing of restaurant openings is inherently difficult to precisely predict and is subject to a number of factors that are outside of the Company's control, including factors that are under the control of the Company's landlords and contractors. During the first quarter of 2007, the Company is evaluating certain initiatives related to its strategic business and growth plan, including increased brewery productivity and improved support of its expanding restaurant operations, that may result in a one-time pretax charge in the range of $1.8 to $2.2 million (approximately $1.2 to $1.5 million net of the related tax effect) or approximately $0.05 per diluted share. First, as a result of the previously announced rebalancing of the Company's internal brewing activities associated with the planned ramp-up of Reno's brewing operations, the Company may de-commission as many as four of its older, smaller and inefficient "legacy" breweries during 2007. Second, as a result of the Company's quality-enhancing and sales-building initiatives in its restaurants, the Company is evaluating a more contemporary china/silverware/glassware program, as well as image enhancements to certain restaurant facilities, which may result in the one-time disposal of the replaced assets. Finally, the Company relocated its home office support activities to a larger leased facility during the first quarter of 2007 to more effectively accommodate the Company's planned future expansion that may result in the disposal of certain nonproductive support-related assets and associated relocation costs. Management intends to have the plans for these strategic initiatives finalized during this first quarter and implemented before the end of fiscal 2007.

This pro-forma non-GAAP financial information includes financial measures which the Company reconciles to the results reported in accordance with GAAP. The Company believes that pro-forma non-GAAP reporting for prior periods, giving effect to the adjustments shown in the reconciliation below, is useful to investors to permit them to compare the Company's results to prior periods using consistent assumptions regarding stock-based compensation. In addition, the Company believes that its competitors report similar non-GAAP financial information and, as a result, investors, analysts and others in the investment community expect such information to be reported as it allows them to better compare the Company's results with those of its competitors. The Company uses such non-GAAP financial measures to analyze and compare the performance of its core business. The pro-forma non-GAAP financial information presented herein should be considered supplemental to, not superior to or as a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.

Exhibit 99.1 BJ's Restaurants, Inc. Reports Solid Financial Results for the First Quarter of Fiscal 2007 HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 26, 2007--BJ's Restaurants, Inc. (NASDAQ:BJRI) today reported revenues and net income for the first fiscal quarter ended April 3, 2007. Highlights for the first quarter, compared to the same quarter last year, were as follows: -- Revenues increased approximately 33% to $71.2 million -- Comparable restaurant sales increased 6.9% -- Total operating weeks increased approximately 24% -- Net income of $3.0 million and diluted net income per share of $0.11, excluding a previously announced non-cash, pre-tax charge of $2.0 million ($0.05 per diluted share) related to asset disposals -- Net income of $1.6 million and diluted net income per share of $0.06 "Our leadership team was very pleased with the Company's results for the first quarter of 2007," commented Jerry Deitchle, President and CEO. "In spite of a continuing 'headwind' due to the difficult operating environment in general for most casual dining restaurant companies, BJ's was able to achieve a strong 6.9% increase in comparable restaurant sales for the quarter (our 42nd consecutive quarter of positive comparable sales comparisons), successfully hurdling a solid 6.8% increase for the same quarter last year. That adds up to an impressive 13.7% two-year increase in first quarter comparable sales. We believe our continued positive sales trends are the result of the improved quality, differentiation, overall value and broad 'approachability' of the BJ's concept, coupled with improved operational execution as a result of our recently implemented toolsets and initiatives." The Company opened two new restaurants in the first quarter of 2007 in Tampa, Florida and Columbus, Ohio. These two restaurants represent BJ's initial entry into the Midwest and Southeast regions of the United States. "Sales volumes for these two new restaurants are currently running in excess of $100,000 per week, which is stronger than we expected and is very encouraging," commented Deitchle. Additionally, the Company opened its second Florida restaurant on April 17, 2007 in Orlando, across from the Mall at Millenia. The Company continues to target as many as 13 new restaurants for 2007 and thereby will increase its operating week capacity by 20% to 25% during the year. All prospective locations for potential 2007 openings have been secured, and seven new restaurants are currently under construction. The Company currently anticipates opening as many as four new restaurants in the second quarter, of which one has already opened; as many as three new restaurants in the third quarter; and as many as four new restaurants in the fourth quarter. The actual timing of restaurant openings is inherently difficult to precisely predict and is subject to a number of factors that are outside of the Company's control, including factors that are under the control of the Company's landlords and contractors. As previously announced, the Company incurred a one-time, non-cash, pre-tax charge of $2.0 million (approximately $1.3 million net of the related tax effect or approximately $0.05 per diluted share) related to the disposal of certain assets as a result of certain initiatives to further improve the quality, productivity, efficiency and capacity of its restaurant, brewing and infrastructure support operations. In the Company's restaurants, existing televisions were replaced with new flat panel, high definition televisions. Additionally, the current china/silverware/glassware package in the restaurants is being upgraded with a more contemporary package that significantly enhances BJ's food and beverage presentations. The Company also decommissioned four of its older, smaller and inefficient "legacy" breweries to take advantage of the economies of scale offered by the Company's new, large-capacity brewery in Reno, Nevada. The Company also relocated its home office support activities to a larger leased facility during the first quarter of 2007 to more effectively accommodate the Company's planned future expansion that resulted in the disposal of certain nonproductive support-related assets. Investor Conference Call and Webcast BJ's Restaurants, Inc. will conduct a conference call on its first quarter earnings release today, April 26, 2007, at 2:00 p.m. (Pacific). The Company will provide an Internet simulcast, as well as a replay of the conference call. The link to the simulcast and rebroadcast can be found on the Company's website at http://www.bjsrestaurants.com. The rebroadcast will be available following the live broadcast and continue for 30 days.

Our restaurant operations team in Palmdale also did a terrific job of serving all of our guests at BJ's gold standard level of operational excellence." The Palmdale restaurant is the Company's fourth new restaurant opening to date during 2007. The Company remains solidly on track to open as many as thirteen new restaurants during 2007 and thereby increase its total restaurant operating weeks by 20% to 25% during the year.

BJ's Restaurants, Inc. currently owns and operates 59 casual dining restaurants under the BJ's Restaurant and Brewery, BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse or BJ's Pizza & Grill brand names. BJ's restaurants offer an innovative and broad menu featuring award-winning, signature deep-dish pizza complemented with generously portioned salads, sandwiches, soups, pastas, entrees and desserts. Quality, flavor, value, moderate prices and sincere service remain distinct attributes of the BJ's experience. The Company operates several microbreweries which produce and distribute BJ's critically acclaimed handcrafted beers throughout the chain. The Company's restaurants are located in California (36), Texas (8), Arizona (4), Colorado (3), Oregon (3), Nevada (2), Florida (2) and Ohio (1).

Exhibit 99.1 BJ's Restaurants, Inc. Holds Annual Meeting of Shareholders and Comments on Current Business Trends HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 30, 2007--BJ's Restaurants, Inc. (NASDAQ:BJRI) held its annual meeting of shareholders on Wednesday, May 30, 2007. Shareholders re-elected Paul A. Motenko, Jeremiah J. Hennessy, Gerald W. Deitchle, Peter A. Bassi, Larry D. Bouts, Shann M. Brassfield, James A. Dal Pozzo, J. Roger King and John F. Grundhofer to the Board of Directors to serve until the next annual meeting. Additionally, shareholders also ratified the selection of Ernst & Young LLP to serve as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal 2007. Jerry Deitchle, President and CEO, commented to shareholders attending the meeting that the Company's comparable restaurant sales continue to be solidly positive to date for the second quarter of fiscal 2007, despite the difficult operating environment in general for most casual dining restaurant concepts. "During the past two years, we have focused most of our key initiatives on improving our operational ability to correctly and consistently process an increasing amount of sales in a more productive, efficient and leverageable manner, while simultaneously improving the overall quality and differentiation of the BJ's dining experience," said Deitchle. "We believe that the success of our initiatives, coupled with the strong overall approachability of the BJ's concept for consumers of all incomes and demographics, continue to provide BJ's with a strong capability to gain additional market share in one of the most highly competitive segments of the restaurant industry." During the meeting, Deitchle also reiterated the Company's plan to open as many as 13 new restaurants during fiscal 2007, of which five have already opened to date, and thereby achieve a 20% to 25% increase in total restaurant operating weeks during the year. "Initial sales for our new restaurants opened so far this year have been very strong," commented Deitchle. "Not only did our new Palmdale, CA restaurant set an all-time opening week sales record for BJ's, Palmdale also set an all-time weekly sales record for any BJ's restaurant during its second week of opening, which is quite remarkable. Sales volumes for our new restaurants in Central Florida and Ohio continue to meet or exceed our expectations. Additionally, initial sales for our 60th restaurant recently opened in Norman, OK continue to be well in excess of expectations." Work is well underway to secure additional locations for potential openings in 2008 and 2009. BJ's Restaurants, Inc. currently owns and operates 60 casual dining restaurants under the BJ's Restaurant and Brewery, BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse or BJ's Pizza & Grill brand names.

Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
 
 
 
 
 
(a) The Board of Directors (the "Board") of BJ's Restaurants, Inc. (the "Company") adopted a resolution amending and restating the Company's Bylaws (as amended and restated, the "Bylaws") as of May 30, 2007.
Descriptions of the provisions adopted or changed and, if applicable, the previous provision are provided below. These descriptions are summaries and are qualified in their entirety by the Bylaws filed herewith as Exhibit 3.1, the text of which is incorporated by reference in this Section 5.03.
Nominations and Shareholder Business
New Sections 14 and 15 were added to Article II to establish procedures pursuant to which a shareholder may nominate a person for election to the Board or propose business to be considered at a shareholders meeting. These changes are designed to give the Board and the Company ample information and time to respond to any shareholder proposals and shareholder nominations for Board seats. The following summarizes the material provisions of these new sections:
. The Chairman of the Board or such other officer as is designated by a majority of the Board will preside over meetings and have the authority to determine the order of business and regulate conduct at the meeting (including regulating who may make statements at the meeting and when).
Meeting Procedures
. To nominate a person for election to the Board, a shareholder must set forth all information relating to the nominee that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to applicable proxy solicitation rules.
Nominations
. To propose an item of business, a shareholder must provide notice containing such information as is specified in the Bylaws as to the proposal, including a brief description of the business, along with a description and the text of the proposal or business. The shareholder also must set forth the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting, and any material interest in such business of such shareholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made.
Shareholder Business
. Written notice of a shareholder nomination or proposal of other business must be delivered to the Company's secretary not less than 60 nor more than 90 days prior to the date on which the Company first mailed its proxy materials for the prior year's annual meeting. However, if the Company's annual meeting is advanced or delayed by more than 30 days from the anniversary of the previous year's meeting, a shareholder's written notice will be timely if its is delivered by the10th day following the public announcement of the date of the meeting.
Notice Deadlines
. At a special meeting of shareholders, only such business shall be conducted as shall have been brought before the meeting pursuant to the Company's notice of meeting or as may otherwise be properly brought before the meeting in accordance with the Bylaws.
Notice Requirements for Special Meetings
Ability to Issue Uncertificated Shares
Recent regulatory changes require that exchange or Nasdaq-listed companies become DRS eligible by January 1, 2008. DRS stands for "Direct Registration System" and refers to a system pursuant to which shares may be held in book entry form, without a certificate.
In order to assure that the Company's securities are DRS eligible, certain changes to the Bylaws have been made and are reflected in the changes to Article VIII, Sections 4 and 5, and Article V, Section 10 of the Bylaws.
As amended, the Bylaws permit the Company to issue certificated or uncertificated shares. Previously, the Company's Bylaws provided every Company shareholder with the right to have a certificate certifying the number of shares owned by such shareholder.
Officers
Article V, Sections 1, 7, 8 and 11 have been revised to more accurately reflect the Company's current officer/management structure by clarifying the relative duties and powers of the CEO, President (to the extent the President is different than the CEO) and the CFO.
Right to Call Special Director Meetings
Article II, Section 3 was amended to add the CEO to the persons who may call a special meeting of shareholders. In addition, Article III, Section 8 was revised to reflect that the chief executive officer has the right to call special meetings of the Board but that vice-presidents did not. Such power is now reserved for the chairman, the chief executive officer, president, the secretary or any two directors.
Technological Updates
Multiple provisions were changed to reflect changes in the technologies used to perform ministerial tasks and to permit electronic communication and storage. In particular, provisions were changed to allow notice to be given electronically for all meetings of shareholders (Article II, Section 5), special meetings of the Board (Article III, Section 8), and with respect to any other actions except as prohibited by applicable law (Article VIII, Section 8). Notice by electronic delivery will be deemed given when dispatched (Article VIII, Section 8), and any person entitled to notice may waive it by electronic transmission (Article VIII, Section 8). The members of the Board may consent to any action without a meeting by electronic transmission or transmissions (Article III, Section 13), and any director or officer may resign by electronic transmission to the Company (Article III, Section 4; Article V, Section 4).
Provisions have been similarly changed to allow the minutes of proceedings of the Board or any committee thereof (Article III, Section 13) and any other records (Article VII, Section 6) to be stored in electronic form.
Deletions of Provisions Regarding Financial Statements and Annual Statements
Prior Sections 6 and 7 of Article VII of the Bylaws have been deleted. These provisions contained certain provisions requiring delivery to shareholders of financial statements and other financial information as well as requiring the filing of certain annual statements with the Secretary of State of California. Such provisions are duplicative of provisions of the California Corporations Code as well as the regulatory requirements for reporting companies under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and, as such, are not necessary and are potential confusing in light of the SEC and NASD regulations governing the same subjects.
 
On May 31, 2007 Co-Chairman Paul A. Motenko and Jerry J. Hennessy each established a personal stock trading plan pursuant to, and intended to comply with, Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Under the terms of the plan, Motenko and Hennessy each may sell up to 80,000 shares beginning May 31, 2007. The shares to be sold will be acquired through the exercise of employee stock options for both Motenko and Hennessy. If Motenko completes all the planned sales of shares under their Rule 10b5-1 plans, he would continue to own approximately 400,000 shares and vested options, together representing approximately 1.5 percent of the Company's outstanding stock (based on the most recently reported number of outstanding shares of the Company). If Hennessy complete all the planned sales of shares under their Rule 10b5-1 plans, he would continue to own approximately 380,000 shares and vested options, together representing approximately 1.5 percent of the Company's outstanding stock (based on the most recently reported number of outstanding shares of the Company).
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

If the notice is not given within twenty (20) days after receipt of the request, the person or persons requesting the meeting may give the notice.

Section 5
Manner of Giving Notice; Affidavit of Notice
 
shareholder appearing on the books of the corporation or given to the corporation by that shareholder for the purpose of notice. If no such address appears on the corporation's books or is given, notice shall be deemed to have been given if sent to that shareholder by first-class mail or by telegraphic or other written communication to the corporation's principal executive office, or if published at least once in a newspaper of general circulation in the county where that office is located. Notice shall be deemed to have been given at the time when delivered personally, deposited in the mail, or sent by telegram or other means of written communication.
If any notice addressed to a shareholder at the address of that shareholder appearing on the books of the corporation is returned to the corporation by the United States Postal Service marked to indicate that the United States Postal Service is unable to deliver the notice to the shareholder at that address, all future notices or reports shall be deemed to have been duly given (without further mailing) if they are available to the shareholder on written demand of the shareholder at the principal executive office of the corporation for a period of one (1) year from the date of the giving of the notice.
An affidavit of the mailing or other means of giving any notice of any shareholders' meeting shall be executed by the secretary, assistant secretary or any transfer agent of the corporation giving the notice, and shall be filed and maintained in the minute book of the corporation.
. . The presence in person or by proxy of the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote at any meeting of shareholders shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. The shareholders present at a duly called or held meeting at which a quorum is present may continue to do business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough shareholders to leave less than a quorum, if any action taken (other than adjournment) is approved by at least a majority of the shares required to constitute a quorum.
Section 6
Quorum
. . Any shareholders' meeting, annual or special, whether or not a quorum is present, may be adjourned from time to time by the vote of a majority of the shares represented at that meeting, either in person or by proxy, but in the absence of a quorum, no other business may be transacted at that meeting, except as provided in Section 6 of this Article II.
Section 7
Adjourned Meeting; Notice
When any meeting of shareholders, either annual or special, is adjourned to another time or place, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place are announced at a meeting at which the adjournment is taken, unless a new record date for the adjourned meeting is fixed, or unless the adjournment is for more than forty-five (45) days from the date set for the original meeting, in which case the board of directors shall set a new record date. Notice of any such adjourned meeting shall be
 
given to each shareholder of record entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting in accordance with the provisions of Sections 4 and 5 of this Article II. At any adjourned meeting the corporation may transact any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting.
. . The shareholders entitled to vote at any meeting of shareholders shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 11 of this Article II, subject to the provisions of Sections 702 to 704, inclusive, of the California Corporations Code (relating to voting shares held by a fiduciary, in the name of a corporation or in joint ownership). The shareholders' vote may be by voice vote or by ballot; provided, however, that any election for directors must be by ballot if demanded by any shareholder before the voting has begun. On any matter other than election of directors, any shareholder may vote part of the shares in favor of the proposal and refrain from voting the remaining shares or vote them against the proposal, but, if the shareholder fails to specify the number of shares which the shareholder is voting affirmatively, it will be conclusively presumed that the shareholder's approving vote is with respect to all shares that the shareholder is entitled to vote. If a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of the majority of the shares represented at the meeting and entitled to vote on any matter (other than the election of directors) shall be the act of the shareholders, unless the vote of a greater number or voting by classes is required by California General Corporation Law or by the articles of incorporation.
Section 8
Voting
At a shareholders' meeting at which directors are to be elected, no shareholder shall be entitled to cumulate votes (i.e., cast for any one (1) or more candidates a number of votes greater than the number of the shareholder's shares) unless the candidates' names have been placed in nomination prior to commencement of the voting and a shareholder has given notice prior to commencement of the voting of the shareholder's intention to cumulate votes. If any shareholder has given such a notice, then every shareholder entitled to vote may cumulate votes for candidates in nomination and give one (1) candidate a number of votes equal to the number of directors to be elected multiplied by the number of votes to which that shareholder's shares are entitled, or distribute the shareholder's votes on the same principle among any or all of the candidates, as the shareholder deems fit. The candidates receiving the highest number of votes, up to the number of directors to be elected, shall be elected.
. . The transactions of any meeting of shareholders, either annual or special, however called and noticed, and wherever held, shall be as valid as though a meeting had been duly held after regular call and notice, if a quorum be present either in person or by proxy, and if, either before or after the meeting, each person entitled to vote, who was not present in person or by proxy, signs a written waiver of notice or a consent to the holding of the meeting, or an approval of the minutes. The waiver of notice or consent need not specify either the
Section 9
Waiver of Notice or Consent by Absent Shareholders
 
business to be transacted or the purpose of any annual or special meeting of shareholders, except that if action is taken or proposed to be taken for approval of any of those matters specified in the second paragraph of Section 4 of this Article II, the waiver of notice or consent shall state the general nature of the proposal. All such waivers, consents or approvals shall be filed with the corporate records or made a part of the minutes of the meeting.
Attendance by a person at a meeting shall also constitute a waiver of notice of and presence at that meeting, except when the person objects, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened, and except that attendance at a meeting is not a waiver of any right to object to the consideration of matters not included in the notice of the meeting if that objection is expressly made at the meeting.
. . Any action which may be taken at any annual or special meeting of shareholders may be taken without a meeting and without prior notice, if a consent in writing is prepared, setting forth the action so taken, signed by the holders of outstanding shares having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take that action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote on that action were present and voted. In the case of election of directors, such a consent shall be effective only if signed by the holders of all outstanding shares entitled to vote for the election of directors; provided, however, that a director may be elected at any time to fill a vacancy on the board of directors that has not been filled by the directors, by the written consent of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote for the election of directors. All such consents shall be filed with the secretary of the corporation and shall be maintained in the corporate records. Any shareholder giving a written consent, or the shareholder's proxy holder(s), or a transferee of the shares, or a personal representative of the shareholder or their respective proxy holder(s), may revoke the consent by a writing received by the secretary of the corporation before written consents of the number of shares required to authorize the proposed action have been filed with the secretary.
Section 10
Shareholder Action By Written Consent Without Meeting
If the consents of all shareholders entitled to vote have not been solicited in writing, and if the unanimous written consent of all such shareholders shall not have been received, the secretary shall give prompt notice of the corporate action approved by the shareholders without a meeting. This notice shall be given in the manner specified in Section 5 of this Article II. In the case of approval of (i) contracts or transactions in which a director has a direct or indirect financial interest, pursuant to Section 310 of the Corporations Code of California, (ii) indemnification of agents of the corporation, pursuant to Section 317 of that Code, (iii) a reorganization of the corporation, pursuant to Section 1201 of that Code, or (iv) a distribution in dissolution other than in accordance with the rights of outstanding preferred shares, pursuant to Section 2007 of that Code, the notice shall be given at least ten (10) days before the consummation of any action authorized by that approval.
 
. . For purposes of determining the shareholders entitled to notice of any meeting or to vote or entitled to give consent to corporate action without a meeting, the board of directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall not be more than sixty (60) days nor less than ten (10) days before the date of any such meeting nor more than sixty (60) days before any such action without a meeting, and in this event only shareholders of record on the date so fixed are entitled to notice and to vote or to give consents, as the case may be, notwithstanding any transfer of any shares after the record date, except as otherwise required by law.
Section 11
Record Date for Shareholder Notice, Voting and Giving Consents
If the board of directors does not so fix a record date:
(a) The record date for determining shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of shareholders shall be at the close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which notice is given or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held.
(b) The record date for determining shareholders entitled to give consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, (i) when no prior action by the board has been taken, shall be the day on which the first written consent is given, or (ii) when prior action of the board has been taken, shall be at the close of business on the day on which the board adopts the resolution relating to that action, or the sixtieth (60th) day before the date of such other action, whichever is later.
. . Every person entitled to vote for directors or on any other matter shall have the right to do so either in person or by one (1) or more agents authorized by a written proxy signed by the person and filed with the secretary of the corporation. A proxy shall be deemed signed if the shareholder's name is placed on the proxy (whether by manual signature, typewriting, telegraphic transmission or otherwise) by the shareholder or the shareholder's attorney in fact. A validly executed proxy which does not state that it is irrevocable shall continue in full force and effect unless (i) revoked by the person executing it, before the vote pursuant to that proxy, by a writing delivered to the corporation stating that the proxy is revoked, or by a subsequent proxy executed by, or attendance at the meeting and voting in person by, the person executing the proxy; or (ii) written notice of the death or incapacity of the maker of that proxy is received by the corporation before the vote pursuant to that proxy is counted; provided, however, that no proxy shall be valid after the expiration of eleven (11) months from the date of the proxy, unless otherwise provided in the proxy. The revocability of a proxy that states on its face that it is irrevocable shall be governed by the provisions of Sections 705(e) and 705(f) of the Corporations Code of California.
Section 12
Proxies
 
. . Before any meeting of shareholders, the board of directors may appoint any persons (other than nominees for office) to act as inspectors of election at the meeting or its adjournment. If no inspectors of election are so appointed, the chairman of the meeting may, and on the request of any shareholder or shareholder's proxy shall, appoint inspectors of election at the meeting. The number of inspectors shall be either one (1) or three (3). If inspectors are appointed at a meeting on the request of one (1) or more shareholders or proxies, the holders of a majority of shares or their proxies present at the meeting shall determine whether one (1) or three (3) inspectors are to be appointed. If any person appointed as inspector fails to appear or fails or refuses to act, the chairman of the meeting may, and upon the request of any shareholder or a shareholder's proxy shall, appoint a person to fill that vacancy.
Section 13
Inspectors of Election
These inspectors shall:
(a) Determine the number of shares outstanding and the voting power of each, the shares represented at the meeting, the existence of a quorum and the authenticity, validity and effect of proxies;
(b) Receive votes, ballots or consents;
(c) Hear and determine all challenges and questions in any way arising in connection with the right to vote;
(d) Count and tabulate all votes or consents;
(e) Determine when the polls shall close;
(f) Determine the result; and
(g) Do any other acts that may be proper to conduct the election or vote with fairness to all shareholders.
. . The chairman of the board, or such other officer(s) of the corporation designated by a majority of the board of directors, will call meetings of the shareholders to order and will act as presiding officer thereof. Unless otherwise determined by the board of directors prior to the meeting, the presiding officer of the meeting of the shareholders will also determine the order of business and have the authority in his or her sole discretion to regulate the conduct of any such meeting, including without limitation by (i) imposing restrictions on the persons (other than shareholders of the corporation or their duly appointed proxies) who may attend any such
Section 14
Order of Business
 
shareholders' meeting, (ii) ascertaining whether any shareholder or his proxy may be excluded from any meeting of the shareholders based upon any determination by the presiding officer, in his or her sole discretion, that any such person has unduly disrupted or is likely to disrupt the proceedings thereat, and (iii) determining the circumstances in which any person may make a statement or ask questions at any meeting of the shareholders.
At an annual meeting of the shareholders, only such business will be conducted or considered as is properly brought before the meeting. To be properly brought before an annual meeting, business must be (i) specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the board of directors, (ii) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by the presiding officer or by or at the direction of a majority of the board of directors, or (iii) otherwise properly requested to be brought before the meeting by a shareholder of the corporation in accordance with the immediately succeeding sentence. For business to be properly requested by a shareholder to be brought before an annual meeting, the shareholder must (i) be a shareholder of record at the time of the giving of the notice of such annual meeting by or at the direction of the board of directors, (ii) be entitled to vote at such meeting, and (iii) have given timely written notice thereof to the secretary of the corporation in accordance with Article II, Section 15 of these Bylaws.
Nominations of persons for election as directors of the corporation may be made at an annual meeting of shareholders only (i) by or at the direction of the board of directors or (ii) by any shareholder who is a shareholder of record at the time of the giving of the notice of such annual meeting by or at the direction of the board of directors, who is entitled to vote for the election of directors at such meeting and who has given timely written notice thereof to the secretary in accordance with Article II, Section 15 of these Bylaws. Only persons who are nominated in accordance with this Article II, Section 14 will be eligible for election at a meeting of shareholders as directors of the corporation.
At a special meeting of shareholders, only such business may be conducted or considered as is properly brought before the meeting. To be properly brought before a special meeting, business must be (i) specified in the notice of the meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the chairman of the board, the chief executive officer, the president, or the secretary or (ii) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by the presiding officer or by or at the direction of a majority of the board of directors. The determination of whether any business sought to be brought before any annual or special meeting of the shareholders is properly brought before such meeting in accordance with this Article II, Section 14, and whether any nomination of a person for election as a director of the corporation at any annual meeting of the shareholders was properly made in accordance with this Article II, Section 14, will be made by the presiding officer of such meeting. If the presiding officer determines that any business is
 
not properly brought before such meeting, or any nomination was not properly made, he or she will so declare to the meeting and any such business will not be conducted or considered and any such nomination will be disregarded.
Section 15. . To be timely for purposes of Article II, Section 14 of these Bylaws, a shareholder's notice must be addressed to the secretary and delivered or mailed to and received at the principal executive offices of the corporation not less than sixty (60) nor more than ninety (90) calendar days prior to the anniversary date of the date (as specified in the corporation's proxy materials for its immediately preceding annual meeting of shareholders) on which the corporation first mailed its proxy materials for its immediately preceding annual meeting of shareholders; , , that in the event the annual meeting is called for a date that is not within thirty (30) calendar days of the anniversary date of the date on which the immediately preceding annual meeting of shareholders was called, to be timely, notice by the shareholder must be so received not later than the close of business on the tenth (10th) calendar day following the day on which public announcement of the date of the annual meeting is first made. In no event will the public announcement of an adjournment of an annual meeting of shareholders commence a new time period for the giving of a shareholder's not as provided above.

that any person who is or was a director, officer, employee, trustee, or other agent of such a constituent corporation or who, being or having been such a director, officer, employee, trustee, or other agent, is or was serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee, trustee or other agent of another corporation as a director, officer, employee, trustee or other agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Article with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as such person would if he or she had served the resulting or surviving corporation in the same capacity;

. . This corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any proceeding, whether external or internal to this corporation (other than a judicial action or suit brought by or in the right of the corporation), by reason of the fact that such person is or was an agent of this corporation, against expenses, judgments, fines, settlements and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with such proceeding, or any appeal therein, if such person acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of this corporation, and with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such conduct was unlawful. The termination of any proceeding -- whether by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of or its equivalent -- shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of this corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, that such person had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful.
Section 2
Action, Etc. Other Than by or in the Right of the Corporation
nolo contendere
. . This corporation
Section 3
Actions, Etc. by or in the Right of the Corporation
 
shall indemnify any person who was or is a party, or is threatened to be made a party, to any proceeding by or in the right of this corporation to procure a judgment in its favor because that person is or was an agent of this corporation, against expenses actually and reasonably incurred by that person in connection with the defense, settlement or appeal of that action if that person acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation. No indemnification shall be made under this Section 3 in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which that person shall have been adjudged to be liable for gross negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of that person's duty to this corporation, unless and only to the extent that the court in which that action was brought shall determine upon application that, in view of all the circumstances of the case, that person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for the expenses which the court shall determine.
. . Any indemnification under Section 2 or 3 (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by this corporation unless a determination is reasonably and promptly made (i) by the board by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to such proceeding, or (ii) if such a quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable, if a quorum of disinterested directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (iii) by the stockholders, that such person acted in bad faith and in a manner that such person did not believe to be in or not opposed to the best interests of this corporation, or, with respect to any criminal proceeding, that such person believed or had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.
Section 4
Determination of Right of Indemnification
. . Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Article, to the extent that an agent of this corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise, including, without limitation, the dismissal of an action without prejudice or the settlement of an action without admission of liability, in defense of any proceeding or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, or on appeal from any such proceeding, action, claim or matter, such agent shall be indemnified against all expenses incurred in connection therewith.
Section 5
Indemnification Against Expenses of Successful Party
. . Except as limited by Section 7 of this Article, costs, charges and expenses incurred by any agent of the corporation in any proceeding or any appeal therefrom shall be paid by the corporation in advance of the final disposition of such matter, if said agent shall undertake to repay such amount in the event that it is ultimately determined, as provided herein, that such person is not entitled to indemnification. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no advance shall be made by this corporation if a determination is reasonably and promptly made by the board of directors by a majority vote of a quorum of disinterested directors, or (if such a quorum is not obtainable or, even if obtainable, a quorum of disinterested directors so directs) by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, that, based upon the facts known to the
Section 6
Advances of Expenses
 
board or counsel at the time such determination is made, such person acted in bad faith and in a manner that such person did not believe to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, or, with respect to any criminal proceeding, that such person believed or had reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. In no event shall any advance be made in instances where the board or independent legal counsel reasonably determines that such person deliberately breached his or her duty to the corporation or its shareholders.
. . Any indemnification under Sections 2, 3 and 5, or advance under Section 6 of this Article, shall be made promptly, and in any event within ninety (90) days, upon the written request of an agent of the corporation, unless with respect to applications under Sections 2, 3 or 6, a determination is reasonably and promptly made by the board of directors by a majority vote of a quorum of disinterested directors that such agent acted in a manner set forth in such Sections as to justify the corporation not indemnifying or making an advance to the agent. In the event no quorum of disinterested directors is obtainable, the board of directors shall promptly direct that independent legal counsel shall decide whether the agent acted in the manner set forth in such Sections as to justify the corporation not indemnifying or making an advance to the agent. The right to indemnification or advances as granted by this Article shall be enforceable by the agent in any court of competent jurisdiction, if the board or independent legal counsel denies the claim, in whole or in part, or if no disposition of such claim is made within ninety days. The agent's costs and expenses incurred in connection with successfully establishing his or her right to indemnification, in whole or in part, in any such proceeding shall also be indemnified by the corporation.
Section 7
Right of Agent to Indemnification Upon Application; Procedure Upon Application
. . The indemnification provided by this Article shall not be deemed exclusive of, and shall not affect, any other rights to which an agent of this corporation seeking indemnification may be entitled under any law, Bylaw, or charter provision, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in his or her official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be an agent of the corporation and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person. All rights to indemnification under this Article shall be deemed to be provided by a contract between the corporation and the agent who serves in such capacity at any time while these bylaws and other relevant provisions of the general corporation law and other applicable law, if any, are in effect. Any repeal or modification thereof shall not affect any rights or obligations then existing.
Section 8
Other Rights and Remedies
. . Upon resolution passed by the board, the corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was an agent of the corporation against any liability asserted against such person and incurred
Section 9
Insurance
 
by him or her in any such capacity, or arising out of his or her status as such, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such liability under the provisions of this Article. The corporation may create a trust fund, grant a security interest or use other means (including, without limitation, a letter of credit) to ensure the payment of such sums as may become necessary to effect indemnification as provided herein.
. . If this Article or any portion thereof shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each agent as to expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement with respect to any action, suit, appeal, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative, and whether internal or external, including a grand jury proceeding and an action or suit brought by or in the right of the corporation, to the full extent permitted by any applicable portion of this Article that shall not have been invalidated, or by any other applicable law.
Section 10
Savings Clause
. . The corporation shall keep at its principal executive office, or at the office of its transfer agent or registrar, if either is appointed and as determined by resolution of the board of directors, a record of its shareholders, giving the names and addresses of all shareholders and the number and class of shares held by each shareholder.

This list shall be made available to any such shareholder by the transfer agent on or before the later of five (5) days after the demand is received or the date specified in the demand as of the date on which the list is to be compiled. The record of shareholders shall also be open to inspection on the written demand of any shareholder or holder of a voting trust certificate, at any time during usual business hours, for a purpose reasonably related to the holder's interests as a shareholder or as the holder of a voting trust certificate. Any inspection and copying under this Section 1 may be made in person or by an agent or attorney of the shareholder or holder of a voting trust certificate making the demand.

The minutes and accounting books and records shall be open to inspection upon the written demand of any shareholder or holder of a voting trust certificate, at any reasonable time during usual business hours, for a purpose reasonably related to the holder's interests as a shareholder or as the holder of a voting trust certificate. The inspection may be made in person or by an agent or attorney and shall include the right to copy and make extracts. These rights of inspection shall extend to the records of each subsidiary corporation of the corporation.
Section 3
Maintenance and Inspection of Other Corporate Records
. . Every director shall have the absolute right at any reasonable time to inspect and copy all books, records and documents of every kind and the physical properties of the corporation and each of its subsidiary corporations.

Section 4
Inspection by Directors
. . The annual report to shareholders referred to in Section 1501 of the California General Corporation Law is expressly dispensed with, but nothing herein shall be interpreted as prohibiting the board of directors from issuing annual or other periodic reports to the shareholders of the corporation as they consider appropriate.
Section 5
Annual Report to Shareholders
 
. . To the extent permitted by applicable law, any records maintained by the corporation in the regular course of its business, including its stock ledger, books of account and minute books, may be kept in electronic form or any other information storage device, provided that the records so kept can be converted into clearly legible form within a reasonable time. The corporation shall so convert any records so kept upon the request of any person entitled to inspect the same.
Section 6
Form of Records
. . For purposes of determining the shareholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any other lawful action (other than action by shareholders by written consent without a meeting), the board of directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall not be more than sixty (60) days before any such action, and in that case only shareholders of record on the date so fixed are entitled to receive the dividend, distribution or allotment of rights or to exercise the rights, as the case may be, notwithstanding any transfer of any shares after the record date so fixed, except as otherwise provided in the California General Corporation Law.
Section 1
Record Date for Purposes Other Than Notice and Voting
If the board of directors does not so fix a record date, the record date for determining shareholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the board adopts the applicable resolution or the sixtieth (60th) day before the date of that action, whichever is later.
. . All checks, drafts or other orders for payment of money, notes or other evidences of indebtedness, issued in the name of or payable to the corporation, shall be signed or endorsed by such person or persons and in such manner as, from time to time, shall be determined by resolution of the board of directors.
Section 2
Checks, Drafts, Evidences of Indebtedness
. . The board of directors, except as otherwise provided in these bylaws, may authorize any officer or officers, agent or agents, to enter into any contract or execute any instrument in the name of and on behalf of the corporation, and this authority may be general or confined to specific instances; and, unless so authorized or ratified by the board of directors or within the agency power of an officer, no officer, agent or employee shall have any power or authority to bind the corporation by any contract or engagement or to pledge its credit or to render it liable for any purpose or for any amount.
Section 3
Corporate Contracts and Instruments; How Executed

Any certificates that are issued shall be signed in the name of the corporation by the chairman of the board, the president or vice president and by the chief financial officer, an assistant treasurer, the secretary or any assistant secretary, certifying the number of shares and the class or series of shares owned by the shareholder. Any or all of the signatures on the certificate may be facsimile. In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed on a certificate shall have ceased to be that officer, transfer agent or registrar before that certificate is issued, it may be issued by the corporation with the same effect as if that person were an officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue. Shares of the corporation's capital stock may also be evidenced by registration in the holder's name in uncertificated, book-entry form on the books of the corporation in accordance with a direct registration system approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission and by the Nasdaq Global Market or any securities exchange on which the stock of the corporation may from time to time be traded.

Certificates for Shares; Direct Registration System.
Transfers of shares of stock of the corporation shall be made by the transfer agent and registrar on the books of the corporation after receipt of a request with proper evidence of succession, assignment, or authority to transfer by the record holder of such stock, or by an attorney lawfully constituted in writing, and in the case of stock represented by a certificate, upon surrender of the certificate. Subject to the foregoing, the board of directors shall have power and authority to make such rules and regulations as it shall deem necessary or appropriate concerning the issue, transfer, and registration of shares of stock of the corporation, and to appoint and remove transfer agents and registrars of transfers.
. . Any person claiming a certificate of stock to be lost, stolen, mislaid, or destroyed shall make an affidavit or affirmation of that fact and verify the same in such manner as the board of directors may require, and shall, if the board of directors so requires, give the corporation, its transfer agents, registrars, and/or other agents a bond of indemnity in form approved by counsel, and in amount and with such sureties as may be satisfactory to the corporate secretary of the corporation, before a new certificate (or uncertificated shares in lieu of a new certificate) may be issued of the same tenor and for the same number of shares as the one alleged to have been lost, stolen, mislaid, or destroyed.
Section 5
Lost Certificates
. . The chairman of the board, the president, any vice president, or any other person authorized by resolution of the board of directors or by any of the foregoing designated officers, is authorized to vote on behalf of the corporation any and all shares of any other corporation
Section 6

or corporations, foreign or domestic, standing in the name of the corporation. The authority granted to these officers to vote or represent on behalf of the corporation any and all shares held by the corporation in any other corporation or corporations may be exercised either by such officers in person or by any other person authorized so to do by proxy duly executed by these officers.
. . Unless the context requires otherwise, the general provisions, rules of construction and definitions in the California General Corporation Law shall govern the construction of these bylaws. Without limiting the generality of this provision, wherever the context so indicates, the singular number shall include the plural, the plural number shall include the singular, and the term "person" shall include both a corporation and a natural person.
Section 7

Any such notice shall be addressed to the person to whom notice is to be given at such persons address as it appears on the records of the Corporation.

Any written waiver of notice, signed by the person entitled to notice or a waiver by electronic transmission by the person entitled to notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice.
Section 8
Notice; Waiver of Notice
. . New bylaws may be adopted or these bylaws may be amended or repealed by the vote or written consent of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote; provided, however, that if the articles of incorporation of the corporation set forth the number of authorized directors of the corporation, the authorized number of directors may be changed only by an amendment of the articles of incorporation.

Exhibit 99.1 BJ's Restaurants, Inc. Reports Financial Results for the Second Quarter of Fiscal 2007 HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 26, 2007--BJ's Restaurants, Inc. (NASDAQ:BJRI) today reported revenues and net income for the second quarter ended July 3, 2007. Highlights for the 13 weeks ended July 3, 2007, compared to the 13 weeks ended July 4, 2006, were as follows: -- Revenues increased approximately 37% to $79.3 million -- Comparable restaurant sales increased 7.5% -- Net income increased approximately 40% to $3.3 million -- Diluted net income per share increased 20% to $0.12 "Our leadership team was very pleased with our financial results for the second quarter of 2007," commented Jerry Deitchle, President and CEO. "In spite of the ongoing challenging operating environment, in general, for most casual dining companies, BJ's achieved its 43rd consecutive quarter of comparable sales increases with a strong 7.5% increase during the second quarter, successfully hurdling a 5.9% increase in the same quarter last year, which is quite remarkable. We believe that our continuing strong sales momentum is a direct result of the key initiatives and investments we have implemented over the past couple of years to further improve the quality and differentiation of the BJ's dining experience while, at the same time, protecting and enhancing the overall 'approachability' and value of BJ's for the casual dining consumer. Having said that, we still have many more opportunities to further improve the quality and productivity of the BJ's concept. These will be the principal focus of our 2008 key initiatives." During the second quarter, the Company opened three new restaurants (Orlando, FL, Palmdale, CA and Norman, OK). "In addition to our continuing strong comparable sales trends, we have also been very pleased with the sales volumes for all of our 2007 restaurant openings to date," commented Greg Levin, Chief Financial Officer. "We remain particularly pleased with the sales volumes for BJ's initial openings in the states of Florida, Ohio and Oklahoma earlier this year." The Company remains on track to open as many as 13 new restaurants during fiscal 2007 and thereby increase its total restaurant operating weeks by 20% to 25% as initially targeted. To date, six restaurants have opened and seven more are currently under construction. The Company currently anticipates opening four new restaurants in the third quarter, of which one has already opened in Oklahoma City, OK, and four new restaurants in the fourth quarter. Due to many factors that are outside of our influence and control, the timing of new restaurant openings may change. "Our new restaurant development pipeline for 2008 is already in excellent shape as of today," commented Greg Lynds, Chief Development Officer. "We have signed letters of intent in hand for as many as 15 new, high quality restaurant locations next year, which would enable us to achieve our targeted 20% to 25% growth rate in total restaurant operating weeks." Investor Conference Call and Webcast BJ's Restaurants, Inc. will conduct a conference call on its second quarter earnings release today, July 26, 2007, at 2:00 p.m. (Pacific).

BJ'S RESTAURANTS, INC. October 25, 2007 (Registrant) By: /s/ GERALD W. DEITCHLE ----------------------------------------- Gerald W.

Exhibit 99.1 BJ's Restaurants, Inc. Reports Strong Financial Results for the Third Quarter of Fiscal 2007 HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 25, 2007--BJ's Restaurants, Inc. (NASDAQ:BJRI) today reported revenues and net income for the third quarter ended October 2, 2007. Highlights for the 13 weeks ended October 2, 2007, compared to the 13 weeks ended October 3, 2006, were as follows: -- Revenues increased approximately 30% to $80.4 million -- Comparable restaurant sales increased 5.6% -- Net income increased approximately 31% to $3.1 million -- Diluted net income per share increased 20% to $0.12 "Our leadership team was very pleased with our solid financial results for the third quarter," commented Jerry Deitchle, President and CEO. "As most restaurant industry investors know, the operating environment for casual dining restaurants in general continues to be very challenging from almost every perspective. In spite of those continuing challenges, BJ's continues to profitably increase its market share in the highly competitive 'grill and bar' segment. Our 5.6% comparable sales increase during the third quarter successfully hurdled a strong 5.3% increase for the same quarter last year and represented our 44th consecutive quarter of positive comparisons on that measure since our 1996 IPO. BJ's continues to rank among the leaders in the casual dining segment for driving comparable sales gains, thanks to the inherent competitive strengths of our concept and our steadily improving ability to correctly and consistently execute in our restaurants." "In this difficult operating environment, where consumer spending for casual dining occasions and the prime costs of doing business will likely continue to be under significant pressure on an absolute basis for the foreseeable future, we believe the more successful casual dining concepts will be those that protect their overall consumer 'approachability' for all dining occasions and that offer even greater quality, differentiation and overall value to the consumer," said Deitchle. "These have always been the competitive strengths of the BJ's concept. As our investors know, during the past couple of years we have invested significantly to raise the overall quality of the BJ's dining experience to further distance ourselves from the mature, 'mass market' casual dining concepts. While these investments have had their typical initial rollout costs and associated 'learning curve' challenges to overcome, we believe they have better positioned BJ's to continue profitably growing its market share and to further leverage our business model during 2008." During the third quarter, the Company opened four new restaurants (Oklahoma City, OK; Citrus Park, FL; McAllen, TX and Stockton, CA). "Our development team has done an outstanding job in delivering high quality locations on time, and our operations team has provided the 'gold standard' training and operating execution to enable the high quality dining experience that we expect from the first day a new BJ's opens," commented Greg Levin, Chief Financial Officer. "As a result, we are extremely pleased with our sales volumes for all of our 2007 restaurant openings." The Company has already opened three new restaurants in the fourth quarter (Temple, TX; Montebello, CA and Glendale, CA) and anticipates opening its 13th and final new restaurant for 2007 in Austin, TX prior to Thanksgiving. "We are very pleased to have accomplished our previously stated goal to open as many as 13 new restaurants during 2007," commented Greg Lynds, Chief Development Officer. "During 2008, we continue to target as many as 15 new restaurant openings and thereby achieve a targeted 20% to 25% increase in total restaurant operating weeks." The Company also announced the appointments of Greg Levin and Greg Lynds to Executive Vice Presidents. Both executives will retain their current responsibilities as Chief Financial Officer and Chief Development Officer, respectively. "Greg and Greg are two of the most capable executives that I have worked with in my 30 years in the restaurant industry," said Deitchle. "Their proven management skills and effective leadership will become increasingly valuable as BJ's continues to execute its national expansion plan."

The new BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse is located at the intersection of Brodie Lane and US Hwy 290 on a free-standing pad within the new regional shopping center known as the Sunset Valley Village in Austin, Texas. The new BJ's restaurant is approximately 8,000 square feet, contains seating for 260 guests and features BJ's extensive menu that includes BJ's signature deep-dish pizza, award winning handcrafted beer and our famous Pizookie(R) dessert. BJ's highly detailed, contemporary decor and unique video statement, including several high definition flat panel televisions, creates a high energy, fun and family-friendly dining environment for everyone to enjoy.

"We are excited to bring the BJ's concept to Austin," said Jerry Deitchle, President and CEO. "Sales for our first day of opening were stronger than we expected. Our Austin restaurant is our 11th restaurant in the state of Texas, where our comparable sales increases have been very strong during the past couple of years and also where initial sales volumes for our new restaurants have also been strong. Our Austin opening represents our 13th and final opening for 2007, and successfully completes our previously stated development goal for the year. Our development team, led by Greg Lynds as Executive Vice President and Chief Development Officer, executed our 2007 growth plan exceptionally well. Additionally, our restaurant operations team, led by Lon Ledwith as Senior Vice President of Restaurant Operations and supported by Nanette McWhertor as Vice President of New Restaurant Openings, executed our high volume openings very effectively." The Company reiterates its goal to open as many as 15 new restaurants during 2008 and thereby increase its total restaurant operating weeks by approximately 20% to 25% during the year.

On December 12, 2007, the Board of Directors of the BJ's Restaurants, Inc. made certain amendments to the charters of its Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Governance and Nominating Committee. Complete copies of the charters, as amended, are attached hereto as Exhibits 99.1 through 99.3. Complete copies of these charters are also available on the Company's website at www.bjsrestaurants.com under the heading "Investors" and subheading "Corporate Governance."
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
Purpose
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Committee") shall provide assistance to the Board of Directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibility to the shareholders, potential shareholders, the investment community, and others relating to: the quality and integrity of the Company's financial statements; the financial reporting process; the systems of internal accounting and financial controls; the performance of the Company's independent auditors; the independent auditor's qualifications and independence; and the Company's compliance with ethics policies and legal and regulatory requirements. In so doing, it is the policy of the Committee to maintain and foster free and open communication between the Committee, independent auditors and management of the Company.
Authority
In discharging its oversight role, the Committee is empowered to investigate any matter brought to its attention with full access to all books, records, facilities, and personnel of the Company and the authority to engage independent counsel and other advisers as it determines necessary to carry out its duties. The Company will provide the Committee with appropriate funding, as the Committee determines, for the payment of compensation to the Company's independent auditor, outside counsel and other advisors as it deems appropriate, and administrative expenses of the Committee that are necessary and appropriate in carrying out its duties. Any communication between the Committee and legal counsel in the course of obtaining legal advice will be considered privileged communication of the Company, and the Committee will take all necessary steps to preserve the privileged nature of those communications. The Committee may form and delegate authority to subcommittees and may delegate authority to one or more designated members of the Committee, provided that any actions by such subcommittees or individual members shall be disclosed to the Committee at its next scheduled meeting.
Membership and Organization
The Committee shall consist of at least three members of the Board of Directors, each of whom (i) is "independent" under the rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market, LLC, the SEC and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, (ii) does not accept any consulting, advisory, or other compensatory fee from the Company other than in his or her capacity as a member of the Board or any committee of the Board, and (iii) is not an affiliated persons of the Company. All Committee members must be able to read and understand fundamental financial statements, including a company's balance sheet, income statement and cash flow statement. At least one member of the Committee shall, in the judgment of the Board, be an "audit committee financial expert," as defined by the rules and regulations of the SEC.
The members of the Committee and its chairperson shall be appointed by and serve at the discretion of the Board.
Generally, no member of the Committee may serve on more than three audit committees of publicly traded companies (including the Audit Committee of the Company) at the same time. For this purpose, service on the audit committee of a parent and its substantially-owned subsidiaries counts as service on a single audit committee. The Board has the discretion to grant exceptions to this general rule subject to compliance with applicable regulatory requirements and applicable NASDAQ rules.
Meetings
The Committee shall hold such regular or special meetings as its members shall deem necessary or appropriate, it being understood that the Committee will ordinarily meet quarterly in advance of the release of quarterly financial results. In addition, the Committee will separately meet on a periodic basis with management (including the CFO) and the independent auditors to discuss any matters that the Committee or any of these persons or firms believe should be discussed. The Committee may request any officer or employee of the Company or the Company's outside counsel or independent auditors to attend a meeting of the Committee or to meet with any members of, or consultants to, the Committee. The Committee will cause to be kept adequate minutes of its proceedings, and will report on its actions and activities at the next quarterly meeting of the Board. Committee members will be furnished with copies of the minutes of each meeting and any action taking by unanimous consent. The Committee is governed by the same rules regarding meetings (including meetings by conference telephone or similar communications equipment), actions without meetings, notice, waiver of notice, and quorum and voting requirements as are applicable to the Board. The Committee is authorized and empowered to adopt its own rules of procedure not inconsistent with (a) any provision of the Company's Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws, or (b) the laws of California.
Duties and Responsibilities
The primary responsibility of the Committee is to oversee the Company's financial reporting process on behalf of the Board of Directors and report the results of their activities to the Board. While the Committee has the responsibilities and powers set forth in this Charter, it is not the duty of the Committee to plan or conduct audits or to determine that the Company's financial statements are complete and accurate and are in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Management is responsible for the preparation, presentation, and integrity of the Company's financial statements and for the appropriateness of the accounting principles and reporting policies that are used by the Company. The independent auditors are responsible for planning and carrying out a proper audit of the Company's annual financial statements, reviewing the Company's unaudited interim financial statements, and other procedures.
The Committee, in carrying out its responsibilities, believes its policies and procedures should remain flexible, in order to best react to changing conditions and circumstances. The Committee will take appropriate actions to set the overall corporate "tone" for quality financial reporting, sound business risk practices, and ethical behavior. The following shall be the principal duties and responsibilities of the Committee. These are set forth as a guide with the understanding that the Committee may supplement them as appropriate.
1. The Committee shall be directly responsible for the appointment, retention, and termination of the independent auditors (subject, if applicable, to shareholder ratification), and the independent auditors must report directly to the Committee. The Committee also shall be directly responsible for the oversight of the work of the independent auditors, including resolution of disagreements between management and the auditor regarding financial reporting.
2. The Committee shall consider and pre-approve all audit and non-audit services provided by the independent auditors. All non-audit services permitted to be performed by the independent auditors pursuant to applicable law and regulations shall be considered and pre-approved by the Committee and such approvals must be disclosed in the Company's public filings to the extent required by law or regulation. The Committee may delegate pre-approval authority to a member of the Committee. The decisions of any Committee member to whom pre-approval authority is delegated must be disclosed to the full Committee at its next scheduled meeting.
3. The Committee shall report its findings regularly to the Board, including any issues that arise with respect to the quality or integrity of the Company's financial statements, the Company's compliance with legal or regulatory requirements, and the performance and independence of the Company's independent auditors.
4. At least annually, the Committee shall obtain and review a formal written statement by the independent auditors describing:
 
 
5. The Committee shall actively engage in a dialogue with the Company's management and the independent auditors with respect to any disclosed relationships or services that may impact the objectivity and independence of the auditors from management and the Company and take appropriate action in response to the auditor's report to satisfy itself of the auditor's objectivity and independence. The Committee shall also (i) confirm with the independent auditors that such firm is in compliance with the partner rotation requirements established by the SEC, (ii) set clear policies for the Company's approval of hiring of employees or former employees of the Company's independent auditors, and (iii) if applicable, consider whether the independent auditor's provision of non-audit services to the Company is compatible with maintaining the independence of such firm.
6. The Committee shall discuss with the independent auditors the overall scope and plans for their respective audits, including the adequacy of staffing and compensation. Also, the Committee shall discuss with management and independent auditors the adequacy and effectiveness of the accounting and financial controls, including the Company's policies and procedures to assess, monitor, manage and minimize business risk, and legal and ethical compliance programs (e.g., Company's Codes of Ethics and Conduct).
7. The Committee shall meet separately periodically with management, the CFO and/or Controller, and the independent auditors to discuss issues and concerns warranting Committee attention. The Committee shall provide sufficient opportunity for the independent auditors to meet privately with the members of the Committee. The Committee shall review with the independent auditor any audit problems or difficulties and management's response.
8. The Committee shall receive a report from the independent auditor, prior to the filing of its audit report with the SEC, on all critical accounting policies and practices of the Company, any significant changes thereto, all material alternative treatments of financial information within generally accepted accounting principles that have been discussed with management, including the ramifications of the use of such alternative treatments and disclosures and the treatment preferred by the independent auditor, and other material written communications between the independent auditor and management.
9. The Committee will review management's assertion on its assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls as of the end of the most recent fiscal year and the independent auditors' report on management's assertion. In this regard, the Committee will inquire of the Company's CEO, CFO and Chief Accounting Officer (if applicable) as to the existence of any deficiencies in the design or operation of internal controls that could adversely affect the Company's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data, any material weaknesses in internal controls, and any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the Company's internal controls.
10. The Committee shall review and discuss all earnings press releases prior to their release, as well as all formal financial information and earnings guidance provided to analysts and rating agencies.
11. The Committee shall review the interim financial statements and disclosures under Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations with management and the independent auditors prior to the filing of the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Also, the Committee shall discuss the results of the quarterly review and any other matters required to be communicated to the Committee by the independent auditors under generally accepted auditing standards.
12. The Committee shall review with management and independent auditors the financial statements and disclosures under Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations to be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K (or the annual report to shareholders if distributed prior to the filing of Form 10-K), including their judgment about the quality, not just the acceptability, of accounting principles, the reasonableness of significant judgments, and the clarity of the disclosures in the financial statements. Also, the Committee shall discuss the results of the annual audit and any other matters required to be communicated to the Committee by the independent auditors under generally accepted auditing standards.
13. The Committee shall establish procedures for the receipt, retention, and treatment of complaints received by the issuer regarding accounting, internal accounting controls, or auditing matters, and the confidential, anonymous submission by employees of the issuer of concerns regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters.
14. The Committee shall receive corporate attorneys' reports of evidence of a material violation of securities laws or breaches of fiduciary duty.
15. The Committee also prepares its report to be included in the Company's annual proxy statement, as required by SEC regulations.
16. The Committee shall periodically review and reassess the adequacy of its Charter and shall annually evaluate its performance and compliance with its Charter.

Authority
The Committee will have the resources and authority necessary to discharge its duties and responsibilities.

Any communication between the Committee and legal counsel in the course of obtaining legal advice will be considered privileged communication of the Company, and the Committee will take all necessary steps to preserve the privileged nature of those communications.
The Committee will serve as the "Committee" established to administer equity-based and employee benefit plans, and as such will discharge any responsibilities imposed on the Committee under those plans, including making and authorizing grants, in accordance with the terms of those plans. The Committee may delegate to one or more executive officers the authority to make grants of stock options and stock awards to eligible individuals who are not executive officers. The Committee may not delegate any decisions with respect to equity compensation for any executive officer of the Company. Any executive officer to whom the Committee grants such authority shall regularly report to the Committee any grants so made. The Committee may revoke any such delegation of authority at any time.
The Committee may form and delegate authority to subcommittees and may delegate authority to one or more designated members of the Committee to perform certain of its duties on its behalf including, to the extent permitted under applicable law, the delegation to a subcommittee of at least two directors the authority to grant equity awards, provided that any actions by such subcommittees or individual members shall be disclosed to the Committee at its next scheduled meeting.
Membership and Organization
The Committee shall consist of at least three members of the Board of Directors, each of whom (i) is "independent" under the rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market, LLC, the SEC and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, (ii) is a "non-employee director" within the meaning of Rule 16b-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and does not accept any consulting, advisory, or other compensatory fee from the Company other than in his or her capacity as a member of the Board or any committee of the Board, and (iii) is an "outside director" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code.
The members of the of the Committee and its chairperson shall be appointed by and serve at the discretion of the Board.
Meetings
The Committee shall hold such regular or special meetings as its members shall deem necessary or appropriate, it being understood that the Committee will ordinarily meet at least two times a year at a time and place determined by the Committee chairperson. The Committee may invite such members of management to its meetings, as it may deem desirable or appropriate, consistent with the maintenance of the confidentiality of compensation discussions. The Company's Chief Executive Officer should not attend any portion of a meeting where his/her performance or compensation is discussed, unless specifically invited by the Committee. The Committee will cause to be kept adequate minutes of its proceedings, and will report on its actions and activities at the next quarterly meeting of the Board. Committee members will be furnished with copies of the minutes of each meeting and any action taking by unanimous consent. The Committee is governed by the same rules regarding meetings (including meetings by conference telephone or similar communications equipment), actions without meetings, notice, waiver of notice, and quorum and voting requirements as are applicable to the Board. The Committee is authorized and empowered to adopt its own rules of procedure not inconsistent with (a) any provision of the Company's Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws, or (b) the laws of California.
Duties and Responsibilities
The following are the principal duties and responsibilities of the Committee:
1. In consultation with senior management, the Committee shall establish the Company's general compensation philosophy, and oversee the development and implementation of compensation programs.
2. Review and approve corporate goals and objectives relevant to the compensation of the CEO, evaluate the performance of the CEO in light of those goals and objectives, and either as a committee or together with the other independent directors (as directed by the Board), determine and approve the CEO's compensation level based on this evaluation. In determining the long-term incentive component of the CEO's compensation, the Committee shall consider, among other factors, the Company's performance and relative shareholder return, the value of similar incentive awards to chief executive officers at comparable companies and the awards granted to the CEO in past years.
3. Conduct an annual evaluation of the performance of the CEO.
4. Together with the CEO, annually review the performance of executive officers and other officers designated as a "chief" other than the CEO.
5. Make recommendations to the Board with respect to compensation for all Company executive officers other than the CEO, all officers designated as "chief," and such other key employees as the Board may authorize it to consider. The CEO shall, at his/her discretion, have the authority to alter compensation for executives below the level of "chief" without Committee approval, provided the revised compensation does not exceed the competitive marketplace.
6. New officer hires and the compensation for such officer(s), other than any officer designated as "chief" may be made by the CEO (or another executive officer designated by the CEO) without Committee approval, provided that the compensation does not exceed the competitive marketplace. The Committee shall be promptly notified of any such hiring and compensation. The Committee shall approve the new hiring of officers designated as "chief" and the compensation of such officers and shall promptly notify the Board of any such hiring and compensation.
7. Approve new compensation plans or other material perquisites benefiting officers or senior officers.
8. Act as the "Committee" under any equity incentive plans of the Company and review and approve all grants and awards to executive officers and other participants under the Company's equity incentive plans. The Committee may delegate, with such parameters or limitations as the Committee may decide, to one or more executive officers the authority to make grants of stock options and stock awards to eligible individuals who are not executive officers.
9. Periodically evaluate compensation for members of the Board and its committees and review and approve changes in such compensation plans relating to director compensation. Directors who are employees of the Company shall not be compensated for their service as a director (other than reimbursement of expenses incurred in attending board and committee meetings).

10. Review and report on any additional compensation matters as the Board requests.
11. Review and discuss with the Board plans for executive officer development and succession planning for the CEO and all executive officers.
12. Review and approve the Company's retirement, welfare benefits and equity based programs, including their administration and the service provided those by any outside consultants.

To Present At The 6th Annual Cowen and Company Consumer Conference; Also Reports Preliminary Unaudited Revenues For the Fourth Quarter of 2007." The press release issued by the Registrant in connection with the announcement is attached to this report as Exhibit 99.1. The information in this Form 8-K and Exhibits attached hereto are being furnished and shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.

LEVIN --------------------- Gregory S. Levin Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Exhibit 99.1 BJ'S Restaurants, Inc. to Present at the 6th Annual Cowen and Company Consumer Conference; Also Reports Preliminary, Unaudited Revenues for the Fourth Quarter of 2007 HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 7, 2008--BJ's Restaurants, Inc. (NASDAQ:BJRI) will be presenting at the 6th Annual Cowen and Company Consumer Conference in New York City on Tuesday, January 15, 2008 at 8:00 am (Eastern). Jerry Deitchle, President and CEO; Greg Levin, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Greg Lynds, Executive Vice President and Chief Development Officer will be presenting on behalf of the Company. Investors and interested parties may listen to the presentation at the Company's website located at http://www.bjsrestaurants.com. The presentation can be accessed by clicking on the "Investors" link from the Company's home page followed by the "Presentation" link. An archive of the presentation will be available following the live presentation for 30 days. The Company also reported preliminary, unaudited revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, which ended on Tuesday, January 1, 2008. Revenues for the fourth quarter increased approximately 29% to $85.2 million compared to $65.9 million for the same quarter last year. Comparable restaurant sales increased approximately 4.9% during the quarter, successfully hurdling a strong 5.5% increase in comparable restaurant sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. Additionally, the total revenue contribution from the Company's newer restaurants exceeded management's expectations during the fourth quarter. "BJ's strong increase in revenues for the fourth quarter is all the more remarkable when considering the increasingly difficult macro operating environment for consumer sentiment and spending," commented Jerry Deitchle, President and CEO. "Our 4.9% increase in comparable restaurant sales for the fourth quarter marks BJ's 45th straight quarter of positive comparisons on that measure and reflects the sustained popularity and perceived value BJ's has with consumers." For the full fiscal years of 2005, 2006 and 2007, BJ's comparable restaurant sales increased approximately 4.6%, 5.8% and 6.2%, respectively. "We believe these impressive sales increases are attributable to the strategy we have been executing during the past three years to more clearly define BJ's as a higher quality, more differentiated 'casual-plus' concept, coupled with the favorable impacts of our operational toolset rollouts on our four-wall execution and modest menu price increases that have been accepted by our guests," said Deitchle. "We remain highly confident about BJ's opportunity to continue to gain market share in the estimated $90 billion-plus casual dining industry. Going forward into 2008, our leadership team has never felt better about the factors in BJ's business that we can control." "Like most restaurant company management teams and industry observers, we do not foresee a meaningful industry-wide turnaround from the current difficult macroeconomic trends during the upcoming year," commented Greg Levin, Executive Vice President and CFO. "Having said that, with a quality menu of over 100 menu items, including our signature pizza and beer offerings, at an average guest check of approximately $12, we believe the BJ's concept is well positioned to continue its profitable growth during 2008. We continue to work on a number of initiatives that are intended to help offset the pressures of the operating environment on guest traffic in general including, but not limited to, strengthening our off-premise sales channel (including online ordering and curbside cashiering technology rollouts) and offering call-ahead seating and upgraded beverage, lunch and kids programs that are more effectively marketed." During 2007, the Company achieved its stated goal to open as many as 13 new restaurants and thereby increased its total restaurant operating weeks by approximately 23% compared to the previous year. "We are pleased to reiterate our goal to open as many as 15 new restaurants during 2008 and thereby increase our total restaurant operating weeks another 20% to 25%," commented Greg Lynds, Executive Vice President and Chief Development Officer. "Signed leases or letters of intent are already in place to support our targeted new restaurant growth for 2008, and five new restaurants are already under construction. Additionally, thanks in large part to BJ's growing national reputation and the success of our 'casual-plus' strategy, we are now in a position to secure higher profile sites that have greater amounts of landlord construction contributions available. We believe this is a significant vote of confidence for the BJ's concept from the retail development community." BJ's Restaurants, Inc. currently owns and operates 68 casual dining restaurants under the BJ's Restaurant & Brewery, BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse or BJ's Pizza & Grill brand names. BJ's restaurants offer an innovative and broad menu featuring award winning, signature deep-dish pizza complemented with generously portioned salads, sandwiches, soups, pastas, entrees and desserts. Quality, flavor, value, moderate prices and sincere service and hospitality remain distinct attributes of the BJ's experience. The Company operates several microbreweries which produce and distribute BJ's critically acclaimed, handcrafted beers throughout the chain. The Company's restaurants are located in California (39), Texas (11), Arizona (4), Colorado (3), Oregon (3), Nevada (2), Florida (3), Ohio (1) and Oklahoma (2).

We continue to work on a number of initiatives that are intended to help offset the pressures of the operating environment on guest traffic in general including, but not limited to, strengthening our off-premise sales channel (including online ordering and curbside cashiering technology rollouts) and offering call-ahead seating and upgraded beverage, lunch and kids programs that are more effectively marketed.
During 2007, the Company achieved its stated goal to open as many as 13 new restaurants and thereby increased its total restaurant operating weeks by approximately 23% compared to the previous year. We are pleased to reiterate our goal to open as many as 15 new restaurants during 2008 and thereby increase our total restaurant operating weeks another 20% to 25%, commented Greg Lynds, Executive Vice President and Chief Development Officer. Signed leases or letters of intent are already in place to support our targeted new restaurant growth for 2008, and five new restaurants are already under construction. Additionally, thanks in large part to BJs growing national reputation and the success of our casual-plus strategy, we are now in a position to secure higher profile sites that have greater amounts of landlord construction contributions available. We believe this is a significant vote of confidence for the BJs concept from the retail development community.

BJ
s Restaurants, Inc. Reports Strong Financial Results for the Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year of 2007
HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--BJs Restaurants, Inc. (NASDAQ: BJRI) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended January 1, 2008.
Highlights for the 13 weeks ended January 1, 2008 compared to the 13 weeks ended January 2, 2007 were as follows:
Revenues increased approximately 29% to $85.2 million
Comparable restaurant sales increased 4.9%
Net income increased approximately 31% to $3.7 million
Diluted net income per share increased 27% to $0.14
Four new restaurants opened
Total restaurant operating weeks increased approximately 24% to 873
Highlights for the 52 weeks ended January 1, 2008 compared to the 52 weeks ended January 2, 2007, were as follows:
Revenues increased approximately 32% to $316.1 million
Comparable restaurant sales increased 6.2%
Net income and fully diluted net income per share increased approximately 19% and 7% to $11.7 million and $0.44, respectively
Excluding the effect of a non-cash, pretax charge of $2.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 primarily related to asset disposals, non-GAAP net income and fully diluted net income per share increased approximately 33% and 20% to $13.1 million and $0.49, respectively
Thirteen new restaurants opened
Total restaurant operating weeks increased approximately 24% to 3,172
Our leadership team was very pleased with BJs strong financial performance for the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2007, commented Jerry Deitchle, President and CEO. In spite of the increasingly difficult operating environment for both consumers and casual dining restaurants, BJs achieved a solid 4.9% increase in comparable restaurant sales for the fourth quarter and a strong 6.2% increase in comparable restaurant sales for the year. Our 4.9% increase in comparable restaurant sales during the fourth quarter represented our 45 consecutive quarter of positive comparisons on that measure since our 1996 IPO.
th
We remain confident that 2008 offers a significant opportunity for BJs to continue to gain market share in the estimated $90 billion-plus casual dining industry, continued Deitchle. Our leadership team has never felt better about the factors in BJ's business that we can control. We are well positioned to execute our 2008 restaurant expansion plan, which calls for the opening of as many as 15 new restaurants in high quality locations and with increased levels of landlord construction contributions. Our targeted 20% to 25% increase in total restaurant operating weeks during 2008 represents the most significant component of our expected growth in total revenues for the year. We do recognize that the operating environment in general for casual dining continues to be impacted by negative consumer sentiment and declining guest traffic. BJs is not immune from these uncontrollable pressures, as evidenced by the slight traffic decline in our comparable restaurants during the fourth quarter and softer sales trends during January, particularly in our home court market of California where 33 of our 50 comparable restaurants are located. In light of the weaker national economy, we currently expect our comparable sales for the full year of 2008 to track closer to our longer-term targeted run rate of 1% to 3%. Having said that, we continue to work on our planned traffic-building initiatives for 2008 that will offer BJs a solid opportunity to drive increased sales. Most of these initiatives should be in full stride during the second half of this year.
During the first half of 2008, the Company plans to roll out and promote BJs enhanced curbside to-go program that will feature on-line ordering, improved packaging and car-side cashiering. Additionally, the Company plans to roll out a call-ahead seating program for the convenience of our guests that will be managed within BJs automated table management system, thus providing what the Company believes to be a competitive advantage over similar programs offered by competitors. On the menu front, initiatives are being executed to introduce new high quality, signature entres; upgraded bar offerings, including new wine and specialty drinks; and an upgraded lunch program that will feature many of BJs signature menu items. We believe that our average guest check in the $12 range, coupled with our strengthened casual-plus competitive positioning and our sales-building initiatives in progress, should provide BJs with a solid opportunity to continue to outperform most of our peers in this difficult environment, said Deitchle.
Four new restaurants were opened during the fourth quarter of 2007 (Temple, TX; Austin, TX; Montebello, CA and Glendale, CA). Accordingly, the Company achieved its stated goal at the beginning of 2007 to open as many as 13 new restaurants during the year. During 2007, the national appeal of the BJs concept was demonstrated with successful openings in Florida, Ohio and Oklahoma. The Company reiterates its goal to open as many as 15 new restaurants during 2008 and thereby increase its total restaurant operating weeks another 20% to 25%. Signed leases or letters of intent are already in place to support targeted new restaurant growth for 2008, with eight new restaurants already under construction. As of this date, the Company currently expects to open two restaurants during the first quarter of 2008, of which one has already opened at the Tri-County Mall in Cincinnati, OH. The Company anticipates opening four new restaurants in the second quarter, five new restaurants in the third quarter and four new restaurants in the fourth quarter of 2008. The actual timing of restaurant openings is inherently difficult to precisely predict and is subject to weather conditions and other factors outside of the Companys control, including factors that are under the control of the Companys landlords, municipalities and contractors.
During the first quarter of 2008, the Company will close one of its smaller-format BJs Pizza & Grill restaurants located in the Portland, Oregon area upon expiration of its underlying lease. During fiscal 2007, this smaller-format restaurant contributed sales of only $1.2 million and operating income of less than $5,000. The Company does not expect the costs associated with closing this restaurant to have a material impact on the Companys financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2008.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement the consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the Company has included the following non-GAAP financial measures in this press release or in the webcast to discuss the Company's financial results for the fourth quarter and yearly period which may be accessed via the Company's website at http://www.bjsrestaurants.com: (i) non-GAAP net income, and (ii) non-GAAP basic and diluted net income per share. Each of these non-GAAP financial measures is adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain expenses and gains. As a general matter, the Company uses these non-GAAP measures in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. Among other things, the Company uses such non-GAAP financial measures in addition to and in conjunction with corresponding GAAP measures to help analyze the performance of its core business. In addition, the Company believes that such non-GAAP financial information is provided by its competitors and such information is used by analysts and others in the investment community to analyze the Company's results and in formulating estimates of future performance and that failure to report these non-GAAP measures, could result in confusion among analysts and others and a misplaced perception that the Company's results have underperformed or exceeded expectations or the results of its competitors.
These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the Company's operations that, when viewed with the GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of the Company's results of operations and the factors and trends affecting the Company's business. However, these non-GAAP measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.
Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP basic and diluted net income per share exclude the effects of (i) stock-based compensation expense, and (ii) a loss on the disposal of certain assets. In addition, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted net income per share reflect an adjustment of income tax expense associated with exclusion of the foregoing expense items. The adjustment of income taxes is required in order to provide management and investors a more accurate assessment of the taxes that would have been payable on net income, as adjusted by exclusion of the effects of the above listed items. The Company believes that presentation of measures of net income and diluted net income per share that exclude these items assists management and investors in evaluating the period over period performance of the Company's ongoing core business operations because the expenses are non-cash in nature. Additionally, although the sizes of the Companys grants of various equity awards are within the Company's control, the amount of stock compensation expense varies depending on factors such as short-term fluctuations in stock price and volatility which can be unrelated to the operational performance of the Company during the period in question and generally is outside the control of management during the period in which the expense is recognized. Moreover, the Company believes that the exclusion of stock-based compensation in presenting non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors to understand the impact of the expensing of stock-based compensation to the Company's net income and net income per share in comparison to prior periods as well as to its competitors. Furthermore, with the respect to the exclusion of charges relating to the disposal of certain assets, the Company believes that presentation of a measure of non-GAAP net income and net income per share that excludes such charges is useful to management and investors in evaluating the performance of the Companys ongoing operations on a period-to-period basis and relative to the Companys competitors. In this regard, the Company notes that the losses of this type are infrequent and variable in nature.
The Company believes disclosure of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP basic and diluted net income per share has economic substance because the excluded expenses are infrequent in nature and do not represent current cash expenditures. A material limitation associated with the use of this measure as compared to the GAAP measures of net income and diluted net income per share is that they may not be comparable with the calculation of net income and diluted net income per share for other companies in the Company's industry. The Company compensates for these limitations by providing full disclosure of the effects of this non-GAAP measure, by presenting the corresponding GAAP financial measure in this release and in the Companys financial statements and by providing a reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP measure to enable investors to perform their own analysis.

Exhibit 99.1
BJ's Restaurants, Inc. Opens in Louisville, Kentucky
HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--BJ's Restaurants, Inc. (NASDAQ:BJRI) today announced the opening of its 70th restaurant in Louisville, KY on February 25, 2008. The new BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse is located at 7900 Shelbyville Road in the Oxmoor Center. The restaurant is approximately 9,000 square feet, contains seating for approximately 275 guests and features BJs extensive menu that includes BJ's signature deep-dish pizza, award winning handcrafted beer and our famous Pizookie dessert. BJs highly detailed, contemporary dcor and unique video statement, including several high definition flat panel televisions, creates a high energy, fun and family-friendly dining environment for everyone to enjoy. Hours of operation are from 11:00 a.m. to 12:00 midnight Sunday through Thursday and 11:00 a.m. to 1:00 a.m. Friday and Saturday.
We are very pleased to bring the BJs concept to Louisville, commented Jerry Deitchle, President and CEO. This restaurant represents our second new opening to date for 2008 and also represents our third restaurant in the Ohio Valley, where consumers have heartily welcomed the BJs concept. We plan to open additional restaurants in the Ohio Valley during the next few years. Additionally, we remain solidly on track to open as many as 15 new restaurants during 2008 and thereby increase our operating weeks by 20% to 25%. Eight additional restaurants are already under construction for potential openings later this year.

Exhibit 99.1
BJs Restaurants, Inc. to Present at March Conferences; Also Comments on Its Short-Term Investment Holdings
HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--BJs Restaurants, Inc. (NASDAQ: BJRI) today announced that management will be presenting at two investor conferences in March. The details of the conferences are listed below:
Bank of America 2008 Consumer Conference at the Palace Hotel, New York, NY  The presentation will begin at approximately 3:20pm (Eastern) on Tuesday, March 11, 2008.
2008 Citigroup Small & Mid-Cap Conference at the Four Seasons at Mandalay Bay, Las Vegas, NV  The presentation will begin at approximately 1:45pm (Pacific) on Wednesday, March 19, 2008.
The presentation for each conference will be broadcast over the Internet. Interested parties can listen to the presentations by accessing the Investors page of the Companys website located at www.bjsrestaurants.com. To access the live simulcast of the presentation, please go to the Companys website at least 15 minutes prior to the presentation to download and install any necessary audio software. Archives of the webcasts will be made available following the live presentation for a period of approximately 30 days from the date of the presentation
The Company also noted that it has $37 million of auction rate securities currently included in its short-term investment portfolio. The auction-rate securities are AAA rated, long-term debt obligations secured by student loans, which loans are generally 97% guaranteed by the U.S. Government under the Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP). In addition to the U.S. Government guarantee on such student loans, many of the securities also have separate insurance policies guaranteeing both the principal and accrued interest. Liquidity for these securities has historically been provided by an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at pre-determined intervals up to 35 days. In the past, the auction process has allowed investors to obtain immediate liquidity if so desired by selling the securities at their face amounts. However, as has been recently reported in the financial press, the current disruptions in the credit markets have adversely affected the auction market for these types of securities. From February 11, 2008 to March 5, 2009, all auctions scheduled with respect to the Companys auction rate securities have failed to close. This is the first time the Company has experienced this type of event for its holdings of auction rate securities. The Company understands that the failure of auctions is broad based and not limited to those securities held by the Company. The auction rate securities continue to pay interest at rates that are generally higher than the current market rate, and there has been no change in the rating of these securities to date.
As a result of the failed auctions, these securities are currently not liquid and, furthermore, the Company cannot predict how long they will remain illiquid. As such, at least in the near term, the Company may or may not be able to liquidate some or all of its remaining auction rate securities prior to their maturities at prices approximating their face amounts. The final maturity dates of the auction rate securities which the Company owns is between 2020 and 2047. The current market for the auction rate securities held by the Company is uncertain and the Company will continue to monitor and evaluate the market for these securities to determine if impairment of the carrying value of the securities has occurred due to the loss of liquidity or for other reasons. If the credit ratings of the security issuers deteriorate or if normal market conditions do not return in the near future, the Company may be required to reduce the value of these securities through an impairment charge against net income and reflect them as long-term investments on its balance sheet for the period ending April 1, 2008 or thereafter.
Based on the Companys current and projected cash flow from operations, cash balances on hand, agreed-upon landlord construction contributions and its undrawn $25 million credit facility, Company management believes that the current lack of liquidity of its auction rate securities holdings will not have a material impact on the Companys ability to fund its operations or continue its expansion. However, if current conditions in the auction rate securities market continue for a prolonged period, the Companys longer-term financial flexibility could be impacted until other sources of capital are obtained. While the Company has a credit facility in place which it may currently draw upon, in the event that global credit market conditions further deteriorate, it is possible that creditors could place limitations or restrictions on the ability of borrowers in general to draw on existing credit facilities. At this time, however, the Company has no indication that any such limitations or restrictions are likely to occur. As an additional liquidity enhancement and at the Companys option, the financial institution that provides the Companys $25 million credit facility has agreed in principle to increase the size of that facility to $45 million, subject to final terms and customary documentation.

On March 18, 2008, BJ's Restaurants, Inc. (the "Company") amended its Loan Agreement dated October 17, 2007, with Bank of America, N.A. ("BofA") pursuant to which the Company increased its unsecured revolving line of credit with Bank of America to $45,000,000 (the "Amended Line of Credit"). While the Company is not obligated to utilize the Amended Line of Credit, it is expected that the Amended Line of Credit will be used primarily for general corporate purposes, including the development of new restaurants, and the issuance of letters of credit in connection with the Company's insurance programs.
The Borrowings under the Amended Line of Credit bear interest at BofA's Prime Rate or a rate ranging from LIBOR plus 0.875% to LIBOR plus 1.625% based upon the Company's Lease Adjusted Leverage Ratio as defined in the original line of credit agreement. Pursuant to the Amended Line of Credit, the Company will be required to pay certain customary fees and expenses associated with maintenance and use of the Amended Line of Credit including letter of credit issuance fees and unused commitment fees. Interest on the Amended Line of Credit is payable quarterly and the Amended Line of Credit expires, and all borrowings thereunder must be repaid on or before, September 30, 2012.
The Amended Line of Credit contains certain representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default that are customary for credit arrangements of this type, including covenants which restrict the Company's ability to, among other things, create liens, borrow money (other than purchase money indebtedness and trade credit, lease obligations incurred in the ordinary course, and similar ordinary course liabilities) and engage in mergers, consolidations, significant asset sales and certain other transactions as defined in the original line of credit agreement. The Company also agreed to maintain specified fixed charge coverage and overall debt ratios.

Exhibit 99.1
BJ
s Restaurants, Inc. Reports Financial Results for the First Quarter of Fiscal 2008
HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--BJs Restaurants, Inc. (NASDAQ: BJRI) today reported financial results for the first fiscal quarter ended April 1, 2008.
Highlights for the first quarter, compared to the same quarter last year, were as follows:
Revenues increased approximately 22% to $86.8 million
Net income was $3.1 million and diluted net income per share was $0.12, compared to net income of $1.6 million and diluted net income per share of $0.06 for the same quarter last year (which included a non-cash charge of approximately $1.3 million, net of tax, or $0.05 per diluted share, related to fixed asset disposals)
Comparable restaurant sales were approximately flat for the quarter
Total restaurant operating weeks increased approximately 24%
2008 restaurant expansion plan remains solidly on track
In spite of the increasing difficulty of the overall operating environment for most casual dining restaurant companies in nearly every respect, our restaurant, brewery and infrastructure support teams did a very good job of driving BJs forward and managing the elements of our business that are within our control during the first quarter, commented Jerry Deitchle, President and CEO. As we initially noted in our February 2008 investor conference call, our first quarter results reflect softer levels of comparable sales, particularly in the Inland Empire and Sacramento areas of California and in the Phoenix area of Arizona, which together contain 13 of our 50 total comparable restaurants. These areas have been significantly impacted by the slowing national economy, the credit crunch and the resulting pressures in general on consumer spending and confidence. Excluding these 13 restaurants from our comparable restaurant base for the first quarter, our comparable restaurant sales would have been up approximately 3.1%.
While no one can accurately predict how the consumer will continue to react in this volatile and slowing economy, we do not believe that the current difficult operating environment is likely to abate in the near future, said Greg Levin, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Accordingly, we are accelerating our planned schedule of 2008 sales-building initiatives. These initiatives include on-line ordering and curbside cashiering services, call-ahead seating service, expanded delivery service, new lunch specials, and additional print media support for our new menu entrees and other services. We expect most of these initiatives to be in place by the end of the second quarter. On the operational execution front, our restaurant management team did a very good job of managing our controllable costs and expenses during the first quarter, and we expect them to continue to do so.
The Company opened two new restaurants in the first quarter of 2008 in Cincinnati, Ohio and Louisville, Kentucky. The Cincinnati restaurant represents the Companys second restaurant in Ohio, and the Louisville restaurant is the Companys first restaurant in Kentucky. We were very pleased with the initial sales volumes of our Cincinnati and Louisville restaurants, even though both were opened during periods of significant winter weather in both cities, said Greg Lynds, Executive Vice President and Chief Development Officer. With the planned May 2008 openings of our new restaurants in Indianapolis, Indiana and Kissimmee, Florida, BJs will have four restaurants in each of the Ohio Valley and Central Florida regions, and more openings are planned in these areas during upcoming years.
We remain very excited and confident in BJs long-term ability to gain additional market share in the estimated $90-plus billion casual dining segment of the restaurant industry, said Deitchle. Our development team has worked very hard to put us in an excellent position to successfully execute our previously stated restaurant expansion plan to open as many as 15 new restaurants during 2008 and thereby increase our total restaurant operating weeks another 20% to 25% during the year. All prospective locations for potential 2008 openings have been secured and nine restaurants are currently under construction. As of this date, the Company currently expects to open approximately four, five and four new restaurants during each of the upcoming three fiscal quarters, respectively. The actual timing of restaurant openings is inherently difficult to precisely predict and is subject to weather conditions and other factors outside of the Companys control, including factors that are under the control of the Companys landlords, municipalities and contractors.
As previously disclosed, the Companys investments consist of auction rate securities (ARS) with a par or face value of $37.1 million. These auction rate securities are AAA rated, long-term debt obligations secured by student loans, which loans are 97% guaranteed by the U.S. Government under the Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP). The recent uncertainties in the credit markets have affected the Companys holding in these ARS investments, since auctions for the Companys investments in these securities have failed to settle on their respective settlement dates. Historically, the fair value of the ARS investments approximated par value due to the frequent resets through the auction process. While the Company continues to earn interest on its ARS investments and there has been no change in the ratings of these securities to date, these investments are not currently trading and, therefore, do not currently have a readily determinable market value. In accordance with FASB Statement No. 157, , (FAS 157), the Company estimated the fair value of its auction rate securities using valuation models and methodologies provided by third parties, including the Companys investment manager for the ARS. Based on these valuation models and methodologies, the Company has recognized a temporary decline in the fair value of its ARS investments of approximately $1.5 million as of April 1, 2008. In accordance with FASB Statement No. 115, , (FAS 115), a temporary change in fair value results in an unrealized holding loss being recorded in the other comprehensive income (loss) component of shareholders equity. Such an unrealized holding loss does not affect net income for the applicable accounting period. Due to the current illiquidity of these investments and the uncertainty regarding the auction rate securities market, the Company has also reclassified these investments to non-current investments for the current reporting period at fair value. In addition, the Company has a $45 million line of credit, which has zero outstanding as of April 1, 2008, and currently anticipates holding these ARS investments until a recovery of the auction process or until maturity. The Company will continue to monitor the auction rate securities market and the liquidity and value of the securities it holds. Additional adjustments to the fair value may be required from quarter to quarter to reflect changes in market conditions.

Further information concerning the Companys results of operations for first quarter 2008 will be provided in the Companys Form 10-Q filing, to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission by May 12, 2008.
Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement the consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the Company has included the following non-GAAP financial measures in this press release or in the webcast to discuss the Company's financial results for the first quarter which may be accessed via the Company's website at (i) non-GAAP net income, and (ii) non-GAAP basic and diluted net income per share. Each of these non-GAAP financial measures is adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain expenses and gains. As a general matter, the Company uses these non-GAAP measures in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. Among other things, the Company uses such non-GAAP financial measures in addition to and in conjunction with corresponding GAAP measures to help analyze the performance of its core business. In addition, the Company believes that such non-GAAP financial information is provided by its competitors and such information is used by analysts and others in the investment community to analyze the Company's results and in formulating estimates of future performance and that failure to report these non-GAAP measures, could result in confusion among analysts and others and a misplaced perception that the Company's results have underperformed or exceeded expectations or the results of its competitors.
http://www.bjsrestaurants.com:
These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the Company's operations that, when viewed with the GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of the Company's results of operations and the factors and trends affecting the Company's business. However, these non-GAAP measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.
Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP basic and diluted net income per share exclude the effects of (i) stock-based compensation expense, and (ii) a loss on the disposal of certain assets. In addition, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted net income per share reflect an adjustment of income tax expense associated with exclusion of the foregoing expense items. The adjustment of income taxes is required in order to provide management and investors a more accurate assessment of the taxes that would have been payable on net income, as adjusted by exclusion of the effects of the above listed items. The Company believes that presentation of measures of net income and diluted net income per share that exclude these items assists management and investors in evaluating the period over period performance of the Company's ongoing core business operations because the expenses are non-cash in nature. Additionally, although the sizes of the Companys grants of various equity awards are within the Company's control, the amount of stock compensation expense varies depending on factors such as short-term fluctuations in stock price and volatility which can be unrelated to the operational performance of the Company during the period in question and generally is outside the control of management during the period in which the expense is recognized. Moreover, the Company believes that the exclusion of stock-based compensation in presenting non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors to understand the impact of the expensing of stock-based compensation to the Company's net income and net income per share in comparison to prior periods as well as to its competitors. Furthermore, with the respect to the exclusion of charges relating to the disposal of certain assets, the Company believes that presentation of a measure of non-GAAP net income and net income per share that excludes such charges is useful to management and investors in evaluating the performance of the Companys ongoing operations on a period-to-period basis and relative to the Companys competitors. In this regard, the Company notes that the losses of this type are infrequent and variable in nature.
The Company believes disclosure of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP basic and diluted net income per share has economic substance because the excluded expenses are infrequent in nature and do not represent current cash expenditures. A material limitation associated with the use of this measure as compared to the GAAP measures of net income and diluted net income per share is that they may not be comparable with the calculation of net income and diluted net income per share for other companies in the Company's industry. The Company compensates for these limitations by providing full disclosure of the effects of this non-GAAP measure, by presenting the corresponding GAAP financial measure in this release and in the Companys financial statements and by providing a reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP measure to enable investors to perform their own analysis.

Exhibit 99.1
BJ's Restaurants, Inc. Holds Annual Meeting of Shareholders; Names New Chairman and Lead Independent Director
HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--BJs Restaurants, Inc. (NASDAQ:BJRI) held its annual meeting of shareholders on Wednesday, June 4, 2008. Shareholders re-elected Paul A. Motenko, Jeremiah J. Hennessy, Gerald W. Deitchle, Peter A. Bassi, Larry D. Bouts, Shann M. Brassfield, James A. Dal Pozzo, J. Roger King and John F. Grundhofer to the Board of Directors to serve for one-year terms until the next annual meeting. Additionally, shareholders also ratified the selection of Ernst & Young LLP to serve as the Companys independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal 2008.
The Company also announced that the board of directors has unanimously elected Gerald W. (Jerry) Deitchle, President and CEO, to the additional post of Chairman of the Board, and Peter A. (Pete) Bassi as the boards lead independent director. I am very grateful that Paul Motenko and Jerry Hennessy, our co-founders and former co-chairmen, will be continuing their valuable service and support to BJs as members of our board, commented Deitchle.
At the annual shareholders meeting, BJs leadership team presented an update of the Companys strategic business and growth plan. The slide presentation can be viewed on the Investors page of the Companys website located at . We remain highly confident about BJs opportunity to continue executing its longer-term growth plan and thereby gain additional market share in the estimated $90 billion casual dining segment of the restaurant industry, said Deitchle. With only 71 restaurants open today, we believe that we are only about a fourth of the way to opening our current estimate of approximately 300 domestic restaurants of various site types and sizes. While the current operating environment remains very difficult for casual dining restaurants in general, we believe the BJs restaurant concept is well positioned with greater quality, differentiation and value compared to most of our mass market casual dining competitors and offers us a good opportunity to outperform our similarly-situated peers during these challenging times.

We are very excited to open BJs first restaurant in the South Bay trade area of the Los Angeles market, commented Jerry Deitchle, Chairman and CEO. Sales for our opening day in Torrance were exceptionally strong. Our new Torrance restaurant is a solid example of the successful execution of BJs current expansion strategy that is primarily focused on opening new restaurants in mature, densely populated trade areas with favorable demographics and that also have steady, proven levels of retail sales in general. Our Torrance restaurant represents our sixth opening to date during 2008. We currently remain on track to open as many as nine more restaurants during 2008 and thereby achieve our stated goal to open as many as 15 new restaurants and increase our total restaurant operating weeks by 20% to 25% this year.
Deitchle also commented that several BJs restaurants achieved record-setting sales levels during the fiscal week of Fathers Day that ended on Tuesday, June 17. Additionally, during that week, one of our Southern California restaurants became the first BJs restaurant in Company history to exceed $200,000 in weekly sales, said Deitchle. This is an impressive achievement when considering that our estimated average guest check is in the $12 range. Even during these challenging times for the consumer, the BJs concept remains as popular and approachable as ever, and we are going to keep doing our best to make BJs an even better dining experience for our guests.

Exhibit 99.1
BJ
s Restaurants, Inc. Reports Financial Results for the Second Quarter of Fiscal 2008
HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--BJs Restaurants, Inc. (NASDAQ:BJRI) today reported financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2008 that ended on July 1, 2008.
Highlights for the second quarter were as follows (compared to the same quarter last year):
Revenues increased approximately 16% to $92.2 million
Comparable restaurant sales increased 0.6%, successfully hurdling a 7.5% increase in the same quarter last year
Net income and diluted net income per share were $2.9 million and $0.11, respectively
Four new restaurants were opened during the quarter
2008 restaurant expansion plan remains solidly on track
Our leadership team was pleased with our solid overall financial results for the second quarter, particularly after considering the conditions in the macro environment and a difficult quarterly comparison to overcome, commented Jerry Deitchle, Chairman and CEO. Not only did we achieve a positive comparable sales comparison for the quarter, we also achieved a slight sequential quarterly improvement in estimated four-wall restaurant operating cash flow margins while doing our best to navigate through the continuing challenges of the overall environment for consumer spending and the costs of key inputs to our operations. Additionally, our diluted net income per share comparison for the quarter was impacted by approximately $0.03 per share due to asset disposal costs related to selected restaurant remodels in the current quarter, as well as reduced amounts of interest and other income compared to the same quarter last year.
Our 0.6% increase in comparable restaurant sales for the quarter successfully hurdled a 7.5% increase for the same quarter last year, which also represented our strongest quarterly comparable sales comparison since fiscal 2004, said Deitchle. Additionally, BJs positive comparable restaurant sales metric for the second quarter compares favorably to the estimated 1.1% decrease in comparable restaurant sales for the June quarter according to the Knapp-Track industry data for casual dining.
(TM)
So far this year, we have successfully implemented many of our planned 2008 key sales-building initiatives which include curbside cashiering service, call-ahead seating service, expanded delivery service, new lunch specials, enhanced happy hour programs and additional print media support for our new menu entres, said Deitchle. During the second half of this year, we plan to promote our new online ordering service, new menu entres, an updated wine program and our new seasonal beers which are all scheduled to be rolled out later this year. In this tough environment, we will continue to drive BJs top-of-mind awareness and reinforce our points of quality differentiation with our consumers.
The Company opened four new restaurants during the second quarter of 2008 in Orlando, Florida; Indianapolis, Indiana; Baton Rouge, Louisiana; and Torrance, California. Three of these four new restaurants were opened in the latter half of the quarter. The Company continues to target as many as 15 new restaurant openings in total during 2008, of which six have opened as of the end of the second quarter. The Company currently expects to open as many as five new restaurants in the third quarter (of which two have already opened), and as many as four new restaurants in the fourth quarter. The actual timing of restaurant openings is inherently difficult to precisely predict and is subject to a number of factors outside of the Companys control, including factors that are under the control of the Companys landlords, municipalities and contractors.

Such statements include, but are not limited to, those regarding expected comparable restaurant sales growth in 2008, those regarding the effect of new sales-building initiatives, as well as those regarding the number of restaurants expected to be opened in 2008 and the timing and location of such openings. These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause actual results to be materially different from those projected or anticipated. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to: (i) our ability to manage an increasing number of new restaurant openings, (ii) construction delays, (iii) labor shortages, (iv) minimum wage increases, (v) food quality and health concerns, (vi) factors that impact California, where 40 of our current 75 restaurants are located, (vii) restaurant and brewery industry competition, (viii) impact of certain brewery business considerations, including without limitation, dependence upon suppliers and related hazards, (ix) consumer spending trends in general for casual dining occasions, (x) potential uninsured losses and liabilities, (xi) fluctuating commodity costs and availability of food in general and certain raw materials related to the brewing of our handcrafted beers and energy, (xii) trademark and servicemark risks, (xiii) government regulations, (xiv) licensing costs, (xv) beer and liquor regulations, (xvi) loss of key personnel, (xvii) inability to secure acceptable sites, (xviii) limitations on insurance coverage, (xix) legal proceedings, (xx) other general economic and regulatory conditions and requirements, (xxi) the success of our key sales-building and related operational initiatives and (xxii) numerous other matters discussed in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. BJ's Restaurants, Inc. undertakes no obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
Further information concerning the Companys results of operations for the second quarter 2008 will be provided in the Companys Form 10-Q filing, to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission by August 11, 2008.
(1) Investments are comprised of auction rate securities classified as available for sale and recorded at their fair value as of July 1, 2008. As disclosed in previous periodic reports, due to significant disruptions in the market for auction rate securities, the Company may be required to make adjustments in the reported fair value of these instruments in future quarterly periods.
(2) Excludes the one licensed restaurant.
Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement the consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the Company has included the following non-GAAP financial measures in this press release or in the webcast to discuss the Company's financial results for the second quarter which may be accessed via the Company's website at (i) non-GAAP net income, and (ii) non-GAAP basic and diluted net income per share. Each of these non-GAAP financial measures is adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain expenses and gains. As a general matter, the Company uses these non-GAAP measures in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. Among other things, the Company uses such non-GAAP financial measures in addition to and in conjunction with corresponding GAAP measures to help analyze the performance of its core business. In addition, the Company believes that such non-GAAP financial information is provided by its competitors and such information is used by analysts and others in the investment community to analyze the Company's results and in formulating estimates of future performance and that failure to report these non-GAAP measures, could result in confusion among analysts and others and a misplaced perception that the Company's results have underperformed or exceeded expectations or the results of its competitors.
http://www.bjsrestaurants.com:
These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the Company's operations that, when viewed with the GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of the Company's results of operations and the factors and trends affecting the Company's business. However, these non-GAAP measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.
Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP basic and diluted net income per share exclude the effects of (i) stock-based compensation expense, and (ii) loss on disposal of certain assets. In addition, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted net income per share reflect an adjustment of income tax expense associated with exclusion of the foregoing expense items. The adjustment of income taxes is required in order to provide management and investors a more accurate assessment of the taxes that would have been payable on net income, as adjusted by exclusion of the effects of the above listed items. The Company believes that presentation of measures of net income and diluted net income per share that exclude these items assists management and investors in evaluating the period over period performance of the Company's ongoing core business operations because the expenses are non-cash in nature. Additionally, although the sizes of the Companys grants of various equity awards are within the Company's control, the amount of stock compensation expense varies depending on factors such as short-term fluctuations in stock price and volatility which can be unrelated to the operational performance of the Company during the period in question and generally is outside the control of management during the period in which the expense is recognized. Moreover, the Company believes that the exclusion of stock-based compensation in presenting non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors to understand the impact of the expensing of stock-based compensation to the Company's net income and net income per share in comparison to prior periods as well as to its competitors. Furthermore, with the respect to the exclusion of charges relating to the disposal of certain assets, the Company believes that presentation of a measure of non-GAAP net income and net income per share that excludes such charges is useful to management and investors in evaluating the performance of the Companys ongoing operations on a period-to-period basis and relative to the Companys competitors.
The Company believes disclosure of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP basic and diluted net income per share has economic substance because the excluded expenses are infrequent in nature and do not represent current cash expenditures. A material limitation associated with the use of this measure as compared to the GAAP measures of net income and diluted net income per share is that they may not be comparable with the calculation of net income and diluted net income per share for other companies in the Company's industry. The Company compensates for these limitations by providing full disclosure of the effects of this non-GAAP measure, by presenting the corresponding GAAP financial measure in this release and in the Companys financial statements and by providing a reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP measure to enable investors to perform their own analysis.

Exhibit 99.1
BJ's Restaurants Wins Two Gold Medals At The Great American Beer Festival
HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--October 20, 2008--BJ's Restaurants, Inc. (NASDAQ:BJRI) announced today that gold medals were recently awarded for two of the Companys proprietary craft beers at the Great American Beer Festival (GABF) in Denver, Colorado. BJs Oktoberfest was awarded a gold medal in the American-Style Amber Lager category. Additionally, a gold medal was awarded in the German-Style Wheat Ale category for a new, light-beer version of the popular BJs Harvest Hefeweizen called Im Half the Beer I Used to Be. These two awards bring BJs gold medal count at the GABF to 11, and to 25 GABF medals overall since the Companys first year of GABF participation in 1996.
We are extremely proud of our craft brewing tradition and capabilities at BJs, and these two GABF gold medals are a testament to our continuing commitment to create unique, world-class craft beers for our guests, said Alex Puchner, Senior Vice President of Brewery Operations. While we are pleased to receive such recognition from the craft beer industry professionals on the GABF judging panels, ultimately it is the feedback from the guests in our restaurants that matters the most. BJs Oktoberfest was recently featured in all BJs Restaurants and quickly became the highest selling seasonal beer in the Companys history. Our guests were telling us we had a winner with our Oktoberfest, and it turns out they were right.
BJs Oktoberfest is available in BJs Restaurants this month while supplies last. The light version of BJs Harvest Hefeweizen is being considered for rollout to Company restaurants during 2009.
In addition to BJs award-winning handcrafted beer, all BJ's Restaurants feature an extensive menu that includes BJ's signature deep-dish pizza and famous Pizookie dessert. BJ's highly detailed, contemporary decor and unique video statement, including several high definition flat panel televisions, creates a high energy, fun and family-friendly dining environment for everyone to enjoy. Hours of operation are from 11:00 a.m. to midnight Sunday through Thursday and 11:00 a.m. to 1:00 a.m. Friday and Saturday.

Exhibit 99.1
BJ
s Restaurants, Inc. Reports Financial Results for the Third Quarter of Fiscal 2008
HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--October 23, 2008--BJs Restaurants, Inc. (NASDAQ:BJRI) today reported financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2008 that ended on Tuesday, September 30, 2008.
Total revenues increased approximately 19% to $95.8 million compared to $80.4 million for the same quarter last year. Net income and diluted net income per share for the quarter ended September 30, 2008, were $2.0 million and $0.08, respectively.
We continue to have strong confidence in BJs ability to steadily gain market share in the estimated $90 billion casual dining segment of the restaurant industry over the longer term, commented Jerry Deitchle, Chairman and CEO. The BJs restaurant concept remains one of the most approachable, higher-quality and higher-energy concepts with great value for the consumer in the casual dining segment today, and our leverageable growth and support infrastructure is solidly in place. With only 80 restaurants open today, the vast majority of our restaurant growth remains ahead of us. While we have never felt better about the factors in our business that are within our control, our challenge for the next year or so will be to successfully navigate through the many uncontrollable events and factors in the current operating environment that are impacting the short-term operating results and expansion plans of most casual dining restaurant companies.
Comparable restaurant sales decreased by approximately 1.0% during the quarter ended September 30, 2008, which was up against a strong 5.6% increase achieved in the same quarter last year. Several factors impacted our comparable restaurant sales result this quarter, including the July 4th holiday shift (approximately 0.5%) and restaurant closures due to Hurricane Ike (approximately 0.5%), said Deitchle. Absent these two factors, we believe that our comparable restaurant sales would have been flat for the quarter just ended, which represents a very respectable performance in these highly volatile times and, in particular, given that over half of our restaurants are located in the states of California and Arizona where the current economic slowdown had been quite pronounced. In spite of all of these uncontrollable factors, we were pleased that our comparable restaurant sales for the quarter outperformed the Knapp-Track benchmark for casual dining comparable sales, which is estimated to be down approximately 3.8% for the September quarter.
Compared to the same quarter last year, diluted net income per share for the quarter ended September 30, 2008, was also impacted by the following items: approximately $0.02 due to estimated lost sales, operating profit and property damages from Hurricanes Gustav and Ike that were in excess of our property and business interruption insurance coverage; approximately $0.03 due to higher utilities and marketing expenses; approximately $0.02 due to higher preopening costs associated with six new restaurant openings compared to four openings; a benefit of approximately $0.03 due to a reduction of our estimated incentive compensation liability for this year; and a benefit of approximately $0.01 due to a lower effective tax rate.
The Company successfully opened a record six new restaurants during the third quarter of 2008, including one that was successfully moved forward from an originally expected opening in the fourth quarter. Initial sales volumes for these six new restaurants continue to meet or exceed the Companys expectations. In addition to our Tacoma, WA opening on October 13, 2008, we currently plan to open two more restaurants in densely populated, mature home court trade areas during November 2008  one in Chula Vista, CA, and the other in Newark, CA, said Deitchle. As a result, we will successfully achieve our stated goal to open as many as 15 new restaurants this year and increase our total restaurant operating weeks by over 20%. This outstanding accomplishment reflects the strength and quality of our development and restaurant operations teams.
Many retail projects have been delayed or canceled by developers due to the slowing economy, the credit crunch and the reduced expansion plans of many retailers and restaurant companies. This has impacted the short-term availability of quality sites in the Companys new restaurant development pipeline. BJs four-wall economics are sound, and they support a continued steady pace of new restaurant expansion, said Deitchle. However, we depend on major retail project developers to provide us with a predictable supply of quality sites, and this supply is now more constrained. The hallmark of BJs new restaurant development program has always been AAA-quality locations in mature, densely populated trade areas with premier co-tenants that create maximum consumer synergy. We will maintain this discipline in our expansion plan. As of today, we currently anticipate our growth in total restaurant operating weeks during 2009 to be in the approximate range of 15% to 18%. After we complete our full annual business planning cycle for 2009 during the next couple of months, we will announce the expected number of new restaurants for the upcoming year and refine our expected operating week growth target if necessary. The entire BJs team is excited to open more BJs restaurants next year and further increase our market share.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement the consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the Company has included the following non-GAAP financial measures in this press release or in the webcast to discuss the Company's financial results for the third quarter which may be accessed via the Company's website at (i) non-GAAP net income, and (ii) non-GAAP basic and diluted net income per share. Each of these non-GAAP financial measures is adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain expenses and gains. As a general matter, the Company uses these non-GAAP measures in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. Among other things, the Company uses such non-GAAP financial measures in addition to and in conjunction with corresponding GAAP measures to help analyze the performance of its core business. In addition, the Company believes that such non-GAAP financial information is provided by its competitors and such information is used by analysts and others in the investment community to analyze the Company's results and in formulating estimates of future performance and that failure to report these non-GAAP measures, could result in confusion among analysts and others and a misplaced perception that the Company's results have underperformed or exceeded expectations or the results of its competitors.

These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the Company's operations that, when viewed with the GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of the Company's results of operations and the factors and trends affecting the Company's business. However, these non-GAAP measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.
Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP basic and diluted net income per share exclude the effects of (i) stock-based compensation expense, (ii) loss on disposal of certain assets and (iii) natural disaster and related expense. In addition, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted net income per share reflect an adjustment of income tax expense associated with exclusion of the foregoing expense items. The adjustment of income taxes is required in order to provide management and investors a more accurate assessment of the taxes that would have been payable on net income, as adjusted by exclusion of the effects of the above listed items. The Company believes that presentation of measures of net income and diluted net income per share that exclude these items assists management and investors in evaluating the period over period performance of the Company's ongoing core business operations because the expenses are either non-cash or non-routine in nature. Additionally, although the sizes of the Companys grants of various equity awards are within the Company's control, the amount of stock compensation expense varies depending on factors such as short-term fluctuations in stock price and volatility which can be unrelated to the operational performance of the Company during the period in question and generally is outside the control of management during the period in which the expense is recognized. Moreover, the Company believes that the exclusion of stock-based compensation in presenting non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors to understand the impact of the expensing of stock-based compensation to the Company's net income and net income per share in comparison to prior periods as well as to its competitors. Furthermore, the Company believes the exclusion of natural disaster and related expenses (Hurricanes Gustav and Ike) is appropriate and useful to investors in light of the fact that such expenses are, by their nature, extraordinary and non-recurring. Finally, with the respect to the exclusion of charges relating to the disposal of certain assets and to charges related to the natural disaster and related expense, the Company believes that presentation of a measure of non-GAAP net income and net income per share that excludes such charges is useful to management and investors in evaluating the performance of the Companys ongoing operations on a period-to-period basis and relative to the Companys competitors.
The Company believes disclosure of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP basic and diluted net income per share has economic substance because expenses associated with disposal of assets and natural disasters are infrequent in nature. In addition, the loss on disposal of assets and stock based compensation expenses do not represent current cash expenditures. A material limitation associated with the use of this measure as compared to the GAAP measures of net income and diluted net income per share is that they may not be comparable with the calculation of net income and diluted net income per share for other companies in the Company's industry. The Company compensates for these limitations by providing full disclosure of the effects of this non-GAAP measure, by presenting the corresponding GAAP financial measure in this release and in the Companys financial statements and by providing a reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP measure to enable investors to perform their own analysis.

The new BJs in Chula Vista is located in the Chula Vista Center, a 900,000 square foot shopping mall anchored by Macys, Sears and JC Penney that is seven miles south of downtown San Diego and seven miles north of the international border to Mexico. The new restaurant is approximately 9,000 square feet and contains seating for approximately 280 guests. The new BJs in Newark is located at 5699 Mowry Avenue on the northwest corner of I-880 and Mowry Avenue, directly across from the NewPark Regional Mall. The new restaurant is approximately 8,500 square feet and contains seating for approximately 270 guests.

Both new restaurants are located in mature, densely populated trade areas with proven levels of retail sales. Sales for our first day of operations in both restaurants were very strong.

As we noted in our press release on October 23, 2008, we currently anticipate that our growth in total restaurant operating weeks during fiscal 2009 will be in the approximate range of 15% to 18%. We anticipate completing our annual business planning cycle for 2009 during the next month or so, at which time we will announce the expected number and timing of new restaurant openings for the upcoming year and refine our expected operating week growth target if necessary. The entire BJ's team is very excited to open additional BJ's restaurants next year and further increase our market share in the casual dining segment.

The Company also reported preliminary, unaudited revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 that ended on Tuesday, December 30, 2008. When compared to the same quarter of fiscal 2007 that ended on Tuesday, January 1, 2007, revenues for the fourth quarter increased approximately 16.5% to $99.3 million compared to $85.2 million for the same quarter last year. Comparable restaurant sales decreased approximately 0.7% during the fourth quarter, compared to an increase of 4.9% achieved during the same quarter last year.
For the full fiscal year of 2008, revenues increased approximately 18% to $374.1 million compared to $316.1 million for fiscal 2007. Comparable restaurant sales decreased approximately 0.3% during fiscal 2008, compared to an increase of 6.2% achieved during fiscal 2007. As in prior years, final results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 are currently expected to be released in mid-February 2009 after the completion of the Companys annual independent audit.
After considering the slowing national economy and our significant presence in California, Arizona and Florida, where 42 of our 59 comparable restaurants for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 were located, we believe that BJs ability to retain over 99% of our comparable sales volumes during both the fourth quarter and the full year of 2008 is a strong testimonial to the continuing popularity, relevancy and value of the BJs restaurant concept, coupled with our ability to correctly and consistently execute, commented Jerry Deitchle, Chairman and CEO. Our restaurant operators, brewers and infrastructure support team did an outstanding job of advancing BJs business during 2008 despite the difficult operating environment.
We remain very confident in BJs ability to continue to increase its market share in the estimated $90 billion casual dining segment of the restaurant industry, said Deitchle. BJs current estimated share of the casual dining market, in terms of sales, is less than one-half of one percent. Compared to many of the thousands of mature, mass market casual dining chain restaurants in the segment, we believe the BJs concept has stronger levels of quality, differentiation, energy, relevance and approachability at about the same average guest check. We will continue to leverage these competitive advantages as we execute our national expansion plan.
The Company has completed its 2009 business and operational plan. After carefully considering the current recessionary cycle of the national economy and the general slowdown in new retail project development, the Company currently expects to open 9 to 11 new restaurants during 2009. As of this date, the Company currently plans to open as many as two restaurants during the first quarter of 2009; none during the second quarter; as many as four to five restaurants during the third quarter; and as many as three to four restaurants during the fourth quarter. The actual number and timing of new restaurant openings is subject to a number of factors outside of the Companys control, including weather conditions and factors under the control of landlords, contractors and regulatory/licensing authorities. Coupled with the carryover impact of partial-year 2008 openings, the Companys total restaurant operating weeks during 2009 are expected to increase approximately 15% to 16%.
After carefully evaluating all potential locations in our existing markets that are both currently available and have the desired demographics and co-tenancies that we require, we believe that our planned 2009 openings represent an appropriate rate of targeted capacity growth that can be executed in a high quality manner in this operating environment, said Deitchle. Our new restaurant development strategy continues to focus on AAA-quality locations in mature, densely populated trade areas with premier co-tenants that create maximum synergy in terms of consumer traffic and energy. We will maintain this discipline in our expansion plan and avoid the pitfalls of growing just for the sake of growth. The Company currently expects to finance its 2009 expansion plan, along with other planned capital expenditures for the year, with internally generated cash flow from existing operations and committed landlord construction contributions. Our goal is to preserve as much of our investment balances on hand and our borrowing capacity as we can for potential future deployment when the recessionary cycle begins to abate, said Deitchle.
The Company currently estimates the total cost of its food commodity basket to increase approximately 3% during 2009, which is slightly lower than previous estimates. This current estimate is based on negotiations with suppliers that have been completed to date, coupled with current and expected market conditions for certain fresh and other commodity items that the Company is either unable to, or has currently elected not to contract for longer periods of time. BJs competitive strategy has always been focused on providing a higher quality, more contemporary casual-plus dining experience at about the same average guest check of many of our mass market competitors, said Deitchle. To the extent that our costs for key inputs such as food commodities continue to be lower than expected, we will be able to better protect our value concept positioning with consumers and thereby keep our expected menu price increases as small as we can. The Companys commodity costs and availabilities are subject to a number of factors outside of the Companys control and can experience periods of significant volatility, whether contracted for or not. Investors are referred to the full discussion of risks and uncertainties associated with the Companys commodities as disclosed in its periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The Company also anticipates recording pre-tax charges totaling approximately $2.1 million during the fourth quarter of 2008. These charges principally relate to accrued compensation and related benefits resulting from the December 2008 departure of the Companys two co-founders and estimated costs to settle two California employment practices lawsuits that have been outstanding since 2004 and 2005.

Exhibit 99.1
BJs Restaurants, Inc. Reports Financial Results for the Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year of 2008
HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--February 12, 2009--BJs Restaurants, Inc. (NASDAQ: BJRI) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2008 that ended on Tuesday, December 30, 2008.
Compared to the same quarter of the prior year, total revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 increased approximately 16.5% to $99.3 million. Comparable restaurant sales decreased by 0.7% during the fourth quarter compared to an increase of 4.9% for the same quarter last year. Net income and diluted net income per share for the fourth quarter were $2.3 million and $0.08, respectively. As previously announced in our press release on January 8, 2009, fourth quarter results include $2.1 million of pre-tax charges related to accrued compensation and related benefits from the December 2008 departure of the Companys two co-founders and estimated costs to settle two California employment practices lawsuits that have been outstanding since 2004 and 2005. The Company also incurred a pre-tax charge of approximately $0.5 million related to asset disposals in connection with selected restaurant facility image enhancements and upgrades. As a result of these aforementioned charges, the Company realized a net tax benefit in the fourth quarter of $0.4 million, or $0.01 of diluted net income per share. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding the $2.6 million of pre-tax charges and their related tax effect, the Company estimates its annual effective tax rate would have been 24.6%, resulting in non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share of $3.4 million and $0.13, respectively. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures is included in the accompanying financial data.
Compared to fiscal 2007, total revenues for fiscal 2008 increased approximately 18.3% to $374.1 million. Comparable restaurant sales decreased only 0.3% during the fiscal year. Net income and diluted net income per share for fiscal 2008 were $10.3 million and $0.39, respectively. In addition to the $2.6 million of fourth quarter pretax charges noted above, there were other pre-tax charges totaling approximately $0.8 million related to hurricane losses and asset disposals recorded in earlier quarters during fiscal 2008. These charges resulted in reducing the Companys effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 to approximately 21.0%. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding the $3.4 million of pre-tax charges and their related tax effect, the Company estimates its effective tax rate would have been 24.6%, resulting in non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share of $12.4 million and $0.47, respectively. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures is included in the accompanying financial data.
We were pleased with our overall financial performance during the fourth quarter and full year of 2008 in light of the unprecedented volatility of the overall operating environment for most consumer businesses, commented Jerry Deitchle, Chairman and CEO. We are particularly proud of our comparable sales performance when compared to most of our casual dining peers. Our comparable restaurant sales decreased by only 0.7% during the fourth quarter, compared to an estimated decrease of approximately 6.3% in the Knapp-Track benchmark for casual dining comparable restaurant sales for the quarter. The entire BJs team has worked very hard to successfully implement and execute several sales-building initiatives during the fourth quarter and full year of 2008 that principally involved the introduction of new products and services for our guests. We expect that 2009 will be another difficult year for the casual dining segment in terms of overall guest traffic. Accordingly, we have additional sales-building initiatives planned for 2009 implementation. We also believe that BJs continues to benefit from its casual-plus competitive positioning combined with its mass market casual dining average guest check in the $12 range. We intend to continue playing to the strengths of our competitive positioning as we move forward with the execution of our national expansion plan, with the goal to continue building our market share in the estimated $90 billion casual dining segment over time.
The Company opened three new restaurants during the fourth quarter of 2008 (Tacoma, WA; Newark, CA; and Chula Vista, CA). As previously announced, the Company currently expects to open 9 to 11 new restaurants during 2009. Two new restaurants are currently planned for first quarter openings (Henderson, NV and Gainesville, FL). As of this date, there are no new openings planned for the second quarter; as many as four to five new restaurants planned for the third quarter; and as many as three to four new restaurants planned for the fourth quarter. Coupled with the carryover impact of our partial-year 2008 new restaurant openings, the Companys total restaurant operating weeks during 2009 are currently expected to increase approximately 15% to 16%. The actual number and timing of new restaurant openings is subject to a number of factors outside of the Companys control, including weather conditions and factors under the control of landlords, contractors and regulatory/licensing authorities, as well as credit market conditions and the availability of capital to finance our expansion. We are continuing to focus our new restaurant development in AAA-quality locations in mature, densely populated trade areas with solid co-tenancies in the retail projects that we select, said Deitchle. We are fortunate that BJs has become a preferred tenant with many of the major retail project developers and operators in the country, thus increasing the overall number and quality of potential locations available for our new restaurant development over the longer run.

BJs Restaurants, Inc. will conduct a conference call on its fourth quarter earnings release today, February 12, 2009, at 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Time).

BJ's Restaurants, Inc. undertakes no obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
Further information concerning the Companys results of operations for the fourth quarter 2008 will be provided in the Companys Form 10-K filing, to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission by March 14, 2009.
(1) Investments are comprised of auction rate securities classified as available for sale, included in non-current assets and recorded at their fair value as of December 30, 2008. As disclosed in previous periodic reports, due to significant disruptions in the market for auction rate securities, the Company may be required to make adjustments in the reported fair value of these instruments in future quarterly periods.
(2) Percentages represent percent of total revenues.
(3) Excludes the one licensed restaurant.
Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement the consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the Company has included the following non-GAAP financial measures in this press release or in the webcast to discuss the Company's financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year which may be accessed via the Company's website at (i) non-GAAP net income and (ii) non-GAAP basic and diluted net income per share. Each of these non-GAAP financial measures is adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain expenses and gains. As a general matter, the Company uses these non-GAAP measures in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. Among other things, the Company uses such non-GAAP financial measures in addition to and in conjunction with corresponding GAAP measures to help analyze the performance of its core business. In addition, the Company believes that such non-GAAP financial information is provided by its competitors and such information is used by analysts and others in the investment community to analyze the Company's results and in formulating estimates of future performance and that failure to report these non-GAAP measures, could result in confusion among analysts and others and a misplaced perception that the Company's results have underperformed or exceeded expectations.
http://www.bjsrestaurants.com:
These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the Company's operations that, when viewed with the GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of the Company's results of operations and the factors and trends affecting the Company's business. However, these non-GAAP measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.
Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP basic and diluted net income per share exclude the effects of (i) loss on disposal of certain assets, (ii) natural disaster and related expense and (iii) legal settlements and termination expenses. In addition, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted net income per share reflect an adjustment of income tax expense associated with exclusion of the foregoing expense items and an estimated effective tax rate that the Company would have incurred if they excluded these charges. The adjustment of income taxes is required in order to provide management and investors a more accurate assessment of the taxes that would have been payable on net income, as adjusted by exclusion of the effects of the above listed items. The Company believes that presentation of measures of net income and diluted net income per share that exclude these items assists management and investors in evaluating the period over period performance of the Company's ongoing core business operations because the expenses are either non-cash or non-routine in nature. Furthermore, the Company believes the exclusion of legal settlements and termination expenses (settlement of two employment practice lawsuits and the departure of the Companys co-founders) and natural disaster and related expenses (Hurricanes Gustav and Ike) is appropriate and useful to investors in light of the fact that such expenses are, by their nature, extraordinary and non-recurring. Finally, with the respect to the exclusion of charges relating to the disposal of certain assets, charges related to the natural disaster and related expense and charges related to legal settlements and termination expenses, the Company believes that presentation of a measure of non-GAAP net income and net income per share that excludes such charges is useful to management and investors in evaluating the performance of the Companys ongoing operations on a period-to-period basis and relative to the Companys competitors.
The Company believes disclosure of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP basic and diluted net income per share has economic substance because expenses associated with disposal of assets, natural disasters and legal settlements and termination expenses are infrequent in nature. In addition, the loss on disposal of assets does not represent current cash expenditures. A material limitation associated with the use of this measure as compared to the GAAP measures of net income and diluted net income per share is that they may not be comparable with the calculation of net income and diluted net income per share for other companies in the Company's industry. The Company compensates for these limitations by providing full disclosure of the effects of this non-GAAP measure, by presenting the corresponding GAAP financial measure in this release and in the Companys financial statements and by providing a reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP measure to enable investors to perform their own analysis.
(1) The Companys tax rate for the thirteen and fifty-two weeks ended December 30, 2008 was impacted by the charges listed in the reconciliation schedule above. Excluding these charges the Company estimates that its effective annual tax rate would have been 24.6%. Accordingly for this reconciliation of non-GAAP related financial matters the Company used the 24.6% effective tax rate for the thirteen and fifty-two weeks ended December 30, 2008, as if these charges did not occur.

Exhibit 99.1
BJs Restaurants, Inc. Reports Financial Results for the First Quarter of Fiscal 2009
HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 23, 2009--BJs Restaurants, Inc. (NASDAQ: BJRI) today reported financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 that ended on Tuesday, March 31, 2009.
Total revenues increased approximately 18% to $102.4 million compared to $86.8 million for the same quarter last year. Comparable restaurant sales decreased by only 0.1% during the first quarter of fiscal 2009 compared to flat comparable restaurant sales for the same quarter last year. Net income and diluted net income per share for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 increased approximately 20% to $3.8 million and 17% to $0.14, respectively, compared to the first quarter of last year.
Our leadership team was pleased with our overall performance for the first quarter of 2009, commented Jerry Deitchle, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Despite the continuing economic recession and its related pressure on consumer discretionary spending, our comparable restaurant sales were essentially flat during the quarter compared to an estimated decrease of 4.2% in comparable casual dining restaurant sales reported by the Knapp-Track survey for the first quarter. We believe that our solid comparable sales performance is a strong testament to the broad approachability of the BJs concept to all consumer demographics, coupled with our unwavering focus to deliver a higher quality dining experience at a price point that remains the same or lower than most of our mass market casual dining competitors. In addition to our favorable comparable sales performance, we believe that our restaurant operators and support team did an effective job of managing controllable costs and expenses during the quarter. While we currently believe that the tough economy will continue to keep pressure on overall casual dining customer traffic for at least the rest of 2009, BJs will continue to work hard to outperform its peers and steadily capture additional market share in the estimated $80 billion casual dining segment.
The Company successfully opened two new restaurants during the first quarter of 2009 (in Gainesville, Florida, and Henderson, Nevada). We are very pleased with initial sales volumes for our first two new restaurants of 2009, said Deitchle. Our restaurant in Gainesville set a new sales record for a non-California BJs restaurant by achieving over $150,000 of opening week sales, a record they subsequently broke the following week. Additionally, sales for our new Henderson, Nevada, restaurant (in the Las Vegas market) continue to track well in excess of $100,000 per week. The Company currently remains on track to open as many 9 to 11 new restaurants during 2009 and thereby achieve a targeted increase of 15% to 16% in total restaurant operating weeks for the year. The Company currently expects to open no new restaurants during the second quarter; as many as four to five new restaurants during the third quarter; and as many as three to four new restaurants during the fourth quarter. The actual number and timing of new restaurant openings is subject to a number of factors outside of the Company's control, including weather conditions and factors under the control of landlords, contractors and regulatory/licensing authorities.
Investor Conference Call and Webcast
BJs Restaurants, Inc. will conduct a conference call on its first quarter earnings release today, April 23, 2009, at 2:00 p.m. (Pacific Time).

Exhibit 99.1
BJ's Restaurants, Inc. Holds Annual Meeting of Shareholders
HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 4, 2009--BJs Restaurants, Inc. (NASDAQ:BJRI) held its annual meeting of shareholders on Wednesday, June 3, 2009. Shareholders re-elected Gerald W. Deitchle, Peter A. Bassi, Larry D. Bouts, Shann M. Brassfield, James A. Dal Pozzo, J. Roger King and John F. Grundhofer to the Board of Directors to serve for one-year terms until the next annual meeting. Additionally, shareholders also ratified the selection of Ernst & Young LLP to serve as the Companys independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal 2009. Management also provided shareholders with an overview of the Companys fiscal 2008 financial results and an update on the Companys current expansion plan and key initiatives in progress.
In spite of the current economic recession, BJs continues to steadily gain market share in the estimated $80-$85 billion casual dining segment of the restaurant industry, commented Jerry Deitchle, Chairman and CEO. Currently, our estimated share of the segments annual sales is only about one-half of one percent. Accordingly, the bulk of our national growth opportunity remains well ahead of us. Our previously announced 2009 new restaurant expansion plan remains solidly on track, and work is well underway in developing a reasonable expansion plan for next year. Our team has worked very hard during the last four to five years to more clearly position the BJs concept as a casual-plus competitor that delivers a higher quality, more differentiated dining experience at a price point that remains the same or lower than most of our mass market casual dining competitors. We will continue to make prudent investments in our concept and our growth infrastructure to further reinforce our competitive positioning as we navigate our way through the current recession and become an even stronger competitive force when the recession eventually abates.

Exhibit 99.1
BJs Restaurants, Inc. Reports Financial Results for the Second Quarter of Fiscal 2009
HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 23, 2009--BJs Restaurants, Inc. (NASDAQ: BJRI) today reported financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2009 that ended on Tuesday, June 30, 2009.
Total revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 2009 increased approximately 17% to $107.7 million compared to $92.2 million for the same quarter last year. Comparable restaurant sales decreased by 1.3% during the second quarter of fiscal 2009 compared to an increase of 0.6% during the same quarter last year. Net income and diluted net income per share for the second quarter of fiscal 2009 increased approximately 52% and 45%, respectively, to $4.4 million and $0.16, respectively, compared to the same quarter last year.
Despite the ongoing difficult environment for consumer discretionary spending in general, and for dining out occasions in particular, BJs continued its forward momentum during the second quarter as evidenced by our favorable financial performance, commented Jerry Deitchle, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. We were pleased that our comparable restaurant sales continue to outperform the widely-followed Knapp-Track benchmark survey for casual dining comparable sales, which is expected to report an estimated decrease of at least 6% for the second quarter.
While some casual dining concepts have adopted a save your way to success strategy during the current recession, we continue to make prudent investments to further strengthen BJs competitive positioning as a higher quality, more differentiated and less commoditized casual dining concept at a good value for the consumer, said Deitchle. During the quarter, we rolled out our most comprehensive menu update in many years, and our new menu and beverage creations have been well received by our guests. We also continue to make investments in technological toolsets and quality fast operational systems that are intended to enable our restaurant operators to become even more productive and efficient in their four-wall execution. We currently expect that the tough economy will continue to keep pressure on our overall guest traffic for at least the remainder of 2009, particularly when considering that approximately two-thirds of our restaurants are located in states with unemployment rates that are currently higher than the national average. Nevertheless, BJ's will continue to work hard to control what we can control and to outperform our peers. With only 85 restaurants opened today, we remain confident in BJs ability to achieve steady market share gains over time in the estimated $80 billion casual dining segment of the restaurant industry."
The Company successfully opened one new restaurant at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2009 in Mesquite, Texas. This new restaurant represents our third new restaurant opening to date during fiscal 2009. Seven additional new restaurants are under construction and we currently expect to open all of them before the end of 2009, thereby achieving our targeted 15% to 16% increase in total restaurant operating weeks for the year. The Company currently expects to open two new restaurants during the third quarter and five new restaurants during the fourth quarter. Investors are reminded that the actual number and timing of new restaurant openings for any given period is subject to a number of factors outside of the Company's control, including weather conditions and factors under the control of landlords, contractors and regulatory/licensing authorities.
Investor Conference Call and Webcast
BJs Restaurants, Inc. will conduct a conference call on its second quarter earnings release today, July 23, 2009, at 2:00 p.m. (Pacific Time).

Shares shall not be issued pursuant to the exercise of an Award unless the exercise of such Award and the issuance and delivery of such Shares pursuant thereto shall comply with all relevant provisions of law, including, without limitation, the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Exchange Act, the rules and regulations promulgated under either such Act, and the requirements of any stock exchange or quotation system upon which the Shares may then be listed or quoted, and shall be further subject to the approval of counsel for the Company with respect to such compliance.
(d) SUBSTITUTIONS AND ASSUMPTIONS. The Board or the Committee shall have the right to substitute or assume Awards in connection with mergers, reorganizations, separations, or other transactions to which Section 424(a) of the Code applies, provided such substitutions and assumptions are permitted by Section 424 of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder. The number of Shares reserved pursuant to Section 4(a) may be increased by the corresponding number of Awards assumed and, in the case of a substitution, by the net increase in the number of Shares subject to Awards before and after the substitution.
 
SECTION 5. . If any change is made to the Shares by reason of any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, combination of shares, exchange of shares or other change affecting the outstanding Shares as a class without the Company's receipt of consideration, appropriate adjustments shall be made to (i) the maximum number and/or class of securities issuable under the Plan, (ii) the number and/or class of securities and/or the price per Share covered by outstanding Awards under the Plan and (iii) the Maximum Annual Participant Award. The Committee may also make adjustments described in (i)-(iii) of the previous sentence in the event of any distribution of assets to shareholders other than a normal cash dividend, if any. In determining adjustments to be made under this Section 5, the Committee may take into account such factors as it deems appropriate, including the restrictions of applicable law and the potential tax consequences of an adjustment, and in light of such factors may make adjustments that are not uniform or proportionate among outstanding Awards. Adjustments, if any, and any determinations or interpretations, including any determination of whether a distribution is other than a normal cash dividend, made by the Committee shall be final, binding and conclusive. For purposes of this Section 5, conversion of any convertible securities of the Company shall not be deemed to have been "effected without receipt of consideration."
ADJUSTMENTS TO SHARES SUBJECT TO THE PLAN
Except as expressly provided herein, no issuance by the Company of shares of any class, or securities convertible into shares of any class, shall affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with respect to, the number or price of Shares subject to an Award.
SECTION 6. .
GENERAL ELIGIBILITY
(a) AWARDS. Awards may be granted to Participants who are Employees, Directors or Consultants; provided however that Incentive Stock Options may only be granted to Employees.
(b) MAXIMUM ANNUAL PARTICIPANT AWARD. The aggregate number of Shares with respect to which an Award or Awards may be granted to any one Participant in any one taxable year of the Company (the "Maximum Annual Participant Award") shall not exceed 300,000 shares of Common Stock (increased, proportionately, in the event of any stock split or stock dividend with respect to the Shares).
(c) NO EMPLOYMENT/SERVICE RIGHTS. Nothing in the Plan shall confer upon any Participant the right to an Award or to continue in service as an Employee or Consultant for any period of specific duration, or interfere with or otherwise restrict in any way the rights of the Company (or any Subsidiary employing or retaining such person), or of any Participant, which rights are hereby expressly reserved by each, to terminate such person's services at any time for any reason, with or without cause.).
 
(d) AWARDS TO NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS; CONTINUATION OF AUTOMATIC GRANTS. The aggregate number of Shares with respect to which Awards may be granted to Non-Employee Directors under the Plan shall be 500,000 shares of Common Stock (increased proportionately in the event of any stock split or stock dividend with respect to the Shares). Unless and until amended or terminated by the Board, the Committee or the Governance and Nomination Committee thereof, the automatic Award grants to Non-Employee Directors contemplated by Section 7.16 of the Former Plan shall terminate under the Former Plan and continue under the Plan from and after the Effective Date. Any provision in the Former Plan or in options granted under the Former Plan referencing expiration of options upon termination of the Former Plan shall be deemed to refer to expiration upon termination of this Plan. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Former Plan, unless otherwise determined by the Board or the Committee, all Non-Employee Directors shall be eligible to receive the automatic Award grants contemplated by Section 7.16 of the Former Plan.
(e) COMPLIANCE WITH SECTION 409A. It is the intention of this Plan that any Awards granted hereunder shall satisfy the additional conditions applicable to nonqualified deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Code. No Award shall provide for deferral of compensation that does not comply with Section 409A of the Code, unless the Board or Committee, at the time of grant, specifically provides that the Award is not intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code. In the event that an Award is determined to constitute "nonqualified deferred compensation" that would be subject to the additional tax under Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code (or any successor provisions), the Committee shall have the authority to impose such additional conditions as it deems necessary to avoid the imposition of the additional tax. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Plan, the Company shall have no liability to any Participant or any other person (i) if an Award does not satisfy the additional conditions applicable to nonqualified deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Code or (ii) for any other unexpected tax consequence affecting any Participant or other person due to the receipt or settlement of any Award granted hereunder.
SECTION 7. .
PROCEDURE FOR EXERCISE OF AWARDS; RIGHTS AS A SHAREHOLDER
(a) PROCEDURE. An Award shall be exercised when written, electronic or verbal notice of exercise has been given to the Company, or the brokerage firm or firms approved by the Company to facilitate exercises and sales under this Plan, in accordance with the terms of the Award by the person entitled to exercise the Award and full payment for the Shares with respect to which the Award is exercised has been received by the Company or the brokerage firm or firms, as applicable. The notification to the brokerage firm shall be made in accordance with procedures of such brokerage firm approved by the Company. Full payment may, as authorized by the Committee, consist of any consideration and method of payment allowable under Section 7(b) of the Plan. The Company shall issue (or cause to be issued) such share certificate promptly upon exercise of the Award. In the event that the exercise of an Award is treated in part as the exercise of an Incentive Stock Option and in part as the exercise of a Nonqualified Stock Option pursuant to Section 10(a), the Company shall issue a share certificate evidencing
 
the Shares treated as acquired upon the exercise of an Incentive Stock Option and a separate share certificate evidencing the Shares treated as acquired upon the exercise of a Nonqualified Stock Option, and shall identify each such certificate accordingly in its share transfer records. No adjustment will be made for a dividend or other right for which the record date is prior to the date the share certificate is issued, except as provided in Section 5 of the Plan.
(b) METHOD OF PAYMENT. The consideration to be paid for any Shares to be issued upon exercise or other required settlement of an Award, including the method of payment, shall be determined by the Committee at the time of settlement and which forms may include: (i) with respect to an Option and subject to any restrictions or limitations imposed under applicable law, a request that the Company or the designated brokerage firm conduct a cashless exercise of the Option; (ii) cash; and (iii) tender of shares of Common Stock owned by the Participant in accordance with rules established by the Committee from time to time. Shares used to pay the exercise price shall be valued at their Fair Market Value on the exercise date. Payment of the aggregate exercise price by means of tendering previously-owned shares of Common Stock shall not be permitted when the same may, in the reasonable opinion of the Company, cause the Company to record a loss or expense as a result thereof.
(c) WITHHOLDING OBLIGATIONS. To the extent required by applicable federal, state, local or foreign law, the Committee may and/or a Participant shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Company for the satisfaction of any withholding tax obligations that arise with respect to any Incentive Stock Option, Nonqualified Stock Option, SAR, Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units, Performance Shares, Performance Units or any sale of Shares. The Company shall not be required to issue Shares or to recognize the disposition of such Shares until such obligations are satisfied. These obligations may be satisfied by having the Company withhold a portion of the Shares that otherwise would be issued to a Participant under such Award or by tendering Shares previously acquired by the Participant in accordance with rules established by the Committee from time to time.
(d) SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS. Except as otherwise provided in this Plan, until the issuance (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company) of the share certificate evidencing such Shares, no right to vote or receive dividends or any other rights as a shareholder shall exist with respect to the Shares subject to the Award, notwithstanding the exercise of the Award.
(e) NON-TRANSFERABILITY OF AWARDS. An Award may not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred, or disposed of in exchange for consideration, except that an Award may be transferred by will or by the laws of descent or distribution and may be exercised, during the lifetime of the Participant, only by the Participant; unless the Committee permits further transferability, on a general or specific basis, in which case the Committee may impose conditions and limitations on any permitted transferability.
 
SECTION 8. .
EXPIRATION OF AWARDS
(a) EXPIRATION, TERMINATION OR FORFEITURE OF AWARDS. Unless otherwise provided in the applicable Award Agreement or any severance agreement, vested Awards granted under this Plan shall expire, terminate, or otherwise be forfeited as follows:
(i) three (3) months after the effective date of termination of Active Status for a Participant other than a Non-Employee Director, other than in circumstances covered by (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v) below; or six (6) months after the date a Non-Employee Director ceases to be a Director or Consultant other than in circumstances covered by (ii) and (iv) below:
(ii) immediately upon termination of a Participant's Active Status for Misconduct;
(iii) twelve (12) months after the date on which a Participant other than a Non-Employee Director ceased performing services as a result of his or her total and permanent Disability;
(iv) twelve (12) months after the date of the death of a Participant whose Active Status terminated as a result of his or her death; and
(v) six (6) months after the date on which the Participant ceased performing services as a result of Retirement.
(b) EXTENSION OF TERM. Notwithstanding subsection (a) above, the Committee shall have the authority to extend the expiration date of any outstanding Option, other than an Incentive Stock Option, or SAR in circumstances in which it deems such action to be appropriate (provided that no such extension shall extend the term of an Option or SAR beyond the date on which the Option or SAR would have expired if no termination of the Employee's Active Status had occurred).
SECTION 9. . Notwithstanding any other provision in the Plan to the contrary, the following provisions shall apply unless otherwise provided in the most recently executed agreement between the Participant and the Company, or specifically prohibited under applicable laws, or by the rules and regulations of any applicable governmental agencies or national securities exchanges or quotation systems.
EFFECT OF CHANGE OF CONTROL
(a) ACCELERATION. Awards of a Participant shall be Accelerated (as defined in Section 9(b) below) as follows:
(i) With respect to Non-Employee Directors, upon the occurrence of a Change of Control described in Section 2(f);
(ii) With respect to any Employee, upon the occurrence of a Change of Control described in Section 2(f)(i);
 
(iii) With respect to any Employee who Resigns for Good Reason or whose Active Status is terminated, so long as such resignation or termination occurs within one year after a Change of Control described in Section 2(f)(ii), (iii) or (iv); and
(iv) With respect to any Employee, upon the occurrence of a Change of Control described in Section 2(f)(iv) in connection with which each Award is not assumed or an equivalent award substituted by such successor entity or a parent or subsidiary of such successor entity.
(b) DEFINITION. For purposes of this Section 9, Awards of a Participant being "Accelerated" means, with respect to such Participant:
(i) any and all Options and SARs shall become fully vested and immediately exercisable, and shall remain exercisable for the greater of (1) the time period specified in the original Award (but subject to termination upon termination of Active Status in accordance with the terms of the original Award) or, (2) one year following the date of such acceleration;
(ii) any restriction periods and restrictions imposed on Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units that are not performance-based shall lapse;
(iii) any restriction periods and restrictions imposed on Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, and Performance Compensation Awards that are performance-based shall lapse, unless such performance-based Awards remain outstanding after the Change of Control (or are assumed by any successor entity) and the applicable Performance Criteria can be accurately tracked following the Change of Control; and
(iv) the restrictions and deferral limitations and other conditions applicable to any other Awards shall lapse, and such other Awards shall become free of all restrictions, limitations or conditions and become fully vested and transferable to the full extent of the original grant.
SECTION 10. .
GRANT, TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF OPTIONS
(a) DESIGNATION. Each Option shall be designated in an Award Agreement as either an Incentive Stock Option or a Nonqualified Stock Option. However, notwithstanding such designations, to the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value of the Shares with respect to which Options designated as Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by any Employee during any calendar year (under all plans of the Company) exceeds $100,000, such excess Options shall be treated as Nonqualified Stock Options. Options shall be taken into account in the order in which they were granted.
 
(b) TERMS OF OPTIONS. The term of each Option shall be no more than ten (10) years from the date of grant. However, in the case of an Incentive Stock Option granted to a Participant who, at the time the Option is granted, owns Shares representing more than ten percent (10%) of the voting power of all classes of shares of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, the term of the Option shall be no more than five (5) years from the date of grant.
(c) OPTION EXERCISE PRICES.
(i) The per Share exercise price under an Incentive Stock Option shall be as follows:
(A) If granted to an Employee who, at the time of the grant of such Incentive Stock Option, owns shares representing more than ten percent (10%) of the voting power of all classes of shares of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, the per Share exercise price shall be no less than 110% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant.
(B) If granted to any other Employee, the per Share exercise price shall be no less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant.
(ii) The per Share exercise price under a Nonqualified Stock Option or SAR shall be no less than one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant.
(iii) In no event shall the Board or the Committee be permitted to Reprice an Option after the date of grant without shareholder approval.
(d) VESTING. To the extent Options vest and become exercisable in increments, such Options shall cease vesting as of the date of the Optionee's Disability or termination of such Optionee's Active Status for reasons other than Retirement or death, in each of which cases such Options shall immediately vest in full.
(e) EXERCISE. Any Option granted hereunder shall be exercisable at such times and under such conditions as determined by the Committee at the time of grant, and as are permissible under the terms of the Plan. An Option may not be exercised for a fraction of a Share.
SECTION 11. .
GRANT, TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF STOCK AWARDS
(a) DESIGNATION. Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units may be granted either alone, in addition to, or in tandem with other Awards granted under the Plan. Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units may include a dividend equivalent right, as permitted by Section 5. After the Committee determines that it will offer Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units, it will advise the Participant in writing or electronically, by means of an Award Agreement, of the terms, conditions and restrictions, including vesting, if any, related to the offer, including the number of Shares that the Participant shall be entitled to receive or purchase, the price to be paid, if any, and, if applicable, the
 
time within which the Participant must accept the offer. The offer shall be accepted by execution of an Award Agreement or as otherwise directed by the Committee. Restricted Stock Units may be paid as permitted by Section 7(b). The term of each award of Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units shall be at the discretion of the Committee.
(b) PERFORMANCE BASED STOCK AWARDS. The Committee may elect to grant Restricted Stock and/or Restricted Stock Units that are intended to qualify as "performance based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code. Any such performance based Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units shall be subject to the attainment of Performance Goals relating to Performance Criteria selected by the Committee and specified at the time such Restricted Stock and/or Restricted Stock Units are granted.
(c) VESTING. Subject to the provisions of Section 9 of this Plan, unless the Committee determines otherwise, the Award Agreement shall provide for the forfeiture of the non-vested Shares underlying Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units upon the termination of a Participant's Active Status. The Committee shall be bound to administer Awards of Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units that are not performance-based with a minimum vesting period of at least three years.
SECTION 12. .
GRANT, TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF SARS
(a) GRANTS. The Committee shall have the full power and authority, exercisable in its sole discretion, to grant SARs to selected Participants. The terms of SARs shall be at the discretion of the Committee. In no event shall the Board or the Committee be permitted to Reprice a SAR after the date of grant without shareholder approval.
(b) STAND-ALONE SARS.
(i) A Participant may be granted stand-alone stock appreciation rights ("Stand-Alone SARs") that are not tied to any underlying Option under Section 10 of the Plan. The Stand-Alone SAR shall cover a specified number of Shares and shall be exercisable upon such terms and conditions as the Committee shall establish. Upon exercise of the Stand-Alone SAR, the holder shall be entitled to receive a distribution from the Company in an amount equal to the excess of (A) the aggregate Fair Market Value (on the exercise date) of the Shares underlying the exercised right over (B) the aggregate base price in effect for those Shares.
(ii) The number of Shares underlying each Stand-Alone SAR and the base price in effect for those Shares shall be determined by the Committee at the time the Stand-Alone SAR is granted. In no event, however, may the base price per Share be less than the Fair Market Value per underlying Share on the grant date.
(iii) The distribution with respect to an exercised Stand-Alone SAR may be made in Shares valued at Fair Market Value on the exercise date, in cash, or partly in Shares and partly in cash, as the Committee shall deem appropriate.
 
(c) EXERCISED SARS. The Shares issued in settlement of any SARs exercised under this Section 12 shall not be available for subsequent issuance under the Plan. In accordance with Section 4, Shares underlying any exercised SARs that were not issued in settlement of the SAR shall become available for future issuance under the Plan.
SECTION 13. .
GRANT, TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF PERFORMANCE COMPENSATION AWARDS
(a) GRANTS. The Committee shall have the full power and authority, exercisable in its sole discretion, to grant Performance Compensation Awards in the form of Performance Units or Performance Shares to Employees (including Officers) and shall evidence such grant in an Award Agreement that is delivered to the Participant setting forth the terms and conditions of the Award. The Committee may, at the time of grant of a Performance Compensation Award, designate such Award as a Performance Compensation Award in order that such Award constitutes "qualified performance-based compensation" under Code Section 162(m), in which event the Committee shall have the power to grant such Performance Compensation Award upon terms and conditions that qualify it as "qualified performance-based compensation" within the meaning of Code Section 162(m).
(b) ELIGIBILITY. The Committee shall, in its sole discretion, designate within the first 90 days of a Performance Period (or, if shorter, within the maximum period allowed under Section 162(m) of the Code) which Participants will be eligible to receive Performance Compensation Awards in respect of such Performance Period. However, designation of a Participant eligible to receive an Award hereunder for a Performance Period shall not in any manner entitle the Participant to receive payment in respect of any Performance Compensation Award for such Performance Period. The determination as to whether or not such Participant becomes entitled to payment in respect of any Performance Compensation Award shall be decided solely in accordance with the provisions of this Section 13. Moreover, designation of a Participant eligible to receive a Performance Compensation Award hereunder for a particular Performance Period shall not require designation of such Participant eligible to receive a Performance Compensation Award hereunder in any subsequent Performance Period and designation of one person as a Participant eligible to receive a Performance Compensation Award hereunder shall not require designation of any other person as a Participant eligible to receive a Performance Compensation Award hereunder in such period or in any other period.
(c) DISCRETION OF COMMITTEE WITH RESPECT TO PERFORMANCE COMPENSATION AWARDS. With regard to a particular Performance Period, the Committee shall have full discretion to select the length of such Performance Period, the type(s) of Performance Compensation Awards to be issued, the Performance Criteria that will be used to establish the Performance Goal(s), the kind(s) and/or level(s) of the Performance Goals(s) that is (are) to apply, or any combination of the foregoing, and the Performance Formula. Within the first 90 days of a Performance Period (or, if shorter, within the maximum period allowed under Section 162(m) of the Code), the Committee shall, with regard to the Performance Compensation Awards to be
 
issued for such Performance Period, exercise its discretion with respect to each of the matters enumerated in the immediately preceding sentence and record the same in writing.
(d) MODIFICATION OF PERFORMANCE GOALS. The Committee is authorized at any time during the first ninety (90) days of a Performance Period (or, if shorter, within the maximum period allowed under Section 162(m) of the Code), or any time thereafter (but only to the extent the exercise of such authority after such 90-day period (or such shorter period, if applicable) would not cause the Performance Compensation Awards granted to any participant for the Performance Period to fail to qualify as "qualified performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code), in its sole discretion, to adjust or modify the calculation of a Performance Goal for such Performance Period to the extent permitted under Section 162(m) of the Code (i) in the event of, or in anticipation of, any unusual or extraordinary corporate item, transaction, event or development affecting the Company (to the extent applicable to such Performance Goal) or (ii) in recognition of, or in anticipation of, any other unusual or nonrecurring events affecting the Company (to the extent applicable to such Performance Goal), or the financial statements of the Company (to the extent applicable to such Performance Goal), or of changes in applicable rules, rulings, regulations or other requirements of any governmental body or securities exchange, accounting principles, law or business conditions.
(e) PAYMENT OF PERFORMANCE COMPENSATION AWARDS.
(i) A Participant must be employed by the Company on the last day of a Performance Period to be eligible for payment in respect of a Performance Compensation Award for such Performance Period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the discretion of the Committee, Performance Compensation Awards may be paid to Participants in the event of Retirement of such Participant or with respect to a Participant whose Active Status as an employee has terminated after the beginning of the Performance Period for which a Performance Compensation Award is made, or to the designee or estate of a Participant who died prior to the last day of a Performance Period.
(ii) A Participant shall be eligible to receive payments in respect of a Performance Compensation Award only to the extent that (1) the Performance Goal(s) for such period are achieved and certified by the Committee in accordance with Section 13(e)(iii) and (2) the Performance Formula as applied against such Performance Goal(s) determines that all or some portion of such Participant's Performance Compensation Award has been earned for the Performance Period.
(iii) Following the completion of a Performance Period, the Committee shall meet to review and certify in writing whether, and to what extent, the Performance Goals for the Performance Period have been achieved and, if so, to calculate and certify in writing that amount of the Performance Compensation Awards earned for the period based upon the Performance Formula. The Committee shall then determine the actual size of each Participant's Performance Compensation Award for the Performance Period.
 
(iv) [Intentionally omitted]
(v) The Performance Compensation Awards granted for a Performance Period shall be paid to Participants as soon as administratively possible following completion of the certifications required by Section 13(e)(iii), unless the Committee shall determine that any Performance Compensation Award shall be deferred.
(vi) In no event shall any discretionary authority granted to the Committee by the Plan be used to (1) grant or provide payment in respect of Performance Compensation Awards for a Performance Period if the Performance Goals for such Performance Period have not been attained, or (2) increase a Performance Compensation Award for any Participant at any time after the first 90 days of the Performance Period (or, if shorter, the maximum period allowed under Section 162(m)).
SECTION 14. . The Plan shall become effective as of the Effective Date. It shall continue in effect until the tenth (10
TERM OF PLAN

SECTION 15. .
AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION OF THE PLAN
(a) AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION. The Board or the Committee may amend or terminate the Plan from time to time in such respects as the Board may deem advisable (including, but not limited to amendments which the Board deems appropriate to enhance the Company's ability to claim deductions related to stock option exercises); provided that to the extent required by the Code or the rules of Nasdaq or the SEC, shareholder approval shall be required for any amendment of the Plan. Subject to the foregoing, it is specifically intended that the Board or Committee may amend the Plan without shareholder approval to comply with legal, regulatory and listing requirements and to avoid unanticipated consequences deemed by the Committee to be inconsistent with the purpose of the Plan or any Award Agreement.
(b) PARTICIPANTS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. The Committee shall have the authority to adopt such modifications, procedures, and sub-plans as may be necessary or desirable to comply with provisions of the laws of foreign countries in which the Company or its Subsidiaries may operate to assure the viability of the benefits from Awards granted to Participants performing services in such countries and to meet the objectives of the Plan.
(c) EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR TERMINATION. Any amendment or termination of the Plan shall not affect Awards already granted and such Awards shall remain in full force and effect as if this Plan had not been amended or terminated, unless mutually agreed otherwise between the Participant and the Committee, which agreement must be in writing and signed by the Participant and the Company.
 
SECTION 16. . The effectiveness of the Plan is subject to approval by the shareholders of the Company in accordance with applicable Nasdaq rules.

Exhibit 99.1
BJs Restaurants, Inc. Reports Financial Results for the Third Quarter of Fiscal 2009
HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--October 22, 2009--BJs Restaurants, Inc. (NASDAQ: BJRI) today reported financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2009 ending Tuesday, September 29, 2009.
Total revenues for the third quarter of fiscal 2009 increased approximately 8.5% to $103.9 million compared to $95.8 million for the same quarter last year. Comparable restaurant sales decreased by 1.6% during the third quarter of fiscal 2009 compared to a decrease of 1.0% during the same quarter last year. Net income and diluted net income per share for the third quarter of fiscal 2009 increased approximately 55% to $3.2 million and 50% to $0.12, respectively, compared to the same quarter last year.
"Our leadership team was very pleased that BJ's continued its forward momentum during the third quarter, despite the significant pressures created by the ongoing economic recession," commented Jerry Deitchle, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "We were also pleased that our comparable restaurant sales once again outperformed the widely-followed Knapp-Track benchmark survey for casual dining comparable sales, which we believe will report an estimated decrease of at least 6% for the third quarter. We believe that our comparatively strong sales are the result of our steadily improving restaurant level operational execution, combined with favorable consumer response to our marketing and promotional programs that focus on the communication of BJs everyday value and our new products and services.
We expect that the tough economy will continue to keep pressure on guest traffic for the upcoming quarter and into 2010, particularly when considering that approximately two-thirds of our restaurants are located in states with unemployment rates that are currently higher than the national average, said Deitchle. Nevertheless, BJ's will work hard to control what we can control and to outperform our peers. We will continue to make prudent investments in the quality of our food, beverages, facilities and  most important  our restaurant management talent. By doing so, we intend to emerge from the recession as an even stronger concept and company. With only 89 restaurants opened today, we remain confident in BJ's ability to achieve steady market share gains over time in the estimated $80 billion casual dining segment of the restaurant industry."
The Company has successfully opened seven new restaurants to date during fiscal 2009. Three additional new restaurants are under construction and all are expected to open before Thanksgiving. As such, the Company will achieve its originally targeted 15% to 16% increase in total restaurant operating weeks for the year. Based on the current status of its new restaurant development pipeline, the Company expects to open as many as 10 to 11 new restaurants during fiscal 2010 and has thereby set a preliminary targeted increase in total restaurant operating weeks in the range of 13% to 14% for next year. We believe that BJs is one of just a few publicly-held casual dining restaurants companies that achieved double-digit capacity growth during 2009, and that also plans to achieve that level of growth during 2010, commented Deitchle. Investors are reminded that the actual number and timing of new restaurant openings for any given period is subject to a number of factors outside of the Company's control, including weather conditions and factors under the control of landlords, contractors and regulatory/licensing authorities.

BJs Restaurants, Inc. will conduct a conference call on its third quarter earnings release today, October 22, 2009, at 2:00 p.m. (Pacific Time).

"We are very excited to open our final restaurant for 2009 in Hurst, which is a mature, densely populated trade area with proven levels of retail sales," said Jerry Deitchle, Chairman and CEO. "Our Hurst restaurant represents our seventh location in the Dallas-Fort Worth market, where we have enjoyed some of our strongest comparable restaurant sales comparisons during the past few years. Opening day sales were very strong. The Hurst opening represents our tenth and final new restaurant opening for 2009, and successfully completes our previously stated expansion objective for the year. The entire BJ's team looks forward to driving further increases in our market share in the casual dining segment of the restaurant industry by opening as many as 10 to 11 new restaurants next year. By doing so, BJ's would be one of just a few publicly-held casual dining restaurant companies to achieve double-digit annual capacity growth, in terms of total restaurant operating weeks, for both 2009 and 2010." Investors are remind ed that the actual number and timing of new restaurant openings for any given period is subject to a number of factors outside of the Company's control, including weather conditions and factors under the control of landlords, contractors and regulatory/licensing authorities.

Item 8.01. Other Events.
On January 7, 2010, the Registrant issued a press release titled "BJ's Restaurants, Inc. To Present At January Investor Conferences and Provides a Business Update." The press release issued by the Registrant in connection with the announcement is attached to this report as Exhibit 99.1.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
    Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT 99.1
HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif., Jan. 7, 2010 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BJ's Restaurants, Inc. (Nasdaq:BJRI) will be presenting at two investor conferences during the month of January, as follows:
* Cowen and Company's 8th Annual Consumer Conference at the Westin   Times Square, New York, NY.  The Company's presentation will begin   at approximately 10:30am (Eastern) on Monday, January 11, 2010. * 12th Annual ICR XChange at the St. Regis Monarch Beach, Dana Point,   CA.  The Company's presentation will begin at approximately 8:15am   (Pacific) on Thursday, January 14, 2010.
Both presentations will be broadcast live over the Internet. Interested parties may listen to the presentations at the Company's website located at http://www.bjsrestaurants.com. The presentation can be accessed by clicking on the "Investors" link from the Company's home page followed by the "Presentation" link. An archive of the presentation will be available following the live presentation for 30 days.
The Company also reported preliminary, unaudited revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 that ended on Tuesday, December 29, 2009. When compared to the same quarter of fiscal 2008 that ended on Tuesday, December 30, 2008, revenues for the fourth quarter increased approximately 13.4% to $112.6 million compared to $99.3 million for the same quarter last year. Comparable restaurant sales decreased approximately 0.2% during the fourth quarter, compared to a decrease of 0.7% during the same quarter last year.
For the full fiscal year of 2009, revenues increased approximately 14.1% to $426.7 million compared to $374.1 million for fiscal 2008. Comparable restaurant sales decreased approximately 0.8% during fiscal 2009, compared to a decrease of 0.3% during fiscal 2008. As in prior years, final financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 are currently expected to be released in mid-February 2010 after the completion of the Company's annual independent audit.
"Our restaurant operators, brewers and field supervision/home office support teams worked very effectively throughout 2009 to maintain BJ's forward momentum during one of the toughest years ever for the restaurant industry," commented Jerry Deitchle, Chairman and CEO. "Despite the fact that 50 of our 71 comparable restaurants for the fourth quarter of 2009 are located in states that have unemployment rates above the national average, BJ's was able to retain over 99% of our comparable restaurant sales during the quarter, and also for the full year. We believe this is a strong testament to the success of our ongoing strategy to continually invest in the core of our restaurant operations, in good times and in tough times, to further improve their overall quality, differentiation, energy and value for the casual dining consumer.
"While we continue to expect the national economy to remain difficult for consumers during 2010, we also remain very confident in BJ's ability to continue to achieve market share gains in the estimated $80 billion casual dining segment of the restaurant industry," said Deitchle. "We expect to open as many as 10 to 11 new restaurants during 2010 and have targeted an approximate 13% increase in our total restaurant operating weeks for the coming year. We believe BJ's is one of just a few publicly-held casual dining restaurant companies to achieve double-digit capacity growth during 2009, and that also plans to achieve that level of growth during 2010." Investors are reminded that the actual number and timing of new restaurant openings for any given period is subject to a number of factors outside of the Company's control, including weather conditions and factors under the control of landlords, contractors and regulatory/licensing authorities.
The Company also announced that it reached a settlement for the full liquidation of its auction rate securities (ARS) investment portfolio with its former broker-dealer for the portfolio. Under the terms of the settlement, the Company received approximately $27.4 million in cash (including accrued interest) in exchange for its entire remaining ARS investment portfolio. In addition, the settlement provides the Company with certain options and the potential for additional recoveries, depending upon the performance of the ARS market during the next three years. As a result of the settlement, the Company preliminarily expects to record an after-tax loss on the disposition of its ARS investment portfolio of approximately $1.3 million or $0.05 per diluted share during the quarter ended December 29, 2009. This loss will be in addition to an estimated $500,000 of pre-tax, non-recurring legal and related expenses associated with negotiating and documenting the settlement, which the Company previously disclosed. As of this date, the amounts for losses and expenses are preliminary estimates and are subject to final analysis and documentation. "We believe this settlement favorably resolves a significant uncertainty and places our Company in a much improved short-term liquidity position," commented Greg Levin, the Company's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
The Company also announced that it has filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on January 7, 2010. "Although we do not have any immediate plans to raise capital, we anticipate that this registration statement will provide us with additional financial flexibility to quickly access capital markets as we continue to execute our national expansion plan," said Deitchle. "We believe the flexibility and efficiency that is provided by the increasingly common and proactive shelf registration process will be of significant benefit to the Company." When declared effective by the SEC, the shelf registration statement will permit the Company to raise capital from time to time through the offer and sale of various types of securities not to exceed an aggregate value of $75 million. The Company does not have any current intentions or commitments to sell securities and the shelf registration statement and the terms of any future offering would be established at the time of such offering subject to market conditions. Any offering of securities covered by the shelf registration statement will be made only by means of a written prospectus and prospectus supplement. In addition, the Form S-3 also includes the registration of 3,801,730 shares of common stock previously acquired by certain shareholders from the Company in various transactions several years ago. The Company is also registering these shares to fulfill its contractual obligations under a registration rights agreement with those shareholders.
The Company's shelf registration statement has been filed with the SEC but has not yet become effective. The securities registered may not be sold, nor may offers to buy be accepted, prior to the time the registration statement becomes effective. This press release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy the securities, nor shall there be any sale of the securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction. Any offering by the Company of the securities covered by the registration statement will only be by means of a prospectus and an accompanying prospectus supplement.

EXHIBIT 99.1
HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif., Feb. 11, 2010 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BJ's Restaurants, Inc. (Nasdaq:BJRI) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2009 that ended on Tuesday, December 29, 2009.
Total revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 increased approximately 13.5% to $112.6 million compared to $99.3 million for the same quarter last year. Comparable restaurant sales decreased by 0.2% during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 compared to a decrease of 0.7% during the same quarter last year. Net income and diluted net income per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 were $1.7 million and $0.06, respectively. As previously announced in our press release on January 7, 2010, the fourth quarter results include a $1.7 million pre-tax charge related to the settlement and disposition of the Company's entire auction rate securities ("ARS") investment portfolio and $0.5 million of legal costs associated with negotiating and documenting the settlement of the Company's related claim against the broker-dealer for its ARS portfolio. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding the aforementioned $2.2 million of pre-tax charges and their related tax effect, the Company's non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share for the fourth quarter were $3.3 million and $0.12, respectively. A reconciliation between GAAP and these non-GAAP financial measures is included in the accompanying financial data. 
Total revenues for fiscal 2009 increased approximately 14.1% to $426.7 million compared to $374.1 million for fiscal 2008. Comparable restaurant sales decreased by 0.8% during fiscal 2009 compared to a decrease of 0.3% during fiscal 2008. Net income and diluted net income per share for fiscal 2009 were $13.0 million and $0.48, respectively. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding the $2.2 million of pre-tax charges and their related tax effect, the Company's non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share were $14.7 million and $0.53, respectively. A reconciliation between GAAP and these non-GAAP financial measures is included in the accompanying financial data.
"Given the difficult national economy and its continuing pressure on consumer spending for restaurant occasions, our leadership team was pleased with BJ's overall financial performance for the fourth quarter and full year of 2009," commented Jerry Deitchle, Chairman and CEO. "Not only did we achieve double-digit revenue growth for the fourth quarter and full year, our comparable restaurant sales results continued to outperform most of our casual dining peers.  Our relatively strong comparable sales performance is a solid testimonial to the popularity, quality, relevance, approachability and value of the BJ's restaurant concept and our steadily improving ability to correctly and consistently execute within the four walls of our restaurants.
"While we do not expect consumer spending for restaurant occasions to significantly recover during 2010, we remain confident in BJ's ability to gain market share in the estimated $80 billion casual dining segment," said Deitchle. "Our 2010 new restaurant development pipeline is in excellent shape as of today, and we are already working on potential locations for 2011 openings. Additionally, we will continue to make prudent investments in the 'core' of the BJ's concept to further strengthen its competitive advantages of quality, differentiation and value for the casual dining consumer."
The Company opened five new restaurants during the fourth quarter of 2009 (Culver City, CA; Concord, CA; Carlsbad, CA; San Rafael, CA; and Hurst, TX). As previously announced, the Company currently expects to open as many as 10 to 11 new restaurants during 2010. Two new restaurant openings are currently planned for the latter half of the first quarter of 2010 (Ft. Worth, TX and Escondido, CA). As of this date, for the remainder of 2010, the Company expects to open as many as two new restaurants in the second quarter, four new restaurants in the third quarter and as many as two to three new restaurants during the fourth quarter. The actual number and timing of new restaurant openings during 2010 is subject to a number of factors outside of the Company's control, including weather conditions and factors under the control of landlords, contractors and regulatory/licensing authorities.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement the consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the Company has included the following non-GAAP financial measures in this press release or in the webcast to discuss the Company's financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year which may be accessed via the Company's website at http://www.bjsrestaurants.com: (i) non-GAAP net income and (ii) non-GAAP basic and diluted net income per share. Each of these non-GAAP financial measures is adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain expenses and gains. As a general matter, the Company uses these non-GAAP measures in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. Among other things, the Company uses such non-GAAP financial measures in addition to and in conjunction with corresponding GAAP measures to help analyze the performance of its core business. In addition, the Company believes that such non-GAAP financ ial information is provided by its competitors and such information is used by analysts and others in the investment community to analyze the Company's results and in formulating estimates of future performance and that failure to report these non-GAAP measures, could result in confusion among analysts and others and a misplaced perception that the Company's results have underperformed or exceeded expectations.
These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the Company's operations that, when viewed with the GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of the Company's results of operations and the factors and trends affecting the Company's business. However, these non-GAAP measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.
For fiscal 2009, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP basic and diluted net income per share exclude the effects of the settlement of ARS investments and the related legal and related expenses. For fiscal 2008, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP basic and diluted net income per share exclude the effects of (i) natural disaster and related expense and (ii) legal settlements and related expenses arising from the prior termination of certain executive officers. In addition, for fiscal 2008, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted net income per share reflect an adjustment of income tax expense associated with exclusion of the foregoing expense items and an estimated effective tax rate that the Company would have incurred if they excluded these charges. The adjustment of income taxes is required in order to provide management and investors a more accurate assessment of the taxes that would have been payable on net income, as adjusted by exclusion of the effects of the above listed items. The Comp any believes that presentation of measures of net income and diluted net income per share that exclude these items assists management and investors in evaluating the period over period performance of the Company's ongoing core business operations because the expenses are either non-cash or non-routine in nature. Furthermore, the Company believes that presentation of a measure of non-GAAP net income and net income per share that excludes such charges is useful to management and investors in evaluating the performance of the Company's ongoing operations on a period-to-period basis and relative to the Company's competitors. 
 
(1)  Amounts included in the Company's general and administrative expenses for the thirteen and        fifty-two weeks ended December 29, 2009. 
(2)  The Company's tax rate for the thirteen and fifty-two weeks ended December 30, 2008, was         impacted by the charges listed in the reconciliation schedule above. Excluding these charges         the Company estimates that its effective annual tax rate would have been 24.6%. Accordingly,         for this reconciliation of non-GAAP related financial matters the Company used the 24.6%         effective tax rate for the thirteen and fifty-two weeks ended December 30, 2008, as if these         charges did not occur.   
(3)   Represents the incremental difference between the Company's recorded annual effective tax rate         and its estimated effective annual tax rate of 24.6% as noted previously for the thirteen and         fifty-two weeks ended December 30, 2008.

(a) The Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors of the Company previously approved, and on December 30, 2009, the Company granted to Executive an equity award (the "Award") under the Company's 2005 Equity Incentive Plan (as it may be amended from time to time, the "Plan") consisting of a non-qualified stock option to purchase an aggregate of 232,702 shares of Company common stock at an exercise price of $18.86 per share, which award is evidenced by the Company's standard form of non-qualified stock option agreement (and related Notice of Grant and Grant Summary) and having terms consistent with the provisions of this Agreement (collectively, the "Option Agreement"). Subject to the additional vesting and other provisions of Section 5(b) below and
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Option Agreement, (i) the Award shall vest in full on the third yearly anniversary of the Commencement Date (the "Vesting Date"), and (ii) any option included in the Award shall be exercisable by Executive at any time after vesting and shall expire on the tenth yearly anniversary of the grant date (the "Expiration Date").
(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or the Option Agreement:
(i) if Executive's employment is terminated prior to the Vesting Date as a result of any Pro Rata Acceleration Trigger (as defined below), the Award shall immediately vest on a pro rata basis determined by multiplying the total number of option shares subject to the Award by a fraction (the "Pro Rata Vesting Percentage"), the denominator of which is 36 and the numerator of which is the number of completed calendar months from the Commencement Date to the date of the Acceleration Trigger. "Pro Rata Acceleration Trigger" shall mean the death or Disability of Executive. "Disability" shall mean Executive's incapacity due to physical or mental illness which has resulted in him being absent from the full time performance of substantially all of his material duties with the Company for 90 consecutive days or 180 days total within any 12-month period, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors;
(ii) if Executive's employment is terminated prior to the Vesting Date as a result of any Acceleration Trigger (as defined below), the Award shall immediately vest in full and Executive will have twelve (12) months following termination of his service to the Company as an employee or member of the Board of Directors to exercise the Award (but not beyond the Expiration Date). "Acceleration Trigger" shall mean (1) a termination of Executive by the Company without Cause (as defined in Section 7 of this Agreement) other than as a result of Executive's death or Disability, or (2) a resignation by Executive for Good Reason (as defined in Section 7 of this Agreement);
(iii) in the event Executive's employment is terminated by the Company for Cause, or Executive voluntarily resigns without Good Reason (in each case other than by reason of death or Disability), or Executive refuses to serve, declines nomination or voluntarily resigns as a member of the Board of Directors (other than in connection with a resignation for Good Reason, death or Disability), the unvested portion of the Award shall not become exercisable and shall immediately terminate;
(iv) in the event Executive dies or becomes Disabled, Executive (or his estate or designated representative) shall have twelve (12) months to exercise the Award to the extent it had become vested on or before the date of death or Disability (but not beyond the Expiration Date), after which time the Award shall expire;
(v) in the event Executive is terminated for Cause (or his service as a member of the Board of Directors is terminated for Misconduct as defined in Section 2(y)(viii) of the Plan) following the date on which the Award becomes fully vested, the Award shall expire on the date of such termination;
(vi) in the event that Executive's service as an employee or member of the Board of Directors terminates for any reason other than as described in Sections 5(b)(ii), 5(b)(iv) or 5(b)(v) above, Executive shall have ninety (90) days to exercise the vested portion of the Award (but not beyond the Expiration Date), after which time the Award shall expire; and
(vii) the provisions of Section 9 of the Plan, as it may be amended from time to time, shall apply to the Award; provided, however, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 9(a)(iii) of the Plan, Executive will not be Accelerated (as defined in the Plan) if his Active Status (as defined in the Plan) is terminated within one year after a Change of Control (as defined in the Plan) for Cause or as a result of his resignation (other than as a result of his death or Disability) without Good Reason.
 
(c) In addition to all amounts otherwise payable under this Agreement and subject to the additional vesting and other provisions of Sections 5(d) and 5(e) below, the Company shall pay the Executive, during his lifetime or in the event of his death Executive's designated beneficiary or his estate if no beneficiary is designated, an annual retirement benefit in the annual amount of one hundred twenty-five thousand dollars ($125,000) per year for a period of five (5) years (the "Retirement Benefit") payable in equal monthly installments, and Executive's right to receive the Retirement Benefit shall vest in full on the Vesting Date (as defined above).
(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement:
(i) if Executive's employment is terminated prior to the Vesting Date as a result of any Pro Rata Acceleration Trigger (as defined above), the Retirement Benefit shall immediately vest on a pro rata basis with the annual payment being determined by multiplying $125,000 by the Pro Rata Vesting Percentage (as defined above);
(ii) if Executive's employment is terminated prior to the Vesting Date as a result of any Acceleration Trigger (as defined above), the Retirement Benefit shall immediately vest in full; and
(iii) in the event Executive's employment is terminated by the Company for Cause or Executive voluntarily resigns without Good Reason (in each case other than by reason of death or Disability), or Executive refuses to serve, declines nomination or voluntarily resigns as a member of the Board of Directors (other than in connection with a resignation for Good Reason, death or Disability) prior to the Vesting Date, Executive shall not be entitled to any Retirement Benefit.
(e) Payment of the Retirement Benefit shall commence on the first regular Company payroll date (but no later than thirty days) following Executive's Separation from Service (as defined below) or, if earlier, Executive's "Qualifying Disability" (as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(4)(i)), subject to the provisions of Section 5(f) below (which may require a six-month delay in the commencement of payment upon a Separation from Service). Payment of the Retirement Benefit, to the extent vested, shall be accelerated in the following events: (i) if, after Executive's Separation from Service or Qualifying Disability, a "Change in Control Event" (as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-2(i)(5)) occurs or Executive dies, then the remaining installments shall be accelerated and paid in a lump sum upon the earlier of such Change in Control Event or death; and (ii) if Executive's Separation from Service occurs on or within two years after a Change in Control Event, the Retirement Benefit will be paid in a lump sum upon such Separation from Service (subject to the provisions of Section 5(f) below). The Retirement Benefit shall be payable from the general, unrestricted assets of the Company, and the Executive shall be an unsecured general creditor of the Company. The Company's obligations hereunder are an unfunded, unsecured promise to pay benefits in the future, and the Executive shall have no right or interest in any specific assets of the Company by virtue of this obligation. No trust shall be construed to have been created by this Section 5, nor shall any fiduciary relationship be construed to exist between the Company and the Executive. If the Company, in its sole discretion, elects to fund its obligations to pay the Retirement Benefit through the purchase of one or more insurance policies, the Executive shall have no rights in such policy or policies, or the proceeds thereof. The Company shall be the sole owner and beneficiary of said policy or policies, and shall hold all incidents of ownership. The Retirement Benefit is nontransferable, and the Executive shall not assign, transfer, or otherwise encumber any payments made hereunder except for a properly executed written beneficiary designation. Any attempt to transfer or assign benefits shall be null and void, and shall terminate the Company's obligations under this Agreement. The Company shall have the right to deduct and pay over from all Retirement Benefit payments hereunder any federal, state, local or employment taxes which it deems are required by law to be withheld with respect to such payments.
 
(f) For purposes of this Agreement, "Separation from Service" means a separation from service as that term is used in Section 409A(a)(2)(i) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the Treasury Regulations thereunder (the "Code"). Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, if the Retirement Benefit under this Section 5 is payable to Executive upon his Separation from Service, then such payment shall be deferred until the date six months and one day following such Separation from Service (or if earlier, the date of Executive's death) to the extent necessary to avoid adverse tax consequences under Section 409A of the Code, and if such payments are required to be so deferred, the first payment shall be in an amount equal to the total amount to which Executive would otherwise have been entitled to during the period following the date of Separation from Service if the deferral had not been required. Subsequent payments shall be made in accordance with the dates and terms set forth herein.
6. .
Benefits
(a) Executive shall be entitled to paid vacation and business expense reimbursement in accordance with the Company's policies. Executive shall also be entitled to participate with other similarly situated executive officers of the Company based on position, tenure and salary in any plan of the Company relating to health insurance, stock purchases, pension, thrift, profit sharing, life insurance, disability insurance, education, or other retirement or executive benefits that the Company has adopted or may hereafter adopt for the benefit of its executive officers.
(b) Executive shall be entitled to a car allowance of $1,800 per month; provided, however, that the Company may, with the Executive's consent, substitute a company-provided leased vehicle in lieu of the car allowance so long as the Company expense associated with such lease vehicle (lease payments, license, taxes and insurance) does not exceed $1,800 per month.
(c) Executive shall be reimbursed for his reasonable legal fees incurred in connection with negotiating and drafting this agreement up to a maximum of $13,000.
(d) The Company shall pay all unreimbursed out-of-pocket costs associated with an annual physical examination of Executive, such amount not to exceed $3,000 per year.
7. .

At the request of the Board, Executive agrees to resign from his position as a director of the Company within 24 hours after termination of his employment for any reason.
(b) Subject to the provisions of Sections 7(c) and (d) below, in the event the Company terminates Executive without Cause (for reasons other than his death or Disability) or Executive resigns for Good Reason, in addition to any accrued but unpaid compensation due to him under applicable law, any amounts required to be paid to him pursuant to Section 5, any earned but unpaid Bonus for the fiscal year ending immediately before the termination of employment, and any Other Benefits (as defined below), he shall be entitled to receive the following: (i) a lump sum cash payment thirty days following the date of his Separation from Service equal to 100% of the Base Salary that would be due to Executive between the date of termination of employment and the later of the Termination Date or any Extended Termination Date, (ii) payment of the car allowance described in Section 6(b) through the later of the Termination Date or any Extended Termination Date, (iii) a lump sum cash payment thirty days following the date of his Separation from Service equal to a pro rata portion (based on the percentage of days employed for the year in question) of the Bonus for the year in which the termination occurs in the event that the Board of Directors reasonably and in good faith determines that Executive was on track to satisfy the relevant performance criteria for such Bonus (the "Pro Rata Bonus Payment"), (iv) if Executive is not covered by any other comprehensive group insurance, the Company will reimburse Executive an amount equivalent to Executive's COBRA payments through the end of the Termination Date or Extended Termination Date, as the case may be, or if less, the maximum term provided by COBRA for coverage of Executive and his eligible dependents. It shall be a condition to receipt of the consideration described in this Section 7(b) that Executive shall execute the Company's standard form of general release of the Company and its affiliates.
 
(c) In the event Executive resigns or voluntarily terminates his employment for any reason (other than for Good Reason) or the Company terminates Executive's employment for Cause (in each case other than by reason of death or Disability), in addition to any amounts required to be paid pursuant to Section 5, the Company shall only be required to pay Executive (i) on the date it would have been payable to Executive, any unpaid Base Salary and accrued vacation pay earned prior to the date of Executive's termination, (ii) any unpaid reimbursements due Executive for expenses incurred by Executive prior to the date of Executive's termination, and (iii) any benefits that are required, or to which Executive is entitled, under any plan, contract or arrangement maintained by the Company as of the end of his employment; provided, however, nothing in this clause (iii) shall require the continuation of such benefits following termination unless such continuation is required under applicable law or the specific terms of the plan, contract or arrangement (together, the "Other Benefits").
(d) In the event of termination as a result of the death or Disability of Executive, in addition to any amounts required to be paid pursuant to Section 5, the Company shall only be required to pay Executive (or his estate or designated beneficiary) (i) on the date it would have been payable to Executive, any unpaid Base Salary and accrued vacation pay earned prior to the date of Executive's termination, (ii) any unpaid reimbursements due Executive for expenses incurred by Executive prior to the date of Executive's termination, (iii) any earned but unpaid Bonus for the fiscal year ending immediately before the termination of employment, (iv) any Pro Rata Bonus Payment, and (v) any Other Benefits.
(e) For purposes of this Agreement, "Cause" shall mean (i) an act or acts of dishonesty undertaken by Executive and intended to result in material personal gain or enrichment of Executive or others at the expense of the Company, (ii) gross misconduct that is willful or deliberate on Executive's part and that, in either event, is materially injurious to the Company, (iii) the conviction of Executive of a felony, or (iv) the material breach of any terms and conditions of this Agreement by Executive, which breach has not been cured by Executive within 30 days after written notice thereof to Executive from the Company. The cessation of employment by Executive shall not be deemed to be for Cause unless and until there shall have been delivered to Executive a copy of a resolution, duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than a majority of the entire non-employee membership of the Board (for the sake of clarity, not including Executive) at a meeting of the Board called and held for such purpose (after reasonable notice to Executive and an opportunity for him, together with his counsel, to be heard before the Board), finding that, in the good faith opinion of the Board, one or more causes for termination exist under this Section 7(e), and specifying the particulars thereof in detail.
(f) For purposes of this Agreement, "Good Reason" shall mean:
(i) any removal of Executive from his current office (which shall not be deemed to include his role as Chairman if the positions of Chairman and CEO are required to be separated by majority vote of the Company's shareholders or otherwise mandated by law or regulation applicable to all public companies, or by the listing requirements of the exchange or trading system on which the Company's Common Stock is listed for trading), or any failure by the Company to nominate or seek re-election of Executive to the Board of Directors (or as Chairman of the Board of Directors, unless the positions of Chairman and CEO are required to be separated by majority vote of the Company's shareholders or otherwise mandated by law or regulation applicable to all public companies, or by the listing requirements of the exchange or trading system on which the Company's Common Stock is listed for trading), except in connection with termination of Executive's employment for death, Disability, Cause or his voluntary resignation;
 
(ii) any involuntary material reduction in Executive's then-current Base Salary or any involuntary material reduction in Executive's comprehensive benefit package (other than changes, if any, required by group insurance carriers applicable to all persons covered under such plans or changes required under applicable law);
(iii) the assignment to Executive of duties that represent or constitute a material adverse change in Executive's position, duties, responsibilities and status with the Company;
(iv) an involuntary material adverse change in Executive's authorities or reporting responsibilities; except in connection with the termination of Executive's employment for Cause, upon the Disability or death of Executive, or upon the voluntary resignation by Executive;
(v) a relocation of the Company's principal executive offices to a location that is more than 50 miles from the location of the Company's principal executive offices as of the date of this Agreement that was not recommended by the Executive to the Board; or
(vi) the material breach of any terms and conditions of this Agreement by the Company, including without limitation Section 13;
provided, however, that a termination shall not be considered for Good Reason unless Executive has given notice to the Company of the event constituting Good Reason within ninety (90) days of the initial occurrence thereof, such event has not been cured by the Company within thirty (30) days after written notice thereof to the Company from Executive, and Executive resigns no later than 180 days after the initial occurrence of such event.
(g) Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, any amounts payable to Executive under this Section 7 during the first six months and one day following the date of Executive's Separation from Service pursuant to this Section 7 that constitute nonqualified deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, shall be deferred until the date six months and one day following such Separation from Service (or if earlier, the date of Executive's death) to the extent necessary to avoid adverse tax consequences under Section 409A, and if such payments are required to be so deferred, the first payment shall be in an amount equal to the total amount to which Executive would otherwise have been entitled to during the period following the date of Separation from Service if the deferral had not been required. Subsequent payments shall be made in accordance with the dates and terms set forth herein.
8. .
Covenants
(a) . During the term of this Agreement and thereafter, Executive shall not, except as may be required to perform his duties hereunder or as required by applicable law or court order, disclose to others for use, whether directly or indirectly, any Confidential Information regarding the Company. "Confidential Information" shall mean information about the Company, its subsidiaries and affiliates, and their respective clients and customers that is not available to the general public or that does not otherwise become available to the general public, and that was learned by Executive in the course of his employment by the Company, including, without limitation, any data, formulae, recipes, methods, information, proprietary knowledge, trade secrets and client and customer lists and all papers, resumes, records and other documents containing such Confidential Information. Executive acknowledges that such Confidential Information is specialized, unique in nature and of great value to the Company, and that such information gives the Company a competitive advantage. Upon the termination of his employment, Executive will promptly deliver to the Company all documents, maintained in any format, including electronic or print, (and all copies thereof) in his possession containing any Confidential Information.
Confidential Information
 
(b) . Except as otherwise provided herein, Executive agrees that during the term of this Agreement he will not, directly or indirectly, without the prior written consent of the Company, provide consulting services with or without pay, or own, manage, operate, join, control, participate in, or be connected as a stockholder, partner, or otherwise with any business, individual, partner, firm, corporation, or other entity which is then in competition with the Company or any present affiliate of the Company in the industry of owning or operating full-menu table service casual dining restaurants; provided, however, that the "beneficial ownership" by Executive, either individually or as a member of a "group," as such terms are used in Rule 13d under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, of not more than 5% of the voting stock of any corporation shall not be a violation of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Executive shall be permitted to maintain the ownership interests and directorship approved by the Company's Board prior to the Commencement Date so long as they do not interfere with the performance of his duties and do not constitute competitive activities.
Noncompetition
(c) . Executive agrees that all styles, designs, recipes, lists, materials, books, files, reports, correspondence, records, and other documents ("Company Material") used, prepared, or made available to Executive, shall be and shall remain the property of the Company. Upon the termination of his employment and/or the expiration of this Agreement, all Company Materials shall be returned immediately to the Company, and Executive shall not make or retain any copies thereof.
Right to Company Materials
(d) . Executive understands and agrees that in the course of employment with the Company, Executive will obtain access to and/or acquire Company trade secrets, including Confidential Information, which are solely the property of the Company. Therefore, to protect such trade secrets, Executive promises and agrees that during the term of this Agreement, and for a period of two years thereafter, he will not actively solicit or assist or instruct others in soliciting any employees, customers, franchisees, landlords, or suppliers of the Company or any of its present or future subsidiaries or affiliates, to divert their employment or business to or with any individual, partnership, firm, corporation or other entity then in competition with the business of the Company, or any subsidiary or affiliate of the Company. The Company acknowledges in this regard that its customers, landlords and suppliers do have existing relationships and likely will have future relationships with the Company's direct and indirect competitors in the restaurant industry in the ordinary course of their activities. For purposes of this Section 8, "solicit" shall not include general advertisements or other communications in any media not targeted specifically at such employees, customers, franchisees, landlords, or suppliers, and any responses by such persons thereto.
Non-solicitation
(e) . Except for statements of fact, internal Company communications relating to the performance of the Company, disclosures required under applicable law or in connection with any legal proceedings with respect to which Executive is a party or witness, Executive will not make any disparaging remarks regarding the Company at any time during or after the termination of his employment with the Company. Except for statements of fact, internal communications relating to the performance of Executive, and disclosures required under applicable law or in connection with any legal proceedings with respect to which the Company is a party or witness, the Company will not make any disparaging remarks regarding Executive at any time during or after the termination of his employment with the Company.
Non-disparagement
9. .
Code Sections 280G and 409A
(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in the event that Executive becomes entitled to receive or receives any payments, options, awards or benefits (including, without limitation, the monetary value of any non-cash benefits and the accelerated vesting of stock options or restricted stock) under this Agreement or under any other plan, agreement or arrangement with the Company, from any person whose actions result in any change described in Code Section 280G(b)(2)(A)(i) (a "Section 280G Transaction") or from any person affiliated with the Company or such person (collectively, the "Payments") that may separately or in the aggregate constitute "parachute payments" within the meaning of Code Section 280G and it is determined that, but for this
 
Section 9(a), any of the Payments will be subject to any excise tax pursuant to Code Section 4999 or any similar or successor provision (the "Excise Tax"), the Company shall pay to Executive either (i) the full amount of the Company Payments (as defined below) or (ii) an amount equal to the Company Payments (as defined below), reduced by the minimum amount necessary to prevent any portion of the Payments from being an "excess parachute payment" (within the meaning of Code Section 280G) (the "Capped Payments"), whichever of the foregoing amounts results in the receipt by Executive, on an after-tax basis, of the greatest amount of Payments notwithstanding that all or some portion of the Payments may be subject to the Excise Tax. For purposes of determining whether Executive would receive a greater after-tax benefit from receipt of the Capped Payments than from receipt of the full amount of the Payments, (i) there shall be taken into account any Excise Tax and all applicable federal, state and local taxes required to be paid by Executive in respect of the receipt of such payments and (ii) such payments shall be deemed to be subject to federal income taxes at the highest rate of federal income taxation applicable to individuals that is in effect for the calendar year in which the benefits are to be paid, and state and local income taxes at the highest rate of taxation applicable to individuals in the state and locality of employee's residence on the effective date of the Section 280G Transaction, net of the maximum reduction in federal income taxes which could be obtained from deduction of such state and local taxes (as determined by assuming that such deduction is subject to the maximum limitation applicable to itemized deductions under Code Section 68 and any other limitations applicable to the deduction of state and local income taxes under the Code).
(b) In the event that Section 9(a) applies and a reduction is required to be applied to the Company Payments thereunder, the Company Payments shall be reduced by the Company in its reasonable discretion in the following order and in a manner that complies with Code Section 409A (as determined by the Company): (i) reduction of any cash payments otherwise payable to Executive that are exempt from Code Section 409A; (ii) reduction of any cash payments otherwise payable to Executive that are subject Code Section 409A on a pro-rata basis or such other manner that complies with Code Section 409A, as determined by the Company, (iii) cancellation of accelerated vesting of equity awards (other than stock options) that are exempt from Code Section 409A; (iv) cancellation of accelerated vesting of stock options that are exempt from Code Section 409A; and (v) reduction of any other payments and benefits otherwise payable to the Executive by the Company on a pro-rata basis or such other manner that complies with Code Section 409A, as determined by the Company. If acceleration of vesting of Executive's stock options or other equity awards is to be reduced pursuant to clauses (iii) or (iv) of the immediately preceding sentence, such acceleration of vesting shall be accomplished by first canceling such acceleration for the vesting installment that will vest last and continuing to the extent necessary by canceling such acceleration for the next vesting installment with the latest vesting. For purposes of this Section 9, the term "Company Payments" means any payments, options, awards or benefits (including, without limitation, the monetary value of any non-cash benefits and the accelerated vesting of stock options or restricted stock) under this Agreement or under any other plan, agreement or arrangement with the Company.
(c) All calculations and determinations under this Section 9, including application and interpretation of the Code and related regulatory, administrative and judicial authorities, shall be made by an accounting firm selected by the Company and reasonably acceptable to Executive which is designated as one of the four largest accounting firms in the United States (the "Accounting Firm"). All determinations made by the Accounting Firm under this Section 9 shall be conclusive and binding on both the Company and Executive, and the Company shall cause the Accounting Firm to provide its determinations and any supporting calculations with respect to Executive to the Company and Executive. The Company shall bear all fees and expenses charged by the Accounting Firm in connection with its services. For purposes of making the calculations and determinations under this Section 9, after taking into account the information provided by the Company and Executive, the Accounting Firm may make reasonable, good faith assumptions and approximations concerning the application of Code Sections 280G and 4999. The Company and Executive shall furnish the Accounting Firm with such information and documents as the Accounting Firm may reasonably request to assist the Accounting Firm in making calculations and determinations under this Section 9.
 
(d) The parties agree that all provisions of this Agreement are intended to meet, and to operate in accordance with, in all material respects, the requirements of paragraphs (2), (3), and (4) of Section 409A(a) of the Code, and any guidance from the Department of Treasury or Internal Revenue Service thereunder, but only to the extent any compensation or benefits provided hereunder are not excepted or excluded from such requirements pursuant to the short-term deferral exception described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(4), the involuntary separation pay plan exception described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii), or otherwise. In this regard each severance payment under Section 7 of this Agreement shall be treated as a separate payment for purposes of Section 409A of the Code. Where ambiguity or uncertainty exists, this Agreement shall be interpreted in a manner which would qualify any compensation payable hereunder to satisfy the requirements for exception to or exclusion from Section 409A and the taxes imposed thereunder. In the event either party reasonably determines any item payable by the Company to the Executive pursuant to this Agreement that is not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture would not meet, or is reasonably likely not to meet, the requirements of paragraphs (2), (3) and (4) of Section 409A, or to qualify as excepted or excluded from Section 409A, such party shall notify the other in writing. Any such notice shall specify in reasonable detail the basis and reasons for such party's determination. The parties agree to negotiate in good faith the terms and conditions of an amendment to this Agreement and to avoid the inclusion of such item in a tax year before the Executive's actual receipt of such item of income; provided, however, nothing in this Section 21 shall be construed or interpreted to require the Company to increase any amounts payable to the Executive pursuant to this Agreement or to consent to any amendment that would materially and adversely change the Company's financial, accounting or tax treatment of the payments to the Executive under this Agreement. Any item payable under this Agreement that the Company reasonably determines is subject to Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, shall not be paid or commence to be paid before the later of (a) six months after the date of the Executive's Separation from Service and (b) the payment date or commencement date specified in this Agreement for such item.
Any payment or benefit due upon a termination of Executive's employment that represents a "deferral of compensation" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code shall be paid or provided to Executive only upon a Separation from Service.
Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, to the extent any expense reimbursement or the provision of any in-kind benefit under this Agreement is determined to be subject to Section 409A of the Code, the amount of any such expenses eligible for reimbursement, or the provision of any in-kind benefit, in one calendar year shall not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement in any other taxable year (except for any lifetime or other aggregate limitation applicable to medical expenses), in no event shall any expenses be reimbursed after the last day of the calendar year following the calendar year in which Executive incurred such expenses, and in no event shall any right to reimbursement or the provision of any in-kind benefit be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit.
10. . The Company shall to the extent permitted and required by law, indemnify and hold Executive harmless from costs, expense or liability arising out of or relating to any acts or decisions made by Executive in the course of his employment to the same extent the Company indemnifies and holds harmless other officers and directors of the Company in accordance with the Company's established policies. This indemnity shall include, without limitation, advancing Executive attorneys fees to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. The Company agrees to continuously maintain directors and officers' liability insurance with reasonable limits of coverage at least equal to those in effect on the Commencement Date (unless Executive has voted in favor of a reduction in such coverage as a member of the Board of Directors or has implemented a reduction in his capacity as an executive officer of the Company without a vote of the Board of Directors) and to include Executive within said coverage while Executive is employed by the Company and for at least six (6) years after the termination of Executive's employment by the Company.
Indemnity
 
11. . No amendment or additions to this Agreement shall be binding unless in writing and signed by both parties hereto.
Amendments; Entire Agreement
12. . The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof.
Severability
13. . The Company shall require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company to expressly assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken place. As used in this Agreement, "Company" shall mean the Company as hereinbefore defined and any successor to its business and/or assets as aforesaid which assumes this Agreement by operation of law, or otherwise
Assumption by Successor
14. . Except as provided herein, any controversy or claim arising out of or relating in any way to this Agreement or the breach thereof, or Executive's employment and any statutory claims including all claims of employment discrimination shall be subject to private and confidential arbitration in Orange County, California in accordance with the laws of the State of California. The arbitration shall be conducted in a procedurally fair manner by a mutually agreed upon neutral arbitrator selected in accordance with the National Rules for the Resolution of Employment Disputes ("Rules") of the American Arbitration Association or if none can be mutually agreed upon, then by one arbitrator appointed pursuant to the Rules. The arbitration shall be conducted confidentially in accordance with the Rules. The arbitration fees shall be paid by the Company. Each party shall have the right to conduct discovery including depositions, requests for production of documents and such other discovery as permitted under the Rules or ordered by the arbitrator. The statute of limitations or any cause of action shall be that prescribed by law. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award any damages authorized by law for the claims presented including punitive damages and shall have the authority to award reasonable attorneys fees to the prevailing party in accordance with applicable law. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on all parties and shall be the exclusive remedy of the parties. The award shall be in writing in accordance with the Rules, and shall be subject to judicial enforcement in accordance with California law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 19, nothing herein shall prevent or restrict the Company or Executive from seeking provisional injunctive relief from any forum having competent jurisdiction over the parties.
Arbitration
15. . No provision of this Agreement may be modified, waived or discharged unless such waiver, modification or discharge is agreed to in writing and signed by Executive and such officer as may be specifically designated by the Board. No waiver by either party hereto at any time of any breach by the other party hereto of, or compliance with, any condition or provision of this Agreement to be performed by such other party shall be deemed a waiver of similar or dissimilar provisions or conditions at the same or at any prior or subsequent time. This Agreement supersedes any prior oral or written agreements between the parties relating to the subject matter hereof including, without limitation, Executive's Employment Agreement, dated as of January 12, 2005. No agreements or representations, oral or otherwise, express or implied, with respect to the subject matter hereof have been made by either party which are not expressly set forth in this Agreement. The validity, interpretation, construction and performance of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflicts of law principles.
Miscellaneous

ITEM: Financial Statements and Exhibits
Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On April 22, 2010, BJ's Restaurants, Inc., a California corporation (the "Registrant"), announced its financial results for the first quarter ended March 30, 2010. The press release issued by the Registrant in connection with the announcement is attached to this report as Exhibit 99.1. The information in this Form 8-K and Exhibits attached hereto are being furnished and shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
    Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT 99.1
HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif., April 22, 2010 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BJ's Restaurants, Inc. (Nasdaq:BJRI) today reported financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2010 that ended on Tuesday, March 30, 2010.
Total revenues increased approximately 19% to $121.7 million compared to $102.4 million for the same quarter last year. Comparable restaurant sales increased by 4.4% during the first quarter of fiscal 2010 compared to a decrease of 0.1% for the same quarter last year. Net income and diluted net income per share for the first quarter of fiscal 2010 increased approximately 16% to $4.4 million and 14% to $0.16, respectively, compared to the first quarter of last year.
"Our leadership team is pleased to report solid increases in sales and earnings for the first quarter, despite the ongoing economic challenges facing consumers in many of our key markets," said Jerry Deitchle, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.  "Thanks to the continuing effective execution of our restaurant operators, coupled with the success of our new February menu, which included our 'Snacks and Small Bites' menu introduction as well as upgrades to our kids' menu and lunch specials, guest traffic in our comparable restaurants moved into positive territory for the first time since the third quarter of 2007.  Furthermore, our guest traffic comparisons remain positive for the first few weeks of the second quarter.  While the estimated direct and indirect costs incurred to roll out these menu enhancements totaled approximately $0.02 per share during the quarter, this investment strategically strengthened BJ's competitive positioning as a higher quality, more differentiated concept with exc eptional value for the consumer.  During the last two recessionary years, some of our competitors adopted a defensive philosophy of saving their way to success, and either deferred or eliminated many investments that might have added more quality and value to their concepts.  At BJ's, we continued to prudently invest in new restaurant growth as well as in our food, service, facilities, talent base and support infrastructure, so that we will be well positioned to emerge from the recession as an even stronger market-share 'taker' in the estimated $80 billion casual dining segment over the longer term."
The Company successfully opened two new restaurants during the first quarter of 2010 in Fort Worth, Texas (Alliance Town Center) and Escondido, California (North County Fair Mall). Initial sales volumes for both new restaurants remain strong.  "We believe that BJ's is one of just a few publicly-held casual dining restaurant companies to target double-digit capacity growth during 2010," commented Deitchle. "Our 2010 new restaurant development pipeline is in excellent shape as of today, and we are already working on potential locations for 2011 openings.  Six new restaurants are currently under construction and other potential restaurant locations are in their final stages of permitting and plan development. As of this date, we expect to open two new restaurants in the second quarter, four in the third quarter and as many as two or three new restaurants during the fourth quarter." Investors are reminded that the actual number and timing of new restaurant openings is subject to a number of factors outside of the Company's control, including weather conditions and factors under the control of landlords, contractors and regulatory/licensing authorities.
Investor Conference Call and Webcast
BJ's Restaurants, Inc. will conduct a conference call on its first quarter earnings release today, April 22, 2010, at 2:00 p.m. (Pacific Time). The Company will provide an Internet simulcast, as well as a replay of the conference call.

Plan.  The aggregate number of Shares available for issuance under the Plan will be reduced by one Share for each Share delivered in settlement of an Option and by one and one-half (1.5)  Shares for each Share delivered in settlement of any Award of Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, SARs, or Performance Shares or Performance Units unless a greater reduction is specified by the Committee with respect to a specific Award grant.

Shares available for issuance under the Plan shall be increased by any shares of Common Stock subject to outstanding awards under the Former Plan on the Effective Date that later cease to be subject to such awards for any reason other than such awards having been exerc ised, subject to adjustment from time to time as provided in Section 5, which shares of Common Stock shall, as of the date such shares cease to be subject to such awards, cease to be available for grant and issuance under the Former Plan, but shall be available for issuance under the Plan.  The Shares may be authorized but unissued, or reacquired shares of Common Stock.  The Company, during the term of this Plan, will at all times reserve and keep available such number of Shares as shall be sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Plan.
 
(b)
 
      TIME OF GRANTING AWARDS

(c)

The Committee may also make adjustments described in (i)-(iii) of the previous sentence in the event of any distribution of assets to shareholders other than a normal cash dividend, if any.  In determining adjustments to be made under this Section 5, the Committee may take into account such factors as it deems appropriate, including the restrictions of applicable law and the potential tax consequences of an adjustment, and in light of such factors may make adjustments that are not uniform or proportionate among outstanding Awards.  Adjustments, if any, and any determinations or interpretations, includi ng any determination of whether a distribution is other than a normal cash dividend, made by the Committee shall be final, binding and conclusive.  For purposes of this Section 5, conversion of any convertible securities of the Company shall not be deemed to have been effected without receipt of consideration.
 
Except as expressly provided herein, no issuance by the Company of shares of any class, or securities convertible into shares of any class, shall affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with respect to, the number or price of Shares subject to an Award.

(e)       COMPLIANCE WITH SECTION 409A.  It is the intention of this Plan that any Awards granted hereunder shall satisfy the additional conditions applicable to nonqualified deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Code.  No Award shall provide for deferral of compensation that does not comply with Section 409A of the Code, unless the Board or Committee, at the time of grant, specifically provides that the Award is not intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code. In the event that an Award is determined to constitute "nonqualified deferred compensation" that would be subject to the additional tax under Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code (or any successor provisions), the Committee shall have the authority to i mpose such additional conditions as it deems necessary to avoid the imposition of the additional tax.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Plan, the Company shall have no liability to any Participant or any other person (i) if an Award does not satisfy the additional conditions applicable to nonqualified deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Code or (ii) for any other unexpected tax consequence affecting any Participant or other person due to the receipt or settlement of any Award granted hereunder.
SECTION 7.  
PROCEDURE FOR EXERCISE OF AWARDS; RIGHTS AS A SHAREHOLDER

.  An Award shall be exercised when written, electronic or verbal notice of exercise has been given to the Company, or the brokerage firm or firms approved by the Company to facilitate exercises and sales under this Plan, in accordance with the terms of the Award by the person entitled to exercise the Award and full payment for the Shares with respect to which the Award is exercised has been received by the Company or the brokerage firm or firms, as applicable.  The notification to the
 
 
14
 
brokerage firm shall be made in accordance with procedures of such brokerage firm approved by the Company.  Full payment may, as authorized by the Committee, consist of any consideration and method of payment allowable under Section 7(b) of the Plan.

In the event that the exercise of an Award is treated in part as the exercise of an Incentive Stock Option and in part as the exercise of a Nonqualified Stock Option pursuant to Section 10(a), the Company shall issue a share certificate evidencing the Shares treated as acquired upon the exercise of an Incentive Stock Option and a separate share certificate evidencing the Shares treated as acquired upon the exercise of a Nonqualified Stock Option, and shall identify each such certificate accordingly in its share transfer records.  No adjustment will be made for a dividend or other right for which the record date is prior to the date the share certificate is issued, except as provided in Section 5 of the Plan.

Shares used to pay the exercise price shall be valued at their Fair Market Value on the exercise date.  Payment of the aggregate exercise price by means of tendering previously-owned shares of Common Stock shall not be permitted when the same may, in the reasonable opinion of the Company, cause the Company to record a loss or expense as a result thereof.
 
(c)
 
      WITHHOLDING OBLIGATIONS
.  To the extent required by applicable federal, state, local or foreign law, the Committee may and/or a Participant shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Company for the satisfaction of any withholding tax obligations that arise with respect to any Incentive Stock Option, Nonqualified Stock Option, SAR, Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units, Performance Shares, Performance Units or any sale of Shares.  The Company shall not be required to issue Shares or to recognize the disposition of such Shares until such obligations are satisfied.  These obliga tions may be satisfied by having the Company withhold a portion of the Shares that otherwise would be issued to a Participant under such Award or by tendering Shares previously acquired by the Participant in accordance with rules established by the Committee from time to time.
 
(d)
 
      SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS
.  Except as otherwise provided in this Plan, until the issuance (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company) of the share certificate evidencing such Shares, no right to vote or receive dividends or any other rights as a shareholder shall exist with respect to the Shares subject to the Award, notwithstanding the exercise of the Award.
 
 
15
 
(e)
 
      NON-TRANSFERABILITY OF AWARDS
.  An Award may not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred, or disposed of in exchange for consideration, except that an Award may be transferred by will or by the laws of descent or distribution and may be exercised, during the lifetime of the Participant, only by the Participant; unless the Committee permits further transferability, on a general or specific basis, in which case the Committee may impose conditions and limitations on any permitted transferability.

HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif., June 9, 2010 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BJ's Restaurants, Inc. (Nasdaq:BJRI) held its annual meeting of shareholders on Tuesday, June 8, 2010. Shareholders re-elected Gerald W. Deitchle, Peter A. Bassi, Larry D. Bouts, James A. Dal Pozzo, J. Roger King, William L. Hyde, Jr. and John F. Grundhofer to the Board of Directors to serve for one-year terms until the next annual meeting.

With only 96 restaurants open as of today, we are confident that the bulk of our future growth remains well ahead of us."

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On July 22, 2010, BJ's Restaurants, Inc., a California corporation (the "Registrant"), announced its financial results for the second quarter ended June 29, 2010. The press release issued by the Registrant in connection with the announcement is attached to this report as Exhibit 99.1. The information in this Form 8-K and Exhibits attached hereto are being furnished and shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
    Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT 99.1
HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif., July 22, 2010 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BJ's Restaurants, Inc. (Nasdaq:BJRI) today reported financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2010 that ended on Tuesday, June 29, 2010.
Highlights for the second quarter compared to the same quarter last year were as follows:
Total revenues increased 21% to $130.5 million
Comparable restaurant sales increased 5.3%
Net income increased 44% to $6.3 million
Diluted net income per share increased 44% to $0.23
"Our leadership team was very pleased with our solid financial results for the second quarter," commented Jerry Deitchle, Chairman and CEO. "As most restaurant industry investors know, the sales environment for casual dining restaurants continues to be very challenging in light of the current economic conditions. In spite of those challenges, BJ's achieved its second consecutive quarter of solid increases in both comparable restaurant sales and guest traffic. Furthermore, our restaurant operators did an excellent job of managing our higher sales volumes in a productive and efficient manner during the quarter, resulting in improved operating margins. In this difficult operating environment, where consumer spending for casual dining occasions remains under pressure, we continue to believe the more successful restaurant concepts will be those that work harder to protect their overall approachability for all dining occasions and that offer even more quality, differentiation and value to the consumer.  These have always been the hallmarks of the BJ's restaurant concept and brand. We will continue to make prudent investments in every aspect of our concept to steadily increase the gap between BJ's and many of our competitors on these important brand attributes."
The Company opened two new restaurants during the second quarter of 2010 (both in San Antonio, Texas) for a total of four new restaurants during the first half of this fiscal year. "Initial sales volumes for all of our new restaurant openings during 2010 remain stronger than we anticipated," commented Deitchle. The Company currently expects to open four new restaurants during the third quarter, one of which has already opened in Daytona Beach, Florida, and two new restaurants during the fourth quarter. As such, the Company expects to achieve its stated goal to increase its total restaurant operating weeks by approximately 13% during fiscal 2010. Investors are reminded that the actual number and timing of new restaurant openings is subject to a number of factors outside of the Company's control, including weather conditions and factors under the control of landlords, contractors and regulatory/licensing authorities.

EXHIBIT 99.1
HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif., Oct. 21, 2010 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BJ's Restaurants, Inc. (Nasdaq:BJRI) today reported financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2010 that ended on September 28, 2010.
Highlights for the third quarter compared to the same quarter last year were as follows:
Total revenues increased 24% to $128.8 million  
Comparable restaurant sales increased 6.7%  
Net income increased 75% to $5.5 million  
Diluted net income per share increased 67% to $0.20
Results for the third quarter include a pre-tax charge of $884,000, or approximately $0.02 per diluted share, related to the disposal of certain unproductive restaurant assets in connection with the Company's ongoing productivity/efficiency initiatives and facility image enhancement activities. 
"Our leadership team was pleased to deliver a strong financial performance for the third quarter," commented Jerry Deitchle, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.  "We continue to make prudent investments in the very core of the BJ's concept to more solidly position our restaurants as a higher quality, more differentiated 'dining out for fun' experience with outstanding value, while keeping BJ's exceptionally approachable by all consumers.  As a result of our relentless focus on quality and differentiation, coupled with steadily improving execution by our restaurant operators, we achieved our third consecutive quarter of increases in both comparable restaurant sales and guest traffic.  We also achieved measurable leverage in our operating margins during the quarter.  While our recent financial results reflect the success of our competitive positioning strategy and many of our current tactical initiatives, we intend to continue to implement new initiatives in 2011 with the goal to further strengthen the quality, differentiation and productivity of the BJ's restaurant concept."
Four new restaurants were opened during the third quarter of 2010 (Daytona Beach, FL; Tucson, AZ; Colorado Springs, CO; Sparks, NV). The Company currently expects to open two new restaurants during the fourth quarter, of which one has already opened in Puente Hills, CA (in the Los Angeles market). "Initial sales volumes for all of our 2010 new restaurant openings to date continue to exceed our expectations," commented Deitchle. The final new restaurant opening for 2010 is expected to occur before Thanksgiving in The Woodlands, TX (in the Houston market). As a result, the Company will successfully achieve its stated goal to open 10 new restaurants during 2010. 
Based on the current status of the Company's restaurant development pipeline, as many as 12 to 13 new restaurants are expected to be opened during fiscal 2011. "Our development team has been able to secure several high-quality sites in mature trade areas with proven, stable levels of retail sales and with the demographics and co-tenancies that we seek for the BJ's concept," said Deitchle.  "We are looking forward to executing another year of profitable expansion for the BJ's concept, principally focused within our current 13-state geographical footprint to more effectively leverage our brand awareness, our supply chain and our supervision and managerial resources." Investors are reminded that the actual number and timing of new restaurant openings is subject to a number of factors outside of the Company's control, including weather conditions and factors under the control of landlords, contractors and regulatory/licensing authorities.

The Company also reported preliminary, unaudited revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 that ended on Tuesday, December 28, 2010. When compared to the same quarter of fiscal 2009 that ended on Tuesday, December 29, 2009, revenues for the fourth quarter increased approximately 18.0% to $132.9 million compared to $112.6 million for the same quarter last year. Comparable restaurant sales increased approximately 5.9% during the fourth quarter, compared to a decrease of 0.2% during the same quarter last year.  For the full fiscal year of 2010, revenues increased approximately 20.4% to $513.9 million compared to $426.7 million for fiscal 2009. Comparable restaurant sales increased approximately 5.6% during fiscal 2010, compared to a decrease of only 0.8% during fiscal 2009.

"Our leadership team was pleased with our strong top-line results for both the fourth quarter and full fiscal year of 2010," commented Jerry Deitchle, Chairman and CEO. "At BJ's, we consider ourselves to be sales builders, first and foremost. We believe that our ongoing favorable sales performance is largely the result of our strategy to prudently invest in the core of the BJ's concept, during both good and difficult economic times, to further enhance the overall quality, differentiation, relevance and value for today's casual dining consumer. Coupled with steady improvements in our ability to correctly and consistently operate our restaurants, we believe that BJ's is well-positioned to be a 'market share taker' in the casual dining segment for many years to come. 
"We continue to remain highly confident in our ability to deliver high quality, double-digit capacity growth during 2011, as measured in terms of expected growth in total restaurant operating weeks," said Deitchle. "We currently plan to open as many as 12 to 13 new restaurants during 2011 and thereby achieve an approximate 12% increase in total restaurant operating weeks for the full year. All of our potential new locations for 2011 have been identified, and four new restaurants have already commenced construction. Additionally, work is well underway to secure potential locations to support our restaurant expansion plan for 2012 and 2013." Investors are reminded that the actual number and timing of new restaurant openings is subject to a number of factors outside of the Company's control, including weather conditions and factors under the control of landlords, contractors and regulatory/licensing authorities.

EXHIBIT 99.1
HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif., Feb. 10, 2011 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BJ's Restaurants, Inc. (Nasdaq:BJRI) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2010 that ended on Tuesday, December 28, 2010.
Highlights for the 13 weeks ended December 28, 2010, compared to the 13 weeks ended December 29, 2009, were as follows:
Total revenues increased 18% to $132.9 million
Comparable restaurant sales increased 5.9%
Net income and diluted net income per share were $6.9 million and $0.24, respectively
Two new restaurants opened
Total restaurant operating weeks increased approximately 12%
Results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 include an after-tax benefit of approximately $0.7 million or $0.02 per diluted share primarily due to a favorable tax rate adjustment associated with disqualifying dispositions related to incentive stock options ("ISO"). Additionally, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, the Company recorded an after-tax charge of approximately $1.6 million or $0.06 per diluted share related to a loss and related legal costs for the disposition of the Company's entire auction rate securities ("ARS") portfolio. Excluding both of these items from each year's quarterly results, non-GAAP net income and diluted net income per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 would have increased by 90% and 83%, respectively, to $6.3 million and $0.22 compared to non-GAAP results for the same quarter last year. A reconciliation between GAAP and these non-GAAP financial measures is included in the accompanying financial data. 
Highlights for the 52 weeks ended December 28, 2010, compared to the 52 weeks ended December 29, 2009, were as follows: 
Total revenues increased 20% to $513.9 million
Comparable restaurant sales increased 5.6%
Net income and diluted net income per share were $23.2 million and $0.82, respectively
Ten new restaurants opened
Total restaurant operating weeks increased approximately 13%
Excluding the two aforementioned after-tax items for both fiscal 2010 and 2009, non-GAAP net income and diluted net income per share for fiscal 2010 would have increased by 53% and 51%, respectively, to $22.5 million and $0.80 compared to non-GAAP results for fiscal 2009. A reconciliation between GAAP and these non-GAAP financial measures is included in the accompanying financial data. 
"Our leadership team was very pleased with BJ's strong financial performance for both the fourth quarter and full year of 2010," commented Jerry Deitchle, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Despite the difficult operating environment during the past couple of years, we made a decision to continue prudently investing in the quality of the BJ's restaurant concept and the strength of our support infrastructure, thereby protecting our brand and our longer-term growth opportunity. As a result, fiscal 2010 was a very successful year for BJ's. Not only did we achieve our targeted capacity growth by opening ten successful new restaurants this past year, we also achieved four consecutive quarters of solidly positive comparable restaurant sales that resulted in a 5.6% increase in that metric for the full year. Taken together, our capacity growth and comparable restaurant sales growth enabled BJ's to surpass the half-billion dollar sales milestone during fiscal 2010. Just as important, we were able to achieve better leverage of our sales increases to our bottom-line performance as a result of more effective operational execution in all aspects of our business. We look forward to the challenge of surpassing this performance during the upcoming year."  
Two new restaurants opened during the fourth quarter of 2010 (Puente Hills, CA and Shenandoah, TX). "Sales volumes for all of our new restaurant openings during 2010 remain strong," commented Deitchle. As previously announced, the Company currently expects to open as many as 12 to 13 new restaurants during 2011. Two new restaurant openings are currently planned for the latter half of the first quarter of 2011 (Tyler, TX and Sacramento, CA). As of this date, the Company expects to open as many as three new restaurants in the second quarter, four new restaurants in the third quarter and as many as three or four new restaurants during the fourth quarter. Investors are reminded that the actual number and timing of new restaurant openings is subject to a number of factors outside of the Company's control, including weather conditions and factors under the control of landlords, contractors and regulatory/licensing authorities.

Certain statements in the preceding paragraphs and all other statements that are not purely historical constitute "forward-looking" statements for purposes of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are intended to be covered by the safe harbors created thereby. Such statements include, but are not limited to, those regarding expected comparable restaurant sales growth in future periods, those regarding the effect of new sales-building initiatives, as well as those regarding the number of restaurants expected to be opened in future periods and the timing and location of such openings. These "forward-looking" statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause actual results to be materially different from those projected or anticipated. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to: (i) the effect of recent credit and equity market disruptions on our ability to finance our continued expansion on acceptable terms, (ii) our ability to manage an increasing number of new restaurant openings, (iii) construction delays, (iv) labor shortages, (v) minimum wage increases, (vi) food quality and health concerns, (vii) factors that impact California, where 51 of our current 102 restaurants are located, (viii) restaurant and brewery industry competition, (ix) impact of certain brewery business considerations, including without limitation, dependence upon suppliers and related hazards, (x) consumer spending trends in general for casual dining occasions, (xi) potential uninsured losses and liabilities, (xii) fluctuating commodity costs and availability of food in general and certain raw materials related to the brewing of our handcrafted beers and energy, (xiii) trademark and service-mark risks, (xiv) government regulations, (xv) licensing costs, (xvi) beer and liquor regulations, (xvii) loss of key personnel, (xviii) inability to secure acceptable sites, (xix) limitations on insurance coverage, (xx) legal proceedings, (xxi) other general economic and regulatory conditions and requirements, (xxii) the success of our key sales-building and related operational initiatives and (xxiii) numerous other matters discussed in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. BJ's Restaurants, Inc. undertakes no obligation to update or alter its "forward-looking" statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
Further information concerning the Company's results of operations for fourth quarter 2010 will be provided in the Company's Form 10-K filing, to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission by March 13, 2011.
Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement the consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), the Company has included the following non-GAAP financial measures in this press release or in the webcast to discuss the Company's financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year which may be accessed via the Company's website at http://www.bjsrestaurants.com: (i) non-GAAP net income and (ii) non-GAAP basic and diluted net income per share. Each of these non-GAAP financial measures is adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain expenses and gains. As a general matter, the Company uses these non-GAAP measures in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. Among other things, the Company uses such non-GAAP financial measures in addition to and in conjunction with corresponding GAAP measures to help analyze the performance of its core business. In addition, the Company believes that such non-GAAP fina ncial information is provided by its competitors and such information is used by analysts and others in the investment community to analyze the Company's results and in formulating estimates of future performance and that failure to report these non-GAAP measures, could result in confusion among analysts and others and a misplaced perception that the Company's results have underperformed or exceeded expectations.
These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the Company's operations that, when viewed with the GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of the Company's results of operations and the factors and trends affecting the Company's business. However, these non-GAAP measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.
For fiscal 2010, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP basic and diluted net income per share excludes the effect of ISO disqualified dispositions and other tax related adjustments. For fiscal 2009, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP basic and diluted net income per share exclude the effects of the loss on ARS investment disposition and the related legal and related expenses. The Company believes that presentation of measures of net income and diluted net income per share that exclude these items assists management and investors in evaluating the period over period performance of the Company's ongoing core business operations because the expenses are either non-cash or non-routine in nature. Furthermore, the Company believes that presentation of a measure of non-GAAP net income and net income per share that excludes such charges is useful to management and investors in evaluating the performance of the Company's ongoing operations on a period-to-period basis and relative to the Company's competitors .

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On July 21, 2011, BJ's Restaurants, Inc., a California corporation (the "Registrant"), announced its financial results for the second quarter ended June 28, 2011. The press release issued by the Registrant in connection with the announcement is attached to this report as Exhibit 99.1. The information in this Form 8-K and Exhibits attached hereto are being furnished and shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
    Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT 99.1
HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif., July 21, 2011 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BJ's Restaurants, Inc. (Nasdaq:BJRI) today reported financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2011 that ended on Tuesday, June 28, 2011.
Highlights for the second quarter, compared to the same quarter last year, were as follows:
Total revenues increased 17% to $152.9 million
Comparable restaurant sales increased 6.9%
Net income increased 29% to $8.2 million
Diluted net income per share increased 22% to $0.28
Results for the second quarter of fiscal 2011 include a pre-tax charge of approximately $1.0 million, or $0.03 per diluted share related to the settlement of certain California employment practices lawsuits that have been outstanding since 2009 and 2010, partially offset by a pre-tax gain of approximately $0.6 million or $0.02 per diluted share, pursuant to the settlement agreement with the Company's broker-dealer for its former auction rate securities portfolio that was fully liquidated in December 2009. Under the terms of that settlement agreement, the Company is entitled to potential future recoveries of its loss on that portfolio based on the performance of the securities through December 2012. During the second quarter of 2011, certain of those securities were redeemed at par, thus resulting in additional cash recoveries for the Company. Excluding the impact of these two aforementioned items on a non-GAAP basis, net income and net income per diluted share for the second quarter of 2011 was $8.5 million and $0.29, respectively. A reconciliation between GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP financial measures is included in the accompanying financial data.
"Our leadership team was pleased with our strong top-line and bottom-line performance during the second quarter of 2011," commented Jerry Deitchle, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Our focus on providing a higher quality, more differentiated dining experience with broad consumer approachability continues to resonate with our guests, as evidenced by our strong comparable sales increase of 6.9% for the quarter, which successfully hurdled a solid 5.3% increase for the same quarter last year. During the second quarter, we introduced our highly successful, lower calorie Enlightened Entrees menu offerings and continued implementing our seating efficiency, expanded beer taps and other initiatives that provide us with opportunities to further improve our sales productivity and operational efficiency. Furthermore, our restaurant operations team continues to achieve increased leverage within the four walls of our restaurants. Compared to the same quarter last year, our estimated four-wall restaurant level operating cash flow margin increased by 90 basis points to 20.9%. One of the most difficult challenges executing any new restaurant development plan is to preserve the concept's initial favorable unit economics as it expands further away from its home base.   At BJ's, we continue to demonstrate our ability to grow from a small regional California restaurant company into a national restaurant company while preserving and expanding our four-wall restaurant level margins. With only 108 restaurants open today in 13 states, we continue to believe that BJ's best years are still well ahead of us."
As of the end of the second quarter 2011, the Company has successfully opened five new restaurants of which three new restaurants opened during the second quarter (Austin, Texas; Las Vegas, Nevada; and Century City, California). "Sales for our new restaurants continue to exceed our initial expectations, and we remain on track to achieve our stated goal to open as many as 12 to 13 new restaurants this year," said Deitchle. The Company currently expects to open as many as four new restaurants in the third quarter, of which one has already opened in College Station, Texas, and as many as three to four new restaurants in the fourth quarter of this year. Investors are reminded that the actual number and timing of new restaurant openings is subject to a number of factors outside of the Company's control, including weather conditions and factors under the control of landlords, contractors and regulatory/licensing authorities.
Investor Conference Call and Webcast

Certain statements in the preceding paragraphs and all other statements that are not purely historical constitute "forward-looking" statements for purposes of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are intended to be covered by the safe harbors created thereby. Such statements include, but are not limited to, those regarding expected comparable restaurant sales growth in future periods, those regarding the effect of new sales-building initiatives and future guest traffic, as well as those regarding the number of restaurants expected to be opened in future periods and the timing and location of such openings. These "forward-looking" statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause actual results to be materially different from those projected or anticipated. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to: (i) the effect of credit and equity market disruptions on our ability to finance our continued expansion on acceptable terms, (ii) our ability to manage an increasing number of new restaurant openings, (iii) construction delays, (iv) labor shortages, (v) minimum wage increases, (vi) food quality and health concerns, (vii) factors that impact California, where 53 of our current 108 restaurants are located, (viii) restaurant and brewery industry competition, (ix) impact of certain brewery business considerations, including without limitation, dependence upon suppliers, third party contractors and related hazards, (x) consumer spending trends in general for casual dining occasions, (xi) potential uninsured losses and liabilities, (xii) fluctuating commodity costs and availability of food in general and certain raw materials related to the brewing of our handcrafted beers and energy, (xiii) trademark and service-mark risks, (xiv) government regulations, (xv) licensing costs, (xvi) beer and liquor regulations, (xvii) loss of key personnel, (xviii) inability to secure acceptable sites, (xix) limitations on insurance coverage, (xx) legal proceedings, (xxi) other general economic and regulatory conditions and requirements, (xxii) the success of our key sales-building and related operational initiatives and (xxiii) numerous other matters discussed in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. BJ's Restaurants, Inc. undertakes no obligation to update or alter its "forward-looking" statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
Reconciliation of Selected GAAP Financial Measures to Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement the consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), the Company has included the following non-GAAP financial measures in this press release or in the webcast to discuss the Company's financial results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2011 which may be accessed via the Company's website at http://www.bjsrestaurants.com: (i) non-GAAP net income and (ii) non-GAAP basic and diluted net income per share. Each of these non-GAAP financial measures is adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain expenses and gains. As a general matter, the Company uses these non-GAAP measures in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. Among other things, the Company uses such non-GAAP financial measures in addition to and in conjunction with corresponding GAAP measures to help analyze the performance of its core business. In addition, the Company believes that such non-GAAP financial information is provided by its competitors and such information is used by analysts and others in the investment community to analyze the Company's results and in formulating estimates of future performance and that failure to report these non-GAAP measures, could result in confusion among analysts and others and a misplaced perception that the Company's results have underperformed or exceeded expectations.
These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the Company's operations that, when viewed with the GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of the Company's results of operations and the factors and trends affecting the Company's business. However, these non-GAAP measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.
For the thirteen weeks and twenty-six weeks ended June 28, 2011, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP basic and diluted net income per share excludes the effect from the settlement of certain California employment practices lawsuits and the gain pursuant to the settlement agreement with the Company's broker-dealer for its former auction rate securities portfolio that was fully liquidated in December 2009. The Company believes that presentation of measures of net income and diluted net income per share that exclude these items assists management and investors in evaluating the period over period performance of the Company's ongoing core business operations because these items are non-routine in nature. Furthermore, the Company believes that presentation of a measure of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share that excludes such items is useful to management and investors in evaluating the performance of the Company's ongoing operations on a period-to-period basis and relative to the Company's competitors.

Our new restaurant in Dublin joins our two other successful restaurants in Ohio at the Polaris Mall in Columbus and at the Tri County Mall in Cincinnati. Initial sales for both new restaurants exceeded our expectations. The opening of these two new restaurants represents our ninth and tenth new restaurants to date during 2011. We have successfully opened four new operationally complex BJ's restaurants during the past 30 days, which is a strong testament to the capabilities of our restaurant development and operations teams. We currently expect to open two to three more restaurants this year and thereby achieve our stated goal to increase our total restaurant operating weeks by 11% to 12% during 2011."

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On October 20, 2011, BJ's Restaurants, Inc., a California corporation (the "Registrant"), announced its financial results for the third quarter ended September 27, 2011. The press release issued by the Registrant in connection with the announcement is attached to this report as Exhibit 99.1. The information in this Form 8-K and Exhibits attached hereto are being furnished and shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
    Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT 99.1
HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif., Oct. 20, 2011 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BJ's Restaurants, Inc. (Nasdaq:BJRI) today reported financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2011 that ended on Tuesday, September 27, 2011.
Highlights for the third quarter, compared to the same quarter last year, were as follows:
Total revenues increased 17.6% to $151 million
Comparable restaurant sales increased 6.5%
Net income increased 14.3% to $6.3 million
Diluted net income per share increased 10% to $0.22
Results for the third quarter of fiscal 2011 include a pre-tax charge of approximately $1.0 million, or approximately $0.02 per diluted share on an after-tax basis, related to the estimated cost to settle a California employment practices class action lawsuit that has been outstanding since fiscal 2009. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding the impact of this cost, net income and net income per diluted share for the third quarter of 2011 were $7.1 million and $0.24, respectively.  A reconciliation between selected GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP financial measures is included in the accompanying financial data.
"Our leadership team is pleased to deliver yet another quarter of solid increases in BJ's comparable restaurant sales, total revenues and earnings," said Jerry Deitchle, Chairman and CEO. "Our 6.5% comparable restaurant sales increase for the quarter successfully hurdled our 6.7% comparable sales increase in last year's third quarter, which is an impressive accomplishment for any casual dining restaurant company in this difficult operating environment. We continue working very hard offering consumers a higher quality, more contemporary and differentiated casual dining experience with greater energy, relevance and value compared to most of our competitors. Additionally, we will continue to prudently invest in our menu offerings, restaurant management talent base, technology and facilities with the goal to further improve our four-wall sales productivity and operating efficiency. While we believe BJ's has achieved some solid success in each of those respects in recent years, we have much more yet to accomplish."
Four new restaurants were opened during the third quarter of 2011 (College Station, TX; Jacksonville, FL; Pembroke Pines, FL; Brentwood, CA). The Company currently anticipates opening four new restaurants during the fourth quarter before Thanksgiving, of which two have already opened in Dublin, Ohio, at the Tuttle Creek Mall and in Rancho Santa Margarita, California. By doing so, the Company will achieve its stated goal to open as many as 13 new restaurants during fiscal 2011 and its targeted increase in total restaurant operating weeks for the year. "To date, we remain very pleased with the initial sales volumes of all of our 2011 new restaurants," commented Deitchle.
Based on the current status of the Company's new restaurant development pipeline, as many as 15 new restaurants are currently planned to open during fiscal 2012. Additionally, the Company currently expects to relocate one of its older, smaller-format "Pizza and Grill" restaurants to a new location as a larger-format "Brewhouse" prototype restaurant next year, thus more than doubling its square footage.  "With our potential 2012 new restaurant locations identified, our outstanding development team is now focusing on building a solid pipeline for potential 2013 and 2014 restaurant openings," said Deitchle. "At the end of this year, we will only have 115 restaurants open in 13 states, and we believe there are many years of high quality, profitable expansion for the BJ's concept ahead of us." Investors are reminded that the actual number and timing of new restaurant openings is subject to a number of factors outside of the Company's control, including weather conditions and factors under the control of landlords, contractors and regulatory/licensing authorities.

BJ's Restaurants, Inc. will conduct a conference call on its third quarter earnings release today, October 20, 2011, at 2:00 p.m. (Pacific Time).

BJ's Restaurants, Inc. undertakes no obligation to update or alter its "forward-looking" statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
Reconciliation of Selected GAAP Financial Measures to Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement the consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), the Company has included the following non-GAAP financial measures in this press release or in the webcast to discuss the Company's financial results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2011 which may be accessed via the Company's website at http://www.bjsrestaurants.com: (i) non-GAAP net income and (ii) non-GAAP basic and diluted net income per share. Each of these non-GAAP financial measures is adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain expenses and gains. As a general matter, the Company uses these non-GAAP measures in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. Among other things, the Company uses such non-GAAP financial measures in addition to and in conjunction with corresponding GAAP measures to help analyze the performance of its core business. In addition, the Company believes that such non-GAAP financial information is provided by its competitors and such information is used by analysts and others in the investment community to analyze the Company's results and in formulating estimates of future performance and that failure to report these non-GAAP measures could result in confusion among analysts and others and a misplaced perception that the Company's results have underperformed or exceeded expectations.
These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the Company's operations that, when viewed with the GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of the Company's results of operations and the factors and trends affecting the Company's business. However, these non-GAAP measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.
For the thirteen weeks ended September 27, 2011, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP basic and diluted net income per share excludes the effect from the settlement of a California employment practices class action lawsuit. For the thirty-nine weeks ended September 27, 2011, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP basic and diluted net income per share excludes the effect from the settlement of certain California employment practices lawsuits and the gain pursuant to the settlement agreement with the Company's broker-dealer for its former auction rate securities portfolio that was fully liquidated in December 2009. The Company believes that presentation of measures of net income and diluted net income per share that exclude these items assists management and investors in evaluating the period-over-period performance of the Company's ongoing core business operations because these items are generally considered non-routine in nature. Furthermore, the Company believes that presentation of a measure of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share that excludes such items is useful to management and investors in evaluating the performance of the Company's ongoing operations on a period-to-period basis and relative to the Company's competitors.

"BJ's is looking forward to another successful year of expansion during 2012," continued Deitchle. "We currently plan to open as many as 15 new restaurants next year, and we also plan to relocate one older restaurant to a new location that can accommodate a larger, more productive facility. We continue to believe that BJ's will be one of just a few publicly-held casual dining restaurant companies that plans to achieve double-digit capacity growth during 2012 in terms of total restaurant operating weeks." Investors are reminded that the actual number and timing of new restaurant openings for any given period is subject to a number of factors outside of the Company's control, including weather conditions and factors under the control of landlords, contractors and regulatory/licensing authorities

Majority Voting Policy for Directors in Uncontested Elections
On December 14, 2011, the Board of Directors of BJ's Restaurants, Inc. (the "Company") adopted a Majority Voting Policy which provides for majority voting for directors in uncontested elections (the "Policy").
Pursuant to the Policy, any incumbent director nominee who receives a greater number of votes "against" his or her election than votes "for" such election at an annual meeting shall tender his or her resignation within 15 days of the final vote. The Policy will only apply to uncontested elections of directors.
The Board, within ninety (90) days of receiving the certified voting results pertaining to the election, will decide whether to accept the resignation of any unsuccessful incumbent, or whether other action should be taken, through a process managed by the Governance and Nominating Committee. In reaching its decision, the Board may consider any factors it deems relevant, including the director's qualifications, the director's past and expected future contributions to the Company, the overall composition of the Board, and whether accepting the tendered resignation would cause the Company to fail to meet any applicable rule or regulation, including Nasdaq listing standards. The Board promptly will disclose the decision whether to accept the director's resignation offer (and the reasons for rejecting the resignation, if applicable) in a document filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
This description of the Policy is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual Policy, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
The Board of Directors (the "Board") of BJ's Restaurants, Inc., a California corporation (the "Company") has adopted the following policy with respect to the election of directors:
1. In any uncontested election of directors (i.e., those where the number of nominees is the same as the number of directors to be elected) held at an annual meeting of shareholders at which a quorum is present, each incumbent director nominee who receives a greater number of votes "against" his or her election than votes "for" such election shall tender his or her resignation within fifteen (15) days of the Company's receipt of certified voting results pertaining to the election. For these purposes "abstentions" or "broker non-votes" will not count as votes cast with respect to that director.
2. If the number of nominees for any election of directors nominated by (i) the Board, (ii) any shareholder, or (iii) a combination of nominees by the Board and any shareholder, exceeds the number of directors to be elected, the nominees receiving a plurality of the votes cast by holders of shares entitled to vote in the election at a meeting at which a quorum is present will be elected.
3. The Board, within ninety (90) days of receiving the certified voting results pertaining to the election, will decide whether to accept the resignation of any unsuccessful incumbent, or whether other action should be taken, through a process managed by the Governance and Nominating Committee. Consideration of resignations shall exclude the director(s) in question; provided, however, if such exclusion results in less than two directors remaining, then all directors may participate in the decision whether to accept such resignations. In reaching its decision, the Board may consider any factors it deems relevant, including the director's qualifications, the director's past and expected future contributions to the Company, the overall composition of the Board and whether accepting the tendered resignation would cause the Company to fail to meet any applicable rule or regulation, including Nasdaq listing standards.
4. The Board promptly will disclose the decision whether to accept the director's resignation offer (and the reasons for rejecting the resignation, if applicable) in a document filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
5. Unless otherwise determined by the Board, any accepted resignation shall be effective when such director's successor is elected and qualified or upon such director's earlier resignation or removal.
6. The Board may implement such policies and procedures to effect this Majority Voting Policy as it deems appropriate, including requiring that director nominees in uncontested elections submit an irrevocable letter of resignation, contingent on (i) that person not receiving more votes "for" than "against" at the applicable annual meeting of shareholders, and (ii) acceptance of that resignation by the Board.
7. This Majority Voting Policy constitutes a general policy of the Board with respect to uncontested director elections and shall not constitute or be deemed an amendment or modification of the Bylaws of the Company that would be subject to Section 708.5 of the California Corporations Code.

th
The Company also reported preliminary, unaudited revenues of $171.8 million for the 14-week fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 that ended on Tuesday, January 3, 2012, representing an increase of approximately 29% when compared to the 13-week fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 that ended on Tuesday, December 28, 2010. Excluding the additional 14 week of sales from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, the Company's preliminary, unaudited revenues increased approximately 19% to $157.9 million compared to the same quarter last year. On a 13-week comparison ending Tuesday, December 27, 2011, comparable restaurant sales increased approximately 5.1%, successfully hurdling a 5.9% increase for the same quarter last year.

"Our leadership team was very pleased with our continued top-line sales momentum for both the fourth quarter and full fiscal year of 2011," said Jerry Deitchle, Chairman and CEO. "We achieved solid increases in comparable restaurant sales for both the fourth quarter and full year, thereby surpassing the impressive increases that we also attained in the same periods of 2010. We believe that BJ's is one of only a few public casual dining restaurant companies that has achieved a cumulative two-year comparable restaurant sales increase of over 12%, in spite of the continuing challenging economic environment for consumer discretionary spending on casual dining restaurant occasions in general. While we are pleased with our top line sales performance, we still believe that we have opportunities to further increase our overall sales productivity and to further strengthen the quality, differentiation and value of the BJ's restaurant concept as we move forward during 2012." 
During the fourth quarter and full fiscal year of 2011, the Company successfully opened four and thirteen new BJ's restaurants, respectively. "We continue to remain confident in our ability to deliver high quality, low double-digit capacity growth during both 2012 and 2013, as measured in total restaurant operating weeks," said Deitchle. "We currently plan to open as many as 15 new restaurants during 2012, and we also plan to relocate one of our older, small-format 'Pizza and Grill' restaurants to a new location and reopen it as a large-format, more productive  'Brewhouse' restaurant. All of our potential new locations for 2012 have been identified, and six new restaurants have already commenced construction. Additionally, our new restaurant pipeline for 2013 is already firming up." Investors are reminded that the actual number and timing of new restaurant openings for any given period is subject to a number of factors outside of the Company's control, including weather conditions and factors under the control of landlords, contractors and regulatory/licensing authorities.

EXHIBIT 99.1
HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif., Feb. 16, 2012 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BJ's Restaurants, Inc. (Nasdaq:BJRI) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year of 2011 that ended on Tuesday, January 3, 2012. The results for both the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended January 3, 2012 included one additional operating week as compared to the same periods of fiscal 2010. 
Highlights for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, compared to the same quarter last year, were as follows: 
Total revenues increased 29% to $171.8 million (14 weeks vs. 13 weeks)
Comparable restaurant sales increased 5.1% (13 weeks vs. 13 weeks)
Net income increased 42% to $9.9 million (14 weeks vs. 13 weeks)
Diluted net income per share increased 42% to $0.34 (14 weeks vs. 13 weeks)
Total restaurant operating weeks increased approximately 21% (14 weeks vs. 13 weeks) 
Results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 included an after-tax benefit of approximately $0.7 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, primarily due to a favorable tax rate adjustment associated with disqualifying dispositions related to incentive stock options ("ISO"). Excluding this item from fiscal 2010's fourth quarter results, net income and diluted net income per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 would have increased by 58% and 55%, respectively, compared to non-GAAP adjusted results for the same quarter last year. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP adjusted financial measures is included in the accompanying financial data.
Highlights for the fiscal year 2011, compared to fiscal year 2010, were as follows: 
Total revenues increased 21% to $620.9 million (53 weeks vs. 52 weeks)
Comparable restaurant sales increased 6.6% (52 weeks vs. 52 weeks)
Net income increased 36% to $31.6 million (53 weeks vs. 52 weeks)
Diluted net income per share increased 32% to $1.08 (53 weeks vs. 52 weeks)
Total restaurant operating weeks increased approximately 13% (53 weeks vs. 52 weeks) 
Results for fiscal year 2011 include a pre-tax charge of approximately $2.0 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, related to the estimated costs to settle certain California employment practices lawsuits, partially offset by a pre-tax gain of approximately $0.6 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, pursuant to the settlement agreement with the Company's former broker-dealer related to the liquidation of its auction rate securities portfolio in December 2009. Under the terms of that settlement agreement, the Company is entitled to potential future recoveries of its loss on that portfolio based on the performance of the securities through December 2012. During fiscal year 2011, certain of those securities were redeemed at par resulting in additional cash recoveries for the Company. Excluding all of the aforementioned items for fiscal 2011, on a non-GAAP adjusted basis, net income and net income per diluted share for fiscal year 2011 were $32.6 million and $1.12, respectively.
"We were very pleased with BJ's strong financial results for both the fourth quarter and full year of fiscal 2011," commented Jerry Deitchle, Chairman and CEO. "Our 5.1% increase in comparable restaurant sales for the fourth quarter of 2011 was our eighth consecutive quarter of comparable sales increases. For the full fiscal year of 2011, BJ's achieved a 6.6% increase in comparable restaurant sales, successfully hurdling a strong 5.6% increase in comparable restaurant sales for fiscal 2010. Our restaurant operators continue to do an excellent job of simultaneously building sales, improving the overall quality of the BJ's dining experience for our guests and preserving our high quality four-wall restaurant operating margins."
Four new restaurants were opened during the fourth quarter of 2011 (Dublin, OH; Rancho Santa Margarita, CA; Fort Worth, TX; and Anaheim Hills, CA). As a result, the Company fully attained its stated expansion goal for fiscal 2011 by opening a total of 13 new restaurants and achieving a double-digit increase in total restaurant operating weeks during the year. "We were especially pleased that our new restaurant openings created almost 2,000 new jobs for America last year, and we expect to create at least that many during 2012," said Deitchle. As previously announced, the Company currently expects to open as many as 16 new restaurants during 2012, of which one will be a relocation of an existing, small-format "BJ's Pizza & Grill" restaurant to a new, large-format "BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse" location. One new restaurant opening is currently planned for the first quarter of 2012 (Clearwater, FL). As of this date, the Company expects to open as many as five new restaurants in the second quarter, five new restaurants (including the one planned relocation) in the third quarter and five new restaurants during the fourth quarter. "With only 115 restaurants open at the end of fiscal 2011, we believe that we have a significant opportunity to continue our national expansion in a careful, controlled manner and continue gaining market share in the estimated $100+ billion casual dining segment," commented Deitchle. Investors are reminded that the actual number and timing of new restaurant openings is subject to a number of factors outside of the Company's control including, but not limited to, weather conditions and factors under the control of landlords, contractors and regulatory/licensing authorities.

Certain statements in the preceding paragraphs and all other statements that are not purely historical constitute "forward-looking" statements for purposes of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are intended to be covered by the safe harbors created thereby. Such statements include, but are not limited to, those regarding expected comparable restaurant sales growth in future periods, the success of various sales-building and productivity initiatives, future guest traffic trends and the number and timing of new restaurants expected to be opened in future periods. These "forward-looking" statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause actual results to be materially different from those projected or anticipated. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to: (i) the effect of credit and equity market disruptions on our ability to finance our continued expansion on acceptable terms, (ii) our ability to manage an increasing number of new restaurant openings, (iii) construction delays, (iv) labor shortages, (v) increase in minimum wage and other employment related costs, (vi) food quality and health concerns, (vii) factors that impact California, where 56 of our current 115 restaurants are located, (viii) restaurant and brewery industry competition, (ix) impact of certain brewery business considerations, including without limitation, dependence upon suppliers, third party contractors and related hazards, (x) consumer spending trends in general for casual dining occasions, (xi) potential uninsured losses and liabilities, (xii) fluctuating commodity costs and availability of food in general and certain raw materials related to the brewing of our handcrafted beers and energy, (xiii) trademark and service-mark risks, (xiv) government regulations, (xv) licensing costs, (xvi) beer and liquor regulations, (xvii) loss of key personnel, (xviii) inability to secure acceptable sites, (xix) limitations on insurance coverage, (xx) legal proceedings, (xxi) other general economic and regulatory conditions and requirements, (xxii) the success of our key sales-building and related operational initiatives and (xxiii) numerous other matters discussed in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its recent reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K. The "forward-looking" statements contained in this press release are based on current assumptions and expectations and BJ's Restaurants, Inc. undertakes no obligation to update or alter its "forward-looking" statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
Reconciliation of Selected GAAP Financial Measures to Non-GAAP Adjusted Financial Measures
To supplement the consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), the Company has included the following non-GAAP adjusted financial measures in this press release or in the webcast to discuss the Company's financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011 which may be accessed via the Company's website at http://www.bjsrestaurants.com: (i) non-GAAP adjusted net income and (ii) non-GAAP adjusted basic and diluted net income per share. Each of these non-GAAP adjusted financial measures is adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain expenses and gains. As a general matter, the Company uses these non-GAAP adjusted financial measures in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. Among other things, the Company uses such non-GAAP adjusted financial measures in addition to and in conjunction with corresponding GAAP measures to help analyze the performance of its core business. In addition, the Company believes that such non-GAAP adjusted financial information is provided by its competitors and such information is used by analysts and others in the investment community to analyze the Company's results and in formulating estimates of future performance and that failure to report these non-GAAP adjusted measures could result in confusion among analysts and others and a misplaced perception that the Company's results have underperformed or exceeded expectations.
These non-GAAP adjusted financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the Company's operations that, when viewed with the GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of the Company's results of operations and the factors and trends affecting the Company's business. However, these non-GAAP adjusted financial measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.
For fiscal 2011, non-GAAP adjusted net income and non-GAAP adjusted basic and diluted net income per share excludes the effect from the settlement of certain California employment practices lawsuits and the gain pursuant to the settlement agreement with the Company's broker-dealer for its former auction rate securities portfolio that was fully liquidated in December 2009. For fiscal 2010, non-GAAP adjusted net income and non-GAAP adjusted basic and diluted net income per share excludes the effect of ISO disqualified dispositions and other tax related adjustments. The Company believes that presentation of measures of net income and diluted net income per share that exclude these items assists management and investors in evaluating the period-over-period performance of the Company's ongoing core business operations because these items are generally considered non-routine in nature. Furthermore, the Company believes that presentation of a measure of non-GAAP adjusted net income and non-GAAP adjusted basic and diluted net income per share that excludes such items is useful to management and investors in evaluating the performance of the Company's ongoing operations on a period-to-period basis and relative to the Company's competitors.

Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Item 1.01. Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement
On February 17, 2012, BJ's Restaurants, Inc. (the "Company") entered into a Credit Agreement with Bank of America, N.A. ("BofA") pursuant to which the Company established a $75,000,000 unsecured revolving line of credit (the "Line of Credit"). The Line of Credit may be increased to $100,000,000 at the Company's election upon satisfaction of certain criteria. The Line of Credit is guaranteed by the Company's subsidiaries and may be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes. While the Company is not obligated to utilize the Line of Credit, it is expected that the Line of Credit will be used primarily for the issuance of letters of credit in connection with the Company's insurance programs. The Line of Credit replaces and supersedes the Company's Loan Agreement, dated as of October 17, 2007, with BofA, as amended by that certain Amendment No. 1 to Loan Agreement dated as of March 18, 2008 (the "Prior Line of Credit") which provided for a $45,000,000 unsecured line of credit. In connection with the establishment of the Line of Credit, outstanding letters of credit issued under the Company's Prior Line of Credit were reissued under the Line of Credit.
Borrowings under the Line of Credit bear interest at a either LIBOR plus a percentage not to exceed 1.50% or at a rate ranging from BofA's Prime Rate to 0.75% below BofA's Prime Rate depending on the level of lease and debt obligations of the Company as compared to EBITDA. Pursuant to the Line of Credit, the Company will be required to pay certain customary fees and expenses associated with maintenance and use of the Line of Credit including letter of credit issuance fees and unused commitment fees. Interest on the Line of Credit is payable monthly and the Line of Credit expires, and all borrowings thereunder must be repaid on or before, January 31, 2017.
The Line of Credit contains certain representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default that are customary for credit arrangements of this type, including covenants which restrict the Company's ability to, among other things, create liens, borrow money (other than purchase money indebtedness and trade credit, lease obligations incurred in the ordinary course, and similar ordinary course liabilities) and engage in mergers, consolidations, significant asset sales and certain other transactions. The Company also agreed to maintain specified fixed charge coverage and overall debt ratios.
Item 1.02 Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement.
In connection with the Company entering into the Line of Credit, the Company terminated the Prior Line of Credit as described in Item 1.01 above which is incorporated herein by this reference. The terms of the Prior Line of Credit are generally described in Item 1.01 of the Company's Form 8-K filed on March 18, 2008 and incorporated herein by this reference.
Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant
See the description contained in Item 1.01 above which is incorporated herein by this reference.

The press release issued by the Registrant in connection with the announcement is attached to this report as Exhibit 99.1. The information in this Form 8-K and Exhibits attached hereto are being furnished and shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.

EXHIBIT 99.1
HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif., April 26, 2012 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BJ's Restaurants, Inc. (Nasdaq:BJRI) today reported financial results for its first quarter of fiscal 2012 that ended on Tuesday, April 3, 2012.
Highlights for the first quarter of fiscal 2012, compared to the same quarter last year, were as follows:
Total revenues increased 16% to $167.6 million
Comparable restaurant sales increased 3.3%, successfully hurdling last year's 7.8% increase
Net income increased 20% to $8.6 million
Diluted net income per share increased 20% to $0.30
Two new restaurants opened during the quarter
Total restaurant operating weeks increased approximately 13%
"Our leadership team was very pleased with our solid financial results for the first quarter," commented Jerry Deitchle, Chairman and CEO. "Our double-digit increase in total revenues was the result of the continued successful execution of our new restaurant expansion program in a high quality manner, coupled with our ninth consecutive quarter of growth in comparable restaurant sales. Our 3.3% increase in comparable restaurant sales was attributable to the steadily increasing popularity of the BJ's restaurant concept with consumers, combined with the productive and efficient execution of the concept by our restaurant operators in driving guest traffic during the quarter.  It is also noteworthy that our solid comparable restaurant sales increase was achieved despite not having the favorable winter weather comparison experienced by many other national restaurant concepts during the quarter.  Looking forward to the next couple of quarters, we are very excited about the rollout of several sales-building initiatives planned for 2012 including our new menu update in May, which includes some innovative new entrees and other items, and our state-of-the-art guest loyalty program in July.  Additionally, we are excited about the upcoming test of BJ's first television advertising flight in the Sacramento, California market in May."
During the first quarter of fiscal 2012, the Company successfully opened two new restaurants in Clearwater, Florida and Salinas, California. "Our 2012 new restaurant development pipeline remains in excellent shape as of today, and we are now focusing on building a solid pipeline of high quality locations for potential 2013 and 2014 restaurant openings," said Deitchle. As of this date, as many as five new restaurants are expected to open during the second quarter (one of which has already opened in Dublin, California), as many as six new restaurants during the third quarter (including a planned relocation of an existing smaller-format restaurant) and as many as three new restaurants during the fourth quarter. Investors are reminded that the actual number and timing of new restaurant openings is subject to a number of factors outside of the Company's control, including weather conditions and factors under the control of landlords, contractors and regulatory/licensing authorities.
"With only 118 restaurants open to date, BJ's has a long runway of domestic expansion ahead," commented Deitchle. "We continue to achieve steady market share gains in the estimated $100+ billion casual dining industry, thanks largely to the consistent, successful execution of our national expansion plan in a high quality, predictable and leverageable manner year after year. As we look forward, most of BJ's expected market share gain will come from our new restaurant expansion. We believe that BJ's is one of just a few public casual dining restaurant companies that plans to increase its annual capacity in the double-digit range during the upcoming years."

HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif., June 6, 2012 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BJ's Restaurants, Inc. (Nasdaq:BJRI) held its annual meeting of shareholders on Tuesday, June 5, 2012. Shareholders re-elected Gerald W. Deitchle, Peter A. Bassi, Larry D. Bouts, James A. Dal Pozzo, Henry Gomez, John F. Grundhofer, William L. Hyde, Jr., J. Roger King and Lea Anne S.

"Today, BJ's share of the estimated $100+ billion domestic casual dining market is still less than 1%, so the vast majority of our growth remains well ahead of us. The competitive positioning of BJ's as a higher quality, more differentiated restaurant concept with contemporary energy and relevance, coupled with our quality signature food and beverage offerings at moderate prices provide us with a strong engine for further market share gains. We will continue to execute BJ's national expansion plan at a steady, carefully controlled pace that maximizes the quality, predictability and leverage of our brand and our business model.

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On July 26, 2012, BJ's Restaurants, Inc., a California corporation (the "Registrant"), announced its financial results for the second quarter ended July 3, 2012. The press release issued by the Registrant in connection with the announcement is attached to this report as Exhibit 99.1. The information in this Form 8-K and Exhibits attached hereto are being furnished and shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
    Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT 99.1
HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif., July 26, 2012 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BJ's Restaurants, Inc. (Nasdaq:BJRI) today reported financial results for its second quarter of fiscal 2012 that ended on Tuesday, July 3, 2012.
Highlights for the second quarter of fiscal 2012, compared to the same quarter last year, were as follows: 
Total revenues increased 18% to $180.7 million
Comparable restaurant sales increased 4.4%, successfully hurdling a 6.9% increase for the same quarter last year
Net income increased approximately 10% to $9.0 million and diluted net income per share increased 11% to $0.31
On a non-GAAP adjusted basis, excluding certain charges and gains described below and in the reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP adjusted financial measures included in the accompanying financial data, net income and diluted net income per share were $9.2 million and $0.32, respectively
Five new restaurants opened during the second quarter
Total restaurant operating weeks increased approximately 14% 
Results for the second quarter of fiscal 2012 include pre-tax charges totaling approximately $0.7 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, related to the estimated cost to settle a trademark infringement lawsuit and the write off of the remaining net book value of assets related to the upcoming closure of our small-format "pizza and grill" restaurant in Boulder, Colorado, and its relocation to a new site in Boulder that can support a more productive, larger-format BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse. These costs were partially offset by a pre-tax gain of approximately $0.3 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, pursuant to the settlement agreement with the Company's former broker-dealer related to the liquidation of its auction rate securities portfolio in December 2009. Under the terms of that settlement agreement, the Company is entitled to potential future recoveries of its loss on that portfolio based on the performance of the securities through December 2012. During the second quarter of fiscal 2012, certain of those securities were redeemed at par resulting in additional cash recoveries for the Company.
"Our leadership team was very pleased to deliver yet another quarter of double digit increases in revenues and earnings," said Jerry Deitchle, Chairman and CEO. "BJ's continues to be a steady market share taker in the estimated $100+ billion casual dining segment of the restaurant industry, driven primarily by our continuing successful new restaurant expansion program and coupled with comparable restaurant sales increases. Our 4.4% increase in comparable restaurant sales represented our tenth consecutive quarter of increases on that metric. At BJ's we are sales builders first and foremost, and we intend to continue executing our planned sales building initiatives while, at the same time, working effectively to preserve our current high quality four-wall restaurant operating margins as we execute our national expansion plan."
As of the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2012, the Company has successfully opened seven new restaurants, of which five were opened during the second quarter (Waco, Texas; Round Rock, Texas; New Braunfels, Texas; Santa Rosa, California; and Dublin, California).  The Company currently expects to open as many as five new restaurants during the third quarter (including our most recent opening in Wichita, Kansas and our upcoming relocation of our Boulder, Colorado restaurant) and as many as four new restaurants during the fourth quarter.  "Our new restaurant development pipeline for the remainder of 2012 is in excellent shape and our development team is well underway in building a solid pipeline of high quality locations for potential 2013 and 2014 restaurant openings," said Deitchle. "With only 123 restaurants open to date, and with estimated room for at least 425 large-format BJ's restaurants domestically, we believe that the majority of our growth remains well ahead of us." Investors are reminded that the actual number and timing of new restaurant openings are subject to a number of factors outside of the Company's control, including weather conditions and factors under the control of landlords, contractors and regulatory/licensing authorities.
Investor Conference Call and Webcast
BJ's Restaurants, Inc. will conduct a conference call on its second quarter of fiscal 2012 earnings release today, July 26, 2012, at 2:00 p.m. (Pacific Time).

Certain statements in the preceding paragraphs and all other statements that are not purely historical constitute "forward-looking" statements for purposes of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are intended to be covered by the safe harbors created thereby. Such statements include, but are not limited to, those regarding expected comparable restaurant sales growth in future periods, total potential domestic capacity, the success of various sales-building and productivity initiatives, future guest traffic trends and the number and timing of new restaurants expected to be opened in future periods. These "forward-looking" statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause actual results to be materially different from those projected or anticipated. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to: (i) the effect of credit and equity market disruptions on our ability to finance our continued expansion on acceptable terms, (ii) our ability to manage an increasing number of new restaurant openings, (iii) construction delays, (iv) labor shortages, (v) increase in minimum wage and other employment related costs, (vi) food quality and health concerns, (vii) factors that impact California, where 59 of our current 123 restaurants are located, (viii) restaurant and brewery industry competition, (ix) impact of certain brewery business considerations, including without limitation, dependence upon suppliers, third party contractors and related hazards, (x) consumer spending trends in general for casual dining occasions, (xi) potential uninsured losses and liabilities, (xii) fluctuating commodity costs and availability of food in general and certain raw materials related to the brewing of our handcrafted beers and energy, (xiii) trademark and service-mark risks, (xiv) government regulations, (xv) licensing costs, (xvi) beer and liquor regulations, (xvii) loss of key personnel, (xviii) inability to secure acceptable sites, (xix) limitations on insurance coverage, (xx) legal proceedings, (xxi) other general economic and regulatory conditions and requirements, (xxii) the success of our key sales-building and related operational initiatives and (xxiii) numerous other matters discussed in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its recent reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K. The "forward-looking" statements contained in this press release are based on current assumptions and expectations and BJ's Restaurants, Inc. undertakes no obligation to update or alter its "forward-looking" statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 
Reconciliation of Selected GAAP Financial Measures to Non-GAAP Adjusted Financial Measures
To supplement the consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), the Company has included the following non-GAAP adjusted financial measures in this press release or in the webcast to discuss the Company's financial results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2012 which may be accessed via the Company's website at http://www.bjsrestaurants.com: (i) non-GAAP adjusted net income and (ii) non-GAAP adjusted basic and diluted net income per share. Each of these non-GAAP adjusted financial measures is adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain expenses and gains. As a general matter, the Company uses these non-GAAP adjusted financial measures in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. Among other things, the Company uses such non-GAAP adjusted financial measures in addition to and in conjunction with corresponding GAAP measures to help analyze the performance of its core business. The Company believes that such non-GAAP adjusted financial information is provided by its competitors and such information is used by analysts and others in the investment community to analyze the Company's results and in formulating estimates of future performance and that failure to report these non-GAAP adjusted measures could result in confusion among analysts and others and a misplaced perception that the Company's results have underperformed or exceeded expectations.
These non-GAAP adjusted financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the Company's operations that, when viewed with the GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of the Company's results of operations and the factors and trends affecting the Company's business. However, these non-GAAP adjusted financial measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.
For the thirteen and twenty-six weeks ended July 3, 2012, non-GAAP adjusted net income and non-GAAP adjusted basic and diluted net income per share excludes the effect from the settlement of a trademark infringement claim, the loss on disposal of assets related to the upcoming closure of our existing smaller-format restaurant which is being relocated, and a gain pursuant to the settlement agreement with the Company's broker-dealer for its former auction rate securities portfolio that was fully liquidated in December 2009. For the thirteen and twenty-six weeks ended June 28, 2011, non-GAAP adjusted net income and non-GAAP adjusted basic and diluted net income per share excludes the effect from the settlement of certain California employment practices lawsuits and a gain pursuant to the settlement agreement with the Company's broker-dealer for its former auction rate securities portfolio that was fully liquidated in December 2009. The Company believes that presentation of measures of net income and diluted net income per share that exclude these items assist management and investors in evaluating the period-over-period performance of the Company's ongoing core business operations because these items are generally considered non-routine in nature. Furthermore, the Company believes that presentation of a measure of non-GAAP adjusted net income and non-GAAP adjusted basic and diluted net income per share that excludes such items is useful to management and investors in evaluating the performance of the Company's ongoing operations on a period-to-period basis and relative to the Company's competitors.
(1) The tax effect is based on the Company's annual estimated tax rate of 29.3% for the thirteen and twenty-six weeks ended July 3, 2012 and 29.2% for the thirteen and twenty-six weeks ended June 28, 2011.

EXHIBIT 99.1
HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif., Oct. 25, 2012 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BJ's Restaurants, Inc. (Nasdaq:BJRI) today reported financial results for its third quarter of fiscal 2012 that ended on Tuesday, October 2, 2012. 
Highlights for the third quarter of fiscal 2012, compared to the same quarter last year, were as follows:
Total revenues increased approximately 16% to $175.2 million
Total restaurant operating weeks increased 14%
Four new restaurants opened
Comparable restaurant sales increased 2.3%, successfully hurdling a 6.5% increase for the same quarter last year
Net income increased approximately 8% to $6.8 million and diluted net income per share increased 9% to $0.24
Results include expenses of $0.02 per diluted share for loyalty program, pizza upgrade and beer education rollouts 
"Despite the very challenging headwinds that impacted the casual dining segment of the restaurant industry during the September quarter, BJ's delivered another quarter of positive comparable restaurant sales and double-digit revenue increases as we continue to successfully execute our national expansion plan," said Jerry Deitchle, Chairman and CEO. "The summer Olympics, the national political conventions, higher gasoline prices in California and other macro factors were certainly not conducive to driving casual dining guest traffic in general during the quarter.  Nevertheless, BJ's was still able to deliver our 11 consecutive quarter of positive comparable sales increases, thanks to the steadfast popularity of the BJ's restaurant concept with consumers and solid four-wall execution by our restaurant management teams." 
th
"Our results for the September quarter also reflect three investments we made to both preserve and enhance the longer-term competitiveness of the BJ's concept," said Deitchle. "First, we successfully rolled out our new BJ's Premier Rewards guest loyalty program and we are very encouraged with its initial performance. We are now approaching 300,000 enrolled participants in our program, with more signing up every day. Our loyalty program participants currently spend more per visit than our guests do on average, so we continue to have solid confidence in the longer-term sales building advantages of our program. Additionally, we decided to accelerate our regularly scheduled fall menu update to late September this year and focus that update on a complete upgrade of our signature pizza product presentations, including the rollout of a new hand-tossed pizza offering. Since the menu update in late September, our guest purchase incidence rate for pizza has already increased by about 6%, which should benefit margins going forward. We also invested in a new 'BJ's Beer Master' education program during the quarter for our 7,500 hourly servers and bartenders to strengthen their ability to market and sell more of our proprietary craft beer. Our guest purchase incidence rate for beer has also increased by about 4% since the completion of our program. While these investments required up-front costs to develop and roll out, we are confident they all have a solid longer-term return on investment profile and will help further differentiate BJ's from our mass-market casual dining competitors."
As of the end of the third quarter of 2012, the Company has successfully opened 11 new restaurants in 2012, of which four were opened during the third quarter (Wichita, Kansas; Menifee, California; the relocation of its Boulder, Colorado restaurant to a larger, more productive facility; and Hillsboro, Oregon). The Company currently expects to open five new restaurants in the fourth quarter before Thanksgiving, of which two have already opened (in Lubbock, Texas and Doral, Florida), and should thereby achieve its stated goal to open as many as 16 new restaurants during 2012. The Company's new restaurant development pipeline for 2013 currently contemplates the opening of as many as 17 new restaurants, including the relocation of one of its remaining small-format "Pizza and Grill" restaurants in Eugene, Oregon to a new site in Eugene that can accommodate a large-format "Brewhouse" restaurant. "Our new restaurant development pipeline for 2013 is in excellent shape with solid visibility and our development team is well underway in building a solid pipeline of high quality locations for potential 2014 restaurant openings," said Deitchle. "With 127 restaurants currently open in 14 states and with estimated room for at least 425 large-format "Brewhouse" restaurants domestically, we believe that the majority of our growth remains well ahead of us." Investors are reminded that the actual number and timing of new restaurant openings are subject to a number of factors outside of the Company's control, including weather conditions and factors under the control of landlords, contractors and regulatory/licensing authorities.
Investor Conference Call and Webcast
BJ's Restaurants, Inc. will conduct a conference call on its third quarter of fiscal 2012 earnings release today, October 25, 2012, at 2:00 p.m. (Pacific Time).

Certain statements in the preceding paragraphs and all other statements that are not purely historical constitute "forward-looking" statements for purposes of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are intended to be covered by the safe harbors created thereby. Such statements include, but are not limited to, those regarding expected comparable restaurant sales and margin growth in future periods, total potential domestic capacity, the success of various sales-building and productivity initiatives, future guest traffic trends and the number and timing of new restaurants expected to be opened in future periods. These "forward-looking" statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause actual results to be materially different from those projected or anticipated. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to: (i) the effect of credit and equity market disruptions on our ability to finance our continued expansion on acceptable terms, (ii) our ability to manage an increasing number of new restaurant openings, (iii) construction delays, (iv) labor shortages, (v) increase in minimum wage and other employment related costs, (vi) food quality and health concerns, (vii) factors that impact California, where 60 of our current 127 restaurants are located, (viii) restaurant and brewery industry competition, (ix) impact of certain brewery business considerations, including without limitation, dependence upon suppliers, third party contractors and related hazards, (x) consumer spending trends in general for casual dining occasions, (xi) potential uninsured losses and liabilities, (xii) fluctuating commodity costs and availability of food in general and certain raw materials related to the brewing of our handcrafted beers and energy, (xiii) trademark and service-mark risks, (xiv) government regulations, (xv) licensing costs, (xvi) beer and liquor regulations, (xvii) loss of key personnel, (xviii) inability to secure acceptable sites, (xix) limitations on insurance coverage, (xx) legal proceedings, (xxi) other general economic and regulatory conditions and requirements, (xxii) the success of our key sales-building and related operational initiatives and (xxiii) numerous other matters discussed in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its recent reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K. The "forward-looking" statements contained in this press release are based on current assumptions and expectations and BJ's Restaurants, Inc. undertakes no obligation to update or alter its "forward-looking" statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
Reconciliation of Selected GAAP Financial Measures to Non-GAAP Adjusted Financial Measures
To supplement the consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), the Company has included the following non-GAAP adjusted financial measures in this press release or in the webcast to discuss the Company's financial results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2012 which may be accessed via the Company's website at http://www.bjsrestaurants.com: (i) non-GAAP adjusted net income and (ii) non-GAAP adjusted basic and diluted net income per share. Each of these non-GAAP adjusted financial measures is adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain expenses and gains. As a general matter, the Company uses these non-GAAP adjusted financial measures in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. Among other things, the Company uses such non-GAAP adjusted financial measures in addition to and in conjunction with corresponding GAAP measures to help analyze the performance of its core business. The Company believes that such non-GAAP adjusted financial information is provided by its competitors and such information is used by analysts and others in the investment community to analyze the Company's results and in formulating estimates of future performance and that failure to report these non-GAAP adjusted measures could result in confusion among analysts and others and a misplaced perception that the Company's results have underperformed or exceeded expectations.
These non-GAAP adjusted financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the Company's operations that, when viewed with the GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of the Company's results of operations and the factors and trends affecting the Company's business. However, these non-GAAP adjusted financial measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.
For the thirty-nine weeks ended October 2, 2012, non-GAAP adjusted net income and non-GAAP adjusted basic and diluted net income per share exclude the effect from the settlement of a trademark infringement claim, the loss on disposal of assets related to the closure and relocation of the Boulder, Colorado smaller-format "Pizza and Grill" restaurant to a larger format "Brewhouse" restaurant, and a gain pursuant to the settlement agreement with the Company's broker-dealer for its former auction rate securities portfolio that was fully liquidated in December 2009. For the thirteen weeks ended September 27, 2011, non-GAAP adjusted net income and non-GAAP adjusted basic and diluted net income per share exclude the effect from the settlement of a California employment practices class action lawsuit. For the thirty-nine weeks ended September 27, 2011, non-GAAP adjusted net income and non-GAAP adjusted basic and diluted net income per share exclude the effect from the settlement of certain California employment practices lawsuits and a gain pursuant to the settlement agreement with the Company's broker-dealer for its former auction rate securities portfolio that was fully liquidated in December 2009. The Company believes that presentation of measures of net income and diluted net income per share that exclude these items assists management and investors in evaluating the period-over-period performance of the Company's ongoing core business operations because these items are generally considered non-routine in nature. Furthermore, the Company believes that presentation of a measure of non-GAAP adjusted net income and non-GAAP adjusted basic and diluted net income per share that exclude such items is useful to management and investors in evaluating the performance of the Company's ongoing operations on a period-to-period basis and relative to the Company's competitors.

Special Equity Grant.
 
(a)           Effective on the Commencement Date, Executive shall be granted an equity award (the "Award") under the Company's 2005 Equity Incentive Plan (as it may be amended from time to time, the "Plan") having an aggregate grant date value of $3,750,000 and consisting of a combination of (i) non-qualified stock options to purchase shares of Company common stock (the "Options") at an exercise price equal to the Fair Market Value (as defined in the Plan) of a share of Company common stock on the trading day immediately preceding the Commencement Date, and (ii) restricted stock units representing a right to receive shares of Company common stock or the value of such shares in cash on the vesting date ("RSUs").  The Fair Market  Value of the Options shall be determined by the Company using Black Scholes valuation methodology and RSUs shall be valued at the Fair Market Value of the underlying shares on the trading day immediately preceding the Commencement Date.  Such Options and RSUs shall not provide for deferral of compensation under Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-1(b) pursuant to the exemptions described therein for certain stock rights and short-term deferrals, respectively.  Prior to the Commencement Date, Executive shall have the right to choose the allocation of the Award between RSUs and Options; provided however that (i) no more than fifty percent (50%) of the aggregate grant date value of the Award may be in the form of RSUs with the remainder of the Award being in Options, and (ii) if Executive fails to notify the Company of his preferred allocation between RSUs and Options prior to the Commencement Date, the Company shall have the right to determine such allocation in its sole discretion.
 
(b)           Options and RSUs shall be evidenced by the Company's standard forms of award agreements (related Notice of Grant and Grant Summary) consistent with the provisions of this Agreement and the Plan (each, an "Award Agreement" and collectively, the "Award Agreements").  Subject to the additional vesting and other provisions of Section 5(c) and (d) below, which shall be reflected in the Award Agreements, the Options and RSUs shall vest in five equal annual installments of twenty percent (20%) commencing on the first yearly anniversary of the Commencement Date and ending on the fifth yearly anniversary of the Commencement Date.  Options shall be exercisable by Executive at any time after vesting and shall expire on the tenth yearly anniversary of the grant date (the "Expiration Date").  The Award Agreement for the Options shall permit the purchase price for any shares of Company common stock subject to the Options to be paid by any means permitted under the Plan, as well as by net exercise, pursuant to which the number of shares issuable upon exercise of the Options shall be reduced by such number of shares as have an aggregate Fair Market Value equal to the aggregate exercise price (plus tax withholdings, if applicable).
 
(c)           Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or any Award Agreement, if, during the first twelve (12) months following the Commencement Date, Executive's employment is terminated by the Company without Cause (as defined in Section 7 of this Agreement) or by Executive with Good Reason (as defined in Section 7 of this Agreement), then the Awards shall automatically vest so that an aggregate of twenty percent (20%) of each of the Options and RSUs shall be vested as of the date of termination of employment.  Except as specifically provided in this Section 5(c), if Executive's employment terminates for any reason, the unvested portion of any Options or RSUs granted as part of the Award shall not vest and shall immediately terminate.
 
(d)           In the event Executive is terminated by the Company without Cause, resigns for Good Reason, dies or suffers a Disability during the Term, Executive (or his estate or designated representative) shall have twelve (12) months to exercise any Options to the extent such Options were vested on or before the date of death or Disability (but not beyond the Expiration Date), after which time the Options shall expire.  In the event Executive resigns without Good Reason, Executive will have ninety (90) days following termination of employment to exercise any vested Options.  If Executive is terminated by the Company for Cause, the Options shall expire on the date of such termination.

Code Sections 280G and 409A
 
(a)           Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in the event that Executive becomes entitled to receive or receives any payments, options, awards or benefits (including, without limitation, the monetary value of any non-cash benefits and the accelerated vesting of stock options or restricted stock) under this Agreement or under any other plan, agreement or arrangement with the Company, from any person whose actions result in any change described in Section 280G(b)(2)(A)(i) (a Section 280G Transaction) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the Treasury Regulations thereunder (the "Code") or from any person affiliated with the Company or such person (collectively, the Payments) that may separately or in the aggregate constitute parachute payments within the meaning of Code Section 280G and it is determined that, but for this Section 9(a), any of the Payments will be subject to any excise tax pursuant to Code Section 4999 or any similar or successor provision (the Excise Tax), the Company shall pay to Executive either (i) the full amount of the Company Payments (as defined below) or (ii) an amount equal to the Company Payments (as defined below), reduced by the minimum amount necessary to prevent any portion of the Payments from being an excess parachute payment (within the meaning of Code Section 280G) (the Capped Payments), whichever of the foregoing amounts results in the receipt by Executive, on an after-tax basis, of the greatest amount of Payments notwithstanding that all or some portion of the Payments may be subject to the Excise Tax.  For purposes of determining whether Executive would receive a greater after-tax benefit from receipt of the Capped Payments than from receipt of the full amount of the Payments, (i) there shall be taken into account any Excise Tax and all applicable federal, state and local taxes required to be paid by Executive in respect of the receipt of such payments and (ii) such payments shall be deemed to be subject to federal income taxes at the highest rate of federal income taxation applicable to individuals that is in effect for the calendar year in which the benefits are to be paid, and state and local income taxes at the highest rate of taxation applicable to individuals in the state and locality of employees residence on the effective date of the Section 280G Transaction, net of the maximum reduction in federal income taxes which could be obtained from deduction of such state and local taxes (as determined by assuming that such deduction is subject to the maximum limitation applicable to itemized deductions under Code Section 68 and any other limitations applicable to the deduction of state and local income taxes under the Code).
 
(b)              In the event that Section 9(a) applies and a reduction is required to be applied to the Company Payments thereunder, the Company Payments shall be reduced by the Company in its reasonable discretion in the following order and in a manner that complies with Code Section 409A (as determined by the Company): (i) reduction of any cash payments otherwise payable to Executive that are exempt from Code Section 409A; (ii) reduction of any cash payments otherwise payable to Executive that are subject Code Section 409A on a pro-rata basis or such other manner that complies with Code Section 409A, as determined by the Company, (iii) cancellation of accelerated vesting of equity awards (other than stock options) that are exempt from Code Section 409A; (iv) cancellation of accelerated vesting of stock options that are exempt from Code Section 409A; and (v) reduction of any other payments and benefits otherwise payable to the Executive by the Company on a pro-rata basis or such other manner that complies with Code Section 409A, as determined by the Company.  If acceleration of vesting of Executives stock options or other equity awards is to be reduced pursuant to clauses (iii) or (iv) of the immediately preceding sentence, such acceleration of vesting shall be accomplished by first canceling such acceleration for the vesting installment that will vest last and continuing to the extent necessary by canceling such acceleration for the next vesting installment with the latest vesting.  For purposes of this Section 9, the term Company Payments means any payments, options, awards or benefits (including, without limitation, the monetary value of any non-cash benefits and the accelerated vesting of stock options or restricted stock) under this Agreement or under any other plan, agreement or arrangement with the Company.
(c)             All calculations and determinations under this Section 9, including application and interpretation of the Code and related regulatory, administrative and judicial authorities, shall be
 
7
 
made by an accounting firm selected by the Company and reasonably acceptable to Executive which is designated as one of the four largest accounting firms in the United States (the Accounting Firm).  All determinations made by the Accounting Firm under this Section 9 shall be conclusive and binding on both the Company and Executive, and the Company shall cause the Accounting Firm to provide its determinations and any supporting calculations with respect to Executive to the Company and Executive.  The Company shall bear all fees and expenses charged by the Accounting Firm in connection with its services.  For purposes of making the calculations and determinations under this Section 9, after taking into account the information provided by the Company and Executive, the Accounting Firm may make reasonable, good faith assumptions and approximations concerning the application of Code Sections 280G and 4999.  The Company and Executive shall furnish the Accounting Firm with such information and documents as the Accounting Firm may reasonably request to assist the Accounting Firm in making calculations and determinations under this Section 9.
 
(d)           The parties agree that all provisions of this Agreement are intended to meet, and to operate in accordance with, in all material respects, the requirements of paragraphs (2), (3), and (4) of Section 409A(a) of the Code, and any guidance from the Department of Treasury or Internal Revenue Service thereunder, but only to the extent any compensation or benefits provided hereunder are not excepted or excluded from such requirements pursuant to the short-term deferral exception described in Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-1(b)(4), the involuntary separation pay plan exception described in Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii), or otherwise.  In this regard each severance payment under Section 7 of this Agreement shall be treated as a separate payment for purposes of Section 409A of the Code.    Where ambiguity or uncertainty exists, this Agreement shall be interpreted in a manner which would qualify any compensation payable hereunder to satisfy the requirements for exception to or exclusion from Section 409A and the taxes imposed thereunder.  In the event either party reasonably determines any item payable by the Company to the Executive pursuant to this Agreement that is not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture would not meet, or is reasonably likely not to meet, the requirements of paragraphs (2), (3) and (4) of Section 409A, or to qualify as excepted or excluded from Section 409A, such party shall notify the other in writing.  Any such notice shall specify in reasonable detail the basis and reasons for such partys determination.  The parties agree to negotiate in good faith the terms and conditions of an amendment to this Agreement and to avoid the inclusion of such item in a tax year before the Executives actual receipt of such item of income; provided, however, nothing in this Section 9 shall be construed or interpreted to require the Company to increase any amounts payable to the Executive pursuant to this Agreement or to consent to any amendment that would materially and adversely change the Companys financial, accounting or tax treatment of the payments to the Executive under this Agreement.  Any item payable under this Agreement that the Company reasonably determines is subject to Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, shall not be paid or commence to be paid before the later of (a) six months after the date of the Executives Separation from Service and (b) the payment date or commencement date specified in this Agreement for such item.
Any payment or benefit due upon a termination of Executives employment that represents a deferral of compensation within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code shall be paid or provided to Executive only upon a Separation from Service.
Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, to the extent any expense reimbursement or the provision of any in-kind benefit under this Agreement is determined to be subject to Section 409A of the Code, the amount of any such expenses eligible for reimbursement, or the provision of any in-kind benefit, in one calendar year shall not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement in any other taxable year, in no event shall any expenses be reimbursed after the last day of the calendar year following the calendar year in which Executive incurred such expenses, and in no event shall any right to reimbursement or the provision of any in-kind benefit be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit.

(e)           In any case where Executives Separation from Service and the date by which Executive is required to deliver a release pursuant to Section 7(b) fall in two separate taxable years, any amount required to be paid to Executive that is conditioned on the effectiveness of a release and is treated as nonqualified deferred compensation for purposes of Code Section 409A shall be paid in the later taxable year.
(f)           For purposes of this Agreement, "Separation from Service" shall mean a "separation from service" within the meaning of Section 409A(2)(A)(i) of the Code and the underlying Treasury Regulations.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, a termination of employment shall not be deemed to have occurred for purposes of any provision of this Agreement providing for the payment of any amounts or benefits upon or following a termination of employment unless such termination is also a separation from service within the meaning of Code Section 409A and, for purposes of any such provision of this Agreement, references to a termination, termination of employment or like terms shall mean Separation from Service.
10.           .  The Company shall to the extent permitted and required by law, indemnify and hold Executive harmless from costs, expense or liability arising out of or relating to any acts or decisions made by Executive in the course of his employment to the same extent the Company indemnifies and holds harmless other officers and directors of the Company in accordance with the Companys established policies.  This indemnity shall include, without limitation, advancing Executive attorneys fees to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.  The Company agrees to continuously maintain directors and officers' liability insurance with reasonable limits of coverage at least equal to those in effect on the Commencement Date  (unless Executive has voted in favor of a reduction in such coverage as a member of the Board of Directors or has implemented a reduction in his capacity as an executive officer of the Company without a vote of the Board of Directors) and to include Executive within said coverage while Executive is employed by the Company and for at least six (6) years after the termination of Executive's employment by the Company.

HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif., Oct. 29, 2012 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BJ's Restaurants, Inc. (Nasdaq:BJRI) announced today that Gregory A. (Greg) Trojan will join the Company as President and a director effective December 3, 2012. Gerald W. (Jerry) Deitchle, the Company's current Chairman, President and CEO will retire as CEO effective February 1, 2013 and Trojan will succeed him as CEO on that date. Deitchle will continue as Chairman of the Company's Board of Directors.
Since October 2007, Trojan has been employed by Guitar Center Holdings, Inc., a privately held leading retailer of music products with total annual revenue in excess of $2 billion. Guitar Center currently operates 232 Guitar Center stores in 43 states and 109 Music & Arts stores in 22 states. Trojan initially joined Guitar Center as President and Chief Operating Officer and a director and became its CEO in November 2010. From 1996 to 2006, Trojan served as CEO of House of Blues Entertainment, Inc., an operator of restaurant and music venues, concerts and media properties. Prior to that, he served as CEO of the California Pizza Kitchen restaurant chain for two years when it was owned by PepsiCo Inc., and also held various other positions within PepsiCo from 1990 to 1996. Earlier in his career, Trojan was a consultant at Bain & Company, the Wharton Small Business Development Center and Arthur Andersen & Co. Since March 2010, he has served as a director of Domino's Pizza, Inc. Trojan earned a BS in Commerce from The McIntire School at the University of Virginia and an MBA from The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. Trojan, 53, and his family currently reside in the Los Angeles area.
"After an extensive year-long national search, BJ's is very fortunate to have secured the services of such a highly talented and experienced business leader as Greg Trojan," said Peter Bassi, the Company's lead independent director. "Greg's background and experience in leading large, national consumer brands and chain-store operations will be of significant value to BJ's as the Company continues to execute its national expansion plan. We enthusiastically welcome Greg to the BJ's family as our President and next CEO, and we have solid confidence in his ability to continue BJ's forward momentum as a nationwide restaurant growth company."
"On behalf of our Board of Directors, I want to thank Jerry for his eight years of dedicated service as BJ's CEO," said Bassi. "Under Jerry's leadership, BJ's total revenues and cash flow from operating activities have steadily grown from $129 million and $16 million, respectively, in 2004 to estimated amounts in the range of $700 million and $100 million, respectively, in 2012. BJ's annual comparable restaurant sales metric consistently exceeded the average for the casual dining industry on his watch. And, the Company's stated expansion objectives were successfully achieved every year under his direction. Jerry has assembled an outstanding management team and built a solid, leverageable infrastructure to support BJ's future growth. The Board is pleased that he will continue as our Chairman."       
"Greg Trojan knows our industry and also knows how to successfully grow consumer chain-store brands and operations to the multi-billion level in multiple distribution channels," said Deitchle. "In my view, Greg is absolutely the right leader at the right time for BJ's going forward, and I am pleased to pass the Company's leadership baton to him. With only 127 restaurants open today, we are just beginning the third inning of BJ's solid national expansion program.  I am excited to continue as BJ's Chairman for the foreseeable future." 
"I am excited to be joining the BJ's team," commented Trojan. "Under Jerry's leadership, BJ's has clearly demonstrated an impressive track record of success and has cultivated a truly unique concept in the casual dining space. I look forward to bringing BJ's great food and service to many more guests and markets to come."

HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif., Oct. 30, 2012 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BJ's Restaurants, Inc. (Nasdaq:BJRI) today announced the opening of its newest restaurant in Pasadena, California, on Monday, October 29, 2012. The new BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse is located at the intersection of Colorado Boulevard and Marengo Avenue on the ground floor of the historic Pacific Southwest Trust and Savings Bank building. Originally constructed in 1924, the building was designed in the Second Renaissance Revival style of architecture, and the restaurant itself was designed to preserve many outstanding features originally included within the space. Most notable are columns with elaborate capitals, ornamental friezes and cartouches, and the restoration of original marble floors. The restaurant is approximately 9,000 square feet, contains seating for approximately 280 guests, and features BJ's extensive menu including BJ's signature deep-dish pizza, award-winning craft beer and famous Pizookie dessert. BJ's highly detailed, contemporary dcor and unique video statement, including BJ's first 152" plasma television display as well as several high-definition flat panel televisions, create a high energy, fun and family-friendly dining environment for everyone to enjoy. Hours of operation are from 11:00 a.m. to 12:00 midnight Sunday through Thursday, and 11:00 a.m. to 1:00 a.m. Friday and Saturday.
"We are very excited to open our newest BJ's restaurant in our core Southern California market of Pasadena," said Jerry Deitchle, Chairman and CEO.  "Our design and development team did an incredible job of both preserving and highlighting the unique architectural features of our space in this historic building. The Panasonic 152" plasma television that we installed in this restaurant was originally utilized at the NBC studio for the 2012 Summer Olympic Games in London, England. This is the largest plasma television screen currently manufactured in the world, and the first one installed anywhere on the West Coast. We are delighted that BJ's is the first restaurant in the United States to feature this plasma TV, and we invite everyone to stop by, take a look at it and also enjoy BJ's wide variety of high quality food and beer offerings.
"Our Pasadena restaurant is our 14 new restaurant this year, and we currently have two more restaurants scheduled to open before Thanksgiving in Miami, Florida, and Albuquerque, New Mexico," said Deitchle. "As a result, we expect to achieve our previously stated expansion goal for 2012 by opening a total of 16 new restaurants, including the relocation of a smaller-format 'pizza and grill' restaurant in Boulder, Colorado, to a new site in Boulder that supports a larger-format, more productive facility. We currently plan to open as many as 17 new restaurants during 2013, including another relocation. All of our potential new locations for 2013 have now been secured with signed leases or letters of intent. Additionally, work is well underway in building our 2014 expansion pipeline." Investors are reminded that the actual number and timing of new restaurant openings for any given period is subject to a number of factors outside of the Company's control, including weather conditions and factors under the control of landlords, contractors and regulatory/licensing authorities.

EXHIBIT 99.1
HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif., Jan. 10, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BJ's Restaurants, Inc. (Nasdaq:BJRI) today announced that Company management will be presenting at the 15 Annual ICR XChange Conference at the Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami, Florida. The Company's presentation is scheduled to begin at approximately 11:55am (Eastern) on Wednesday, January 16, 2013, and will be broadcast live over the Internet. Interested parties may listen to the presentation at the Company's website located at http://www.bjsrestaurants.com. The presentation can be accessed by clicking on the "Investors" link from the Company's home page followed by the "Presentation" link. An archive of the webcast will be available following the live presentation.
th
The Company also reported preliminary, unaudited revenues of approximately $184.8 million for the 13-week fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 that ended on Tuesday, January 1, 2013, compared to $171.8 million for last year's 14-week fourth quarter. The additional week in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 contributed approximately $13.9 million of incremental sales. Comparable restaurant sales increased approximately 3.0% during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, successfully hurdling a 5.1% increase for the same quarter last year (13 weeks versus 13 weeks). As in prior years, final financial results for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year of 2012 are currently expected to be released in mid-February 2013 after the completion of the Company's annual independent audit.
"We continue to be pleased with the top-line results from both our comparable restaurants and our newer restaurants, particularly in light of the continuing volatile and choppy environment for retail and restaurant sales in general," said Jerry Deitchle, BJ's Chairman and CEO. "Our sales comparisons were quite choppy during the quarter, especially during the first three weeks of the holiday season. As expected, the uneven and less-predictable sales volumes made it more challenging for our restaurant operators to optimize their bottom-line results. Having said that, there is little to no opportunity to optimize performance without the sales, and at BJ's we continue to be sales builders first and foremost. Our 3.0% comparable sales increase for the fourth quarter just ended represents our 12 consecutive quarter of positive comparisons on that metric."
th
As previously announced, Gregory A. (Greg) Trojan was appointed President and a Director of the Company effective December 3, 2013, and will succeed Deitchle as CEO effective February 1, 2013. Deitchle will continue as Chairman of the Company's Board of Directors. "Greg has been enthusiastically welcomed by the entire BJ's team, and his on-boarding process has been very smooth and productive. We have solid confidence in Greg's ability to continue leading BJ's expansion as a national restaurant company and consumer brand," commented Deitchle. Trojan, Deitchle and Greg Levin, BJ's Executive Vice President and CFO, will represent the Company at the upcoming ICR XChange Conference.
During the fourth quarter and full fiscal year of 2012, the Company successfully opened five and 16 new BJ's restaurants, respectively, including one relocated restaurant. "We continue to remain solidly confident in our ability to deliver high quality, low double-digit capacity growth during both 2013 and 2014, as measured in total restaurant operating weeks," said Deitchle.  The Company's new restaurant development pipeline for 2013 currently contemplates the opening of as many as 17 new restaurants, including the relocation of one of our smaller, legacy format BJ's Pizza & Grill locations.  "Our new restaurant development pipeline for 2013 is in excellent shape with solid visibility, and our development team is well underway in building a solid pipeline of high quality locations for potential 2014 restaurant openings," said Deitchle. "With only 130 restaurants currently open in 15 states and with estimated room for at least 425 large-format "Brewhouse" restaurants domestically; we believe that the majority of BJ's growth remains well ahead of us." Investors are reminded that the actual number and timing of new restaurant openings are subject to a number of factors outside of the Company's control, including weather conditions and factors under the control of landlords, contractors and regulatory/licensing authorities.

On February 19, 2013, BJ's Restaurants, Inc., a California corporation (the "Registrant"), announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2012 ended January 1, 2013. The press release issued by the Registrant in connection with the announcement is attached to this report as Exhibit 99.1. The information in this Form 8-K and Exhibits attached hereto are being furnished and shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
    Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT 99.1
HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif., Feb. 19, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BJ's Restaurants, Inc. (Nasdaq:BJRI) today reported financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year of 2012 that ended on Tuesday, January 1, 2013. The results for both the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended January 1, 2013, included one less operating week as compared to the same periods of fiscal 2011. 
Highlights for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 were as follows:
Total revenues increased approximately 8% to $184.8 million, as compared to $171.8 million for the same quarter last year. The extra operating week in fiscal 2011 contributed approximately $13.9 million in sales last year. Excluding the extra operating week, total revenues increased approximately 17% compared to the same quarter last year.
Total restaurant operating weeks increased 5% (13 weeks vs. 14 weeks) and 13% (13 weeks vs. 13 weeks).
Five new restaurants opened during the quarter.
Comparable restaurant sales increased 3.0%, successfully hurdling a 5.1% increase for the same quarter last year (13 weeks vs. 13 weeks).
Net income and diluted net income per share were $7.0 million and $0.24, respectively, as compared to $9.9 million and $0.34 for the same quarter last year. The extra operating week in fiscal 2011 contributed approximately $0.06 of diluted net income per share last year.
On a non-GAAP adjusted basis, excluding certain charges and gains described below and in the reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP adjusted financial measures included in the accompanying financial data, net income and diluted net income per share were $7.6 million and $0.27, respectively.
Results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 include pre-tax charges totaling approximately $1.4 million, or approximately $0.04 per diluted net income per share, related to the estimated cost to settle a California sales tax audit and the one-time costs associated with our CEO transition. These costs were partially offset by a pre-tax gain of approximately $0.5 million, or $0.01 per diluted net income per share, pursuant to the settlement agreement with the Company's former broker-dealer related to the liquidation of its auction rate securities portfolio in December 2009. Under the terms of that settlement agreement, the Company was entitled to potential future recoveries of its loss on that portfolio based on the performance of the securities through December 2012. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, certain of those securities were redeemed at par resulting in additional gains to the Company. As a result of this settlement agreement the Company has successfully recovered 100% of the value of its auction rate securities portfolio.
Highlights for the full fiscal year 2012 were as follows:
Total revenues increased approximately 14% to $708.3 million as compared to $620.9 million for fiscal year 2011. The extra operating week in fiscal 2011 contributed approximately $13.9 million in sales last year. Excluding the extra operating week, total revenues increased approximately 17% compared to the prior year.
Total restaurant operating weeks increased 11% (52 weeks vs. 53 weeks) and 13% (52 weeks vs. 52 weeks).
16 new restaurants opened during the fiscal year, including one relocation.
Comparable restaurant sales increased 3.2%, successfully hurdling a 6.6% increase for fiscal year 2011 (52 weeks vs. 52 weeks).
Net income and diluted net income per share were $31.4 million and $1.09, respectively, as compared to $31.6 million and $1.08 for fiscal year 2011. The extra operating week in fiscal 2011 contributed approximately $0.06 of diluted net income per share last year.
On a non-GAAP adjusted basis, excluding certain charges and gains described below and in the reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP adjusted financial measures included in the accompanying financial data, net income and diluted net income per share were $32.3 million and $1.12, respectively.
Results for fiscal year 2012 include pre-tax charges totaling approximately $2.0 million, or $0.05 per diluted net income per share, related to the estimated cost to settle a trademark infringement lawsuit and a California sales tax audit, the write-off of the remaining net book value of assets related to the closure and relocation of our small-format "Pizza & Grill" restaurant in Boulder, Colorado, and one-time costs associated with our CEO transition. These costs were partially offset by a pre-tax gain of approximately $0.8 million, or $0.02 per diluted net income per share, pursuant to the settlement agreement with the Company's former broker-dealer related to the liquidation of its auction rate securities portfolio in December 2009.
"We were pleased to maintain BJ's forward momentum during the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2012," commented Jerry Deitchle, Chairman of the Board. "Despite the challenging operating environment for restaurants in general, we continued to drive top-line sales and gain market share in the estimated $100+ billion casual dining segment. Excluding the impact of non-recurring items in the fourth quarter, our non-GAAP net income came in as we internally expected at $0.27 per diluted net income per share, due in large part to the high quality, professional execution of our restaurant operators. More importantly, we continued to strengthen the foundation for the BJ's concept going forward. With only 130 restaurants open today in 15 states and with estimated room for at least 425 large-format 'Brewhouse' restaurants domestically, we believe that the majority of BJ's growth remains well ahead of us."
"I want to thank Jerry Deitchle for his stewardship of the BJ's concept over the last eight years," commented Greg Trojan, President and CEO. "I am very impressed with the foundation and the level of execution of the BJ's concept and its brand positioning in the casual dining industry. I am looking forward to working with him as our Chairman going forward. Based on all indications, we expect 2013 to be another challenging year in the casual dining industry. Accordingly, we have several sales building initiatives planned for this year and will continue to prudently manage the costs within our business. We intend to continue playing to the strengths of the BJ's concept by providing a higher quality, more differentiated casual dining experience for our guests, while maintaining an average guest check that remains in the same relative range as those of our mature, 'mass market' peers as we continue to successfully execute our national expansion plan."
The Company successfully opened 16 new restaurants in 2012, including one relocation of an existing restaurant. Five new restaurants (Lubbock, Texas; Pasadena, California; Albuquerque, New Mexico; and two restaurants in Miami, Florida) were opened during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. As previously announced, the Company currently expects to open as many as 17 new restaurants during 2013, of which one will be a relocation of an existing small-format "Pizza & Grill" restaurant in Eugene, Oregon to a new site in Eugene that can accommodate a larger-format "Brewhouse" restaurant. Investors are reminded that the actual number and timing of new restaurant openings are subject to a number of factors outside of the Company's control, including weather conditions and factors under the control of landlords, contractors and regulatory/licensing authorities.

BJ's Restaurants, Inc. will conduct a conference call on its fourth quarter and fiscal year of 2012 earnings release today, February 19, 2013, at 2:00 p.m. (Pacific Time).

Certain statements in the preceding paragraphs and all other statements that are not purely historical constitute "forward-looking" statements for purposes of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are intended to be covered by the safe harbors created thereby. Such statements include, but are not limited to, those regarding expected comparable restaurant sales and margin growth in future periods, total potential domestic capacity, the success of various sales-building and productivity initiatives, future guest traffic trends and the number and timing of new restaurants expected to be opened in future periods. These "forward-looking" statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause actual results to be materially different from those projected or anticipated. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to: (i) our ability to manage an increasing number of new restaurant openings, (ii) construction delays, (iii) labor shortages, (iv) increase in minimum wage and other employment related costs, including the potential impact of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act on our operations, (v) the effect of credit and equity market disruptions on our ability to finance our continued expansion on acceptable terms, (vi) food quality and health concerns, (vii) factors that impact California, where 61 of our current 130 restaurants are located, (viii) restaurant and brewery industry competition, (ix) impact of certain brewery business considerations, including without limitation, dependence upon suppliers, third party contractors and related hazards, (x) consumer spending trends in general for casual dining occasions, (xi) potential uninsured losses and liabilities due to limitations on insurance coverage, (xii) fluctuating commodity costs and availability of food in general and certain raw materials related to the brewing of our handcrafted beers and energy, (xiii) trademark and service-mark risks, (xiv) government regulations and licensing costs, (xv) beer and liquor regulations, (xvi) loss of key personnel, (xvii) inability to secure acceptable sites, (xviii) legal proceedings, (xix) other general economic and regulatory conditions and requirements, (xx) the success of our key sales-building and related operational initiatives, and (xxi) numerous other matters discussed in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its recent reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K. The "forward-looking" statements contained in this press release are based on current assumptions and expectations and BJ's Restaurants, Inc. undertakes no obligation to update or alter its "forward-looking" statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
Reconciliation of Selected GAAP Financial Measures to Non-GAAP Adjusted Financial Measures
To supplement the consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), the Company has included the following non-GAAP adjusted financial measures in this press release or in the webcast to discuss the Company's financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2012 which may be accessed via the Company's website at http://www.bjsrestaurants.com: (i) non-GAAP adjusted net income and (ii) non-GAAP adjusted basic and diluted net income per share. Each of these non-GAAP adjusted financial measures is adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain expenses and gains. As a general matter, the Company uses these non-GAAP adjusted financial measures in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP to help analyze the performance of its core business. The Company believes that such non-GAAP adjusted financial information is provided by its competitors and such information is used by analysts and others in the investment community to analyze the Company's results and in formulating estimates of future performance and that failure to report these non-GAAP adjusted measures could result in confusion among analysts and others and a misplaced perception that the Company's results have underperformed or exceeded expectations.
These non-GAAP adjusted financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the Company's operations that, when viewed with the GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of the Company's results of operations and the factors and trends affecting the Company's business. However, these non-GAAP adjusted financial measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.
For the thirteen weeks ended January 1, 2013, non-GAAP adjusted net income and non-GAAP adjusted basic and diluted net income per share exclude an estimated charge to settle a California sales tax audit, CEO transition costs and a gain pursuant to the settlement agreement with the Company's former broker-dealer for its auction rate securities portfolio that was fully liquidated in December 2009. For fiscal 2012, non-GAAP adjusted net income and non-GAAP adjusted basic and diluted net income per share exclude the effect from the settlement of a trademark infringement claim and an estimated charge to settle a California sales tax audit, the loss on disposal of assets related to the closure and relocation of the Boulder, Colorado smaller-format "Pizza & Grill" restaurant to a larger format "Brewhouse" restaurant, CEO transition costs and a gain pursuant to the settlement agreement with the Company's former broker-dealer for its auction rate securities portfolio that was fully liquidated in December 2009. For fiscal 2011, non-GAAP adjusted net income and non-GAAP adjusted basic and diluted net income per share excluded the effect from the settlement of certain California employment practices lawsuits and a gain pursuant to the settlement agreement with the Company's former broker-dealer for its auction rate securities portfolio that was fully liquidated in December 2009. The Company believes that presentation of measures of net income and basic and diluted net income per share that exclude these items assists management and investors in evaluating the period-over-period performance of the Company's ongoing core business operations because these items are generally considered non-routine in nature. Furthermore, the Company believes that presentation of a measure of non-GAAP adjusted net income and non-GAAP adjusted basic and diluted net income per share that exclude such items is useful to management and investors in evaluating the performance of the Company's ongoing operations on a period-to-period basis and relative to the Company's competitors.

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On April 25, 2013, BJ's Restaurants, Inc., a California corporation (the "Registrant"), announced its financial results for the first quarter ended April 2, 2013. The press release issued by the Registrant in connection with the announcement is attached to this report as Exhibit 99.1. The information in this Form 8-K and Exhibits attached hereto are being furnished and shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
    Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT 99.1
HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif., April 25, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BJ's Restaurants, Inc. (Nasdaq:BJRI) today reported financial results for its first quarter of fiscal 2013 that ended on Tuesday, April 2, 2013. 
Highlights for the first quarter of fiscal 2013 were as follows:
Total revenues increased approximately 13% to $188.6 million
Total restaurant operating weeks increased 13%
One new restaurant opened
Comparable restaurant sales increased 0.4%
Net income and diluted net income per share were $8.3 million and $0.29, respectively
"I could not be more proud of all of our team members for their dedication to making BJ's a great dining experience for our guests," commented Greg Trojan, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Despite the extremely challenging top line sales environment for casual dining, we recorded our 13 consecutive quarter of positive comparable restaurant sales. Furthermore, our restaurant operators did an excellent job of managing the choppy sales environment in a productive and efficient manner during the quarter, resulting in some of our best productivity metrics in quite some time. In this difficult operating environment, where consumer spending for casual dining occasions remains under pressure, we believe the more successful restaurant concepts will be those that protect their overall approachability, quality, differentiation and value for the consumer. This has always been the foundation of the BJ's concept and will continue to be our focus going forward."
th
During the first quarter of fiscal 2013, the Company successfully opened one new restaurant in Puyallup, Washington.  The Company currently plans to open as many as four new restaurants during the second quarter, including one restaurant which has already opened in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, on April 22, 2013, as well as a planned relocation of an existing small-format restaurant in Eugene, Oregon. The Company anticipates opening as many as 12 new restaurants during the last two quarters of fiscal 2013, thereby achieving its stated goal to open as many as 17 new restaurants this year. "Our 2013 development pipeline is in excellent shape and we are now focusing on building a solid pipeline for our 2014 and 2015 restaurant openings," said Trojan. Investors are reminded that the actual number and timing of new restaurant openings are subject to a number of factors outside of the Company's control, including weather conditions and factors under the control of landlords, contractors and regulatory/licensing authorities.
"With only 132 restaurants open to date in 15 states, there is a long runway of expansion ahead," commented Trojan. "We continue to believe there is room for at least 425 BJ's restaurants domestically, and that we are one of a few publicly held casual dining restaurant companies with this type of growth opportunity. Therefore, we will continue executing our national expansion strategy in a careful and controlled manner that will allow us to drive predictability and leverage in our business. At the same time, we will continue investing in our team members, our food and bar offerings, and our restaurant facilities and ambience to deliver a higher quality, more differentiated dining experience for our guests."
