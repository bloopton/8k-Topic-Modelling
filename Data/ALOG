PEABODY, MA (October, 15, 2003)  Analogic Corporation (NASDAQ: ALOG), a leading designer and manufacturer of high precision health and security imaging equipment, today announced revenues and earnings for its fourth quarter and twelve-month period ending July 31, 2003. The Company also announced its intention to restate its financial statements for the nine months ended April 30, 2003, and the fiscal years 2002 and 2001. All amounts set forth in this release have been adjusted to give effect to this restatement.
 
Revenues for the fourth quarter ended July 31, 2003, were $82,025,000, compared with the prior year's fourth-quarter revenues of $88,900,000. Net income for the fourth quarter was $1,674,000, or $.12 per diluted share, compared with $6,569,000, or $.50 per diluted share, for the prior year's fourth quarter. As expected, the difference was primarily the result of a decrease in the number of Explosive Detection Systems shipped this quarter compared to the prior year's fourth quarter, when the Company was initiating deliveries of its Explosive Assessment Computed Tomography (EXACT) system. Medical revenues for the quarter increased slightly over the prior fourth quarter due to increased sales of advanced Data Acquisition Systems (DAS's) for Computed Tomography (CT) and revenues from Sound Technology Inc. (STI), an ultrasound subsidiary acquired in November 2002.
 
Revenues for the twelve months ended July 31, 2003, were a record $471,522,000, compared with the prior year's revenues of $306,126,000, an increase of $165,396,000. Net income for the twelve-month period was a record $49,495,000, or $3.70 per diluted share, compared with $3,006,000, or $.23 per diluted share, for the same period a year ago, an increase of $46,489,000. The significant increase was due primarily to orders for 500 EXACT security imaging systems, nearly all of which were delivered during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2003. The Company also enjoyed substantial growth in its medical imaging subsystems business.
 
ANALOGIC'S Q4 RESULTS  cont'd
 
The Company also announced that it intends to restate its financial statements for the nine months ended April 30, 2003 and the fiscal years ended July 31, 2002 and 2001. The purpose of the restatement is to apply the appropriate accounting standards to (1) the recognition of software revenue by Camtronics Medical Systems, Ltd., a U.S. subsidiary of the Company, and (2) an inter-company loan from the Company to B-K Medical Systems A/S, a Danish subsidiary of the Company.
 
In connection with its year-end audit, the Company concluded that its accounting for revenue at its Camtronics subsidiary, and for foreign exchange transactions with respect to inter-company debt, did not meet required accounting standards. With the assistance of its independent accountants, the Company has taken steps to ensure that these transactions are properly accounted for in all past reporting periods and that transactions of this sort will be properly accounted for in the future.
 
Camtronics previously accounted for all of its revenues in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin 101 (SAB 101), Revenue Recognition. The Company and its independent accountants conducted a review of Camtronics' revenue recognition policy and determined that, in accordance with SOP 97-2, certain revenues originally recorded in prior periods should have been deferred. In accordance with SAB 101, the Company had previously recognized revenue when the major components of software had been delivered, installed, and accepted by the customer. In the majority of cases, the customer has already installed and paid for the software it has accepted. As required by SOP 97-2, the Company will recognize the total revenue related to transactions involving software once all components are delivered, installed, and accepted by the customer. Due to the application of SOP 97-2, the Company will record a $22,867,000 increase in deferred revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. This deferred revenue will be recognized as revenue by the Company in future periods in accordance with SOP 97-2.
 
The Company and its independent accountants also completed a review of the Company's application of FAS No. 52 with respect to foreign exchange gains (losses) attributable to an inter-company loan from the Company to B-K Medical Systems. This review determined that the gains (losses), which had been previously reported in Stockholders' Equity as cumulative translation adjustments, must be recognized as gains (losses) in determining prior period operating results.
 
John Wood, the Company's President and CEO, said, "We do not believe this restatement will have any adverse impact on the Company's future operating results or its business outlook, which remain strong." As restated, the Company's earnings per share for the nine months ended April 30, 2003, reflects a $.01 change from $3.59 to $3.58 per share. The Company's earnings in fiscal 2001 were most affected by the restatement. In addition, deferral of revenue and related costs resulted in adjustments to the Company's balance sheet during the period restated. The financial table set forth below depicts the effect of the combined restatement on selected Income Statement and Balance Sheet items:
 
ANALOGIC'S Q4 RESULTS  cont'd
 
 
The Company will file amended annual reports on Form 10-K for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2002 and July 31, 2001, and amended quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters within the fiscal years ended July 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001.
 
ANALOGIC'S Q4 RESULTS  cont'd
 
Commenting on the past year, Bernard Gordon, Chairman of the Board, stated, "We are extremely pleased with our accomplishments in fiscal 2003. Analogic concluded the best year in its history, with record revenues and income. We also believe that we have successfully established a broader foundation for long-term growth. While we have always been recognized as a technology leader in medical imaging, during this past year we demonstrated our leadership in the rapidly advancing field of security imaging technology as well."
 
John Wood, President & CEO, noted that the growth in revenue and income during fiscal 2003 was due in large part to extraordinary external circumstances, as well as remarkable internal achievements. "The tragedy of September 11
th
led Congress to mandate installation of certified Explosive Detection Systems (EDS) at airports across the country by the end of 2002. Our employees responded to the challenge by producing 500 of our large, complex EXACT security imaging systems in a very short time. We also developed two smaller security imaging systems for an OEM customer.
 
"Many perceived the sale of the 500 EXACT units as a short-term benefit for Analogic. We viewed it as an opportunity to further invest in our technology and establish a leadership position in the development of advanced security systems. We designed and built the first prototypes of an innovative, compact, moderately low-cost, CT-based automatic security imaging system to examine carry-on baggage for aircraft as well as carry-in items for public buildings such as courthouses, embassies, and corporate offices. This system should be ready for government testing early in 2004."
 
"Subsequent to the end of the fiscal year, the Company received a research and development award from the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to design the next generation of innovative explosive detection systems that could be ready for deployment in two to five years. We also entered into an agreement with a leading prime contractor that won a research and development grant from the TSA to help our customer design and develop prototypes of continuous performance enhancements for EDS systems already deployed in airports across the country. We believe the advanced security products we are developing will enhance our status as a leader in security technology and contribute to our long-term growth."
 
Mr. Wood continued, "We entered into a partnership with Sanders Design International to develop a breakthrough, low-cost infrared countermeasures system to protect aircraft from shoulder-fired, heat-seeking missiles. Sanders recently received a grant from the US Air Force and the Defense Advanced Research Programs Agency (DARPA) to further develop this Spatial Infrared Counter Measure (SICM) self-protection system for commercial and military aircraft. "
 
"In fiscal 2003, the Company also enjoyed significant growth in several segments of its medical subsystems business. We introduced several new families of advanced, multi-slice CT DAS's this past year that generated a significant increase in demand from our customers. The power systems we design and manufacture for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) also enjoyed substantial growth this year, and Sound Technology Inc. (STI), the ultrasound transducer subsidiary we acquired in the second quarter of the year, also performed exceptionally well. Capitalizing on our success this year, the Company significantly increased its investment in the development of a number of advanced medical systems for growing niche markets that we believe will be the basis for continuing growth in our medical businesses," concluded Wood.

The corrected release reads:
 
ANALOGIC CORPORATION ANNOUNCES REVENUES AND EARNINGS FOR ITS FIRST QUARTER
 
Analogic Corporation (NASDAQ:ALOG), a leading designer and manufacturer of high precision health and security imaging equipment, announced today revenues and earnings for its first quarter ended October 31, 2003.
 
Revenues for the first quarter ended October 31, 2003, were $74,969,000, compared with the prior year's first quarter revenues of $132,284,000, a decrease of 43%. Net income for the first quarter was $631,000, or $.05 per diluted share. This compares with $19,650,000, or $1.48 per diluted share, for the prior year's first quarter.
 
John Wood, President and CEO, commented, "The decrease in revenue and income was about as expected. Last year we reported record revenue and income in the first quarter due to extraordinary sales of the EXplosive Assessment Computed Tomography (EXACT) systems for use in Explosive Detection Systems (EDS) that screen checked luggage for aircraft. Last year we shipped 175 systems in the first quarter. This year we did not ship any EXACT systems in the quarter as we had earlier supplied our OEM customer with an adequate backlog to meet the
 
recent, significantly lower demand. The result was a quarter over quarter decrease in EXACT shipments of approximately $70,000,000. We expect additional orders for the EXACT this fiscal year and into the future, but at a much more modest level than a year ago.
 
"The decrease in security revenues was offset in part by increased demand quarter over quarter for our patient monitoring equipment, due to the recent introduction of a new generation of monitors, and growth in our medical components businesses. The growth in components reflects strong demand for our advanced CT data acquisition systems and power systems for magnetic resonance imaging."
 
Wood observed that the Company has been implementing a variety of cost containment measures over the past four months. During the quarter the Company began consolidating some of its facilities, moving the Life Care group from leased premises in Wakefield into the Peabody headquarters, and further building consolidations are planned in the future. As anticipated, the Company also considerably reduced staffing in its Haverhill manufacturing facility due to the currently reduced demand for EXACT systems. Orders for explosive detection systems anticipated in the near term will be produced at the Company's expanding Peabody headquarters, where 100,000 square feet of manufacturing and engineering space are being added. Completion is scheduled for January 2004.
 
Wood noted, however, that research and development expenses had increased substantially over the previous first quarter. "As we indicated last year, we took advantage of the increase in income generated by the new security systems to substantially increase our investment in the development of major new medical and security systems. For example, we are in the late stages of development of prototypes of an automated, CT-based portal screening system that can scan carry-on baggage at airports, carry-in' baggage at public buildings, and parcels for corporations and delivery services. We expect the Carry-On Baggage Real-time Assessment (COBRA) Threat Detection System to be ready for submission to the U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) for certification and testing in the first half of the coming calendar year. In September we were a recipient of two awards from the TSA made under the Phoenix Project, established to develop next-generation Explosive Detection Systems (EDS) that deliver deployment-ready aviation checked-baggage inspection systems in two to five years. With Lockheed Martin, we received an award to develop enhancements for EDS systems that are already deployed in airports across the nation. Analogic also received a grant for the initial design phases of an ambitious program to develop an entirely new generation of advanced explosive detection systems that will dramatically improve speed, throughput, and reliability."
 
Analogic has similarly increased its investment in the development of a number of innovative medical imaging systems for niche markets. Several major CT systems are in development, including a low-cost, movable, multi-slice scanner intended for community hospitals and developing countries, a large-bore system for medical and security applications, and a hybrid system combining the Company's newest CT technology with innovative, patented scintillator technology for Positron Emission Tomography (PET). The Company is also continuing major development work on advanced digital X-ray systems for general radiography and
 
mammography, and a unique digital ultrasound mammography system. During the quarter, Analogic also announced the establishment of a new subsidiary, Anexa Corporation, which will sell advanced digital radiography systems to select end-user markets.
 
Wood concluded, "We are confident that our considerable investment in new product development in health as well as in security technology will help position the Company for long-term growth."
 
Analogic Corporation is a leading designer and manufacturer of advanced health and security systems and subsystems sold to Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs). The Company is recognized worldwide for advancing the state of the art in Computed Tomography (CT), Digital Radiography (DR), Ultrasound, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Patient Monitoring, Cardiovascular Information Management, and Embedded Multiprocessing.

PEABODY, MA (March 12, 2004)  Analogic Corporation (NASDAQ-ALOG), a leading designer and manufacturer of high precision health and security imaging equipment, announced today revenues and earnings for its second quarter ended January 31, 2004.
Revenues for the second quarter ended January 31, 2004, were $95,262,000, compared with the prior year's second quarter revenues of $157,145,000, a decrease of 39%. Net income for the second quarter was $4,858,000, or $0.36 per diluted share. This compares with a net income of $21,314,000 or $1.59 per diluted share, for the prior year's second quarter, a decrease of 77%.
Revenues for the six months ended January 31, 2004, were $170,231,000, compared with the prior year's six months' revenues of $289,429,000, a decrease of 41%. Net income for the six-month period was $5,489,000 or $0.41 per diluted share, compared with $40,964,000, or $3.07 per diluted share, for the same period a year ago, a decrease of 87%.
John Wood, President and CEO, commented, "The decrease in revenue and income were again as we had expected. Last year we reported record revenue and income for the second quarter and for the first six months due to extraordinary shipments of EXplosive Assessment Computed Tomography (EXACT) systems for use in certified Explosive Detection Systems (EDS) that screen checked luggage for aircraft. Last year during the second quarter we shipped a record 212 EXACT systems to L-3 Communications to help airports comply with the mandates of the Aviation and Transportation Security Act of 2001. During this quarter ten EXACT systems were shipped, resulting in a quarter-over-quarter revenue decrease of approximately $82,000,000."
 
The decline in security revenues was offset in part by significant growth in the sales of medical imaging equipment, which were up 31% over the prior second quarter. Sales of cardiac information management equipment, clinical ultrasound systems, and patient monitoring systems were up substantially quarter over quarter. Shipments of new families of multi-slice data acquisition systems for Computed Tomography and of ultrasound transducers developed by its Sound Technology subsidiary for OEM customers increased significantly. Sales of digital radiography equipment were also up.
"We are pleased with the strong growth in sales of medical imaging equipment," Wood added. "Part of this growth was due to recognition of revenue deferred from previous years, but much of the improvement was due to solid growth in our subsystems business. We expect the complete systems business to pick up similarly next calendar year in conjunction with the introduction of several new complete computed tomography and digital radiography systems."
Security revenues are also expected to improve. Ten EXACT systems were shipped during the quarter. Only six had been shipped during the preceding two quarters combined. "We've already shipped a small number of EXACT units in the current quarter, " said Wood, "and expect additional orders in the near future, though well below the levels of the previous year. Security revenues will continue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter but we believe there are significant opportunities for substantial growth in security in the not-too-distant future."
The Company has made substantial progress on two prototypes of its innovative COBRA checkpoint scanning system, to scan carry-on/carry-in baggage at airports and other venues. The COBRA uses advanced CT technology to provide three-dimensional images of the entire contents of a carry-on bag or parcel, and automatically alerts the operator as to potential threats. During the quarter the system was successfully tested using real explosives, guns, and some very difficult-to-detect "sharp weapons."
Wood noted that operating expenses had increased quarter-over-quarter due in good part to the formation of Anexa Corporation, a subsidiary established in November to market digital imaging solutions to select end-user markets. Earnings were also affected short-term by continued substantial investment in research and development, significantly above the historical average. The Company took advantage of the increased revenue generated by security systems in Calendar 2002 to initiate development of a number of major new CT and digital radiography systems as well as security imaging systems.
"We are confident," said Wood, "that our aggressive development of a number of new medical and security imaging systems will complement the growth in our subsystems business and provide the basis for substantial long-term growth for the Company."

Exhibit 99.1
PEABODY, MA (June 10, 2004)  Analogic Corporation (NASDAQ-ALOG), a leading designer and manufacturer of high precision medical diagnostic and security equipment, announced today revenues and earnings for its third quarter ended April 30, 2004.
Revenues for the third quarter ended April 30, 2004, were $92,257,000, compared with the prior year's third quarter revenues of $100,068,000, a decrease of 8%. Net income for the third quarter was $1,771,000, or $.13 per diluted share, compared with $6,856,000, or $.51 per diluted share, for the prior year's third quarter, a decrease of 74%.
Revenues for the nine months ended April 30, 2004, were $262,488,000, compared with the prior year's nine months' revenues of $389,497,000, a decrease of 33%. Net income for the nine-month period was $7,260,000 or $.54 per diluted share, compared with $47,820,000, or $3.58 per diluted share, for the same period a year ago, a decrease of 85%.
John Wood, President and CEO, commented, "The decreases in revenue and income from last year were about as expected. Last year we reported record revenue and income for the third quarter and for nine months due to extraordinary shipments of EXplosive Assessment Computed Tomography (EXACT) systems. The EXACT is the heart of a certified Explosive Detection System (EDS) that screens checked luggage for aircraft. Most of those systems were shipped during the first two quarters last year, to help airports comply with the mandates of the Aviation and Transportation Security Act of 2001. During the third quarter a year ago over 50 EXACT systems and spare parts were shipped, compared to 14 units and spares this quarter, resulting in a quarter-over-quarter revenue decrease of approximately $19,742,000."
The decline in security revenues was partially offset by 16% growth in the sales of medical imaging systems, including cardiac information management, digital radiography, and patient monitoring systems. About a third of this growth was due to recognition of revenue deferred from previous years.
 
Operating expenses increased quarter-over-quarter due in large part to Anexa Corporation, a subsidiary established in November to market digital imaging solutions to select end-user markets; personnel-related expenses; and incremental costs incurred to comply with the Sarbannes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Company also continued to invest in research and development at a level well above the historical average.
"Our medical systems business is beginning to improve," said Wood. "We believe it will continue to grow next calendar year with the introduction of several new complete medical CT and digital radiography systems. Our medical subsystems business, including data acquisition systems for CT and ultrasound transducers, remains strong."
"Security revenues are expected to fluctuate but we believe there are opportunities for substantial growth in that sector," Wood noted. "During the quarter we received an order for 40 additional EXACT systems, the majority of which will be delivered during this calendar year. We are making excellent progress on a major field upgrade to the EXACT systems which, subject to certification and field testing, is targeted for availability next calendar year."
The Company also takes pride in its innovative new COBRA checkpoint security system. The COBRA uses advanced CT technology to provide three-dimensional images of the entire contents of a carry-on bag or parcel, and automatically alerts the operator as to potential threats. During the quarter a prototype of the system was exhibited at a Homeland Security conference in Washington, D.C., and demonstrated to several congressional leaders. "We are waiting for the government to establish certification standards for carry-on luggage scanners, which we expect to be issued late this summer. If all goes well, we should be able to put the system into production next calendar year," said Wood. The Company is also developing an entirely new generation of EDS systems funded by a grant from the Transportation Security Administration.
Wood noted, "We are confident that our aggressive development of a number of major new medical and security imaging systems will complement our strong medical subsystems business in the coming year and provide the basis for substantial long-term growth for the Company."

FOR IMMEDIATE WORLDWIDE RELEASE
For Further Information, Contact: John Millerick Senior Vice President & CFO (978) 977-3000
Paul M. Roberts Director of Communications (978) 977-3000, x3213
PEABODY, MA (September 22, 2004)  Analogic Corporation (NASDAQ: ALOG), a leading designer and manufacturer of high precision health and security imaging equipment, today announced revenues and earnings for its fourth quarter and twelve-month period ended July 31, 2004.
Revenues for the fourth quarter ended July 31, 2004, were $108,278,000, compared with the prior year's fourth-quarter revenues of $82,025,000, an increase of $26,253,000 or 32%. Net income for the fourth quarter was $4,370,000, or $.32 per diluted share, compared with $1,675,000, or $.12 per diluted share, for the prior year's fourth quarter. The improvement was due to a modest increase in security systems sales quarter over quarter and general growth in the sales of medical imaging equipment, including computed tomography subsystems, clinical ultrasound systems, digital radiography systems, cardiac information management systems, and patient monitoring systems.
Revenues for the twelve months ended July 31, 2004, were $370,766,000, compared with the prior year's revenues of $471,522,000, a decrease of $100,756,000 or 21%. Net income for the twelve-month period was $11,630,000, or $.86 per diluted share, compared with $49,495,000, or $3.70 per diluted share, for the same period a year ago, a decrease of $37,865,000.
John Wood, President and CEO, commented, "The decreases in revenue and income from year to year were in keeping with what we had expected. Last year we reported record revenue and income due to extraordinary shipments of EXplosive Assessment Computed Tomography (EXACT) systems for use in certified Explosive Detection Systems (EDS) that screen checked luggage for aircraft. We shipped a record 446 EXACT systems to L-3 Communications last year to help airports comply with the mandates of the Aviation and Transportation Security Act of 2001. During Fiscal 2004, only 40 EXACT systems were shipped, resulting in a year-over-year revenue decrease of approximately $168,000,000. That decrease was partially offset by a 26% growth in our medical business. We experienced solid growth in the sales of ultrasound systems and subsystems, CT subsystems, digital radiography systems, patient and fetal monitors, and cardiac information systems, as well as solid growth in our embedded signal-processing sector.
"We believe that we are establishing a broader foundation for long-term growth. The sale of over 400 EXACT units last year was seen by many as a brief, one-time benefit for Analogic. We saw it as an opportunity to increase our investment in our next-generation medical technology and to establish a leadership position in the development of advanced security systems."
In Fiscal 2003, the Company began designing and developing the COBRA, an innovative, compact, CT-based automatic threat detection system to examine carry-on baggage for aircraft as well as carry-in items for public buildings such as courthouses, embassies, and corporate offices. This year, a COBRA prototype was tested with real weapons and explosives in the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) laboratory, where the system performed beyond expectations. As soon as the TSA establishes performance requirements for the next generation of carry-on screening devices, the COBRA will be modified, if necessary, and submitted for certification.
During the year, Analogic entered into an agreement with a leading prime contractor to design and develop prototypes of continuous performance enhancements for EDS systems already deployed in airports across the country, a program funded by a grant from the TSA. Those enhancements are targeted for certification testing and initial production in the next calendar year. The Company separately received an award from the TSA to design the next generation of innovative explosive detection systems for checked luggage that could be deployed over the next two to five years. A development proposal for a third generation of EDS systems targeted for delivery in the 2011 timeframe was submitted to the TSA late in the fiscal year.
Wood noted, "We believe the advanced security products that we are developing will enhance our status as a leader in security technology and contribute to our long-term growth."
In Fiscal 2004, the Company continued to invest in higher levels of research and development in a number of medical areas as well. Analogic is developing new medical CT systems for evolving niche markets, and work continues at PhotoDetection Systems on a new Positron Emission Tomography (PET) system that employs innovative detector technology and can be combined with a CT for a new generation of hybrid PET/CTs. These systems are anticipated to start entering the market towards the end of the next calendar year. New Digital Radiography (DR) systems are being developed for ANEXA, the digital imaging subsidiary established early in the fiscal year. Work is also continuing on a number of advances in high-performance subsystems for multi-slice CT, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and DR, including extremely low-noise detector plates. The Company is continuing to develop a number of advanced ultrasound transducers and is working on the next generation of clinical ultrasound systems, as well as a unique ultrasound mammography system that could eliminate the need for many breast biopsies.
Wood concluded, "We are pleased with what we have accomplished to date in growing our medical business and believe that the steps we have taken in the past year will substantially enhance our opportunities for long-term growth as ."

For Further Information, Contact: John J. Millerick Senior Vice President & CFO (978) 977-3000
PEABODY, MA (October 14, 2004)  Analogic Corporation (NASDAQ: ALOG), a leading designer and manufacturer of high precision health and security imaging equipment, today announced that it did not file its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2004, by the October 14, 2004, due date. The Company will file a Form 12b-25 (Notification of Late Filing) with the SEC seeking a 15-day extension to file its Annual Report on Form 10-K.
In the course of preparing its Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company further evaluated certain information leading it to question whether appropriate revenue recognition procedures had been followed in all cases by its Camtronics Medical Systems subsidiary, a supplier of advanced cardiac information management systems. As a result, the Company is conducting an additional review of certain Camtronics transactions and the revenue recognition procedures followed, which has led to a delay in completing the preparation and audit of its financial statements for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2004. The Company anticipates that this review will be completed in time to permit the filing of the Form 10-K within the 15-day extension provided for under SEC rules. Camtronics' revenues are expected to account for less than twenty percent of the Company's revenues for fiscal 2004.
The Company expects that the audited financial statements that will be filed as part of its Annual Report on Form 10-K will not include revenue from one transaction, totaling $833,000, which was included in the Company's operating results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended July 31, 2004, as originally reported in the Company's September 22, 2004, earnings release. It is possible that the review being undertaken by the Company will lead to the deferral of revenue from other transactions that had been included in the operating results reported in the September 22, 2004, press release. The Company will issue a press release describing any changes from its originally announced operating results when it files its Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The Company's business was strong during the fourth quarter, as described in the September 22, 2004, news release. Sales increased quarter over quarter for computed tomography subsystems, clinical ultrasound systems, digital radiography systems, and patient monitoring systems, as well as for the cardiac information management systems from Camtronics. The Company's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were over $175 million as of July 31, 2004.
John J. Millerick, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, said, "The Company regrets the delay in completing its audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2004, and the possible changes to its fiscal 2004 operating results as originally announced. However, the Company recognizes its responsibility to report complete and accurate financial information, and is taking what it believes are the steps necessary to ensure that it will do so."

Item 3.01. Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing.
On November 2, 2004, Analogic Corporation (the "Company") received a letter from the NASDAQ Stock Market indicating that the Company is not in compliance with the NASDAQ requirements for continued listing set forth in Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14) as a result of the Companys failure to file its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2004 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. NASDAQ rules permit the Company to request a hearing with a NASDAQ Listing Qualifications Panel to appeal NASDAQs decision to delist the Companys common stock. The Company intends to make such an appeal. The Companys common stock will remain listed on the NASDAQ National Market pending the outcome of such appeal. The Company is working diligently to complete the preparation and audit of its financial statements for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2004 and to file its Annual Report on Form 10-K as promptly as possible. However, the Company can provide no assurances that the NASDAQ Listing Qualifications Panel will grant the Companys request for continued listing. On November 2, 2004, the Company issued a press release, attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 99.1, reporting that the Company received the letter from the NASDAQ Stock Market described in this Current Report on Form 8-K.

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On December 13, 2004, Analogic Corporation (the "Company") issued a press release containing certain information about revenues for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2004. The full text of the press release issued in connection with the announcement is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K. The information in Item 2.02 of this Form 8-K and the Exhibit attached hereto shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act, except as expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
Item 4.02. Non-Reliance on Previously Issued Financial Statements or a Related Audit Report or Completed Interim Review.
On December 7, 2004, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Audit Committee") and the management of the Company concluded that the financial statements of the Company included in its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the interim fiscal periods ended October 31, 2003, January 31, 2004 and April 30, 2004, the financial information included in its press release dated September 22, 2004 announcing financial results for the fiscal year and quarter ended July 31, 2004, and all other earnings releases and similar communications of the Company relating to all such fiscal periods, should no longer be relied upon. The Audit Committee and the management of the Company determined that the Company will have to restate its financial statements for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2004 and the interim periods within that year to reflect the appropriate accounting treatment for certain transactions by its subsidiary, Camtronics Medical Systems ("Camtronics"). These restatements will primarily in volve a deferral of Camtronics revenues and associated costs from the fiscal period in which they were originally recorded to subsequent fiscal periods. Analogic is currently assessing whether it will have to restate its financial statements for any periods prior to fiscal 2004 as a result of Camtronics revenue recognition issues. The restatements are required due to the incorrect application of software revenue recognition procedures with respect to certain Camtronics transactions. Under software revenue recognition rules, Camtronics is not permitted to recognize revenue on a multiple-element software arrangement until such time as Camtronics has delivered or performed all elements of the arrangement. Although in the case of a majority of the Camtronics transactions underlying the restatements Camtronics has delivered and the customer has paid for the software, Camtronics is prohibited from recognizing any revenue from the transaction because some element of the transaction such as the delivery of a software upgrade or the performance of customization or data migration serviceshas not been delivered or performed. The Company believes that all of the Camtronics transactions in question represent bona fide customer sales and that the revenue that has been reversed as part of these restatements will be recognized in future fiscal periods. The Audit Committee and the management of the Company discussed the matters disclosed in this filing with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the Companys independent accountants.

FOR IMMEDIATE WORLDWIDE RELEASE For Further Information, Contact: John J. Millerick Senior Vice President & CFO (978) 977-3000
PEABODY, MA (December 13, 2004)  Analogic Corporation (NASDAQ: ALOGE), a designer and manufacturer of high precision health and security imaging equipment, today provided an update on the status of its financial statements.
Analogic has previously reported that, in the course of preparing its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2004, Analogic further evaluated certain information leading it to question whether appropriate software revenue recognition procedures had been followed in all cases by its Camtronics Medical Systems subsidiary, a supplier of advanced cardiac information management systems. Analogic has been conducting a review of Camtronics transactions and the revenue recognition procedures followed. This review has led to a delay in the completion of Analogic's financial statements for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2004 and for the quarter ended October 31, 2004. While those financial statements have not yet been completed, Analogic is in a position to provide an update on the financial statements and related matters.
Form 10-Q for Quarter Ended October 31, 2004
Due to this review and the resultant delay in the completion of its financial statements, Analogic did not file its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended October 31, 2004 by the December 10, 2004 due date. Analogic will today file a Form 12b-25 (Notification of Late Filing) with the SEC reporting this filing delinquency.
Restatement of Prior Financial Statements
In addition, Analogic has concluded that it will have to restate certain of its historical financial statements to reflect the appropriate accounting treatment for some of the Camtronics transactions that have been under review. These restatements will primarily involve a deferral of Camtronics' revenues and associated costs from the fiscal period in which they were originally recorded to subsequent fiscal periods. Analogic had previously announced in its press release dated September 22, 2004 that revenues for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2004 ("fiscal 2004") were $370.8 million. It has now concluded that the revenues reflected in its audited financial statements that will be filed as part of its Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2004 will be less than $370.8 million. In addition, Analogic has determined that it will have to restate its financial statements for each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2004. While Analogic has not completed the preparation of its financial statements for fiscal 2004, it currently estimates that its revenues for fiscal 2004 will be at least $14 million lower than the previously announced $370.8 million. Analogic is still evaluating issues affecting certain Camtronics' transactions that may result in additional changes to its fiscal 2004 revenues. Investors should no longer rely on Analogic's prior earnings releases or financial statements for fiscal 2004 and the interim periods within fiscal 2004.
Analogic is also currently assessing whether some of these same Camtronics revenue recognition issues will require it to restate its financial statements for periods prior to fiscal 2004.
Analogic will issue another press release describing its conclusions with respect to the need to restate prior periods, as well as additional information on its results of operations for fiscal 2004 and, if applicable, prior periods, once it has completed its analysis of those matters.
Any restatements that have to be made are required due to the incorrect application of software revenue recognition procedures with respect to certain Camtronics transactions. Under software revenue recognition rules, Camtronics is not permitted to recognize revenue on a multiple-element software arrangement until such time as Camtronics has delivered or performed all elements of the arrangement. Although in the case of a majority of the Camtronics transactions underlying the restatement Camtronics has delivered and the customer has paid for the software, Camtronics is prohibited from recognizing any revenue from the transaction because some element of the transaction  such as the delivery of a software upgrade or the performance of customization or data migration services  has not been delivered or performed. Analogic believes that all of the Camtronics transactions in question represent bona fide customer sales, and that the revenue that has been reversed as part of these restatements will be recognized in future fiscal periods.
NASDAQ Delisting Notice and Appeal
Analogic announced on November 2, 2004 that it had received a notice from The NASDAQ Stock Market that Analogic was not in compliance with the NASDAQ requirements for continued listing as a result of its failure to file its Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2004 with the SEC, and that its common stock is therefore subject to delisting from The NASDAQ National Market. As permitted by NASDAQ rules, Analogic appealed the decision to delist its common stock; its common stock will remain listed on the NASDAQ National Market pending the outcome of that appeal. As part of the appeal, Analogic requested an extension until January 31, 2005 to file both its Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2004 and its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended October 31, 2004. A hearing on that appeal was held before a NASDAQ Listing Qualifications Panel on December 9, 2004, but a decision has not yet been rendered. Analogic can provide no assurances that the NASDAQ Listing Qualifications Panel will grant Analogic's request for the filing extension. Analogic is working diligently to complete the preparation of its financial statements for fiscal 2004 and the quarter ended October 31, 2004 and to file its Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as promptly as possible. If its request for an extension until January 31, 2005 is granted, Analogic believes that it will be able to complete and file those reports by that date.
This press release contains statements regarding future events or circumstances that involve risks and uncertainties. Those statements are considered "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Act of 1995 and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of that Act. Investors are cautioned that those forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual future events or circumstances as a result of various important factors, including those referred to under the heading "Business Environment and Risk Factors" in Analogic s most recent Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q
on file with the SEC, as well as unforeseen issues encountered in the completion of Analogic s review of Camtronics transactions, Analogic's completion of its financial statements for fiscal 2004 and the first quarter of fiscal 2005, and PricewaterhouseCoopers' audit of the fiscal 2004 financial statements and review of the quarterly financial statements. In addition, the forward-looking statements included in this press release represent Analogic's views as of the date of this press release. Analogic anticipates that subsequent events and developments may cause its views to change. However, while Analogic may elect to update those forward-looking statements at some point in the future, Analogic specifically disclaims any obligation to do so. Those forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing Analogic's views as of any date subsequent to the date of this press release.

Item 3.01. Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing.
On December 22, 2004, Analogic Corporation (the "Company") received a letter from the NASDAQ Stock Market indicating that the Company is not in compliance with the NASDAQ requirements for continued listing set forth in Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14) as a result of the Companys failure to file its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended October 31, 2004 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The NASDAQ Stock Market also indicated that the NASDAQ Listing Qualifications Panel will consider the Companys failure to file its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended October 31, 2004 with the Securities and Exchange Commission in rendering a determination regarding the Companys continued listing on The NASDAQ National Market. As previously reported in the Companys Current Report on Form 8-K filed November 3, 2004, the Company is not in compliance with the same NASDAQ requirements as a result of the Companys failure to file its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2004 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. NASDAQ rules permit the Company to request a hearing with a NASDAQ Listing Qualifications Panel (the "Panel") to appeal NASDAQs decision to delist the Companys common stock. The Company has made such an appeal. As part of the appeal, the Company requested an extension until January 31, 2005 to file both its Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2004 and its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended October 31, 2004. A hearing on that appeal was held before the Panel on December 9, 2004. The Panel has not rendered a decision on the Companys appeal. The Companys common stock will remain listed on the NASDAQ National Market pending the outcome of the Companys appeal. The Company is working diligently to complete the preparation and audit of its financial statements for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2004 and the quarter ended October 31, 2004 and to file it s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2004 and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended October 31, 2004 as promptly as possible. If the Companys request for an extension until January 31, 2005 is granted, the Company believes that it will be able to complete and file those reports by that date. However, the Company can provide no assurances that the NASDAQ Listing Qualifications Panel will grant the Companys request for continued listing. On December 23, 2004, the Company issued a press release, attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 99.1, reporting that the Company received the letter from the NASDAQ Stock Market described in this Current Report on Form 8-K.

PEABODY, MA (December 23, 2004)  Analogic Corporation (NASDAQ: ALOGE), a designer and manufacturer of high-precision health and security imaging equipment, announced that, as expected, it has received a NASDAQ staff determination letter indicating that Analogic is not in compliance with the NASDAQ requirements for continued listing set forth in NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14) as a result of its failure to file its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended October 31, 2004, with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On January 14, 2005, Analogic Corporation (the "Company") issued a press release containing certain information about revenues for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004. The full text of the press release issued in connection with the announcement is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K. The information in Item 2.02 of this Form 8-K and the Exhibit attached hereto shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act, except as expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
Item 4.02. Non-Reliance on Previously Issued Financial Statements or a Related Audit Report or Completed Interim Review.
On January 14, 2005, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Audit Committee") and the management of the Company concluded that previously issued financial statements of the Company included in its Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2002 and July 31, 2003 and in its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the interim fiscal periods ended October 31, January 31 and April 30 within those fiscal years, and all earnings releases and similar communications of the Company relating to all such fiscal periods, should no longer be relied upon. The Audit Committee and the management of the Company determined that the Company must restate the financial statements for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2002 and July 31, 2003 and the interim fiscal periods ended October 31, January 31 and April 30 within those fiscal years to reflect the appropriate accounting treatment for certain transactions by its subsidiary, Camtronics Medical Systems ("Camtronics"). These restatement s will primarily involve a deferral of Camtronics revenues and associated costs from the fiscal period in which they were originally recorded to subsequent fiscal periods. The restatements are required due to the incorrect application of software revenue recognition procedures with respect to certain Camtronics transactions. Under software revenue recognition rules, Camtronics is not permitted to recognize revenue on a multiple-element software arrangement until such time as Camtronics has delivered or performed all elements of the arrangement or has sufficient evidence of fair value for each undelivered or non-performed element of the arrangement. In the majority of the transactions underlying the restatements, Camtronics has delivered and the customer has paid for the software. However, Camtronics is prohibited from recognizing any revenue from the transaction because some element of the transactionsuch as the delivery of a software upgrade or the performance of customization servi ceshas not been delivered or performed or sufficient evidence of fair value for those elements cannot be determined. The Company believes that all of the Camtronics transactions in question represent bona fide customer sales and that the revenue that has been reversed as part of these restatements will be recognized in future fiscal periods. The Audit Committee and the management of the Company discussed the matters disclosed in this filing with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the Companys independent accountants.

PEABODY, MA (January 14, 2005)  Analogic Corporation (NASDAQ: ALOGE), a designer and manufacturer of high precision health and security imaging equipment, today provided an update on the status of its financial statements.
On December 13, 2004, Analogic announced that, as a result of its review of customer transactions and revenue recognition procedures followed by its Camtronics Medical Systems ("Camtronics") subsidiary, Analogic concluded that it must revise its previously announced operating results for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2004 ("fiscal 2004") and that it must restate its financial statements on file with the SEC for each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2004.
Analogic has now concluded that it will restate its financial statements for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2002 and 2003 and each of the interim periods within those years to reflect the appropriate accounting treatment for some of the Camtronics transactions that have been under review. Those restatements will primarily involve a deferral of Camtronics' revenues and associated costs from the fiscal period in which they were originally recorded to subsequent fiscal periods. As a result, investors should no longer rely on Analogic's prior earnings releases or financial statements for those periods.
Analogic currently estimates that its revenues for fiscal 2002 will be $1.2 million lower than the $306.1 million originally reported, and that its revenues for fiscal 2003 will be $0.2 million higher than the $471.5 million originally reported.
Analogic will issue another press release describing complete results of operations for fiscal 2002, fiscal 2003, fiscal 2004 and the first quarter of fiscal 2005 ended October 31, 2004, including the changes to the revenues and net income originally reported for those periods, once it has completed the revisions to and preparation of those financial statements. Analogic will also file amended reports with the SEC containing the necessary restatements of its historical financial statements for those periods, as well as each of the first three quarters of those fiscal years, as promptly as practicable.
The restatements are required due to the incorrect application of software revenue recognition procedures with respect to certain Camtronics transactions. Under software revenue recognition rules, Camtronics is not permitted to recognize revenue on a multiple-element software arrangement until such time as Camtronics has delivered or performed all elements of the arrangement or has sufficient evidence of fair value for each undelivered or non-performed element of the arrangement. In the majority of the transactions underlying the restatement, Camtronics has delivered and the customer has paid for the software. However, Camtronics is prohibited from recognizing any revenue from the transaction because some element of the transaction  such as the delivery of a software upgrade or the performance of customization services  has not been delivered or performed or sufficient evidence of fair value for those elements cannot be determined. Analogic believes that all the Camtronics transactions in question represent bona fide customer sales, and that the revenue that has been reversed as part of these restatements will be recognized in future fiscal periods.
This press release contains statements regarding future events or circumstances that involve risks and uncertainties. Those statements are considered "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Act of 1995 and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of that Act.

In addition, the forward-looking statements included in this press release represent Analogic's views as of the date of this press release.

PEABODY, MA (January 31, 2005)  Analogic Corporation (NASDAQ: ALOGE), a leading designer and manufacturer of high precision health and security imaging equipment, today is reporting restated revenues and earnings for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended July 31, 2004, and its fiscal years ended July 31, 2002 and 2003. On September 22, 2004, the Company had issued a fourth quarter and fiscal year 2004 earnings release. This release supersedes the September 22 release. Investors should not rely on that earnings release or any other previously issued earnings releases for fiscal 2004, 2003, or 2002. All numbers set forth in this release have been restated.
Revenues for the fourth quarter ended July 31, 2004, were $102,235,000, compared with the prior year's fourth-quarter revenues of $81,656,000, an increase of $20,579,000 or 25%. Net income for the fourth quarter was $3,904,000, or $.29 per diluted share, compared with $1,674,000, or $.11 per diluted share, for the prior year's fourth quarter. The improvement was due to a modest increase in the Company's security systems sales and general growth in the sales of medical imaging equipment, including computed tomography subsystems, clinical ultrasound systems, digital radiography systems, and patient monitoring systems.
Revenues for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2004, were $355,557,000, compared with the prior year's record revenues of $471,697,000, a decrease of $116,140,000, or 25%. Net income for the fiscal year was $8,354,000, or $.62 per diluted share, compared with $49,531,000, or $3.70 per diluted share, for the same period a year ago, a decrease of $41,177,000.
On October 14, 2004, the Company stated in a news release that in the course of preparing its Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company further evaluated certain information leading it to question whether appropriate revenue recognition procedures had been followed in all cases by its Camtronics Medical Systems ("Camtronics") subsidiary, a supplier of advanced cardiac information management systems. As a result, the Company conducted an additional review of certain Camtronics transactions and the revenue recognition procedures followed, which led to a delay in completing the preparation and audit of its financial statements for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2004. On December 13, 2004, Analogic announced that, as a result of its review of customer transactions and revenue recognition procedures followed by Camtronics, the Company would revise previously announced operating results for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2004 and restate its financial statements for each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2004.
As announced in a news release dated January 14, 2005, Analogic is also restating its financial statements for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2002 and 2003, and each of the interim periods within these fiscal years to reflect the appropriate accounting treatment for certain Camtronics transactions that have been under review.
Analogic will file amended reports with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) containing the necessary restatements of its historical financial statements for fiscal 2002 and 2003 and the first three quarters of fiscal 2004 as promptly as possible.
The restatements for fiscal 2002 and 2003, and in large part for fiscal 2004, are required due to the incorrect application of software revenue recognition procedures with respect to certain Camtronics transactions. Under software revenue recognition rules, Camtronics is not permitted to recognize revenue on a multiple-element software arrangement until such time as Camtronics has delivered or performed all elements of the arrangement or has sufficient evidence of fair value for each undelivered or non-performed element of the arrangement. In the majority of the transactions underlying the restatement, Camtronics has delivered and the customer has paid for the software. However, Camtronics is prohibited from recognizing any revenue from the transaction because some element of the transaction  such as the delivery of a software upgrade or the performance of customization services  has not been delivered or performed or sufficient evidence of fair value for those elements cannot be determined. Analogic believes that all the Camtronics transactions in question represent bona fide customer sales, and that the revenue that has been reversed as part of these restatements will be recognized in future fiscal periods.
Fiscal 2004 also includes a restatement of revenue recognized by the Company during the quarter with respect to the Company's affiliate Shenzhen Anke High-Tech, Ltd. ("SAHCO"). During the first quarter of fiscal 2004 the Company recorded engineering revenue of $2,800,000 in connection with a license of intellectual property to SAHCO. The agreement between the Company and SAHCO provided for extended payment terms requiring SAHCO to make an initial payment of $500,000 with the remaining balance due over the following twelve months. Upon further review of the agreement and applicable accounting standards, the Company determined that this license revenue should not have been recorded in its entirety at the date of the contract but as payments were received from SAHCO. As of July 31, 2004, the Company had received $1,750,000 in payments from SAHCO. During the first quarter ended October 31, 2004, the Company received an additional $750,000 in payments.
The financial statements set forth below depicts the effects of the combined restatement on selected Income Statement and Balance Sheet items:
John Wood, President and CEO noted, "The decreases in revenue and income from year to year were consistent with what we had expected. Last year we reported record revenue and net income due to extraordinary shipments of EXplosive Assessment Computed Tomography (EXACT) systems for use in certified Explosive Detection Systems (EDS) that screen checked luggage for aircraft. We shipped a record 446 EXACT systems to L-3 Communications last year to help airports comply with the mandates of the Aviation and Transportation Security Act of 2001. During Fiscal 2004, only 40 EXACT systems were shipped, resulting in a year-over-year revenue decrease of approximately $173,000,000. That decrease was partially offset by a 21% growth in our medical business. We experienced solid growth in the sales of ultrasound systems and subsystems, CT subsystems, digital radiography systems, patient and fetal monitors, and embedded signal-processing systems.
"We believe that we are establishing a broader foundation for long-term growth. The sale of over 400 EXACT units in fiscal 2003 was seen by many as a short-term, one-time benefit for Analogic. We saw this windfall in revenue and profit as an opportunity to increase our investment in our next-generation medical technology and to establish a leadership position in the development of advanced security systems."
In Fiscal 2003, the Company began designing and developing the COBRA, an innovative, compact, CT-based automatic threat detection system to examine carry-on baggage for aircraft as well as carry-in items for public buildings such as courthouses, embassies, and corporate offices. In January 2004 a COBRA prototype was tested with real weapons and explosives in the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) laboratory, where the system performed beyond expectations. We expect the TSA to place a COBRA system in a major airport in the very near future for a field trial, and believe that the TSA will shortly establish performance requirements for the next generation of carry-on screening devices. We hope to be able to submit the COBRA for certification testing during the first half of fiscal 2006.
During fiscal 2004, Analogic entered into an agreement with a leading prime contractor to design and develop prototypes of continuous performance enhancements for EDS systems already deployed in airports across the country, a program funded by a grant from the TSA. Those enhancements are targeted for certification testing and initial production over the course of the next twelve months. The Company separately received an award from the TSA to design the next generation of innovative explosive detection systems for checked luggage that could be deployed over the next two to five years. After fiscal year end, the TSA awarded the Company a cooperative agreement in support of its Manhattan II project. Manhattan II is a TSA program that seeks to identify and support the development of revolutionary technologies into deployable systems that will provide significantly enhanced automatic threat-detection and discrimination capabilities for scanning checked luggage carried on aircraft and in other applications. Wood noted that the award was a strong testament to the Company's past and current programs with the TSA. "It is a clear indication that the agency believes in our engineering capabilities and technological leadership, and it further validates our role as an important resource for them," said Wood.
In fiscal 2004 the Company continued to invest in higher levels of research and development in a number of medical areas as well. Analogic is developing new medical CT systems for evolving niche markets, and work continues at PhotoDetection Systems on a new Positron Emission Tomography (PET) system that employs innovative detector technology and can be combined with a CT for a new generation of hybrid PET/CTs. New Digital Radiography (DR) systems are being developed for ANEXA, the digital imaging subsidiary established early in the fiscal year. Work is also continuing on a number of advances in high-performance subsystems for multi-slice CT, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and DR, including extremely low-noise detector plates. The Company is continuing to develop a number of advanced ultrasound transducers and is working on the next generation of clinical ultrasound systems, as well as a unique ultrasound mammography system that could eliminate the need for many breast biopsies.
Wood concluded, "We are pleased with what we have accomplished to date in growing our medical business and believe that the steps we have taken in the past year will substantially enhance our opportunities for long-term growth as ."

FOR IMMEDIATE WORLDWIDE RELEASE
For Further Information, Contact: John J. Millerick Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Treasurer (978) 977-3000
Analogic Corporation Announces Sale of Cedara Software Corp. Shares
PEABODY, MA (February 17, 2005)  John Wood, President and Chief Executive Officer of Analogic Corporation (NASDAQ: ALOG), announced today that Analogic has sold the 4,580,461 shares representing its 14.6% interest in Cedara Software Corp. (TSX:CDE/ NASDAQ: CDSW), of Mississauga, Ontario, Canada. The Company realized net proceeds of $50,751,508 (U.S.) from the sale.
"Analogic originally invested in Cedara in September 2001 to secure access to leading-edge medical imaging software," Wood said. "As a result of Cedara's dramatic turnaround under the direction and leadership of Abe Schwartz and his management team, Cedara no longer requires Analogic's ongoing support. Analogic has met and anticipates that it will continue to meet its goals and objectives in medical imaging software through various contractual arrangements and strategic alliances without the need to maintain an ownership interest in Cedara."
Cedara recently signed a long-term contract to provide its advanced image-processing software to Analogic and its subsidiaries, including ANEXA Corporation, which provides next-generation, digital imaging solutions to select end-user markets such as orthopedic and trauma centers. Cedara and ANEXA also recently entered into a cooperative agreement whereby the direct sales organizations of the two companies will promote each other's products and work jointly to offer end users in the North American market complete, integrated imaging solutions.
Analogic acquired a 19% interest in Cedara in September 2001, in return for an equity investment of $7,500,000 (U.S.) and other considerations. In May 2002, the Company acquired an additional 580,641 shares to maintain its equity interest at 19%. In fiscal 2004, the Company's percentage of Cedara's total shares outstanding decreased to 14.6%. When Cedara completed an equity offering of common shares in March 2004, Analogic did not exercise its preemptive right to maintain its ownership interest at 19%.
Analogic Corporation is a leading designer and manufacturer of advanced health and security systems and subsystems sold primarily to Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs). The Company is recognized worldwide for advancing the state of the art in Computed Tomography (CT), Digital Radiography (DR), Ultrasound, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Patient Monitoring, Cardiovascular Information Management, and Embedded Multiprocessing.

PEABODY, MA (March 10, 2005)  Analogic Corporation (NASDAQ: ALOG), a leading designer and manufacturer of high-precision health and security imaging equipment, announced today results for its second quarter ended January 31, 2005.
Revenues for the second quarter ended January 31, 2005, were $84,316,000, compared with the prior year's second quarter revenues of $92,641,000, a decrease of 9%. The net loss for the second quarter was $3,710,000, or a $0.27 net loss per diluted share. This compares with a net income of $4,911,000, or $0.37 per diluted share, for the prior year's second quarter.
Revenues for the six months ended January 31, 2005, were $168,407,000, compared with the prior year's six-month revenues of $164,350,000, an increase of 2%. The net loss for the six-month period was $3,545,000, or a $0.26 net loss per diluted share, compared with a profit of $3,310,000, or $0.25 per diluted share, for the same period a year ago.
Sales of the Company's clinical ultrasound systems, advanced data acquisition systems for computed tomography, and power systems for magnetic resonance imaging surpassed the prior year's very strong second quarter. Sales of cardiac information management systems, patient monitors, and digital radiography detector plates and systems, however, declined from their strong performance a year earlier.
John Wood, President and CEO, commented, "The results for the quarter did not meet our original expectations. Sales were lower than expected in several areas. Camtronics sales slowed noticeably during the period. Sales of Digital Radiography (DR) systems through our ANEXA subsidiary and DR subsystems through our Anrad subsidiary were also slower than originally expected during the quarter, and shipments of patient monitors to a leading OEM customer were not as robust as anticipated."
Operating costs were somewhat higher for the quarter due to our continuing investment in research and development. The investment required to develop a new generation of selenium technology for digital radiography has been greater than anticipated. In addition, we accelerated development of a new generation of medical CT systems. General and Administrative costs were also up, primarily due to expenses incurred in connection with the review of Camtronics' revenue recognition procedures.
Wood said that while this quarter has clearly been a disappointment, we believe we are on the right course. ANEXA and Anrad exhibited at the world's largest radiology trade show during the quarter, introducing several major products, including the SyneRad OMNI DR system and the GR17 detector plate, respectively. ANEXA's OMNI uses the GR17, the selenium detector with the largest image area in the industry. These products are not scheduled to ship in production volumes until the fourth quarter. Digital radiography continues to offer us many opportunities. The first operating prototype of a new generation of CT systems recently produced its first images. Security system sales should be stronger for the next several quarters. During the first quarter we received a $26,000,000 order for EXACT systems to be shipped during calendar 2005. Shortly after the close of the second quarter, however, we received an additional $25,000,000 order for EXACT systems to be delivered by February 2006, and a request to fulfill the first order by the end of June 2005.
We are confident of opportunities for substantial long-term growth in security. The explosives detection system upgrade kit Analogic is developing with Lockheed Martin under a Transportation Security Administration (TSA) grant is scheduled for certification testing in the near future. The COBRA checkpoint security system, which we have developed independently, is expected to go into government field trials within the next several months. Meanwhile, we continue work under another TSA grant to develop a new generation of explosives detection systems scheduled for delivery in fiscal 2007. During the quarter, the TSA awarded Analogic a cooperative agreement in support of its Manhattan II project. This project seeks to identify and support the development of revolutionary technologies into deployable systems that will provide significantly enhanced automatic threat-detection and discrimination capabilities for scanning checked luggage carried on board aircraft and other security applications. The Manhattan II system is targeted for delivery in 2011.
"We are not pleased with the results for this quarter," said Wood, "but we remain confident that our aggressive development of a number of new medical and security imaging systems will complement the growth in our subsystems business and provide the basis for substantial long-term growth for the Company."

Thanks, Alex. With respect to the Company's results of operations, the Company is today reporting its financial results for the second quarter ending January 31, 2005.
Revenues for the second quarter ended January 31, 2005, were $84,316,000 compared to the prior year's second-quarter revenues of $92,641,000, a decrease of 9%. The net loss for the second quarter was $3,710,000 or $0.27 per diluted share. This compares with net income of $4,911,000 or $0.37 per diluted share for the prior year's second-quarter.
Revenues for the six months ended July 31, 2005 were $168,407,000, compared with the prior year's six month revenues of $164,350,000, an increase of 2%. The net loss for the six-month period was $3,000,545 (ph) or $0.26 per diluted share, compared with a profit of 3,310,000 or $0.25 per diluted share for the same period a year ago.
Sales of the Company's clinical ultrasound systems advanced data acquisitions systems for computer tomography and power systems for magnetic resonance imaging surpassed the prior year's strong second-quarter sales. Sales of cardiac information management systems, patient monitors, and digital radiography, detector plates and systems however declined from their strong performance a year earlier.
Overall gross margin as a percentage of revenues for the three and six months ended January 31, 2005 was 38 and 37.7% compared to 42.7 and 41.7% for the same periods in the prior year. The reduction of approximately 4% in gross margin for both the three and six-month periods when compared to the prior years was primarily due to the positive impact in the prior year of $1.5 million of guaranteed gross margin by an OEM customer and the reversal of $2 million of warranty accruals related to pre-existing warranties which were no longer required.
In addition, the Company realized significantly higher margins on customer funded engineering project in prior years.
Operating expenses were higher during the quarter, primarily due to our continuing investment in research and development, an asset impairment charge in the quarter and increased general and administrative costs. With respect to research and development expenses, the investment required to develop a new generation of selenium technology for digital radiography has been greater than originally anticipated. In addition, the Company has accelerated development of a new generation of medical CT systems.
The Company also recorded an asset impairment charge of approximately $1 million during the quarter related to the change in accounting method for the Company's investment in photo detection systems from the equity to the cost method of accounting and the requirement to evaluate this investment the net realizable value of this investment. Prior to the effective date of the change in accounting method, the Company had recorded its proportionate share of PDS losses as research and product development expenses.
General administrative expenses were also higher during the quarter primarily due to $1.5 million of expenses incurred in connection with the Company's review of its Camtronics revenue recognition procedures.
With respect to the financial condition of the Company, as of January 31, 2005 the Company's current ratio and debt to equity ratio were 4.0 to 1 and 0.25 to 1 respectively. These financial ratios are consistent with the prior quarters. At the end of the second quarter the Company had cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $225.5 million. This compares to $193.8 million at the end of the first quarter and 176.6 million at the end of July 31, 2004.
During the second quarter ended July 31, 2004, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities increased by $31.7 million. This increase during the quarter was primarily the result of the Company recording its investment and Cedera Software Corporation at its fair market value of $49 million, in reclassing this investment from a long-term to a short-term asset. The increase in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities was offset to some extent by an increase in inventory levels to meet anticipated demand and reductions in short-term liabilities, dividend payments, tax payments, trade payables during the quarter.
Subsequent to the end of the second quarter the Company divested its investment in Cedera Software Corporation. As a result of this divestiture, the Company received cash proceeds of $50,751,000 and realized a net gain of approximately $43,850,000. Overall the Company continues to maintain a strong balance sheet and liquidity position.
At this point, I will turn the call back John Wood, our President and Chief Executive Officer.
John Wood
- Analogic Corporation  President and CEO
Thank you very much, John. In reviewing the operational details of this quarter I would like to start with Camtronics. We are very pleased that the investigation of the financials and the restatement is behind us. This was extensive. It was very time-consuming on management's part and the Board's part but it had to be done to ensure that you, the shareholder, had accurate financials which we submitted to the SEC and we're pleased to have that done.
We have made a number of operational changes at Camtronics. We have new management. Dan Webster, a very seasoned manager, is President of Camtronics. He comes to us after a successful career at EG&G, later PerkinElmer. David Stephenson is our new Vice President of Finance. He comes to us from VIASYS, and a company in Madison (ph), Bimedical. Two strong players.
We have changes that work in the sales organization and as you can imagine with a shadow over Camtronics, competitors have used this to their advantage. So we are out telling folks that we are alive and well and working on rebuilding confidence in that business. And Dan Webster is spending about a week per month on the road visiting customers. I have made several trips to Camtronics and we have made a reduction in force there of about 35 people to pull our expenses in line with our run rate and I think our reorganization of the business is well underway and we've implemented training procedures to avoid a recurrence of the software revenue recognition issues that got us into the situation in the first place.
Let me move on to medical subsystems. As noted in our press release we have a number of highlights in that our ultrasound business, our Data Acquisition Systems, magnetic resonance imaging power supplies, those businesses were all up in the quarter. On the negative side, cardiac imaging namely Camtronics understandably their revenues were down. Patient monitors we shipped less and also digital radiology, we shipped less. And I'll get into that into more detail.
But perhaps the principal reason for our loss and certainly while a disappointment, I want to underscore that our R&D and engineering development is a conscious decision we have made at the Company to push hard to develop products that will provide you with enhanced growth and earnings. And specifically engineering expenses for our medical CT we have had some very nice results this last week in that new medical CT scanner that we have developed has produced its first images.
We're cultivating a new OEM customer for this product plus we have direct niche market plans in areas such as orthopedics and urology and are very pleased with the progress we have made in a CT scanner that will hit a price point in a market niche that we believe is going to be a real success.
Anrad, our operation in Montreal is producing direct conversion x-ray plates has received FDA approval for the 17 by 17 inch plate. This produces the highest quality images we believe in the business. We are pursuing other opportunities there in fluoroscopy, mammography, but we have a significant spend there as our delivery rate of these plates is not sufficient to cover the sustaining and the new product development engineering.
But having said that we are quite encouraged by the performance we're seeing in the field and working hard to continue that development not only for our OEM customers but also we are a customer in that ANEXA has just introduced a product we expect to be shipping May/June then incorporate this 17 inch plate.
B-K Medical is working hard on a number of new ultrasound consoles, a whole variety of these at different price points and performance levels. John Millerick and I were over in Denmark for an operational review the week before last and are pleased with what we see there.
On the securities side, we are operating under a number of grants from the TSA and the nature of the grant is that you are expected to cover a significant fraction of the cost internally. In other words, the grant does not cover all the expenses of development so we have to cover that plus we have our own completely internally funded programs, COBRA for carryon baggage being one. And I will provide more details on that.
So again to underscore, significant engineering spend on a number of exciting programs really aimed at a couple of areas. If you look at our 10-K for the year ending July 31, you'll see that our top five customers comprised 46% of revenues, the top 10, 61%. And while we value these customers immensely, Toshiba being the largest at 12% of sales, we also recognize that we need to continue to develop a direct presence to develop improved margins and also reduce our dependency on a handful of customers.
So let's touch on this direct strategy. ANEXA is our initiative in digital radiography and frankly they are behind schedule. We thought that we would have sold more of these products at this point. We have examined the reasons why. We have installed 13 systems to date. Ten in the United States, three in China. In the United States, they are in California, Arizona, Massachusetts, Ohio, Florida, elsewhere. We have a backlog of eight additional systems and pending orders of we believe of another dozen or so systems.
We've gotten excellent market reception in that customers provide us good feedback not only on the equipment but the quality of our applications people, of our service support. But having said that, we only have a half dozen people in the field doing selling and we have zeroed in on that as the problem. We need more exposure. So our plan is to ramp the sales force up to redouble our activity to improve the exposure because digital radiology is here to stay. There are a number of competitors in the field, both small and large. Clearly it has been validated as a valid market and we believe with the quality of our images and the fact that we directly produce this new plate that I mentioned gives us a real advantage.
We also have introduced recently been a new patient monitor for doing impedance cardiography, determining characteristics of heart by a noninvasive technique. We introduced that unit four months ago and we've sold about 150 systems and we are working on expanded distribution either directly or through OEM customers.
Turning to security, you've seen previously announced in quarter one we received an additional 50 unit order from L-3 Communications. Just after the close of Q2, we received another 50 unit order. One thing that impacted our Q2 results is because of a gap from previous orders, we only shipped seven of our EXACT explosive detection systems in Q2, but with these additional orders the ship rate has increased dramatically. In fact our expectations are to ship 24 of these machines in the current third quarter and we expect that to increase by about 50% to 36 machines in the fourth quarter.
We are pleased at the reception. L-3 Communications has done a first-class job of addressing in a market not only here but also internationally. With stepped-up quotation activity, they received an order for a dozen units at the Narita Airport. We think there is more where that came from and we believe in short that we have the best check baggage EDS system out there and it is about to get better in the following way.
We have been under grant from the TSA through Lockheed Martin Corporation to develop an upgrade kit that provides a whole series of enhancements regarding things we have learned over the last few years and we are in trials now with the government seeking certification and approval of this system and expect that this will be field and provide a significantly enhanced performance for this product.
Our COBRA system has historically been running behind. It has been very frustrating for all of us because of a failure of the government to set standards; however, this was in the headlines over the weekend and some of you may have seen that Representative Hal Rogers of Kentucky who is Chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security grilled the Administrator of the TSA, Admiral Stone, with comments such as our "patience is over". "When are you going to get these machines into the airport?"
And our upgrade kit is mentioned (technical difficulty) are now used at airports Stone said, "this upgrade will significantly increase throughput capacity, reduce alarm rates, and significantly enhance the image quality presented to our screeners," he said. So we are happy that they are on the case. TSA as a result of this congressional hearing is under pressure to spend more money on more check baggage machines and also to step up the activity on carryon baggage. In fact we have just received the word that our COBRA machine, which has been under test at the TSA's laboratory in Atlantic City, New Jersey, will be moved into the field for an airport test right in our backyard here at Boston's Logan airport.
So we are happy that the TSA is finally starting to move here and we hope that that will lead to certification standards that we can meet and begin to move toward production of this very important product because of threats, the increased threats and concerns about suicide bombers such as the two Chechen women who brought down Soviet airliners  it is a very real concern.
Also in the security area, we have had activity regarding our infra-red countermeasure system to shoulder launched infra-red guided missiles and mainly a Rand report published in the last few months said that it would be incredibly expensive and penalized aircraft performance to outfit the 6800 commercial airliners in the U.S. with the active systems that involve lasers and a very expensive multi heavy system. Effectively the airlines have resisted this and are seeking an alternative and our team has been down this week talking to congressional staffers about language in the current budget that would state that an assessment of other technologies, namely ours, would be incorporated in the current bill. So we are pleased to see that.
On the security side, I would add that we have hired a Washington-based consulting firm called Layman Group which is headed by John Layman, former Secretary of the Navy under President Reagan to assist us in our Washington affairs on security both on the explosive detection system as well as a missile counter measure. In fact this week we had meetings with the staff of our local congressmen, Meehan and Tierney as well as Senator Kennedy. So we see opportunities to increase our profile here and believe that that will bear fruit again as we move to continue to supply L-3 with a very high-quality product and also seek direct outlets for our other products.
So if I could summarize our operations, I would say as follows. We have had some extraordinary expenses; the Camtronics restatement, the work necessary to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. On the other hand we have had some other expenses while maybe not ordinary are ones that we have consciously made, and that is an aggressive engineering spend in the medical CT, digital radiology, ultrasound, (technical difficulty) and marketing of the sort I just mentioned. And in Washington related to security systems, as well as our medical and ANEXA activity.
So to wrap up, certainly we appreciate that a $0.27 loss is a big disappointment but I want to stress that we believe that we can endure some short-term pain to enhance our long-term prospects for growth and profitability by continuing to invest in these important programs and we are very encouraged by the market prospects.
On the cash side, as John said, we achieved almost a $44 million gain and just under 51 million in cash. We are clearly in a strong cash position. We know that you did not invest in Analogic because you thought that we were a bank and that we need to put this cash to work. I think I mentioned previously that at the beginning of January we were joined by a full-time mergers and acquisitions specialist who has been quite busy and we are exploring acquisitions both from the medical and the security side and very pleased with the flow of opportunities that we see.
We have a new director. We are very pleased to have Jim Judge, who is the Chief Financial Officer of NSTAR, which is our local power utility who has joined us. He has a very strong financial background and very pleased to see Jim on board.
I want to mention quickly that our annual meeting is on April 4. We hope that you will join us. We would like to not only explain in more detail our strategy and tactics but also would offer you a chance to tour the facility, see some of our products and view the status of some of these important developments firsthand. And of course that is provided that the snow has melted in Boston. We hope that we can arrange that by then.
So, operator, at this point we would like to open the floor for questions.
QUESTION AND ANSWER
Operator
(OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS) Arnold Ursaner of CJS Securities.
Arnold Ursaner
- CJS Securities  Analyst
Good morning. One quick question if I may on ANEXA. You were down year-over-year even though you're going up and it's only your second year in existence and comps were not that tough. Can you perhaps explain a little more what happened there?
John Wood
- Analogic Corporation  President and CEO
Yes, I can or at least I can offer a theory. When we first introduce a product we had some early adopters. We were at the RSNA show a year ago in November. At this RSNA show (technical difficulty) to ship it until May/June as I mentioned, so I wonder if we haven't violated the old precept that you don't sell anything that you don't have on the wagon. So we may have some folks waiting to see the new product off and running.
Also we have looked very closely at the sales force and determined that some of our sales reps are more effective than others and we are working to optimize that to pick up some additional salespeople, possibly some additional dealers. But we did hit a flat spot and I believe it's in anticipation of this new product.
Arnold Ursaner
- CJS Securities  Analyst
And I'm sure you have a lot of people on the call but one more quick question if I can. On the  traditionally engineering revenues is a pretty good lead indicator of where your business is heading. They were down a little and I know there is a shift within the way your customers are handling the funding of your R&D. Could you explain a little more what is happening with engineering revenues?
John Wood
- Analogic Corporation  President and CEO
I would have to look at the numbers to be more specific but you are right, in the following way. I think we see less of large front-end loaded engineering projects followed by production. I think perhaps there is a trend to the customers perhaps spend less at the front-end and we can get some better margins at the tail end. Also I will repeat that with the TSA as I mentioned earlier, it is expected from the very beginning that this is a significant cost share, so that reduces it. But let me turn it over to John.
John Millerick
- Analogic Corporation  SVP, CFO and Treasurer
I think what we're finding is that over time, less and less  fewer OEMs are coming forward and really putting up their own money. We're having to find that we're having to do more spend on our own, which basically goes back into the amount of spend in terms of research and development. Also in terms of the TSA, the TSA is funding us. We're getting more funding in the security side, but they are only funding portions of the project. So we are not seeing as much engineering revenue as we have seen heretofore.
Arnold Ursaner
- CJS Securities  Analyst
Thank you.
Operator
Eric Miller with Heartland Advisers.
Eric Miller
- Heartland Advisors  Analyst
Yes, a couple questions really more relating to sort of strategy and running the business. First one is on the R&D side. And John, you mentioned  excited about a couple projects there. I'm just curious what type of hurdle rates  you are spending 17% of sales on R&D, $60 million say run right  which for a $350 million sales company is a huge amount. At what point do you say hey, this is a worthwhile project from a hurdle rate or from a timing perspective to invest those dollars?
And then the second question would relate to when you talk, John, about putting cash to work through an acquisition, but the idea that here we are and I'm assuming with all of this R&D that you're at least looking at a minimum $2.00 a share run rate in earnings at sometime down on the road whether that's 12 months or 18 months, who knows? But I can't believe you would be spending 60 million in R&D with at least that not as a minimum. And then if you would then just do back of the envelope math on that run right, you are trading today at about 6.5 enterprise value to EBITDA.
So the question would be if you're looking at acquisitions and I don't know what you would pay, but if you're looking at acquisitions at 8 or 9 times enterprise value EBITDA, I would sort of wonder why you're not buying your stock back at 6.5 times enterprise value to EBITDA?
John Wood
- Analogic Corporation  President and CEO
Let's touch on R&D first. We evaluate each program individually. We have some targets that may not be the same for all of them for internal rate of return. I don't want to give you the impression that we never saw a development program that we didn't like. In fact, we have shut some down. I can give you an example. We decided that mammography from an overall system's viewpoint is so intensely competitive now that we have suspended, shelved a project that we had there saving a significant run rate.
And we have a number of other examples for a particular medical CT we decided not to go forward with to change the design, so we try to play triage officer there and make sure that we have good prospects for these products before going forward.
You are right, our R&D spend as a percentage of sales was quite high and it reflects our confidence that we have got some winner products under the roof here and looking forward to getting them out there as quick as we can.
The issue of a stock repurchase has come up before the Board. They have not elected to pursue that but I think it is all a question of stock price and perceived value.
Operator
Todd Peters (ph) with American Century (ph).
Todd Peters
- American Century (ph)  Analyst
My question concerns your commentary on lower shipments to an OEM customer. Can you go into a little more explanation? Is there inventory at that customer? It there  your end market seeing a product transition going on perhaps?
John Millerick
- Analogic Corporation  SVP, CFO and Treasurer
Let me just come back. Are you referring to my comments regarding the guaranteed margin?
Todd Peters
- American Century (ph)  Analyst
No, no, in your press release you say that there were lower shipments at a patient monitor to a leading OEM customer were not as robust as anticipated.
John Millerick
- Analogic Corporation  SVP, CFO and Treasurer
Okay, I think we can .
John Wood
- Analogic Corporation  President and CEO
That is correct. One of our OEM customers decided to pull that work in-house. So in time there is a transition out of our shop and they have adopted a different design. Now having said that, we have the ability to sell the existing design ourselves with some modification and we are pursuing other OEMs. But that was a significant issue for us.
Todd Peters
- American Century (ph)  Analyst
Was this one of your top 5 or top 10 customers?
John Wood
- Analogic Corporation  President and CEO
It was in the top five.
Todd Peters
- American Century (ph)  Analyst
Okay, thank you.
Operator
Dalton Chandler with Needham Company.
Dalton Chandler
- Needham Company  Analyst
Good morning. Could you be a little more specific about what your plans are for the ANEXA salesforce? If you have a number of sales people in mind that you think would be optimal and when you expect to get there?
John Wood
- Analogic Corporation  President and CEO
Yes, Dalton, I think with a gradual ramp, we believe that on the order of 20 to 24 people would be appropriate to provide national coverage. One thing I forgot to mention, we have just set up distribution in Europe and we have signed a distributor in the Netherlands and I think we either have or are close to booking our first couple of orders there and also we have had activity in the United Kingdom. So we are starting to move in countries outside of the U.S. and China.
But we believe that we have to be a lot more aggressive in a direct force in the United States not only in medicinal radiology and but to be followed by the niche market medical CT that I mentioned aimed at orthopedics, urology and so on.
Dalton Chandler
- Needham Company  Analyst
Okay and in your international distribution then, is that all distributors or are you planning some direct sales people there?
John Wood
- Analogic Corporation  President and CEO
We would use distributors. It would be very hard for us to justify the cost of a direct presence overseas.
Dalton Chandler
- Needham Company  Analyst
And then on the specialty CT product you mentioned it is an orthopedic product. Can you just describe how that is different than a conventional CT system?
John Wood
- Analogic Corporation  President and CEO
Sure, for the orthopedic practice typically a CT there might be used if the patient needs a hip replacement, then a CT scan is made, measurements of the joint and ball and socket are made. And this allows the orthopedic radiologist to refer to a table of orthopedic kit implants and pick the correct size, have that shipped, and be available for the patient's operation. So the key points are the system does not to be very fast. It does not have to have the very long axial field that's being used and sold by the majors for say, during cardiac scans. But it needs to hit a very competitive price target.
So we view this from a couple of viewpoints. One is as we have discussed in the past we don't want to do anything to aggravate our very valuable OEM customers so we would never go out on head-to-head in the general-purpose CT market but rather have found these niches that they have not chose to explore.
Dalton Chandler
- Needham Company  Analyst
From your list of product lines where you did well in the quarter versus the ones that were disappointing it looked like the OEM shipments were very strong in the quarter. Can you talk a little bit more about what's going on there?
John Wood
- Analogic Corporation  President and CEO
I sure can because it is a real highlight and it's something we  except for providing the overall numbers in the K and Q  and I will point out by the way as requested by investors, we have broken out our reporting now so we provide better visibility now in the medical imaging business and the security business. But we've had a very strong period of shipments of Data Acquisition Systems which are really the heart of CT scanners. Of the boxes that are used in MRI machines to produce a very high-quality images and we have worked hard under the leadership of Peter Howard, who joined us a bit over a year ago and some new members of his team to really build and focus very heavily on this handful of very important customers, namely Toshiba, General Electric, Philips, Siemens, and they have been a good job.
And we have been filing money into two new generations of application-specific integrated circuits or ASICS that will continue to pull the cost of these products down and have had real success there.
Dalton Chandler
- Needham Company  Analyst
Okay, what have the margin trends been like recently? Have you seem some stability in those? At the OEM level?
John Wood
- Analogic Corporation  President and CEO
I don't think we've seen any dramatic change, have we, John?
John Millerick
- Analogic Corporation  SVP, CFO and Treasurer
No, they have been pretty much flat.
John Wood
- Analogic Corporation  President and CEO
I think about flat.
Dalton Chandler
- Needham Company  Analyst
Okay and can you give us the breakdown of revenue between medical and security for the quarter?
John Millerick
- Analogic Corporation  SVP, CFO and Treasurer
Yes, hold on. The way we break it down, we break it into Medical Technology Products which includes medical imaging, Camtronics, and B-K. And that was on revenue, that was about 70.8. This will all be set forth in the 10-Q, Dalton. Security products were about 7.6 million. And corporate and other which basically include the hotel and certain other product lines were about 5.8, to come up to 84.3.
Dalton Chandler
- Needham Company  Analyst
Okay and then just a final question, we are now approaching the midpoint of the current quarter. Have you seen improvements in these product areas that disappointed last quarter? Or are things trending about the same? What do you see so far?
John Millerick
- Analogic Corporation  SVP, CFO and Treasurer
I think one of the areas is security and John touched on it earlier in terms of essentially only shipping out about seven units during the quarter and seeing that pick up quite nicely in the third quarter in one area. John, I don't know in terms of ?
John Wood
- Analogic Corporation  President and CEO
I'm not sure we have any dramatic changes in the others, Dalton.
Dalton Chandler
- Needham Company  Analyst
All right, thanks a lot.

Mike Carlotty (ph) with Palmera Capital (ph).
Mike Carlotty
- Palmera Group (ph)  Analyst
Yes, good morning. Just a couple of questions. Tax rate looked like it was about 7% versus the 10% you're guiding to. Is 10 still the number you are thinking about for the rest of the year?
John Millerick
- Analogic Corporation  SVP, CFO and Treasurer
If we factor in Cedera, the gain on Cedera going forward, it will range in the low 30s, probably around 32 or 33%.
Mike Carlotty
- Palmera Group (ph)  Analyst
And without Cedera?
John Millerick
- Analogic Corporation  SVP, CFO and Treasurer
I think we're looking at about 9%, 9.5%
Mike Carlotty
- Palmera Group (ph)  Analyst
And then from the cash-flow statement, what was cash flow from operations and CapEx for the quarter?
John Millerick
- Analogic Corporation  SVP, CFO and Treasurer
If you can give me just one second, I will get. CapEx for the quarter in terms of spend was $3.4 million. Depreciation was just approximated 5 million and just give me one second on terms. What I am looking at right now is the 10-Q draft and I am looking at what the cash flow has done in six months, net cash provided by operating activities for the six months was 13.4, $13.5 million.
Mike Carlotty
- Palmera Group (ph)  Analyst
Okay, I can back into the quarter. And then also, two quarters ago you started giving one quarter out guidance and then last quarter obviously the accounting restatements was a distraction and you weren't able to do that. Are you able to do that for next quarter or is it something you're not going to continue to do going forward?
John Millerick
- Analogic Corporation  SVP, CFO and Treasurer
To be quite honest, I think we got a little ahead of ourselves. I think we gave guidance on the quarter at breakeven guidance and we came in there or thereabouts. I think we would have misspoken if we had given guidance on the previous quarter. As we look forward I think we are basically falling back to a position that it's probably better not to get out in front of ourselves on the guidance.
Mike Carlotty
- Palmera Group (ph)  Analyst
Okay, thank you.
John Wood
- Analogic Corporation  President and CEO
If you notice we have some company there by the way. The March 1 Wall Street Journal has an article that talks about the number of firms providing guidance has declined significantly. So apparently we're not alone in not being able to call it well.
Mike Carlotty
- Palmera Group (ph)  Analyst
Okay, thanks.

David Snyder (ph) with Hoover Investment Management (ph).
David Snyder
- Hoover Investment Management  Analyst
I have some numerical questions. If I were to  you have the hotel embedded in this corporate and other and I was wondering if you had what the hotel was in terms of revenues by itself in the quarter?
John Millerick
- Analogic Corporation  SVP, CFO and Treasurer
Sure, just give us a second. Approximately $1.9 million for the quarter.
David Snyder
- Hoover Investment Management  Analyst
And that would be versus what a year ago?
John Millerick
- Analogic Corporation  SVP, CFO and Treasurer
I'm trying to think back in terms of what it would have been. It probably would have been very similar a year ago.
David Snyder
- Hoover Investment Management  Analyst
And how about in the sequentially pervious quarter which would have been October quarter?
John Millerick
- Analogic Corporation  SVP, CFO and Treasurer
The October quarter would have been probably 2.7 million, there or thereabouts.
David Snyder
- Hoover Investment Management  Analyst
You also do these signal processors, and that is kind of lumped in in that segment. What did you do with signal processors in the quarter?
John Millerick
- Analogic Corporation  SVP, CFO and Treasurer
I'll tell you what. Let us go back and pull the number for you. Just give us a second. It's not something we just have readily  we have the information but we just don't have  it will take us a few minutes to flip a couple of pages. Do you want to go onto another question?
David Snyder
- Hoover Investment Management  Analyst
Okay, on the upgrade kits for the EXACT, would you be sharing the revenues or profitability of that with L-3 or who would you be doing that with?
John Millerick
- Analogic Corporation  SVP, CFO and Treasurer
I will let John  do you want to take that question? That's one I can't .
David Snyder
- Hoover Investment Management  Analyst
The upgrade kits for the EXACT, would you be sharing the economic benefits of that with L-3 or who?
John Wood
- Analogic Corporation  President and CEO
Our grant for the development of this product was through Lockheed Martin, who is a prime to the TSA and it is not clear yet how this will be procured, how the TSA will proceed. And they have several options as far as procurement and deployment. So I cannot answer the question yet except to say that we believe we have a first-class kit that is well-designed and a very nice field upgrade that will involve some combination of Lockheed Martin, L-3, and/or Analogic. So it is really up to the TSA.
John Millerick
- Analogic Corporation  SVP, CFO and Treasurer
Let me come back around to your question that I skipped over on you. In terms of  as I went back through the revenues for Dalton I basically said corporate and other were approximately 5.8 million in the quarter. 1.9 of that would be the hotel and the remainder would be essentially embedded systems.
David Snyder
- Hoover Investment Management  Analyst
Okay, great. So it was 5. What did you say?
John Millerick
- Analogic Corporation  SVP, CFO and Treasurer
Eight.
David Snyder
- Hoover Investment Management  Analyst
So 5.8 less 1.9.
John Millerick
- Analogic Corporation  SVP, CFO and Treasurer
Approximately 3.9.
David Snyder
- Hoover Investment Management  Analyst
Okay so you did 3.9 in signal processors, and that would be versus what in the October quarter and also year ago?
John Millerick
- Analogic Corporation  SVP, CFO and Treasurer
I would have to go back and pull that. Let me get this for you.
David Snyder
- Hoover Investment Management  Analyst
What I'm trying to do  it may sound like really nerdy questions but I'm trying to model your Company in terms of medical versus security.
John Millerick
- Analogic Corporation  SVP, CFO and Treasurer
I'll tell you what, what might help you is when you get a look at our first quarter Q, we basically start  in the segment information we break it out in much more detail than we have done historically.

Okay. The Cedera you're going to pay taxes on the gain I assume?
John Millerick
- Analogic Corporation  SVP, CFO and Treasurer
Yes.
David Snyder
- Hoover Investment Management  Analyst
So what should we do to the cash on the balance sheet or the cash plus marketable securities on the balance sheet that you just reported?
John Millerick
- Analogic Corporation  SVP, CFO and Treasurer
Of the 225 that was reported I think  let me just take a look  I think approximately $42 million would then  the markup in terms of  let me get the correct number for you.
John Wood
- Analogic Corporation  President and CEO
43.8 is the gain.
John Millerick
- Analogic Corporation  SVP, CFO and Treasurer
But from a bookkeeping standpoint, what we were required to do from accounting convention was to basically write up our investment to fair market value and let me just make sure I have got it for you.
David Snyder
- Hoover Investment Management  Analyst
Just wondering if the 226 is going to go down after you visit H&R Block and pay your taxes?
John Millerick
- Analogic Corporation  SVP, CFO and Treasurer
Yes. In terms of the cash proceeds if you do it on the proceeds which was about $51 million, we are going to make our contribution to the government in the range of about 33% of that. So you will  although the financials show a write-up, it is really  it is to meet an accounting requirement. The actual transaction took place in the third quarter and we expect we will most likely be making a tax payment in the third quarter which will reduce the cash proceeds by at least 33%. So the 51 million that we will take in will be reduced by approximately $17 million.
Alex Van Adzin
- Analogic Corporation  VP and General Counsel
That would be on the gain, correct?
John Millerick
- Analogic Corporation  SVP, CFO and Treasurer
No, no, no, it will be .
David Snyder
- Hoover Investment Management  Analyst
Is the COBRA going to be in any more places besides Logan initially?
John Wood
- Analogic Corporation  President and CEO
No, it is at a single site and that is plenty good enough for us. We're just so happy it is in the field under the auspices of the TSA. We have done other testing; in fact we had COBRA at Logan ourselves and collected images of 4000 bags about 1.5 years ago. But it was a test that we ran asking calibers to volunteer. So it's initially a single point but we retain a very strong competitive lead regarding this product which we believe has potentially has other applications.
For instance if there were an incident on a cruise ship or a rail line like the Madrid tragedy, then this product is quite appropriate for screening small size baggage elsewhere. I would add also as a footnote that L-3 has been conducting some trials regarding the bigger machine for cargo of the sort that FedEx or DHL handles and we think that as well as the prospect of screening the U.S. mail in the future in another setting is an opportunity for us.

As you probably know, a company called United Defense Industries is being acquired by BAE Systems and as the U.S. dollar becomes  I guess that's a double negative  more worthless or less worthless  anyway worth less, it becomes easier for foreign companies to acquire American companies and there is a heck of a lot of potential value in your Company. And so if something were to happen, would you be amenable to talking about the sale of your Company?
John Wood
- Analogic Corporation  President and CEO
As you know as CEO I am obligated to maximize shareholder value and so if a valid interest or offer came forward, I am required to present it to the Board.
David Snyder
- Hoover Investment Management  Analyst
Okay, I guess that's all I've got.
John Wood

Michael Martin
- The Small Cap Report  Analyst
Most of my questions have been answered. Just a couple of quick ones. When will you file a 10-Q?
John Wood
- Analogic Corporation  President and CEO
It will be filed on Monday.
Michael Martin
- The Small Cap Report  Analyst
On Monday, thanks. And secondly in the upgrading program, is it likely that the installed base out there will be upgraded sooner rather than later? In other words, in a relatively short period of time rather than stretched out over a number of years?
John Wood
- Analogic Corporation  President and CEO
That is my hope and I will tell you what I know. With the current 100-unit order that we are working off as I mentioned there will be about 650 of the L-3 eXaminers in the field incorporating the Analogic EXACT. We believe a significant number of those are in in-line applications. We are in the baggage haul running really essentially automated and this upgrade kit brings a whole variety of new capability.
I'll give you some examples. It provides a much higher quality image for the screener, allowing the screener to make a decision whether there is a threat in the bag or not much easier. It is networked, so different terminals around the airport can be used to view a potential threat in any scanner.
The TSA has required that we generate image archives, so heaven forbid if an airplane were to come down, we retain images of all the bags that went through for 48 hours. So it incorporates so many new features that we think  in fact what we have seen is when we show this to screeners and regional TSA people, they want it. And so I think that as the word gets out you're going to see more and more of it. And we believe as it shakes it will be a relatively modest cost update (ph) but we believe that with this upgrade the L-3 eXaminer is a far more capable, better performing machine that our competition, which is the GE envision (ph) system.
Michael Martin
- The Small Cap Report  Analyst
Thanks. Pardon me, I got interrupted, but did you indicate that there were some reasons to be hopeful that the medical side of the business could start showing some positive revenue comparisons in the fourth quarter, which don't appear to be happening in current quarter either?
John Wood
- Analogic Corporation  President and CEO
I'll think we indicated anything specifically in the fourth quarter. I think it is going to take a while to get additional people in on the ANEXA side and also a while before we are able to introduce a new medical CT. So I would not raise that prospect.

Dan Loeb (ph) with AmTrust Financial.
Dan Loeb
- AmTrust Financial  Analyst
Good morning. A few questions. Firstly to Eric Miller's original question, can I assume from your answer that the Board has looked at stock repurchases and has chosen not to that any acquisition that you're looking at will be purchased at less than the 6 to 6.5 multiple of EBITDA?
John Wood
- Analogic Corporation  President and CEO
I think that is taking the analysis a little too far. We would have to be further down the road with an acquisition prospect to decide whether it is going to the accretive or whether we are willing to accept a dilutive situation because we believe it is going to grow into a positive EPS, so I would not represent that the Board has looked at it from that viewpoint.
Dan Loeb
- AmTrust Financial  Analyst
Okay and so you also have no kind of acquisition criteria built in? Everything is as needed basis?
John Wood
- Analogic Corporation  President and CEO
I would say we have several criteria and that we have minority investments in some up-and-coming technologies such as positron emission tomography, the PET scanner, so we have made investments in companies, technologies, I could imagine an acquisition of a tiny company that really didn't have a product yet.
On the other end of the spectrum, with our reserve of cash if we can make a significant acquisition of a company that would generate real sales and earnings, then that might be subject to the more traditional analysis of what is the maximum we could pay to generate shareholder value. And then that gets into the EBITDA multiples that Eric had mentioned earlier.
Dan Loeb
- AmTrust Financial  Analyst
Okay you've done a great job in harvesting the value of Cedera. Where do you stand on the hotel? Hotel valuations today are quite high. Can we expect you harvesting that investment and if not, why not?
John Millerick
- Analogic Corporation  SVP, CFO and Treasurer
Let me say this. I think you're looking at  when you use the term investment for Cedera and for the hotel, they mean different things to us. When we invested in Cedera it was a strategic investment. We determined that in the long run we did not need to have an investment in order to reach our objectives. So we basically made a decision to divest.
With respect to the hotel, we have headed as an asset of the company for some time. We have looked at it from time to time in terms of whether or not we would divest it. The Board has chosen not to divest it and although the market has picked up, we have not seen it picked up substantially in this area to increase the value of the hotel over the last couple of years.
Dan Loeb
- AmTrust Financial  Analyst
Okay and lastly you, John, since you have been on board, The Company has spend heavily in R&D. We understand the Company's strategy, but yet we have not seen the fruits in terms of the earnings and the earning power of the Company. Can you tell us at least when you think we can expect to see those kinds of returns?
John Wood
- Analogic Corporation  President and CEO
Sure, I would consider the Company a portfolio and we have talked a lot about ANEXA for instance. As we expand the sales force over the next year two, I believe you will see that generate some nice sales and be followed by other products as we layer them on one by one.
We have spent a ton of money on security not only to enhance the existing system but also next generation products. I will give you an example. Under grants from the TSA we're developing a next generation explosive detection system that would  the goal is to screen bags at the rate of 1200 per hour, of one meter size bore, so it will handle a relatively large cargo and that would be scheduled for introduction around 2007. That is out there a ways.
So I think if you look at probably the shortest reaction would be some of the medical subsystems work that we have going on. Ultrasound development, these are products that are scheduled for introduction say within the next 6 to 12 months and followed by others after that.
Dan Loeb
- AmTrust Financial  Analyst
Okay but getting it down to kind of a quarter type basis, I think most people who own your stock expect that at some point in time this Company will earn somewhere between $2.00 and $4.00 a share. Are you saying that we're not going to see that kind of earnings rate for another year to 1.5 years?
John Wood
- Analogic Corporation  President and CEO
Well as we were saying earlier, I hesitate to give anything approaching guidance but I can tell you with confidence that we've got a multilayer product introduction plan that is going to be bringing some nice stuff out there and we know for instance that we cannot go on spending at this ratio of R&D to sales for a very long time because we would truly test investor patience. So we expect that we're going to be able to grow out of that situation by building sales as these various programs bear fruit.

Joe Pratt

I just wanted to clarify on the 225 million in cash, does that include a marked-to-market $50 million on Cedera?
John Millerick
- Analogic Corporation  SVP, CFO and Treasurer
No, the valuation within the 225 is approximately $49 million. From an accounting standpoint, we revalued the investment up to 49 and then reclassed it into marketable securities.
Joe Pratt
- AG Edwards  Analyst
So actually if we adjusted for the tax payments, then the real cash figure is less about 17 million?
John Millerick
- Analogic Corporation  SVP, CFO and Treasurer
To be quite frank, I think I spoke a little too quickly in the first instance. The tax will not be computed on the cash proceeds but on the net gain. And the gain is more in the vicinity of $44 million, so you're probably talking 14 million there or thereabouts in the 17 million.
Joe Pratt
- AG Edwards  Analyst
Okay, thank you.
Operator
John Francis with Francis Capital Management.
John Francis
- Francis Capital Management  Analyst
Over the last 13 years or so, the Company has spent approximately $500 million on research and development and today if I adjust that to cash and hotel etc., the Company has an enterprise value of somewhat below 300 million. So given this it appears that historically the Company has generated a very poor rate of return on invested capital for R&D. Now acquisitions that you'll probably be looking at will  are unlikely to generate a higher return on capital than repurchasing your stock.
So my question is why is the Board so strongly opposed to repurchasing stock since this is clearly the way to generate the highest value and to generate the highest return on capital than any other uses of your capital?
John Wood
- Analogic Corporation  President and CEO
John, I believe the Board is optimistic that we're going to find ways to put that cash to work and generate some nice returns. Your comment about the last 13 years is interesting because it highlights a change in strategy that we have adopted over the last couple of years and that is the Company was under gross margin pressure for some years leading up to September 11 as the result (ph) of our consolidation in the medical imaging marketplace, fewer players, Philips acquires Marconi; suddenly we have greatly reduced CT business. So there have been some issues there.
Certainly the Board needs to be cognizant of the matter and the opportunities and to review that periodically and I believe have done so. The Company did do a repurchase of shares but I believe it was quite some time ago.
John Francis
- Francis Capital Management  Analyst
Right. It was a number of years ago but for example if I take the $300 million enterprise value and I divide that equally between your security business and your medical division, medical business, 150 million apiece I would submit that there is no chance you will find any acquisitions for $150 million that will equate what you presently have in either of those businesses. So I can't imagine  I think it is highly unlikely that spending money on an acquisition would generate a superior return on capital than buying back your own stock. And frankly that same statement goes to the R&D spend.
I just don't understand why the Company is planning to deploy capital and is presently deploying capital in projects that generate a rate of return that are lower than the most obvious and an opportunity that is right before you.
John Wood
- Analogic Corporation  President and CEO
Well, I would agree with the thesis that the market is not adequately valuing our enterprise value. I think to change that we have to start to generate some returns as a result of these R&D projects starting to show some real attractive products. And I can only suggest that the Board will review this periodically.
John Francis
- Francis Capital Management  Analyst
I'm just trying to get an understanding of the thought process that the Board is using. Why would capital be deployed at a lower rate of return in a project than just simply buying back stock, which is clearly a higher rate of return on your capital? I just want to understand the thought process behind the Board's decision not to buy back stock.
John Wood
- Analogic Corporation  President and CEO
I would suggest that the Board expects that the 13 year record that you have addressed will change and that we will generate a better return for cash on P&L invested going forward.
John Francis
- Francis Capital Management  Analyst
But why ignore this opportunity?
John Millerick
- Analogic Corporation  SVP, CFO and Treasurer
It is difficult for us to speak directly for the Board. This is a matter that has been discussed in the guidance we have (multiple speakers)
John Francis
- Francis Capital Management  Analyst
I'm trying to understand the thought process. That is what I am asking you. If you could just walk me through it, I would really appreciate it.
John Wood
- Analogic Corporation  President and CEO
I am not sure we have a whole lot more to add there. I don't think John or I have complete visibility into the Board's thinking and history on this. But I can assure you that it has come up and will come up.

PEABODY, MA (June 7, 2005)  Analogic Corporation (NASDAQ: ALOG), a leading designer and manufacturer of high-precision health and security imaging equipment, announced today results for its third quarter ended April 30, 2005.
Revenues for the third quarter ended April 30, 2005, were $94,166,000, compared with the prior year's third-quarter revenues of $88,972,000, an increase of 6%. During the quarter the Company realized a gain of $43,829,000 from the sale of marketable securities. The Company also recorded asset writedowns of $5,587,000. After recording the gain on sale of marketable securities and the asset writedowns, the Company reported net income and diluted earnings per share of $28,120,000 and $2.07, respectively. This compares with net income of $1,140,000, or $0.08 per diluted share, for the prior year's third quarter.
Revenues for the nine months ended April 30, 2005, were $262,573,000, compared with the prior year's nine-months revenues of $253,322,000, an increase of 4%. During the nine-month period, the Company realized a gain of $43,829,000 from the sale of marketable securities. The Company also recorded asset writedowns of $6,534,000 during the period. After recording the gain on sale of securities and the asset writedowns, the Company reported net income and diluted earnings per share of $24,575,000 and $1.81, respectively. This compares with net income of $4,450,000, or $0.33 per diluted share, for the same period a year earlier.
During the third quarter, the Company recorded a gain of $43,829,000 from the sale of the Company's 14.6% interest in Cedara Software Corp. of Mississauga, Ontario, Canada. The net income attributable to the sale of these marketable securities was $27,388,000, or $2.01 per diluted share. The asset writedowns of $5,587,000 recorded by the Company during the quarter related to the Company's medical technology business and resulted from the writedown of certain investments to their net realizable values and the abandonment of certain technologies due to the realignments of the Company's marketing, research, and development activities. The net loss attributable to the writedown of assets was $4,184,000, or $0.31 per diluted share.
Sales of the Company's advanced medical subsystems continued to grow during the quarter, improving on their very strong third quarter a year earlier. These included sales of Data Acquisition Systems (DASs) for Computed Tomography (CT), and power systems for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Sales of medical and security CT systems were also up strongly over the prior year's third quarter. Sales of cardiac information management systems, as expected, were down from a year earlier, as were sales of patient monitors, digital radiography systems and subsystems, and embedded multicomputing systems.
John Wood, President and CEO, commented, "The results from operations, excluding the effect of the asset writedowns, were a modest improvement over the prior year's third quarter. As we had anticipated, sales of Camtronics cardiac information management equipment were below original expectations as a result of its revenue recognition issues earlier in the year. Fortunately, those issues are being resolved and there are clear indications that the new management at Camtronics is affecting a turnaround of the business. Sales of Digital Radiography (DR) systems through our ANEXA subsidiary and DR subsystems through our Anrad subsidiary were also lower than originally expected. In addition, shipments of patient monitors were less than expected due to an OEM customer's decision to discontinue marketing one of the models that we developed and manufactured for them."
Operating costs were somewhat higher for the quarter due to the Company's continuing investment in research and development. For example, the investment required to produce a new generation of Selenium technology for digital radiography is proving to be substantially higher than originally estimated. In the second quarter, the Company began to accelerate development of a new generation of multi-slice medical CT systems, and continued to develop a number of new subsystems and security systems. General and Administrative costs were also up, primarily due to expenses incurred in connection with the Company's efforts to comply with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
Wood said that while this quarter's results were not satisfactory, Analogic is clearly on the right course. Security Systems revenues increased substantially over the prior year. During the quarter, the Company also received an order for approximately $25,000,000 for new EXplosive Assessment Computed Tomography (EXACT) Systems from L-3 Communications, to be delivered before the end of February 2006. Shortly after the close of the quarter, the Company received notice that the Explosives Detection System (EDS) upgrade that it developed with Lockheed Martin had been certified by the U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA). Prototypes are expected to go into field trial during the second half of this calendar year and production is expected to begin early in the next calendar year. Shortly after the close of the quarter, Analogic's innovative COBRA Checkpoint Security System was installed at Boston's Logan International Airport for field trials. That system is performing very well, and the Company is building additional prototypes for further field testing. Meanwhile, design and development work continues on two new generations of EDSs, targeted for release in 2007 and 2011 respectively, under grants received from the TSA.
"We are also confident of our direction in medical imaging," Wood said. "During the quarter we generated considerable customer enthusiasm for the first prototypes of a new generation of compact, modular, liquid-cooled radio frequency amplifiers for MRI. Subsequent to the quarter, we also delivered the first prototypes of a compact, proprietary Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) for a new generation of CT data acquisition systems. Our medical subsystems business is very strong and growing."
On the system level, during the quarter Analogic concluded an agreement to develop a new family of multi-slice computed tomography systems for a well known OEM customer; ANEXA began increasing its sales force to give it broader geographical reach; and B-K Medical introduced the Mini Focus, the first in its new generation of ultrasound scanners.
"Considerable progress was made during the quarter on the development of both security and medical imaging systems," said Wood. "We remain confident that aggressive development of a number of new imaging systems will soon complement the continuing growth in our medical subsystems business and will provide the basis for substantive, long-term growth for the Company."

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On June 14, 2005, Analogic Corporation (the "Corporation") entered into indemnity agreements with each of the following directors and executive officers of the Corporation (each, an "Indemnitee"): James J. Judge (director), Michael T. Modic (director), Bruce W. Steinhauer (director), Edward F. Voboril (director), John W. Wood Jr. (director and executive officer), John J. Millerick (executive officer), and Alex A. Van Adzin (executive officer). The Corporation previously entered into substantially the same form of indemnity agreement with each of the following current directors of the Corporation: M. Ross Brown, Bernard M. Gordon, John A. Tarello, and Gerald L. Wilson. Each indemnity agreement provides that, subject to certain limitations specified elsewhere therein, the Corporation shall indemnify the Indemnitee if he is a party to or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved in any Proceeding, including, without limitation, a Proceeding by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor, against all Losses and Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with the defense or settlement of such Proceeding. Each indemnity agreement also provides that, subject to certain limitations specified elsewhere therein, the Corporation shall indemnify the Indemnitee if he is a party to or threatened to be made a party to or otherwise involved in any Proceeding by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he was or is a director and/or officer of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, employee, or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise, against all Losses and Expenses actually and reasonably incurred in connection with the defense or settlement of such Proceeding. Each indemnity agreement further provides that the Expenses incurred by the Indemnitee in any Proceeding governed by the re levant sections of the indemnity agreement shall be paid by the Corporation at reasonable intervals in advance of any final disposition of such Proceeding, provided that the Indemnitee shall undertake to repay such amounts to the Corporation if it shall ultimately be determined by a court in a final adjudication from which there is no further right of appeal that he was not entitled to indemnification of such Expenses.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
Top of the Form

Exhibit 10.1
This Agreement is made as of the day of by and between Analogic Corporation, a Massachusetts corporation (the "Corporation"), and (" " ["Director"/"Executive Officer"]), [a/an director/executive officer] of the Corporation.
     
Director/Executive Officer is currently serving as [a/an director/executive officer] of the Corporation. The Corporation wishes Director/Executive Officer to continue in such capacity. Director/Executive Officer is willing, under certain circumstances, to continue in such capacity.
In the past, in addition to the indemnification to which Director/Executive Officer is entitled pursuant to the By-Laws of the Corporation, and as additional consideration for Director's/Executive Officer's service, the Corporation has furnished, at its expense, directors' and officers' liability insurance to protect Director/Executive Officer in connection with such service. There has been, however, a substantial increase in corporate litigation which subjects directors and officers to expensive litigation risks at the same time that the availability of directors' and officers' liability insurance has been severely limited and the cost of such insurance has increased and may not be acceptable to the Corporation.
Director/Executive Officer has indicated his concern that the indemnities available under the Corporation's By-Laws and the liability insurance in effect or which may be obtained may not be adequate to protect him against the risks associated with his service to the Corporation. Director/Executive Officer has indicated that he may not be willing to continue in office unless adequate liability insurance, indemnification, or a combination of both will be provided. It is the express policy of the Corporation to indemnify its directors and executive officers so as to provide them with the maximum possible protection permitted by law.
Therefore, in order to induce Director/Executive Officer to continue to serve as [a/an director/executive officer], and in consideration of Director's/Executive Officer's continued service after the date hereof, the Corporation and Director/Executive Officer agree as follows:
1. . For purposes of this Agreement:
Definitions
a. The term "Court" means the court in which the Proceeding was brought or is pending or a court having subject matter jurisdiction and personal jurisdiction over the parties to the matter before such court;
b. "Disinterested Director" means a director of the Corporation who is not a party to the Proceeding(s) in question;
c. The term "Expenses" includes, without limitation thereto, expenses of investigations or judicial or administrative proceedings or appeals, attorneys' and accounting fees and disbursements, taxes, expenses of being a witness in a Proceeding, and any expenses of establishing a right to indemnification under or otherwise enforcing this Agreement;
d. The term "Losses" means amounts which Director/Executive Officer pays as a result of a claim or claims made against him in any Proceeding, including, without limitation, damages, judgments, liabilities, fines, penalties, and sums paid in compromise or settlement of a claim or claims;
e. The term "Proceeding" shall include any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit, or proceeding, whether brought in the right of the Corporation or otherwise and whether of a civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative nature, in which Director/Executive Officer may be or may have been involved as a party, a witness, or otherwise, by reason of the fact that Director/Executive Officer is or was a director and/or officer of the Corporation, by reason of any action taken by him or of any inaction on his part while acting as such director and/or officer, or by reason of the fact that he is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, trustee, employee, partner, or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other organization, whether or not he is serving in such capacity at the time any liability or expense is incurred for which indemnification or reimbursement shall be requested or provided for under this Agreement; and
f. References to "other organization" shall include employee benefit plans; references to "fines" shall include any excise tax or penalty assessed with respect to any employee benefit plan; references to "serving at the request of the Corporation" shall include any service as a director, officer, employee, or agent of the Corporation which imposes duties on, or involves services by, such director, officer, employee, or agent with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants, or its beneficiaries; and a person who acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in the interest of, or not opposed to, the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to have acted in a manner "in good faith, and in the reasonable belief that his conduct was in, or not opposed to, the best interest of the Corporation" as referred to in this Agreement.
2. . Director/Executive Officer agrees to serve or continue to serve as [a/an director/executive officer] of the Corporation for so long as he is duly elected or appointed or until the effective date of his written resignation.
Agreement to Serve
3. . The Corporation shall indemnify Director/Executive Officer if he is a party to or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved in any Proceeding, including, without limitation, a Proceeding by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor, against all Losses and Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by Director/Executive Officer in connection with the defense or settlement of such Proceeding.
Indemnity in Third-Party Proceedings
4. . The Corporation shall indemnify Director/Executive Officer if he is a party to or threatened to be made a party to or otherwise involved in any Proceeding by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he was or is a director and/or officer of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee, or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise, against all Losses and Expenses actually and reasonably incurred in connection with the defense or settlement of such Proceeding.
Indemnity in Proceedings by or in the Right of the Corporation
5. .
Right to Indemnification upon Application; Determination to Indemnify
a. Subject to the provisions of Section 9 hereof as to the Advancement of Expenses, indemnification under Sections 3 and 4 hereof shall be made no later than forty-five (45) days after the Corporation is given written request therefor by or on behalf of Director/Executive Officer. Director/Executive Officer shall give to the Corporation written notice as soon as practicable of any Proceeding for which indemnity will or could be sought hereunder; but the omission so to notify the Corporation shall not relieve it from any liability it may have to Director/Executive Officer to make indemnification payments hereunder.
b. Unless prohibited by the express provisions of an applicable statute in a specific case, indemnification pursuant to Sections 3 and 4 hereof and the advancement of Expenses pursuant to Section 9 hereof, as the case may be, shall be automatic and shall not require the approval of the Board of Directors or of the stockholders of the Corporation, or of any other person or body. If such an applicable statute does, however, expressly prohibit such mandatory indemnification in any such specific case, the Corporation, nevertheless, shall promptly cause a meeting of its Board of Directors or stockholders, as the case may be, to be called and held (or, if permitted to take action by written consent in lieu of a meeting, to obtain the requisite written consents) to take action within thirty (30) days of the written request for indemnification pursuant to Sections 3 or 4 or the advancement of Expenses pursuant to Section 9, as the case may be, to determine whether to approve such request. Such determination shall be made (i) by the Board of Directors of the Corporation by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of Disinterested Directors, or (ii) if such a quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable a quorum of Disinterested Directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (iii) by a special litigation/indemnification committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation appointed by the Board, or (iv) by the stockholders. Immediately upon such determination being so made, the Corporation shall furnish the indemnification or advancement requested. If a determination is made not to indemnify Director/Executive Officer or make the advancement, Director/Executive Officer shall have the right to seek an independent determination in favor of the request for indemnification or the advancement from a Court as contemplated under Section 10 hereof and an order requiring the Corporation to make the requested payments or to take such other action as ordered by such Court.
If the Corporation does not respond to a written request for indemnification pursuant to Sections 3 or 4 hereof or the advancement of Expenses pursuant to Section 9, as the case may be, within said thirty (30) day period, the Corporation shall be deemed to have waived any right to refuse to pay such claim under this Agreement or the right to require that the request be approved by the Board of Directors or the stockholders of the Corporation or by any other person or body.
6. . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Corporation shall not be required to furnish indemnification under Sections 3 or 4 of this Agreement in connection with any Proceeding:
Limitations to Indemnification Rights
a. based upon a specific finding by a Court in a final adjudication from which there is no further right of appeal that (i) Director's/Executive Officer's conduct which is the subject of the Proceeding was not in good faith, and in the reasonable belief that his conduct was in, or not opposed to, the best interest of the Corporation, or (ii) with respect to any Proceeding which is criminal in nature, Director/Executive Officer had reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful;
b. for and to the extent payment is actually made to Director/Executive Officer under a valid and collectible insurance policy (which limitation shall not apply to any excess beyond the amount of payment to Director/Executive Officer under such insurance);
c. based upon or attributable to Director/Executive Officer receiving an improper personal benefit to which he was not legally entitled;
d. for an accounting of profits made or deemed by a Court to have been made from the purchase or sale by Director/Executive Officer of securities of the Corporation pursuant to Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and amendments thereto or similar provisions of any federal, state, or local statutory law or common law; or
e. based upon a specific finding by a Court in a final adjudication from which there is no further right of appeal that such indemnification is not lawful.
7. . For the purposes of Section 6 hereof, Director's/Executive Officer's conduct shall not be deemed to have been not in good faith, and not based in the reasonable belief that his conduct was in, or not opposed to, the best interest of the Corporation, Director/Executive Officer shall not be deemed to have had any reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful, nor shall any presumption arise that Director/Executive Officer did not meet any particular standard of conduct or have any particular belief or that a Court has determined that indemnification under this Agreement is not lawful if:
Presumptions in Making Determinations to Indemnify
a. Director's/Executive Officer's conduct was based on the reports or records, including financial statements, books of account, and other financial records, of the Corporation or another organization, and other information and opinions, in each case supplied to him or prepared by or under the supervision of (i) one or more officers or employees of the Corporation whom Director/Executive Officer reasonably believed to be reliable and competent in the matters presented, (ii) counsel, public accountants, or other persons as to matters which Director/Executive Officer reasonably believed to be within such person's professional or expert competence, or (iii) a duly constituted committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation upon which he does not serve, as to matters within its delegated authority, which committee Director/Executive Officer reasonably believed to merit confidence, unless it is determined that Director/Executive Officer had knowledge concerning the matter in question that would cause such reliance to be unwarranted; or
b. if any Proceeding is terminated by judgment, order, settlement (whether with or without court approval), or conviction, or if a plea of guilty or of , or its equivalent, is entered in any Proceeding.
nolo contendere
8. . Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, to the extent that Director/Executive Officer has been successful, on the merits or otherwise, in defense of any Proceeding or in defense of any claim, issue, or matter therein, including the dismissal of an action without prejudice, Director/Executive Officer shall be indemnified against all Expenses incurred in connection therewith.
Indemnification of Expenses in All Cases for Successful Defense
9. . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Expenses incurred by Director/Executive Officer in any Proceeding governed by Sections 3 or 4 shall be paid by the Corporation at reasonable intervals in advance of any final disposition of such Proceeding, in each case within ten (10) days after the Corporation receives Director's/Executive Officer's written request therefor, provided that Director/Executive Officer shall undertake to repay such amounts to the Corporation if it shall ultimately be determined by a Court in a final adjudication from which there is no further right of appeal that he was not entitled to indemnification of such Expenses. Such undertaking need not be secured and shall be accepted by the Board of Directors of the Corporation without reference to the financial ability of Director/Executive Officer to make repayment. Advancement of Expenses pursuant to this section shall not require approval of the Board of Directors or stockholders of the Corporation, or of any other person or body.
Advancement of Expenses
10. . Director/Executive Officer shall have the right to commence litigation in any Court to enforce this Agreement notwithstanding any previous determination not to provide indemnification hereunder. The Corporation hereby consents to the assertion of personal jurisdiction over it, and to venue, in any Court of record of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts or of the United States in the Commonwealth. The burden of proving that Director/Executive Officer is not entitled to indemnification or advancement of Expenses requested by Director/Executive Officer shall be on the Corporation.
Enforcement of this Agreement
11. . This Agreement and the indemnification provided by this Agreement shall not be deemed exclusive of or affect any other rights to which Director/Executive Officer may be entitled under the Corporation's Articles of Organization or By-Laws, any other agreement, any vote of stockholders or Disinterested Directors, the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office. The indemnification under this Agreement shall continue as to Director/Executive Officer even though he may have ceased to be a director or officer. The absence of any express provision for indemnification hereunder shall not limit any right of indemnification existing independently of this Agreement.
Indemnification Hereunder Not Exclusive
12. . If Director/Executive Officer is entitled under any provision of this Agreement to indemnification by the Corporation for some or a portion of the Losses or Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him in the investigation, defense, appeal, or settlement of any Proceeding but not for the total amount thereof, the Corporation shall nevertheless provide indemnification to Director/Executive Officer for that portion of such Losses or Expenses for which it is determined that Director/Executive Officer is entitled to be indemnified hereunder.
Partial Indemnification
13. . The Corporation shall, upon receipt of a written request from Director/Executive Officer, certifying, , that Director/Executive Officer has reasonable grounds to believe that Director/Executive Officer may be made a party to a Proceeding for which Director/Executive Officer may be entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation under this Agreement, create a Trust (the "Trust") for the benefit of Director/Executive Officer, the Trustee of which shall be chosen by Director/Executive Officer. From time to time, upon receipt of a written request from Director/Executive Officer, the Corporation shall fund the Trust in amounts sufficient to satisfy any and all Losses and Expenses reasonably anticipated at the time of such request for which the Corporation may indemnify Director/Executive Officer hereunder. The amount or amounts to be deposited in the Trust pursuant to the foregoing funding obligation shall be determined by mutual agreement of Director/Executive Officer and the Corporation or, if the Corporation and Director/Executive Officer are unable to reach such an agreement, by independent legal counsel selected by Director/Executive Officer. The terms of the Trust shall provide that except upon the consent of Director/Executive Officer and the Corporation, (i) the Trust shall not be revoked or the principal thereof invaded, without the written consent of Director/Executive Officer, (ii) the Trustee shall advance to Director/Executive Officer, within twenty (20) days of a request by Director/Executive Officer, any and all Expenses, Director/Executive Officer hereby agreeing to reimburse the trustee of the Trust for all Expenses so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by a Court in a final adjudication from which there is no further right of appeal that Director/Executive Officer is not entitled to be indemnified under this Agreement, (iii) the Trust shall continue to be funded by the Corporation in accordance with the funding obligations set forth in this section, (iv) the Trustee shall promptly pay to Director/Executive Officer any amounts to which Director/Executive Officer shall be entitled pursuant to this Agreement, and (v) all unexpended funds in the Trust shall revert to the Corporation upon a final determination by independent legal counsel selected by Director/Executive Officer or a Court that Director/Executive Officer has been fully indemnified with respect to the Proceeding giving rise to the establishment of the Trust in question under the terms of this Agreement.
Establishment of Trust
inter
alia
14. . If this Agreement or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on any ground by any Court, then the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify Director/Executive Officer as to Losses and Expenses with respect to any Proceeding to the fullest extent permitted by (i) any applicable portion of this Agreement that shall not have been so invalidated, or (ii) any applicable law, and the Corporation hereby consents and agrees that this Agreement may be modified accordingly by any Court.
Savings Clause

FOR IMMEDIATE WORLDWIDE RELEASE
Paul M. Roberts Director of Communications (978) 326-4213
PEABODY, MA (September 26, 2005)  Analogic Corporation (NASDAQ: ALOG), a leading designer and manufacturer of high-precision health and security imaging equipment, today announced revenues and earnings for its fourth quarter and twelve-month period ended July 31, 2005.
Revenues for the fourth quarter ended July 31, 2005, were $101,998,000, compared with the prior year's fourth-quarter revenues of $102,235,000, a decrease of $237,000. Net income for the fourth quarter was $4,287,000, or $0.31 per diluted share, compared with $3,904,000, or $0.29 per diluted share, for the prior year's fourth quarter. Security systems shipments increased substantially over the prior year's fourth quarter, and the Company had increased sales of medical Computed Tomography (CT) and clinical ultrasound systems, as well as continued growth in the sales of high-performance subsystems for CT and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Sales of cardiac information management, Digital Radiography (DR), embedded multicomputing, and patient monitoring systems were down from the same quarter a year earlier.
Revenues for the twelve months ended July 31, 2005, were $364,571,000, compared with the prior year's revenues of $355,557,000, an increase of $9,014,000 or 2.5%. Net income for the twelve-month period was $28,862,000, or $2.12 per diluted share, compared with $8,354,000, or $0.62 per diluted share, for the same period a year ago, an increase of $20,508,000 or 245%.
During the fiscal year, the Company recorded a gain of $43,829,000 from the sale of its 14.6% equity interest in Cedara Software Corporation of Mississauga, Ontario, Canada. The net income attributable to the sale of these marketable securities was $27,388,000, or $2.01 per diluted share. The Company also recorded pre-tax asset writedowns of $6,599,000 during fiscal 2005 related to its medical technology business resulting from the writedown of certain investments to their net realizable values and the abandonment of certain technologies due to realignment of the Company's marketing, research, and development activities. The net loss attributable to these pretax asset writedowns was approximately $4,800,000, or $0.35 per diluted share.
BUSINESS UPDATE
John Wood, Analogic President and CEO, said, "Our medical subsystems business for Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) continued to grow substantially in fiscal 2005. We shipped increasing numbers of innovative Data Acquisition Systems (DASs) for CT, and of a new generation of Radio Frequency (RF) amplifiers for MRI systems. Both of these businesses are demonstrating the initial impact of our increased research and development efforts over the past several years. Our medical CT system business began a resurgence this year, as shipments increased. The investment in CT R&D also led directly to an agreement with a well known international OEM to develop a new family of multi-slice CT systems for them, which we expect to begin shipping in late fiscal 2006. Ultrasound systems shipments were also up for the year.
"On the security side of our business, shipments to L-3 Communications almost doubled over the prior year, as we saw a steady, more predictable order rate. L-3 is continuing to deploy advanced Explosives Detection Systems (EDSs) in U.S. airports and has been very successful in generating new orders abroad."
Digital radiography revenues have not yet met expectations. DR shipments by our ANEXA subsidiary were below projections, due essentially to delays in obtaining a key subsystem for its new flagship SyneRad OMNI Digital Radiography system. The first OMNI production units began shipping this month. A number of radiologists and physicists outside the Company who have evaluated images from the OMNI believe them to be the best in the industry.
Patient monitoring revenues were down, as expected, due to a shift in OEM customer product emphasis, as were embedded multicomputing system revenues. Sales of cardiac information and image management systems were also substantially lower, as anticipated, in good part because of market uncertainty following the need to restate Camtronics' revenues during the prior fiscal year. A new management team was put in place at Camtronics during the year and has produced continuous improvement in revenue over the past two quarters.
As expected, operating costs were up over the previous year due primarily to increased administrative costs associated with Sarbanes-Oxley compliance and the Company's prior year financial restatement related to Camtronics' software revenue recognition issues.
Considerable progress was made in a number of areas during the fourth quarter. The Company received a $36,000,000 order for EXACT systems that is now scheduled for completion in June 2006. The U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) certified an upgrade kit developed by Analogic with a leading OEM for EDS systems already deployed in the field. Prototypes of the upgrade are expected to go into field trials later this calendar year and the kit be put into production during the second half of the fiscal year. Significant progress was also made on a next-generation EDS system that is being developed in part with a grant from the TSA. Work also continues on a revolutionary EDS system targeted for delivery in a 2011 timeframe. In July, Wood testified before a Congressional Committee on leveraging technology to improve aviation security. There appeared to be strong congressional support for deploying advanced technology to improve detection capabilities and reduce costs.
Analogic's COBRA Checkpoint Security System was placed into a field trial at Boston's Logan International Airport during the quarter, where it clearly demonstrated its superior detection capabilities while gathering technical data on 37,000 bags in real field conditions. Pilot units are expected to be placed in several locations, including overseas, in the near future.
Working with VisEn Medical, a pioneer in the field of optical molecular imaging, Analogic has developed a Fluorescent Molecular Tomography (FMT) system that can detect biological processes at the molecular level. Preproduction units have been installed at several top-tier pharmaceutical and academic institutions in the U.S. and Europe. The unit is expected to go into production later this year.
During the quarter, Analogic announced U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance for its new LIFEGARD II non-invasive patient and specialty monitors, which will begin shipping this quarter.
"We made considerable progress this year," Wood concluded. "Over the past several years we have invested heavily in research and development on both medical and security products. Development of new, innovative CT data acquisition systems is expanding our capabilities and our opportunities in both medical and security CT. We are developing new CT systems for niche markets, and at PhotoDetection Systems work continues on an advanced Positron Emission Tomography (PET) system, which employs an innovative new detector technology and can be combined with an Analogic CT for a new generation of hybrid PET/CTs. We are working on a new family of ultrasound scanners, and a unique ultrasound mammography system that is now producing its first clinical images.
"Working with Sanders Design Inc., progress has been made in the development of an advanced InfraRed Counter Measures (IRCM) system to protect civilian aircraft from shoulder-fired missiles. Though much remains to be done, we believe this patented technology has significant potential. With continued, aggressive development of a variety of new, high-performance medical and security products, we believe that the Company is setting a strong foundation for long-term growth as ."

MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
The Company has concluded that deficiencies in the controls and procedures related to software revenue recognition at its Camtronics subsidiary continue to constitute a "material weakness," as defined by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board's Auditing Standard No. 2.
As a result of this material weakness at Camtronics, management has concluded that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of July 31, 2005, and expects that the Company's independent registered public accounting firm will reach the same conclusion in its audit report on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. The management report on internal control over financial reporting will be included in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K, which will be filed in October 2005.
"We have made good progress in fiscal year 2005 in addressing and resolving the control deficiencies related to software revenue recognition procedures," Wood said. "We are continuing our efforts to remediate these deficiencies and are confident that we will bring this matter to final resolution during fiscal year 2006."

Item 2.05 Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.
On September 28, 2005, authorized officers of Analogic Corporation (the "Registrant") committed the Registrant to a plan to restructure the business operations of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Sky Computers, Inc. ("Sky), and the business operations of Skys wholly-owned subsidiary, Sky Computers (Europe) Ltd. (the "Plan"), under which material charges will be incurred under generally accepted accounting principles applicable to the Registrant. The Plan involves terminating the employment of approximately forty (40) employees of Sky and Sky-Europe between October 14, 2005 and July 31, 2006, the end of the Registrants current fiscal year. More than half of those employees will be terminated during the Registrants current fiscal quarter, most of whom have been engaged in product development, sales, and administrative activities. The employees who are to remain after the end of the Registrants current fiscal quarter have been and will continue to be engaged principally in the man ufacturing and sale of Skys legacy products and supporting Skys and Sky Europes installed customer base. The decision to engage in the Plan is based on continued lower than expected sales by Sky and Sky Europe. The expected completion date for the Plan is July 31, 2006. There are three major types of costs associated with the Plan: personnel-related costs, such as severance pay; the write-down of certain capital assets; and the write-down of certain inventory. The amount estimated by the Registrant for each of these categories ranges from $0.9 million to $1.0 million, from $0.35 million to $0.4 million, and from $1.1 million to $1.3 million, respectively. The Registrant estimates that the total costs to be incurred related to this Plan to be $2.35 million to $2.7 million. The Registrant will record charges incurred in connection with the Plan of approximately $1.9 million to $2.25 million during the quarter ending October 31, 2005. The Registrant estimates that $0 .45 million of personnel-related charges will be incurred and recorded during the nine month period ended July 31, 2006. The Registrant believes that cash expenditures incurred subsequent to the quarter ended October 31, 2005 will approximate $0.45 million in personnel-related charges.
Item 2.06 Material Impairments.
As noted in Item 2.05 above, authorized officers of the Registrant concluded on September 28, 2005 that a material charge for impairment is required under generally accepted accounting principles applicable to the Registrant, in connection with the write down of the capital assets and the write-down of the inventory identified in Item 2.05 above. The Registrants conclusion that the asset impairment charge, which is estimated to range from $1.45 million to $1.7 million and which will be incurred in the current quarter ending October 31, 2005, is required as a result of the decision to engage in the Plan The Registrant does not believe that the impairment charge will result in any future cash expenditures

This compares with $1,478,000, or $0.11 per diluted share, from continuing operations for the prior year's first quarter.

This compares to a net loss of $1,313,000 or $0.10 per diluted share for the prior year's first quarter.
Net income for the first quarter ended October 31, 2005, was $1,342,000, or $0.10 per diluted share, compared to $165,000 or $0.01 per diluted share, for the prior year's first quarter.
The growth in revenue from continuing operations was due in large part to a continuing increase in demand for the Company's security and medical systems and subsystems. Security technology sales increased by $9,714,000, or 96%, over the prior year's first quarter. Medical technology sales were up $1,643,000, or 3%, over the prior year's first quarter, reflecting uneven results for different segments. Sales of Computed Tomography (CT) systems, CT Data Acquisition Systems (DASs), and Digital Radiography (DR) Flat-Panel Detectors (FPDs) improved strongly. This growth was offset in part by decreased sales of DR and clinical ultrasound systems and decreased engineering revenues.
The Company did not realize the full operating income benefit of this quarter's revenue increase due to reduced margins related to customer-funded engineering projects, increased sales and marketing expenses due in part to the costs associated with our ANEXA subsidiary, and restructuring costs related to SKY Computers.
Research and product development costs were up $1,353,000, or 11.6%, from the prior year's first quarter, due primarily to increased personnel costs as the Company enhanced programs focusing on the development of new complete CT systems, an extended family of multi-slice CT DASs, and new security systems. Engineering revenues were down $1,428,000, or 27%, due primarily to the near completion of a government-supported security engineering development program.
The Company restructured its SKY Computers subsidiary, a supplier of embedded multi-computing systems, during the quarter. The market for high-speed multiprocessing has increasingly lost ground due to the expanding capabilities of personal computers. SKY will continue to meet its manufacturing and service commitments to its customers, but its product development and marketing efforts have been concluded.
During the quarter, Analogic received a grant under the TSA's CAMBRIA program to develop a next-generation checkpoint screening system that establishes very aggressive standards for advanced checkpoint security systems. The Company's innovative COBRA system, a compact, CT-based, automatic threat detection system to examine carry-on baggage for aircraft as well as carry-in items for public buildings, will be its platform for CAMBRIA. We are also planning to install COBRA units in several challenging application environments in the U.S. and abroad to demonstrate the system's advanced security imaging capabilities.
The Company is working to broaden the basis for medical growth. Development continues on a number of major new medical products, including the heart of a new multi-slice medical CT system for a major Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). At PhotoDetection Systems, work continues on a new Positron Emission Tomography (PET) system that employs innovative detector technology and can be combined with a CT for a new generation of hybrid PET/CTs. The first clinical images were taken subsequent to the close of the quarter. New generations of high-performance subsystems for multi-slice CT, MRI, and clinical ultrasound are also in development, as well as a unique ultrasound mammography system.
Subsequent to the end of the quarter, the Company sold all its stock in its Camtronics Medical Systems, Ltd., subsidiary, located in Hartland, Wisconsin, to Emageon Inc., of Birmingham, Alabama, for $40 million in cash. During the second quarter ending January 31, 2006, the Company expects to realize a gain from the sale of Camtronics. The Company, as a result of the sale, has classified the Camtronics business as a discontinued operation and has recast its financial statements accordingly to represent these operations as discontinued.
With respect to a change in accounting principle, effective August 1, 2005, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 123, "Share-Based Payment," which establishes accounting for equity instruments exchanged for employee services, including the requirement to recognize in the statement of operations the value of stock options and other stock-based compensation. The cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle relating to certain aspects of the adoption is reflected in the Company's first quarter financial results. In addition to the cumulative effect, the Company recognized $954,000 and $481,000 of share-based compensation related to stock options and restricted stock awards in the quarter ended October 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
John Wood, President and CEO, noted, "The growth in our security business and in certain segments of our medical business is very encouraging. We believe that several additional medical segments are poised for growth in the coming year and will confirm that we are on the right course for long-term growth as "The World Resource for Health and Security Technology."

FOR IMMEDIATE WORLDWIDE RELEASE
Paul M. Roberts Director of Communications (978) 326-4213 proberts@analogic.com
PEABODY, MA (March 9, 2006)  Analogic Corporation (NASDAQ: ALOG), a leading designer and manufacturer of high-precision health and security imaging equipment, announced today results for its second quarter ended January 31, 2006.
Revenues from continuing operations for the second quarter ended January 31, 2006, were $100,011,000, compared with the prior year's second quarter revenues from continuing operations of $76,110,000, an increase of 31%. Net income from continuing operations for the second quarter was $9,097,000, or $0.66 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $2,046,000, or a net loss of $0.15 per diluted share, from continuing operations a year earlier.
Net income attributable to the gain on disposal of discontinued operations for the second quarter ended January 31, 2006, was $20,640,000, or $1.50 per diluted share.
Net income for the quarter was $29,737,000, or $2.16 per diluted share, compared with a net loss of $3,710,000, or a loss of $0.27 per diluted share, for the prior year's second quarter.
Revenues from continuing operations for the six months ended January 31, 2006, were $186,421,000, compared with the prior year's six-month revenues from continuing operations of $151,240,000, an increase of 23%. Income from continuing operations for the six-month period was $10,160,000, or $0.74 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $568,000, or a loss of $0.04 per diluted share, from continuing operations for the same period a year earlier. The financial results for the six-month period include pre-tax restructuring and asset impairment charges of $2,216,000 associated with the Company's SKY Computers subsidiary.
Net income attributable to discontinued operations, the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, and the gain on disposal of discontinued operations for the six months ended January 31, 2006, was $20,919,000, or $1.52 per diluted share. This compares to a net loss from discontinued operations of $2,977,000, or a loss of $0.22 per diluted share, for the prior year's first six months.
Net income for the first six months ended January 31, 2006, was $31,079,000, or $2.26 per diluted share, compared with a net loss of $3,545,000, or a loss of $0.26 per diluted share, for the same period a year earlier.
On November 1, 2005, the Company sold all its stock in its Camtronics Medical Systems, Ltd., subsidiary, located in Hartland, Wisconsin, to Emageon Inc., of Birmingham, Alabama, for $40 million in cash. The Company, as a result of the sale, has classified the Camtronics business as a discontinued operation and has recast its financial statements accordingly to represent the operation as discontinued. During the quarter ending January 31, 2006, the Company realized a net gain of $20,640,000 after taxes, or $1.50 per diluted share, from the sale of Camtronics.
John Wood, President and CEO, commented, "We are pleased with the results for this quarter." Security revenues improved significantly over a year ago, due primarily to the shipment of 44 EXplosive Assessment Computed Tomography (EXACT) systems, compared to only 7 systems shipped in the quarter a year earlier. Sales of medical products also improved for the quarter. Shipments of Data Acquisition Systems (DASs) for CT were up over a very strong second quarter a year ago. Deliveries of flat-panel detectors for Digital Radiography (DR) by our Anrad subsidiary increased substantially over the same period a year earlier. Shipments of ultrasound probes by our Sound Technology, Inc., (STI) subsidiary were up, as were deliveries of patient monitors, reflecting in part the appeal of new families of monitors we are supplying to a major Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) customer. Sales of clinical ultrasound systems and of power systems for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) were down from a year earlier.
Research and product development costs for the second quarter were $14,149,000, or 14% of total revenue, compared to $13,219,000, or 17% of total revenue, for the prior year's second quarter. The increase was due primarily to additional personnel costs as the Company accelerated development of the heart of a new medical CT system for an OEM customer and of new security products. Engineering revenues for the quarter were $6,119,000, compared to $3,169,000 a year earlier.
Development continues on a number of other new medical products. At PhotoDetection Systems, where we have a minority investment, the first human images were taken with its new Positron Emission Tomography (PET) system, which employs innovative detector technology for a new generation of hybrid PET/CTs. Progress continues on the development of new generations of high-performance subsystems for multi-slice CT, MRI, and clinical ultrasound applications.
During the quarter, a prototype of our major upgrade for existing Explosives Detection Systems (EDSs) to examine checked luggage at airports was installed in the first of two major airports for full field trials. We expect the trials to be successfully completed over the next several months and that the upgrade will be available later this fiscal year. Additional development work continues on our COBRA advanced checkpoint security system, which we expect to provide to the U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) for trial early next fiscal year, and on the next generation of EDS systems, which we expect to submit to the TSA for testing by the middle of next fiscal year.
"This quarter reflects growth in several product areas that have been going through lengthy technical development curves," said Wood. "Success in these product areas, along with substantial progress in other major medical and security projects currently in development, will provide the opportunity for substantial long-term growth for the Company as "
The World Resource for Health and Security Technology.

PEABODY, MA (June 7, 2006)  Analogic Corporation (NASDAQ: ALOG), a leading designer and manufacturer of high-precision health and security imaging equipment, announced today results for its third quarter ended April 30, 2006.
Revenues from continuing operations for the third quarter ended April 30, 2006, were $81,306,000, compared with the prior year's third-quarter revenues from continuing operations of $84,582,000, a decrease of 4%.

The Company also recorded pretax asset writedowns from continuing operations of $1,988,000 during the prior third quarter, which resulted in a net loss from continuing operations of $1,201,000, or $0.09 per diluted share.

The net income from continuing operations attributable to the sale of those marketable securities was $27,388,000, or $2.01 per diluted share. Pretax asset impairment charges totaled $2,935,000 during the prior year's nine-month period resulting in a net loss from continuing operations of $1,774,000, or $0.13 per diluted share.
Net income attributable to discontinued operations, the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, and the gain on disposal of discontinued operations for the nine months ended April 30, 2006, was $20,919,000, or $1.52 per diluted share. This compares to a net loss from discontinued operations of $3,846,000, or a loss of $0.29 per diluted share, for the prior year's first nine months. During the first nine months of this year the Company realized a net gain of $20,640,000, or $1.50 per diluted share, from the sale of our Camtronics Medical Systems subsidiary to Emageon, Inc. of Birmingham, Alabama, on November 1, 2005. As a result of the sale, the Company classified the Camtronics business as a discontinued operation and recast its financial statements accordingly to represent the operation as discontinued.
Net income for the nine months ended April 30, 2006, was $33,589,000, or $2.44 per diluted share, compared with a net income of $24,575,000, or $1.81 per diluted share, for the same period a year earlier.
Sales of the Company's medical technology products were up 6% for the quarter, led by increased shipments of clinical ultrasound systems, ultrasound subsystems, digital radiography subsystems, and patient monitors. Sales of advanced multi-slice Data Acquisition Systems (DASs) for Computed Tomography (CT) remained near the same high level of the previous third quarter. Security technology product sales were down 37% from a year earlier. This was expected as our customer had requested that some shipments originally scheduled for Q3 be accelerated into Q2 to meet their customers' needs. Sales of power amplifiers for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) were also down from a strong quarter a year earlier.
John Wood, President and CEO, commented, "Revenue and income were down from our strong second quarter this year due primarily to the expected decrease in the shipment of EXplosive Assessment Computed Tomography (EXACT) systems. In the second quarter we shipped 44 units, accelerating shipments to meet our customer requirements. In the third quarter we shipped 17 units, with a backlog of 11 units for the remainder of the fiscal year. The lower volume of EXACT shipments resulted in lower income overall for the quarter. We expect that new orders will be forthcoming as the upgraded EXACT system, known as the AN6400, completes inline field trials later this calendar year. We also expect to be able to market the separate upgrade kit later this year, which should improve revenue and income in fiscal 2007."
Wood noted that sales of medical technology products had improved, due primarily to strong showings by several of the Company's subsidiaries. B-K Medical's shipments of ultrasound systems were up over a year ago, as were sales of ultrasound transducers by the Company's Sound Technology, Inc. subsidiary. Flat-panel direct digital radiography detector plate shipments by the Company's Anrad subsidiary were up strongly over a year ago, reflecting continuing improvement in production of these leading-edge subsystems. Patient monitor shipments also increased, as the Company has been expanding the number of parameters measured non-invasively by its growing LIFEGARD family of patient and fetal monitors.
Shipments of data acquisition systems for computed tomography were about level with a very strong quarter a year earlier, but power systems, or Radio Frequency (RF) amplifiers, for MRI were down from a strong quarter a year earlier, and orders for medical CT systems were also lower.
Research and product development costs for the third quarter were $12,382,000, or 15% of total revenue, down from $13,540,000, or 16% of total revenue, for the prior year's third quarter. Engineering revenues for the quarter were $3,415,000, down from $5,221,000 a year earlier, due primarily to a large, funded security project that was completed in the prior year.
A number of major engineering projects are progressing. Development continues on the COBRA advanced checkpoint security system, which the Company expects to provide to the U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) early next fiscal year for testing under its CAMBRIA program. The Company is also developing a new generation of Explosives Detection Systems (EDSs) under the TSA's Phoenix Program. The new system, with a larger bore and higher throughput, should be submitted to the TSA for certification testing by the middle of next fiscal year. Major medical development projects in process include the heart of a new CT system for an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM); a Positron Emission Tomography (PET) system being developed by PhotoDetection Systems, in which we have an equity interest; and new generations of multi-slice CT data acquisition systems and liquid-cooled RF amplifiers for MRI. Analogic has also generated considerable interest in a new brushless technique for delivering power to and data from a rotating CT gantry.
"The breadth of our technological capabilities and the importance of applying those capabilities to both health and security applications were clearly evident this quarter," said Wood. "While shipments of security systems were down over several very strong recent quarters, and we await approval to market several innovative new security systems for airports domestically and abroad, several segments of our medical business demonstrated solid growth. We are working to extend that growth over both major application areas to better ensure our future as The World Resource for Health and Security Technology.'"

Top of the Form
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
Top of the Form

Exhibit 99.1
This Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the "Code") sets forth legal and ethical standards of conduct for directors, officers and employees of Analogic Corporation (the "Company"). This Code is intended to promote ethical conduct in all Company affairs in accordance with our high standards of integrity, and to deter wrongdoing in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. This Code applies to the Company and all of its subsidiaries and other business entities controlled by it worldwide.
If you have any questions regarding this Code or its application in any situation, you should contact your supervisor or the Vice President, Human Resources.
Honest and Ethical Conduct and Fair Dealing
Employees, officers and directors should endeavor to deal honestly, ethically and fairly with the Company's suppliers, customers, competitors and fellow employees. Statements regarding the Company's products and services must be true, and not be misleading, deceptive or fraudulent. There cannot be unfair advantage taken of anyone through manipulation, concealment, abuse of privileged information, misrepresentation of material facts or any other unfair-dealing practice.
Compliance with Laws, Rules and Regulations
The Company requires that all employees, officers and directors comply fully with all laws, rules and regulations applicable to the Company wherever it does business. Specifically, the Company intends to fully comply with all provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, including its "whistleblower" provisions. Each of us is expected to use good judgment and common sense in our desire to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, and to ask for advice when uncertain about them.
If any of us becomes aware of a violation of any law, rule or regulation by the Company, whether by its officers, employees, directors, or any third party doing business on behalf of the Company, it is our responsibility to report the matter to our supervisor or the Vice President, Human Resources, either by phone toll free at 978-326-4460 or fax 978-977-6810. While it is the Company's desire to address such matters internally, nothing in this Code should discourage anyone from reporting any illegal activity, including any suspected violation of the securities laws, antitrust laws, customs and import/export laws, environmental laws or any other federal, state or foreign law, rule or regulation, to the appropriate regulatory authority. In addition, employees may choose to address any belief of a violation directly to an external and independent third party administrator, on a selfidentifying or anonymous basis, by calling the Ethics and Compliance Hotline toll free at 877-888-0002 in the U.S. and Canada and toll-free numbers overseas. This service will convey significant concerns to the appropriate authority.
Employees, officers and directors shall not discharge, demote, suspend, threaten, harass or in any other manner discriminate or retaliate against a fellow employee because he or she in good faith reports a suspected violation. This Code does not prohibit anyone from testifying, participating or otherwise assisting in any state or federal administrative, judicial or legislative proceeding or investigation.
Conflicts of Interest
Employees, officers and directors always should act in the best interests of the Company and refrain from any activity or personal interest that constitutes a "conflict of interest." A conflict of interest occurs when a personal interest interferes with the best interests of the Company. A conflict of interest can arise whenever an officer, director or employee takes an action, or has an interest, that interferes with his/her performance of Company duties and responsibilities in a manner that is honest, objective and effective.
For example:
It is our responsibility to disclose any transaction or relationship that reasonably could be expected to give rise to a conflict of interest to the General Counsel or, if you are an executive officer or director, to the Board of Directors, who shall be responsible for determining whether such transaction or relationship constitutes a conflict of interest.
Insider Trading
Employees, officers and directors who have material non-public information about the Company or other companies, including our suppliers and customers, as a result of their relationship with the Company are prohibited by law and Company policy from trading in securities of the Company or such other companies, and further prohibited from communicating such information to others who might trade on the basis of that information. To help ensure that we do not engage in prohibited insider trading and avoid the appearance of an improper transaction, the Company has adopted a policy entitled "Compliance with United States Securities Laws and Trading in Company Securities" which can be found in the Policies & Procedures section of the Company's intranet.
If anyone is uncertain about these constraints on the purchase or sale of Company securities or the securities of any other company, he/she should consult with the General Counsel before making such purchase or sale.
Confidentiality
Employees, officers and directors will maintain the security of confidential information entrusted to them by the Company or other companies, including our suppliers and customers, except when disclosure is authorized by a supervisor or legally mandated. Unauthorized disclosure of confidential information is prohibited. Additionally, employees should take appropriate precautions to ensure that confidential or sensitive business information, whether proprietary to the Company or another company, is not generally communicated within the Company.
Outside parties may request information concerning the Company. Employees, officers and directors (other than Company authorized spokespersons) must not discuss internal Company matters with, or disseminate internal Company information to, anyone outside the Company, except as may be required in the performance of Company duties. This applies particularly to inquiries concerning the Company from the media, market professionals (such as securities analysts, institutional investors, investment advisers, brokers and dealers) and security holders. All responses to inquiries on behalf of the Company must be made only by Company authorized spokespersons. For any inquiries of this nature, decline comment and refer the inquirer to the Director, Corporate Communications. The Company's policies with respect to public disclosure of internal matters are described more fully in the Company's Disclosure Policy which can be found in the Policies & Procedures section of the Company's intranet.
Employees will honor all lawful obligations to former employers. These obligations may include restrictions on the use and disclosure of confidential information, restrictions on the recruiting of former colleagues to work at the Company, and non-competition agreements.
Protection and Proper Use of Corporate Assets
Employees, officers and directors should seek to protect all Company assets. Theft, carelessness and waste have a direct impact on financial performance. Employees, officers and directors are expected to use Company assets and services solely for legitimate business purposes and not for any personal benefit or the personal benefit of others.
Employees, officers and directors should advance the Company's legitimate business interests whenever the opportunity arises. Personal opportunities which arise through one's position within the Company should not be exploited for personal gain.
Gifts and Gratuities
The use of Company funds or assets for gifts, gratuities or other favors to employees or government officials is prohibited, except to the extent such gifts are in compliance with applicable law, nominal in amount, and not given in consideration or expectation of any action by the recipient.
Employees, officers and directors should not accept, or permit any member of his/her immediate family to accept, any gifts, gratuities or other favors from any customer, supplier or other person doing, or seeking to do, business with the Company, other than items of nominal value. Gifts not of nominal value should be returned immediately and reported to one's supervisor. If immediate return is not practical, they should be given to the Company for charitable disposition or such other disposition as the Company believes appropriate in its sole discretion.
Common sense and moderation should prevail in business entertainment on behalf of the Company. Employees, officers and directors can provide, or accept, business entertainment to or from anyone doing business with the Company only when that entertainment is infrequent, modest and intended to serve legitimate business goals.
Bribes and kickbacks are criminal acts prohibited by law. We will not offer, give, solicit or receive any form of bribe or kickback anywhere in the world.
Accuracy of Books and Records and Public Reports
Employees, officers and directors will honestly and accurately report all business transactions. Accurate information is essential in maintaining the Company's ability to meet legal and regulatory obligations.
All Company books, records and accounts are maintained in accordance with all applicable regulations and standards and accurately reflect the true nature of transactions recorded. The financial statements of the Company conform to generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. and the Company's accounting policies. No undisclosed or unrecorded account or fund can be established for any purpose. No false or misleading entries shall be made in the Company's books or records for any reason, and no disbursement of corporate funds or other corporate property can be made without adequate supporting documentation. Destruction, alteration or falsification of related documents is never acceptable.
It is a policy of the Company to provide full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in all reports and documents submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as in other public disclosures.
Dealings with Independent Auditors
No employee, officer or director shall, directly or indirectly, make or cause to be made a materially false or misleading statement to an accountant in connection with (or omit to state, or cause another person to omit to state, any material fact necessary in order to make statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading to an accountant in connection with) any audit, review or examination of the Company's financial statements or the preparation or filing of any document or report with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. No employee, officer or director shall, directly or indirectly, take any action to coerce, manipulate, mislead or fraudulently influence any independent public or certified public accountant engaged in the performance of an audit or review of the Company's financial statements.
Concerns Regarding Accounting or Auditing Matters
Any employee who believes that a questionable accounting or auditing matter may be occurring within the Company should address that belief directly to the Ethics and Compliance Hotline at 877-888-0002 in the U.S. and Canada.
All such concerns and questions will be recorded and forwarded to the Company's General Counsel, the Company's Chief Financial Officer and, unless they are determined by the General Counsel or the Chief Financial Officer to be without merit, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. A complete record of all concerns will be provided to the Audit Committee on a timely and regular basis. Any such concerns may also be communicated, confidentially and/or anonymously, directly to the Chairman of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.
The Audit Committee will evaluate the merits of all concerns received and will authorize follow-up actions, as it deems necessary or appropriate, to address those concerns.
Waivers of this Code of Business Conduct and Ethics
While some requirements contained in this Code require strict conformity, there are other requirements for which exceptions may be appropriate in certain situations. Any employee or officer who believes that a waiver of any of these requirements is appropriate in a particular situation should first contact his/her immediate supervisor. If the supervisor agrees that a waiver seems appropriate, the approval of the Vice President, Human Resources must be obtained. The Vice President, Human Resources shall be responsible for maintaining a complete record of all requests by employees or officers for waivers of any of the requirements of this Code and the disposition of such requests.
Any executive officer or director who seeks a waiver of any of the requirements of this Code should contact the Chairman of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Any waiver of the requirements of this Code for executive officers or directors, or any change to this Code that applies to executive officers or directors, may be approved only by the Board of Directors and will be disclosed as required by law.
Reporting and Compliance Procedures
Every employee, officer and director has a responsibility to ask questions, seek guidance, report suspected violations and express concerns regarding compliance with this Code. Any employee, officer or director who knows or believes that any other employee or representative of the Company has engaged, or is engaging, in Company-related conduct that violates applicable law or this Code should report such beliefs to his/her supervisor or to the Vice President, Human Resources as described below. The Company will not discipline, discriminate against or retaliate against any fellow employee who reports a concern in good faith, whether or not such information is ultimately proven to be correct, or who cooperates in any investigation or inquiry regarding such conduct. Any supervisor who receives a report of a violation of this Code should inform the Vice President, Human Resources.
Suspected violations of this Code can be reported on a confidential and/or anonymous basis (a) to the Company's Vice President, Human Resources by mail, fax or e-mail at:
or (b) directly to an external and independent third-party administrator, on a self-identifying or anonymous basis, by calling the Ethics and Compliance Hotline toll free at 877-888-0002 in the U.S. and Canada. This service, administered by an independent provider, will convey your concerns to an appropriate authority.
If the Vice President, Human Resources receives information regarding a suspected violation of this Code, action will be taken to (a) evaluate such information, (b) determine if the alleged violation involves an executive officer or a director and, if so, inform the Chief Executive Officer and/or Board of Directors of the alleged violation, (c) further determine whether it is necessary to conduct an informal inquiry or a formal investigation and, if so, initiate such inquiry or investigation, and (d) report the results of any such inquiry or investigation, together with a recommendation as to disposition of the matter, to the General Counsel and Chief Financial Officer for action, or if the alleged violation involves an executive officer or a director, report the results of any such inquiry or investigation to the Board of Directors or a committee thereof. Employees, officers and directors are expected to cooperate fully with any inquiry or investigation by the Company regarding an alleged violation of this Code. Failure to cooperate with any such inquiry or investigation may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.
The Company shall determine whether violations of this Code have occurred and, if so, further determine any disciplinary measures to be taken against any employee who has violated this Code. If an alleged violation involves an executive officer or a director, the Chief Executive Officer and Board of Directors, respectively, shall determine whether a violation has occurred and, if so, shall determine the appropriate disciplinary measures to be taken against such executive officer or director.
Failure to comply with standards outlined in this Code may result in disciplinary action, including discharge and restitution. Moreover, any supervisor who directs or approves of any conduct in violation of this Code, or who has knowledge of such conduct and does not immediately report it, also will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. Certain violations of this Code may require the Company to refer the matter to appropriate governmental or regulatory authorities for investigation and/or prosecution.
Dissemination and Amendment
This Code shall be given to each new employee, officer and director of the Company upon commencement of employment or other relationship with the Company, and shall be distributed annually to each employee, officer and director of the Company, and each employee, officer and director shall certify that he/she has received, read and understood this Code and will comply with its terms.

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On September 26, 2006, Analogic Corporation (the "Registrant") announced its financial results for the fiscal quarter and year ended July 31, 2006. The full text of the press release issued in connection with the announcement is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K. The information in this Item 2.02 and the Exhibit attached hereto shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, except as expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
Item 2.06 Material Impairments.
On September 20, 2006, the Audit Committee of the Registrants Board of Directors determined to record two asset impairment charges totaling $11,580,000 for the fiscal quarter and year ended July 31, 2006. The first asset impairment charge of $7,730,000 involved the write-down of capitalized software and inventories that were in excess of the Registrants estimated future requirements related to a medical CT development program. A second impairment charge of $3,850,000 for capitalized software was recorded as a result of the Companys decision to discontinue the development of a medical CT workstation. The Registrant does not expect the impairment charges to result in any future cash expenditures.
Item 8.01 Other Events.
A dispute has arisen between the Registrant and an OEM customer with whom the Registrant has a Development Agreement regarding a medical CT program. The dispute relates to whether either party breached the agreement. If the Registrant and the customer are unable to resolve their differences with respect to the Agreement, arbitration may result. At this stage, the Registrant cannot predict how this dispute will be resolved or determined. The Registrant has not at this time accrued any expenses related to this dispute, but it is possible that the Registrant may in the future incur expenses or liabilities to the OEM customer in connection with this matter.

Comments on the Medical Imaging Business
John Wood, Analogic President and CEO, said, "Fourth-quarter sales of ultrasound systems and subsystems were up significantly from a year ago, as were sales of digital radiography subsystems, but overall results for the quarter were not satisfactory. High-performance CT subsystem revenues were at about the same level as a year earlier, and sales of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) subsystems were down slightly. Results for Anrad, our digital radiography detector subsidiary, improved from a year ago and from the sequential third quarter, but still did not meet our expectations. ANEXA, our subsidiary that markets digital radiography systems directly to end users in niche markets, also fell short of our expectations for the quarter.
"A technology leader in the radiation therapy market, which has been a major Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) customer for several years, has extended its relationship with Analogic by recently awarding the Company a $17 million, one-year supply and manufacturing contract to provide CT Data Acquisition Systems (DASs) and detectors, as well as mechanical and other assemblies, designed to provide advanced imaging functionality for an Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) device.
"Despite the fourth-quarter writedowns and the slower-than-expected growth of our digital radiography subsystems and systems businesses, we expect the considerable progress we made this year in medical imaging, highlighted by CT DASs and ultrasound transducers, to continue in fiscal 2007," Wood said. "We have completed prototype development of PowerLink, an innovative brushless power transmission and optical data link system (patent pending) for CT, which we are employing on the XLB1100 security scanner. We are in proof-of-concept stage for a complete power chain, including brushless transmission, for medical CT.
"Our B-K Medical subsidiary launched the new Pro Focus line of advanced ultrasound scanners and new transducers, which have been well received by the market. We also began shipping LIFEGARD II patient monitors, which measure a number of parameters such as cardiac output and end-tidal CO non-invasively.

Comments on the Security Imaging Business
"Opportunities continue to multiply on the security side of our business," Wood said. "The events of the past two months have focused increased attention on aviation security and on the technological advances that Analogic is bringing to improved security for checked luggage and the checkpoint. We have made considerable progress in security technology and now look to translate that into commercial success for a number of markets.
"As expected, fourth-quarter sales of security imaging systems were down substantially from a year ago, reflecting the completion of a major order in the quarter," said Wood. "A number of EXplosive Assessment Computed Tomography (EXACT) systems originally scheduled for delivery this quarter had been shipped earlier in the fiscal year per the customer's request. As previously announced, this reduced our backlog for the third and fourth quarters. We shipped 11 EXACT units in the fourth quarter, down from 36 systems in the prior fourth quarter, as we awaited a new order for EXACT systems from our OEM customer.
"As we announced separately today, we recently received from L-3 Communications' (NYSE: LLL) subsidiary, L-3 Communications Security and Detection Systems, Inc., an order for the Company's EXACT systems. Under the terms of the order, Analogic will ship units valued at a minimum of $31,000,000 and a maximum $36,000,000 beginning in October 2006 and continuing through January 2008," Wood said. "We expect to convert many of these units into upgraded AN6400 EXACT systems after our AN6400 completes the U.S. Transportation Security Administration's (TSA) Operational Unit Evaluation (OUE). We also announced today that the OUE process is moving forward. The Company has received an order from L-3 Communications Security and Detection Systems, Inc., to install four AN6400 EXACT System upgrade kits at John Wayne Airport in Orange County, California, as part of the OUE. With their state-of-the-art workstation and networking capability, these upgraded EXACT systems will demonstrate Analogic's latest advances in improved detection and higher baggage throughput.
"The Company is continuing development work on three other major security system programs," Wood said. "One of these programs, the COBRA, is an advanced checkpoint explosives and weapons threat detection system. A new COBRA prototype recently completed gathering data on thousands of carry-on items at Boston's Logan International Airport. COBRA has attracted international attention in light of the recently foiled British terrorist plot, and is scheduled for submission to the TSA for certification early next year. We have just received a $3.8 million order for five COBRA systems from the TSA. The Company will install these units and provide service at several airports beginning in early 2007. This is an important step forward for Analogic.
"The Company is also developing the KING COBRA, a system designed to scan checked luggage at small to mid-sized airports, which is scheduled to be submitted for certification next spring," said Wood. "A new generation of high-speed Explosives Detection Systems (EDSs), the XLB1100, is also in development. With a one-meter bore and a scanning rate of up to 1,100 bags per hour, the XLB should be submitted to the TSA for certification by next summer. The COBRA, KING COBRA, and XLB1100 have all been developed with partial funding from the TSA.
"Looking forward, we plan to continue the strategic evaluation of our business structure, focusing our resources on opportunities with the greatest potential for sustainable growth and profitability. Building on our proven ability to deliver engineering excellence and innovative products, we believe that Analogic is creating a strong foundation for long-term success as " Wood concluded.

FOR IMMEDIATE WORLDWIDE RELEASE
Paul M. Roberts Director of Communications (978) 326-4213 proberts@analogic.com
PEABODY, MA (December 11, 2006)  Analogic Corporation (NASDAQ: ALOG), a leading designer and manufacturer of high-precision health and security imaging equipment, announced today results for its first quarter ended October 31, 2006.
Revenues for the first quarter ended October 31, 2006, were $75,602,000, compared with the prior year's first quarter revenues of $86,410,000, a decrease of $10,808,000, or 13%. Net loss for the first quarter was $5,360,000, or a $0.39 net loss per diluted share, compared with earnings of $1,342,000, or $0.10 per diluted share, for the prior year's first quarter. The first quarter ended October 31, 2006, includes pre-tax asset impairment charges of $9,705,000 associated with the Company's digital radiography systems business. The first quarter ended October 31, 2005, included restructuring and asset impairment charges of $2,205,000 related primarily to the Company's former SKY Computers subsidiary.
CEO John Wood, said, "The overall results for the quarter are disappointing. Although our digital radiography business improved slightly, it continued to perform well below earlier expectations. We therefore conducted an in-depth review of the business and as a result of this review recorded asset impairment charges of $9,705,000 related to the writedown of certain assets to their estimated net realizable value."
The continuing strong performance of our core OEM Medical Technology Products business is very encouraging. Medical technology product sales were $67,773,000, up $6,573,000 or 11% over the prior year's first quarter. Revenues for clinical ultrasound systems and subsystems, CT Data Acquisition Systems (DASs), and Computed Tomography (CT) systems were up over good performances a year earlier. Sales of Power Systems for Magnetic Resonance Imaging were down slightly from a year earlier.
The decrease in overall revenue was due primarily to the expected significant short-term decrease in sales of the Company's EXACT security imaging systems. Security technology product revenues were $4,639,000, down $15,227,000 or 77% from the previous year due to the Company shipping only 4 EXACT systems this quarter compared to 35 a year earlier. On September 26, 2006, the Company announced that it had received from L-3 Communications an order for $31 million  $36 million in EXACT systems through January 2008. EXACT sales therefore are expected to resume a more consistent schedule for the second half of this fiscal year and the first half of the next. The Company expects to begin shipping the AN6400 upgrade to the EXACT system later this year, and to put the COBRA checkpoint security system into production.
Ed Becker, President and Chief Operating Officer, noted that research and development costs were down $1,449,000, or 11%, from the prior year's first quarter, due primarily to the winding down of two medical CT development programs and of a successful security imaging project. Becker also noted that, "PhotoDetection Systems, in which we have a substantial minority position, concluded a contract with a major OEM in our recent fourth quarter that includes development funding. As a result of this external funding, the Company's equity losses related to its investment in PhotoDetection Systems have been, and in the future will be, significantly reduced.
Wood added, "Overall, our core medical OEM business is doing very well. Our security business is in the midst of several weak quarters, but the future looks promising. Early in the second quarter we placed prototypes of two of our newest checked luggage scanning systems, the XLB1100 designed for large airports and the KING COBRA designed primarily for small to mid-sized airports, into Logan International Airport in Boston for initial data gathering. In January we will begin shipping five COBRA prototypes to the TSA and several airports to begin visual screening in the field.
"As indicated last quarter, the Company is continuing to evaluate its business structure, focusing our resources on those opportunities with the greatest potential for sustainable growth and profitability. We believe that only in this way can we establish the foundation for long-term growth as The World Resource for Health and Security Technology."

The corporation shall be entitled to participate in, but shall not be entitled to assume the defense of any proceeding brought by or in the right of the corporation or as to which the Covered Person shall have made the conclusion provided for in (ii) above and such conclusion shall have been so confirmed by the corporation's said outside counsel.

Burden of Proof
(e) . The termination of any Proceeding or of any claim, issue, or matter therein, by judgment, order, settlement, or conviction, or upon a plea of guilty or of or its equivalent, shall not (except as otherwise expressly provided in this Article) of itself adversely affect the right of a Covered Person to indemnification or create a presumption that a Covered Person did not act in Good Faith.
Effect of Other Proceedings

Section 10. . Any action, payment, advance determination other than a determination made pursuant to Section 9(a) above, authorization, requirement, grant of indemnification, or other action taken by the corporation pursuant to this Article shall be effective exclusively through any Disinterested person so authorized by the board of directors of the corporation, including the president or any vice president of the corporation.
Action by the Corporation

Insurance

Expenses of Adjudication
Section 15. . If any provision or provisions of this Article shall be held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever:
Severability
(a) the validity, legality, and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Article (including without limitation, each portion of any Section of this Article containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, that is not itself invalid, illegal, or unenforceable) shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby; and
(b) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this Article (including, without limitation, each portion of any Section of this Article containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, that is not itself invalid, illegal, or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent manifested by the provision held invalid, illegal, or unenforceable.

Santa Monica, California 90401
Dear Mr. Francis:
It has been a pleasure to be able to communicate with you regarding your previous and recent stockholder proposals relative to the election of directors of Analogic Corporation.
We have apprised the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of Analogic's Board of Directors of our discussions, and we will, as you and I discussed, present this matter, hopefully to our mutual satisfaction, at the annual meeting of stockholders on January 29, 2007. We look forward to stockholder suggestions for additional members of the Board of Directors so that we can properly elect them from amongst those nominated by Analogic's Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and assure that there is representation of stockholders in all three Analogic director classes.
We received today your letter withdrawing the stockholder proposal for Analogic's 2007 annual meeting of stockholders that you previously submitted on behalf of Catalysis Partners, LLC. Please be aware that your proposal would in any event not have been included in the proxy materials for the 2007 annual meeting of stockholders because it was not received until November 14, 2006, which was after the August 21, 2006, deadline specified in Analogic's 2005 Proxy Statement for such proposals.
Again, we at Analogic thank you for your reconsideration and look forward to carrying out the intent of our discussions in an orderly and appropriate manner.
Sincerely,
/s/ Bernard M. Gordon

At the 2007 Annual Meeting of Stockholders of Analogic Corporation (the "Registrant") held on January 29, 2007 (the "Annual Meeting"), the Registrants stockholders approved an Analogic Corporation 2007 Stock Option Plan (the "2007 Stock Option Plan") and an Analogic Corporation 2007 Restricted Stock Plan (the "2007 Restricted Stock Plan" and, together with the 2007 Stock Option Plan, the "Plans"). A description of the material terms of the Plans is set forth in the Registrants Definitive Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 22, 2006. Copies of the 2007 Stock Option Plan and the 2007 Restricted Stock Plan are attached as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2, respectively, to this Current Report on Form 8-K and are incorporated herein by reference. Copies of the form of Stock Option Award Agreement for the 2007 Stock Option Plan and the form of Restricted Stock Award Agreement for the 2007 Restricted Stock Plan are attached as Exhibits 10.3 an d 10.4, respectively, to this Current Report on Form 8-K and are incorporated herein by reference. At the Annual Meeting, Bernard M. Gordon, who, in his capacity as the Executive Chairman of the Registrant, serves as the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Registrant and also as its principal executive officer on an interim basis while a search for a new chief executive officer is conducted, stated that it is his present intention to complete his service as the Registrants principal executive officer on or before June 15, 2007. The Registrant and John W.

The full text of the Agreement is attached as Exhibit 10.5 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference. The following descri ption of the Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Agreement. Under the Agreement, the Registrant agrees to pay to Mr. Wood on July 2, 2007, provided that Mr. Wood has not revoked the Agreement, a single lump-sum payment of $203,000 (representing six months of Mr. Woods salary at his regular annualized base salary rate of $406,000), less legally required and voluntarily authorized deductions, and otherwise in accordance with the Registrants customary payroll practices. The Agreement further provides that (a) on June 30, 2007, the Registrant shall pay to Mr. Wood an amount equal to the product of 2,000 multiplied by the closing stock price of the Registrants common stock on December 29, 2006 (the "Established Stock Price"), (b) on September 30, 2007, and at the end of each successive three-month period thereafter through and including June 30, 2009, the Registrant shall pay to Mr. Wood an amount equal to the product of 1,000 multiplied by the Establ ished Stock Price, and (c) for a limited duration, which in no event will extend beyond December 31, 2007, the Registrant will continue to pay 80% of the health and/or dental insurance premiums for the continuation of Mr. Woods health and/or dental coverage under the Registrants group plans, provided that Mr. Wood continues to timely pay his 20% share of such premiums. Under the Agreement, Mr. Wood (a) fully and unconditionally releases the Registrant and certain others (collectively referred to in the Agreement as the "Released Parties") from any and all claims, actions, liabilities, and the like of every kind and nature which Mr. Wood has ever had against the Released Parties, (b) agrees to provide certain consulting services and assistance to the Registrant through June 30, 2009, (c) acknowledges and reaffirms his (i) obligation under applicable law and his Proprietary Information and Inventions Agreement with the Registrant dated April 14, 2003 (the "PIIA Agreement"), to keep confi dential certain non-public information concerning the Registrant, (ii) obligation concerning inventions under applicable law and the PIIA Agreement, and (iii) non-competition obligations under his Non-Competition Agreement with the Registrant dated April 14, 2003.

Exhibit 10.1
I. Purpose.
The purpose of the 2007 Analogic Stock Option Plan ("Plan") is to further the growth and development of Analogic Corporation ("Company") by enhancing the Company's ability to attract, motivate and retain certain key Employees and Consultants of the Company and its subsidiary corporations. The Plan permits the grant of Stock Options, both Incentive Stock Options ("ISOs") and Non-Qualified Stock Options ("NQSOs"). The Plan has been adopted and approved by the Company's Board of Directors ("Board") and will become effective upon approval by the Company's stockholders. Unless terminated sooner, the Plan will terminate at the close of business on the day before the tenth anniversary of the date the Plan was approved by the Company's stockholders. Upon termination of the Plan, outstanding Stock Options under the Plan will remain outstanding, but no additional Awards may be issued under the Plan.
.
II. Administration
The Plan shall be administered by the Compensation Committee ("Committee") appointed by the Board except as specified within the Plan. The Committee shall have the authority, except as specified to the contrary within the Plan, to determine eligibility and participation, grant Awards, amend the Plan, determine the terms and provisions of the respective Award Agreements, which need not be the same in all cases, interpret the respective Award Agreements and the Plan, and make all other determinations which, in the Committee's judgment, are necessary or desirable in the administration of the Plan. Any determinations made by the Committee shall be final and binding. In the case of any Awards intended to qualify under the performance-based compensation exemption under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Committee shall exercise its discretion consistent with qualifying the Award as such. Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, no Award outstanding under the Plan may be repriced, regranted through cancellation or otherwise amended to reduce the Exercise Price applicable thereto (other than with respect to adjustments made in connection with a transaction or other change in the Company's capitalization) without the approval of the Company's stockholders.
.
III. Eligibility
All Employees and Consultants are eligible to receive Stock Options under the Plan. Eligibility to receive ISOs is limited to Employees of the Company or a subsidiary corporation as defined in Section 424 of the Code.
IV. Stock Subject to the Plan.
Subject to the provisions of Section VI(a), the maximum number of shares of Common Stock, par value of $.05 per share ("Shares"), which may be issued to Participants under the Plan shall be 250,000 and the maximum number of Shares that may be issued upon exercise of ISOs under the plan is 250,000. Except as specified herein, any Shares subject to an Award which expires or terminates unexercised will again become available for grant under the Plan. Shares tendered or withheld to satisfy the Exercise Price or tax obligations associated with a Stock Option will not become available for further grant under the Plan. In addition, Shares purchased on the open market using proceeds from Stock Option exercises will not become available for further grant under the Plan.
(a) Aggregate Limits.
The maximum number of Shares subject to Stock Options that may be granted to any one Participant in any calendar year under the plan is 150,000 Shares. This limit is intended to comply with Section 162(m) of the Code or any successor provision. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary within the Plan, the foregoing limitations shall be subject to appropriate adjustment under Section VI(a) to the extent that such adjustment will not affect the status of any Stock Option intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code.
(b) Other Limits.
. In connection with a merger or consolidation of an entity with the Company or the acquisition by the Company of property or stock of an entity, the Committee may grant Stock Options in substitution for any stock options granted by such entity or an affiliate thereof. Substitute Awards may be granted on such terms as the Committee deems appropriate in the circumstances, notwithstanding any limitations on Stock Options contained in the Plan. To the extent permitted by the requirements of Section 422 of the Code, the NASDAQ Stock Market ("NASDAQ") or the applicable stock exchange or other legal requirements, any Shares that are issued pursuant to exercise of Stock Options either assumed or converted due to an acquisition will not impact the number of Stock Options available for grant under the Plan.
(c) Substitute Awards
V. Grant, Terms and Conditions Applicable to Stock Option Awards.
The Committee may grant Stock Options to purchase Shares of Common Stock. Each Stock Option granted under the Plan shall be identified in an Award Agreement as either an ISO pursuant to Section 422 of the Code or a NQSO. Any Stock Option designated as an ISO will qualify only to the extent it does not exceed the $100,000 limitation of Section 422(d) of the Code. The Award Agreement shall also specify a number of Shares underlying the Stock Option, the Exercise Price of the Stock Option, the period during which the Stock Option may be exercised and all other terms and, to the extent they are not inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan, any other conditions of the Stock Option the Committee deems necessary or advisable to further the purpose of the Plan or to comply with tax, regulatory and/or accounting principles or requirements.
(a) Grant and Documentation.
. The Exercise Price, which is the amount payable to the Company by the recipient upon exercise of a Stock Option, shall be determined by the Committee. The Exercise Price per Share shall be not less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of Common Stock on the date the Stock Option is granted. The Fair Market Value shall be determined by the mean of the high and low sales prices on the date of grant (or the most recent trading day if the date of grant is not a trading day), provided, however, that the Exercise Price of any ISO granted to a Ten Percent Shareholder shall not be less than 110% of the Fair Market Value of the Shares of Common Stock on the date of grant of the Stock Option.
(b) Option Price
. The Committee may determine the time or times at which each Stock Option awarded under the plan will vest or become exercisable, subject to the limitations provided herein:
(c) Vesting and Exercisability
. No Stock Option may be granted with a term in excess of 10 years, or, in the case of an ISO granted to a Ten Percent Shareholder, five years. . No Stock Option grant, or portion of a Stock Option grant, that vests based on the Continued Service of a Participant will vest earlier than one year from the date the Stock Option was awarded, except as provided under Section V(d) or Section VI(c) of the Plan.
(i) Maximum Term
(ii) Minimum Vesting
Unless otherwise provided in an Award Agreement, Stock Options shall vest, subject to a Participant's Continued Service and other provisions herein, according to the following schedule: 25% of a given Stock Option Award will vest on the second anniversary of the date of grant, with another 25% vesting each subsequent anniversary of the date of grant until the entire grant is vested (at the end of five years). The Committee may, in its discretion, structure the vesting of a Stock Option award upon defined performance criteria and related Company, division, subsidiary or individual goals and objectives.
Except as otherwise determined by the Committee and provided in an Award Agreement:
(d) Effect of Termination of Employment.
(i) in the event a Participant's employment with the Company shall terminate for any reason other than death, Disability, Discharge For Cause, Retirement or Voluntary Resignation (non-retirement), Stock Options that are exercisable as of the date of termination will remain exercisable for 90 days from the date of termination, but under no circumstances will Stock Options be exercisable beyond the expiration of the Stock Option's term and Stock Options that are not exercisable on the date of termination shall be terminated at that time;
(ii) in the case of the death of a Participant, Stock Options held by the Participant at the time of death will accelerate, become fully exercisable and remain exercisable by the Participant's legal representatives or heirs until the earlier of one year from the date of death or the expiration of each Stock Option's term;
(iii) if a Participant's employment terminates due to Disability, Stock Options held by the Participant at the time of such termination will accelerate, become fully exercisable and remain exercisable by the Participant (or such Participant's legal representatives) until the earlier of one year from the date of termination or the expiration of each Stock Option's term;
(iv) if a Participant is Discharged For Cause, all outstanding Stock Options held by the Participant (whether vested or unvested) will be terminated as of the commencement of business on the date of termination;
(v) in the event that a Participant's employment terminates due to Retirement, Stock Options that have been outstanding for less than one year as of the date of Retirement will be forfeited, and Stock Options that have been outstanding for more than one year as of the date of Retirement will continue to vest for up to one year from the date of Retirement and will remain exercisable for up to one year from the date of Retirement, or until the expiration of their term, if sooner, and Stock Options that are vested as of the date of Retirement will also remain exercisable for up to one year from Retirement or until the expiration of their term, if sooner; and
(vi) if a Participant's employment terminates due to Voluntary Resignation (non-retirement), all currently outstanding Stock Options, both vested and unvested, will be forfeited as of the date of Voluntary Resignation.
The Committee shall establish requirements as it deems appropriate in order to ensure that no Shares shall be delivered under the Plan to any Participant or their representatives, until such person(s) have made arrangements acceptable to the Committee for the payment of any Federal, State, Local, Employment or other applicable taxes required by law. The Company may deduct any such tax obligations from any payment of any kind due to the Participant. As determined appropriate by the Committee, minimum tax obligations may be satisfied in whole or in part by the delivery of Shares, including Shares retained from the exercise or other event creating the tax obligation. Any Shares withheld for this reason shall be valued at their Fair Market Value on the date on which the amount of tax to be withheld is determined.
(e) Taxes.
(f) Transferability
.
Each Stock Option by its terms shall not be transferable otherwise than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and shall be exercisable, during a Participant's lifetime (unless Disabled within the meaning of the Plan), only by the Participant.
Stock Options awarded under the Plan may be exercised by delivering notice, as specified in the applicable Award Agreement, along with full payment of the Exercise Price for all Stock Options being exercised. Payment of the Exercise Price for one or more Stock Option(s) may be satisfied (i) in U.S. dollars (cash or check) or (ii) in one or more of the following ways (to the extent permitted by the Committee): through the delivery of an appropriate number of Shares of Common Stock that have been held by the Participant for at least six months, or through a cashless exercise program in conjunction with a securities brokerage firm. No Shares shall be distributed to any Participant prior to the full payment of the Exercise Price to the Company.
(g) Exercise of Stock Options.
. The Committee may at any time provide that any Stock Option shall become immediately exercisable in full or in part, or free of some or all restrictions or conditions.
(h) Acceleration
VI. Effect of Certain Transactions.
In the event of a stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, combination, reclassification or similar change in the capital structure of the Company, the Committee shall make appropriate adjustments to: the number of Shares of stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding Stock Options, the Exercise Price relating to any outstanding Stock Option, the maximum number of Shares available for issuance under the Plan, and the maximum number of Shares subject to Stock Options which may be awarded to any Participant during any tax year of the Company or as ISOs in order to prevent either the dilution or enlargement of the rights of Participants; provided that, any adjustments to ISOs shall be made in accordance with Section 424 of the Code. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event the Company effects a split of the Common Stock by means of a stock dividend and the Exercise Price of and the number of Shares subject to each Stock Option are adjusted as of the date of the distribution of the dividend (rather than as of the record date for such dividend), then an optionee who exercises a Stock Option between the record date and the distribution date for such stock dividend shall be entitled to receive, on the distribution date, the stock dividend with respect to the Shares of Common Stock acquired upon such Stock Option exercise, notwithstanding the fact that such Shares were not outstanding as of the close of business on the record date for such stock dividend.
(a) Change in Capitalization.
   
The Committee shall notify Participants no less than twenty (20) days in advance of any proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Company. Unless specified otherwise in an individual's employment contract or Award Agreement, all unexercised Stock Options shall terminate immediately prior to consummation of such dissolution or liquidation.
(b) Liquidation.
Unless otherwise specified in an individual Award Agreement or otherwise, in the event of a Change-in-Control, each outstanding Stock Option under the Plan shall, immediately prior to such Change-in-Control, accelerate and become fully exercisable, subject to all other terms of the Stock Option or as specified in the Award Agreement and expire no sooner than the earlier of three months from the date of such Change-in-Control or the expiration of its term.
(c) Change-in-Control.
VII. Other Provisions Related To Stock Options.
Neither eligibility under, nor participation in, the Plan shall be construed as giving any person the right to continued employment or any rights as a stockholder except as to Shares that are actually issued under the Plan. Furthermore, no person shall have any claim to receive a Stock Option grant under the Plan. The Committee's grant of Stock Options to a Participant at any time shall not require the Committee to grant any other Stock Option Awards to such Participant or other persons at any time.
(a) Limitation of Rights.

No Stock Option may be granted under the Plan after the day prior to the tenth anniversary of the date the Plan was approved by the Company's stockholders. No Stock Option shall be granted or exercised if the grant of the Stock Option, or the exercise and the issuance of Shares pursuant thereto, would be contrary to law or the regulations of any duly constituted authority having jurisdiction. Furthermore, if any term or provision of the Plan shall be deemed invalid, unlawful or unenforceable, that term or provision in question shall be revised in order to be valid, lawful and enforceable, but will not affect any other provision of the Plan.
(b) Conditions to Effectiveness of the Plan
The Board may amend, suspend or terminate the Plan or any portion thereof at any time provided that:
(c) Alteration, Termination, Discontinuance, Suspension or Amendment.
(i) to the extent required by Section 162(m), no Stock Option granted to a Participant that is intended to comply with Section 162(m) after the date of such amendment shall become exercisable, realizable or vested, as applicable to such Stock Option, unless and until such amendment shall have been approved by the Company's stockholders if required by Section 162(m) (including the vote required under Section 162(m));
(ii) no amendment that would require stockholder approval under the rules of NASDAQ may be made effective unless and until such amendment shall have been approved by the Company's stockholders; and
(iii) if NASDAQ amends its corporate governance rules so that such rules no longer require stockholder approval of material amendments to equity compensation plans, then, from and after the effective date of such amendment to the NASDAQ rules, no amendment to the Plan:
(A) materially increasing the number of shares authorized under the Plan (other than pursuant to Section VI), (B) expanding the types of Stock Options that may be granted under the Plan, or (C) materially expanding the class of participants eligible to participate in the Plan shall be effective unless stockholder approval is obtained.
In addition, if at any time the approval of the Company's stockholders is required as to any other modification or amendment under Section 422 of the Code or any successor provision with respect to ISOs, the Board may not effect such modification or amendment without such approval. No Stock Option shall be granted that is conditioned upon stockholder approval of any amendment to the Plan.
Stock Options may be awarded under the Plan to eligible persons in international locations. Although the Committee may not take any actions that would violate applicable laws, the Committee reserves the right to take necessary actions in order to comply with local regulations and requirements, including without limitation:
(d) International Stock Option Considerations.
(i) the right to establish separate sub-plans or programs to provide for the grant of Stock Options to eligible persons in international jurisdictions,
(ii) the right to tailor such sub-plans in a manner that, as the Committee determines necessary and advisable, to comply with local laws and regulations or to maximize the efficiency of the plan in light of local tax or accounting considerations, and

(e) Conditions to Exercise of Options.
The Committee shall not be obligated to deliver any Shares upon the exercise of Stock Options to the extent that such delivery or distribution would not comply with all applicable laws (including, the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933).

(i) shall have represented, warranted and agreed, in form and substance satisfactory to the Company, both that the Participant is acquiring the Stock Option and, at the time of exercising the Stock Option, that the Participant is acquiring the Shares for their own account, for investment or not with a view to or in connection with any distribution,
(ii) shall have agreed to any restrictions on transfer, in a manner satisfactory to the Committee, and
(iii) shall have agreed to an endorsement which makes appropriate reference to such representations, warranties, agreements and restrictions both on the Stock Option and on the certificate representing the Shares.
. No Stock Option shall provide for deferral of compensation that does not comply with Section 409A of the Code, unless the Committee, at the time of grant, specifically provides that the Stock Option is not intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code. The Company shall have no liability to a Participant, or any other party, if a Stock Option that is intended to be exempt from, or compliant with, Section 409A of the Code is not so exempt or compliant or for any action taken by the Committee.
(f) Compliance With Code Section 409A of the Code
. The provisions of the Plan and all Stock Options made hereunder shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, excluding choice-of-law principles of the law of such state that would require the application of the laws of a jurisdiction other than such state.
(g) Governing Law
As used within the plan, the following definitions apply to the terms indicated below:
VIII. Definitions.

Exhibit 10.2
I. Purpose.
The primary purpose of the 2007 Analogic Restricted Stock Plan ("Plan") is to further the growth and development of Analogic Corporation ("Company") by enhancing the Company's ability to attract, motivate and retain Employees and Consultants of the Company and its subsidiary corporations. In addition, given the criticality of the preservation and development of the Company's proprietary products, trade secrets and know-how, the Plan will promote the interests of the Company and stockholders through providing a means to acquire Non-competition Agreements from key Employees who become Participants under this Plan. The Plan permits the grant of Restricted Stock awards ("Award" or "Awards"). The Plan has been adopted and approved by the Company's Board of Directors and will become effective upon approval by the Company's stockholders. Unless terminated sooner, the Plan will terminate at the close of business on the day before the tenth anniversary of the date the Plan is approved by the Company's stockholders. Upon termination of the Plan, outstanding Awards will remain outstanding, but no additional Awards may be issued under the Plan.
.
II. Administration
The Plan shall be administered by the Compensation Committee ("Committee") appointed by the Board except as specified within the Plan. The Committee shall have the authority, except as specified to the contrary within the Plan, to determine eligibility and participation, grant Awards, amend the Plan, determine the terms and provisions of the respective Award Agreements, which need not be the same in all cases, interpret the respective Award Agreements and the Plan, and make all other determinations which, in the Committee's judgment, are necessary or desirable in the administration of the Plan. Any determinations made by the Committee shall be final and binding. In the case of any Awards intended to qualify under the performance-based compensation exemption under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Committee shall exercise its discretion consistent with qualifying the Award as such.
.
III. Eligibility
All of the Company's Employees and Consultants are eligible to receive Awards under the Plan.
IV. Stock Subject to the Plan.
Subject to the adjustment provisions of Section VI(a), the maximum number of shares of Common Stock, par value $.05 per share ("Shares"), which may be issued to Participants pursuant to Awards under the Plan shall be 500,000 Shares, provided that any Shares underlying Awards which are cancelled, terminated or forfeited, shall again become available for future issuance under the Plan. This limit is intended to comply with Section 162(m) of the Code or any successor provision. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary within the Plan, the foregoing limitations shall be subject to appropriate adjustment under Section VI(a) to the extent that such adjustment will not affect the status of any Award intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code.
(a) Aggregate Limits.
. In connection with a merger or consolidation of an entity with the Company or the acquisition by the Company of property or stock of an entity, the Committee may grant Awards in substitution for any restricted stock granted by such entity or an affiliate thereof. Substitute Awards may be granted on such terms as the Committee deems appropriate in the circumstances, notwithstanding any limitations on Awards contained in the Plan. To the extent permitted by the requirements of the NASDAQ Stock Market ("NASDAQ") or the applicable stock exchange or other legal requirements, any shares that are issued pursuant to Awards either assumed or converted due to an acquisition will not impact the number of Shares available for grant under the Plan.
(b) Substitute Awards
V. Grant Terms and Conditions Applicable to Restricted Stock.
The Committee may grant Awards under the Plan. Each Award granted under the Plan shall be identified in an Award Agreement and subject to restrictions on transfer and ownership as the Committee may determine. The Committee shall determine and specify in each applicable Award Agreement, the number of Shares of Restricted Stock granted to any Participant, subject to the overall and individual maximums specified within the Plan. As soon as practical after the grant of an Award, a Certificate, registered in the Participant's name, shall be issued covering the Shares underlying the Award. The Certificate shall bear a legend referring to the Award Agreement containing the terms, conditions and limitations of the Award. These limitations may include, but are not limited to, the achievement of Performance Goals and/or Continuous Service requirements with the Company. Upon vesting, and not before, the legend bearing the restrictions shall be removed. Unless the Committee determines otherwise, each Certificate issued pursuant to a grant of Restricted Stock shall be held by the Company or its designee prior to the applicable Vesting Date.
(a) Grant and Documentation.
. The Committee shall determine, and the Award Agreement shall specify, the price, if any, to be paid by the Participant for each Share of Restricted Stock.
(b) Price
. At the time of grant, the Committee shall specify in each Award Agreement, the relevant terms of the vesting related to such Award. The Committee may structure the vesting to be based on the attainment of Performance Goals over a Performance Period and/or a Participant's Continuous Service. Except as outlined in Section V(h) or Section VI(b), Awards that vest based solely upon a Participant's Continuous Service will not vest sooner than in three equal increments on each of the first three anniversaries of the date of grant. No portion of an Award may be sold, pledged or otherwise disposed of prior to the occurrence of its Vesting Date, as determined by the Committee.
(c) Vesting
Upon the vesting of Shares of Restricted Stock, the Committee shall issue a new Certificate, free of any restrictive legend relating to such vesting, for the number of Shares whose restrictions have lapsed, although the Committee shall not be required to issue any fractional Shares.
(d) Issuance of Certificates.
At the time of grant, the Committee may specify in a Participant's Award Agreement that acceptance of the Award will constitute an agreement between the Participant and the Company that, during the one year period following the termination of such Participant's employment with the Company, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, such Participant may not accept an identical or substantially similar position to that held by the Participant at the Company immediately prior to termination with any business that is directly competitive with the business of the Company, or otherwise have any material investment or interest in any such competitive business. Should the Committee determine that this agreement had been violated at any point, all Awards whose restrictions have not fully lapsed will be forfeited.
(e) Non-competition Agreements.
Commencing on the date an Award is granted, and subject to the delivery, acceptance and terms of the Award Agreement, the Participant shall become a shareholder of the Company as it relates to the Shares of Restricted Stock underlying the Award. Other than the right to sell the Shares prior to the lapse of the restrictions, and subject to any other terms contained within the Participant's Award Agreement, the Participant shall be entitled to all rights of a shareholder, including the ability to vote those Shares and receive distributions related to those Shares. The Committee, in its discretion, may specify in the applicable Award Agreement whether dividends or other distributions related to Restricted Shares whose restrictions have not lapsed shall be held in escrow or otherwise by the Company until such restrictions lapse, or be distributed at the same time as to general shareholders. To the extent that the restrictions do not lapse due to failure to meet any applicable Continuous Service, Performance Goal, Non-competition or other requirement, any undistributed payments will be forfeited.
(f) Rights of Restricted Stock Recipients.
To the extent consistent with other provisions of the Plan, if the Committee determines at the time an Award is granted, that a Participant is or may become a Covered Employee, the Committee may specify that the following provisions related to Section 162(m) of the Code apply:
(g) Section 
162(m)
.
Upon the grant of an Award, the Committee may specify, based on its discretion, that such Award will vest based upon the achievement of specified Performance Goals over a designated Performance Period. Performance Periods under the Plan may not be shorter than one year and may not exceed five years. Upon the grant of a Performance-Based Award, the Committee shall establish and document in writing, the following terms of the Performance-Based Award: the Performance Period, the Performance Measure(s) and the Performance Goal(s). Once established and documented by the Committee, these items may not be amended or otherwise altered if such changes would cause the Award to lose its qualification as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code. Unless specified in an Award Agreement, or as outlined in Section V(h) or VI(b), Performance-Based Awards shall be distributed only after the end of the Performance Period. Performance-Based Awards, to the extent the Performance Goals are satisfied, may be distributed in a lump sum or in installments after the end of the designated Performance Period, provided any such distributions shall be made in a manner intended to avoid payments constituting nonqualified deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Code.
(i) Performance-Based Awards.
If an Award granted to a Covered Employee, or an Employee who the Committee determines may become a Covered Employee, is intended to qualify under Section 162(m) of the Code, the restrictions associated with the Award shall be subject to the achievement of one or more objective Performance Goals established by the Committee and shall vest only to the extent the attainment of the Performance Goals has been certified by the Committee. Performance Goals shall be based on the achievement of specified levels of one or more of the following: revenue, return on capital, profit after taxes, total shareholder return, stock price performance, cash flow, earnings per share, return on equity, return on assets or net assets, income or net income, operating income or net operating income, operating profit or net operating profit, operating margin or profit margin, return on operating revenue, return on invested capital, market segment share, product development, product release schedules, new product innovation, product or other cost reductions through advanced technology or other means, brand recognition/acceptance, product ship targets, sales of assets or subsidiaries, or customer satisfaction levels.
(ii) Performance Goals.
Performance Goals may be applied to the Company as a whole, a division, business unit or subsidiary and may be based on either absolute performance versus internally established goals or relative performance in relation to other companies or indices. Performance Goals shall be evaluated, as applicable, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and shall be subject to certification by the Committee. As soon as practical following the end of a Performance Period, the Committee shall evaluate and document in writing the extent to which the related Performance Goals have been satisfied and the number of Shares payable under any Performance-Based Award to the Participant. Subject to the express provisions of the Plan, the Committee may exercise its discretion to adjust downward, and not upward, the number of Shares payable under any Performance-Based Award subject to the Plan. Furthermore, the Committee may not refrain from enforcing the lack of achievement of any Performance Goal, except in case of the death or Disability of a Participant holding a Performance-Based Award. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, the Committee may take such other actions as it deems appropriate and necessary to qualify Awards as performance-based compensation within Section 162(m) of the Code, or any successor provision. The Committee shall have the authority to make equitable adjustments to Performance Goals to account for unusual or non-recurring events affecting the Company to account for changes in applicable laws or regulations, items of gain, loss or expense determined to be extraordinary or unusual in nature or related to the disposal of a segment of a business or a change in accounting principles. Performance Goals shall be set by the Committee within the time period outlined by, and shall otherwise be in compliance with, Section 162(m) of the Code and any successor provisions.
(iii) Application of Performance Goals.
The maximum number of Shares of Restricted Stock that may be granted to any one Participant in any calendar year under the Plan is 50,000 Shares. This limit is intended to comply with Section 162(m) of the Code or any successor provision.
(iv) Limitation on Awards to a Participant.
Except as otherwise determined by the Committee and provided in an Award Agreement:
(h) Effect of Termination of Employment.
(i) in the event a Participant's employment with the Company shall terminate for any reason, other than: death, Disability or Involuntary Termination that is not For Cause, all Awards under the Plan whose restrictions have not lapsed will be forfeited;
(ii) in the case of the death or Disability of a Participant, Awards held by the Participant at the time of death or Disability that vest based on Continuous Service will accelerate, fully vest and be distributed to the Participant's legal representatives or heirs in the case of death, or to the Participant or their legal representatives in the case of Disability; and
(iii) in the event that a Participant's employment terminates due to Involuntary Termination that is not For Cause, Awards that vest based on Continuous Service that have been outstanding for less than one year, as of the date of Involuntary Termination that is not For Cause, will be forfeited, and Awards that vest based on Continuous Service that have been outstanding for more than one year, as of the date of Involuntary Termination that is not For Cause, will continue to vest for up to one year from the date of the Involuntary Termination that is not For Cause.
Neither eligibility under, nor participation in, the Plan shall be construed as giving any person the right to continued employment.
If a Participant's employment terminates due to death, Disability or Involuntary Termination that is not For Cause, while holding, at the time of termination of employment, any Award that vests based on the attainment of Performance Goals, if more than 50% of the Performance Period is completed, the number of Shares that will vest upon the date of termination will be based on performance to date (pro-rated).
The Committee shall establish requirements as it deems appropriate in order to ensure that no Shares shall be delivered under the Plan to any Participant or their representatives, until such person(s) has made arrangements acceptable to the Committee for the payment of any Federal, State, Local, Employment or other applicable taxes required by law. The Company may deduct any such tax obligations from any payment of any kind due to the Participant. As determined appropriate by the Committee, minimum tax obligations may be satisfied in whole or in part by the delivery of Shares, including Shares retained from the vesting of Restricted Stock or other event creating the tax obligation. Any Shares withheld for this reason shall be valued at their Fair Market Value on the date of which the amount of tax to be withheld is determined. To the extent a Participant makes an election under Section 83(b) of the Code, within ten days of filing such election with the Internal Revenue Service, the Participant must notify the Company in writing of such election.
(i) Taxes.
(j) Transferability
.
Each Award by its terms shall not be transferable otherwise than by will or the laws of descent and distribution.
. The Company will not be obligated to remove restrictions from any Award until:
(k) Conditions on Removal of Restrictions
(i) all conditions of the Award have been met or removed to the satisfaction of the Company,
(ii) in the opinion of the Company's counsel, all other legal matters in connection with the issuance and delivery of such Shares have been satisfied, including any applicable securities laws and any applicable stock exchange or stock market rules and regulations, and
(iii) the Participant has executed and delivered to the Company such representations or agreements as the Company may consider appropriate to satisfy the requirements of any applicable laws, rules or regulations.
. The Committee may at any time provide that any Award shall become immediately free of some or all restrictions or conditions, or otherwise realizable in full or in part, as the case may be.
(l) Acceleration
VI. Effect of Certain Transactions.
In the event of a stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, combination, reclassification or similar change in the capital structure of the Company, the Committee shall make appropriate adjustments to the following items in order to prevent either the dilution or enlargement of the rights of Participants: the number of Shares covered by outstanding Awards, the price, if any, to be paid by the Participant for each Share of Restricted Stock, the maximum number of Shares available for issuance under the Plan, and the maximum number of Shares subject to Awards which may be awarded to any Participant during any tax year.
(a) Change in Capitalization.
   
Unless otherwise specified in an individual Award Agreement or otherwise, in the event of a Change-in-Control, the restrictions covering each outstanding Restricted Stock Award, whether the restrictions are based on Continuous Service or the attainment of Performance Goals, at the time of the Change-in-Control, shall lapse immediately prior to such Change-in-Control and such Restricted Stock shall no longer be subject to risk of forfeiture.
(b) Change-in-Control.
VII. Other Provisions Related To Restricted Stock.
. The Plan was adopted by the Board of Directors on June 5, 2006 and amended on December 7, 2006. No Award may be granted under the Plan after the day prior to the tenth anniversary of the date the Plan was approved by the Company's stockholders. No Award shall be granted if the grant and/or issuance of Shares pursuant thereto, would be contrary to law or the regulations of any duly constituted authority having jurisdiction. Furthermore, if any term or provision of the Plan shall be deemed invalid, unlawful or unenforceable, that term or provision in question shall be revised in order to be valid, lawful and enforceable, but will not affect any other provision of the Plan.
(a) Conditions to Effectiveness of the Plan
The Board may amend, suspend or terminate the Plan or any portion thereof at any time provided that:
(b) Alteration, Termination, Discontinuance, Suspension or Amendment.
(i) to the extent required by Section 162(m), no Award granted to a Participant that is intended to comply with Section 162(m) after the date of such amendment shall become exercisable, realizable or vested, as applicable to such Award, unless and until such amendment shall have been approved by the Company's stockholders if required by Section 162(m) (including the vote required under Section 162(m));
(ii) no amendment that would require stockholder approval under the rules of NASDAQ may be made effective unless and until such amendment shall have been approved by the Company's stockholders; and
(iii) if NASDAQ amends its corporate governance rules so that such rules no longer require stockholder approval of material amendments to equity compensation plans, then, from and after the effective date of such amendment to the NASDAQ rules, no amendment to the Plan:
(A) materially increasing the number of Shares authorized under the Plan (other than pursuant to Section VI),
(B) expanding the types of Awards that may be granted under the Plan, or
(C) materially expanding the class of participants eligible to participate in the Plan shall be effective unless stockholder approval is obtained.
No Award shall be made that is conditioned upon stockholder approval of any amendment to the Plan.
As an unfunded Plan, the Company will not be required to segregate any assets that may by covered by Awards under the Plan. Any obligations of the Company to Participants will be based upon any documented contractual obligations that may be effected pursuant to the Plan. No such obligation of the Company shall be deemed to be secured by any pledge of, or other encumbrance on, any property of the Company.
(c) Unfunded Plan.
Awards may be granted under the Plan to eligible persons in international locations. Although the Committee may not take any actions that would violate applicable laws, the Committee reserves the right to take all necessary actions in order to comply with local regulations and requirements, including without limitation:
(d) International Considerations.
(i) the right to establish separate sub-plans or programs to provide for the grant of Awards to eligible persons in international jurisdictions,
(ii) the right to tailor such sub-plans in a manner that, as the Committee determines necessary and advisable, will comply with local laws and regulations or maximize the efficiency of the Plan in light of local tax or accounting considerations, and
(iii) the right to take any action required, either before or after the grant of an Award, to comply with any applicable local government regulatory exemptions or approvals.
. No Award shall provide for deferral of compensation that does not comply with Section 409A of the Code, unless the Committee, at the time of grant, specifically provides that the Award is not intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code. The Company shall have no liability to a Participant, or any other party, if an Award that is intended to be exempt from, or compliant with, Section 409A of the Code is not so exempt or compliant or for any action taken by the Committee.
(e) Compliance With Code Section 409A of the Code
. The provisions of the Plan and all Awards made hereunder shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, excluding choice-of-law principles of the law of such state that would require the application of the laws of a jurisdiction other than such state.

FOR IMMEDIATE WORLDWIDE RELEASE
Paul M. Roberts Director of Communications (978) 326-4213 proberts@analogic.com
PEABODY, MA (March 7, 2007)  Analogic Corporation (NASDAQ: ALOG), a leading designer and manufacturer of high-precision health and security imaging equipment, announced today results for its second quarter ended January 31, 2007.
Revenues from continuing operations for the second quarter ended January 31, 2007, were $88,358,000, compared with the prior year's second quarter revenues from continuing operations of $100,011,000, a decrease of 12%. Income from continuing operations for the second quarter before discontinued operations and the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle was $5,420,000, or $0.39 per diluted share, compared to $9,097,000, or $0.66 per diluted share, a year earlier.
Income attributable to the gain on disposal of discontinued operations for the prior year's second quarter ended January 31, 2006, was $20,640,000, or $1.50 per diluted share.
Net income for the second quarter ended January 31, 2007, was $5,420,000, or $0.39 per diluted share, compared to $29,737,000, or $2.16 per diluted share, for the prior year's second quarter. The Company had previously reported a net loss of $5,360,000, or a $0.39 net loss per diluted share in the current year's first quarter ended October 31, 2006. The first quarter ended October 31, 2006, included pre-tax asset impairment charges of $9,705,000 associated with the Company's digital radiography systems business.
Revenues from continuing operations for the six months ended January 31, 2007, were $163,960,000, compared with the prior year's six-month revenues from continuing operations of $186,421,000, a decrease of 12%. Income from continuing operations before discontinued operations and the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for the six-month period was $60,000, or $0.00 per diluted share, compared to $10,160,000, or $0.74 per diluted share, for the same period a year earlier. The financial results for the six months ended January 31, 2006, include pre-tax restructuring and asset impairment charges of $2,707,000, of which $2,216,000 was associated with the Company's former SKY Computers subsidiary.
Income attributable to discontinued operations, the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, and the gain on disposal of discontinued operations for the six months ended January 31, 2006, was $20,919,000, or $1.52 per diluted share. The $20,919,000 includes a net gain of $20,640,000 after taxes, or $1.50 per diluted share, from the sale of our Camtronics Medical Systems subsidiary on November 1, 2005.
Net income for the first six months ended January 31, 2007, was $60,000, or $0.00 per diluted share, compared with $31,079,000, or $2.26 per diluted share, for the same period a year earlier.
The decrease in revenue was due primarily to the expected decline in the sales of the Company's EXplosive Assessment Computed Tomography (EXACT) security imaging systems. Security technology product revenues were down $11,105,000, or 44%, over the prior year's second quarter, as the Company shipped 18 EXACTs compared to 44 units a year earlier. As a result of the $31-36 million order the Company received for EXACTs in September 2006, a more regular shipment schedule is anticipated, but at a significantly lower rate than the Company enjoyed in the first half of last year, when 79 units were shipped. Engineering revenues were lower as well because a number of engineering projects were completed and transferred to production during the quarter.
Ed Becker, President and Chief Operating Officer, noted, "The core medical technology business continued its strong performance this quarter. Shipments of Data Acquisition Systems (DASs) for CT were up 18% over a very strong second quarter a year ago, and shipments of power systems for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) systems were up 11%. Sales of ultrasound probes by the Company's Sound Technology, Inc., (STI) subsidiary exceeded expectations, and shipments of clinical ultrasound systems by B-K Medical improved over the prior second quarter."
During the quarter, prototypes of the new KING COBRA Explosives Detection System (EDS), designed to screen checked luggage at small to mid-sized airports, and the XLB1100 EDS, designed for high-speed screening of checked luggage at high-traffic airports, were placed at Boston's Logan International Airport for data gathering and are on schedule to be submitted to the U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) for certification over the course of the calendar year. Prototypes of the COBRA checkpoint security system are being prepared for shipment to four airports in the very near future, and the system should be submitted for certification shortly thereafter. The AN6400 EXACT system upgrade has completed field evaluations. The Company is now awaiting a TSA determination of what airports should receive system upgrades.
Bernard Gordon, Executive Chairman (Principal Executive Officer), said, "During our first-quarter earnings call, a ten-point program to get the Company back on track was articulated. Overall, I believe we are making considerable progress on that program. Total operating expenses decreased by $2,938,000 for the quarter, compared to a year earlier, due to lower research and development costs and lower general and administrative expenses. We are continuing to evaluate the various aspects of our digital radiography businesses as well as our overall business model, and are making good progress in our search for a new Chief Executive Officer. As a result, I believe we are building a strong foundation for renewed long-term growth for the Company as ."

Exhibit No. Description 10.1 Form of Indemnity Agreement for Analogic Corporations Directors and Executive Officers
Top of the Form
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
Top of the Form

Exhibit 10.1
This Agreement is made as of the day of by and between Analogic Corporation, a Massachusetts corporation (the "Corporation"), and (" " ["Director"/"Executive Officer"]), [a/an director/executive officer] of the Corporation.
     
Director/Executive Officer is currently serving as [a/an director/executive officer] of the Corporation. The Corporation wishes Director/Executive Officer to continue in such capacity. Director/Executive Officer is willing, under certain circumstances, to continue in such capacity.
In the past, in addition to the indemnification to which Director/Executive Officer is entitled pursuant to the By-Laws of the Corporation, and as additional consideration for Director's/Executive Officer's service, the Corporation has furnished, at its expense, directors' and officers' liability insurance to protect Director/Executive Officer in connection with such service. There has been, however, a substantial increase in corporate litigation which subjects directors and officers to expensive litigation risks at the same time that the availability of directors' and officers' liability insurance has been severely limited and the cost of such insurance has increased and may not be acceptable to the Corporation.
Director/Executive Officer has indicated his concern that the indemnities available under the Corporation's By-Laws and the liability insurance in effect or which may be obtained may not be adequate to protect him against the risks associated with his service to the Corporation. Director/Executive Officer has indicated that he may not be willing to continue in office unless adequate liability insurance, indemnification, or a combination of both will be provided. It is the express policy of the Corporation to indemnify its directors and executive officers so as to provide them with the maximum possible protection permitted by law.
Therefore, in order to induce Director/Executive Officer to continue to serve as [a/an director/executive officer], and in consideration of Director's/Executive Officer's continued service after the date hereof, the Corporation and Director/Executive Officer agree as follows:
1. . For purposes of this Agreement:
Definitions
a. The term "Court" means the court in which the Proceeding was brought or is pending or a court having subject matter jurisdiction and personal jurisdiction over the parties to the matter before such court;
b. "Disinterested Director" means a director of the Corporation who is not a party to the Proceeding(s) in question;
c. The term "Expenses" includes, without limitation thereto, expenses of investigations or judicial or administrative proceedings or appeals, attorneys' and accounting fees and disbursements, taxes, expenses of being a witness in a Proceeding, and any expenses of establishing a right to indemnification under or otherwise enforcing this Agreement;
d. The term "Losses" means amounts which Director/Executive Officer pays as a result of a claim or claims made against him in any Proceeding, including, without limitation, damages, judgments, liabilities, fines, penalties, and sums paid in compromise or settlement of a claim or claims;
e. The term "Proceeding" shall include any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit, or proceeding, whether brought in the right of the Corporation or otherwise and whether of a civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative nature, in which Director/Executive Officer may be or may have been involved as a party, a witness, or otherwise, by reason of the fact that Director/Executive Officer is or was a director and/or officer of the Corporation, by reason of any action taken by him or of any inaction on his part while acting as such director and/or officer, or by reason of the fact that he is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, trustee, employee, partner, or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other organization, whether or not he is serving in such capacity at the time any liability or expense is incurred for which indemnification or reimbursement shall be requested or provided for under this Agreement; and
f. References to "other organization" shall include employee benefit plans; references to "fines" shall include any excise tax or penalty assessed with respect to any employee benefit plan; references to "serving at the request of the Corporation" shall include any service as a director, officer, employee, or agent of the Corporation which imposes duties on, or involves services by, such director, officer, employee, or agent with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants, or its beneficiaries; and a person who acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in the interest of, or not opposed to, the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to have acted in a manner "in good faith, and in the reasonable belief that his conduct was in, or not opposed to, the best interest of the Corporation" as referred to in this Agreement.
2. . Director/Executive Officer agrees to serve or continue to serve as [a/an director/executive officer] of the Corporation for so long as he is duly elected or appointed or until the effective date of his written resignation.
Agreement to Serve
3. . The Corporation shall indemnify Director/Executive Officer if he is a party to or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved in any Proceeding, including, without limitation, a Proceeding by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor, against all Losses and Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by Director/Executive Officer in connection with the defense or settlement of such Proceeding.
Indemnity in Third-Party Proceedings
4. . The Corporation shall indemnify Director/Executive Officer if he is a party to or threatened to be made a party to or otherwise involved in any Proceeding by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he was or is a director and/or officer of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee, or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise, against all Losses and Expenses actually and reasonably incurred in connection with the defense or settlement of such Proceeding.
Indemnity in Proceedings by or in the Right of the Corporation
5. .
Right to Indemnification upon Application; Determination to Indemnify
a. Subject to the provisions of Section 9 hereof as to the Advancement of Expenses, indemnification under Sections 3 and 4 hereof shall be made no later than forty-five (45) days after the Corporation is given written request therefor by or on behalf of Director/Executive Officer. Director/Executive Officer shall give to the Corporation written notice as soon as practicable of any Proceeding for which indemnity will or could be sought hereunder; but the omission so to notify the Corporation shall not relieve it from any liability it may have to Director/Executive Officer to make indemnification payments hereunder.
b. Unless prohibited by the express provisions of an applicable statute in a specific case, indemnification pursuant to Sections 3 and 4 hereof and the advancement of Expenses pursuant to Section 9 hereof, as the case may be, shall be automatic and shall not require the approval of the Board of Directors or of the stockholders of the Corporation, or of any other person or body. If such an applicable statute does, however, expressly prohibit such mandatory indemnification in any such specific case, the Corporation, nevertheless, shall promptly cause a meeting of its Board of Directors or stockholders, as the case may be, to be called and held (or, if permitted to take action by written consent in lieu of a meeting, to obtain the requisite written consents) to take action within thirty (30) days of the written request for indemnification pursuant to Sections 3 or 4 or the advancement of Expenses pursuant to Section 9, as the case may be, to determine whether to approve such request. Such determination shall be made (i) by the Board of Directors of the Corporation by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of Disinterested Directors, or (ii) if such a quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable a quorum of Disinterested Directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (iii) by a special litigation/indemnification committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation appointed by the Board, or (iv) by the stockholders. Immediately upon such determination being so made, the Corporation shall furnish the indemnification or advancement requested. If a determination is made not to indemnify Director/Executive Officer or make the advancement, Director/Executive Officer shall have the right to seek an independent determination in favor of the request for indemnification or the advancement from a Court as contemplated under Section 10 hereof and an order requiring the Corporation to make the requested payments or to take such other action as ordered by such Court.
If the Corporation does not respond to a written request for indemnification pursuant to Sections 3 or 4 hereof or the advancement of Expenses pursuant to Section 9, as the case may be, within said thirty (30) day period, the Corporation shall be deemed to have waived any right to refuse to pay such claim under this Agreement or the right to require that the request be approved by the Board of Directors or the stockholders of the Corporation or by any other person or body.
6. . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Corporation shall not be required to furnish indemnification under Sections 3 or 4 of this Agreement in connection with any Proceeding:
Limitations to Indemnification Rights
a. based upon a specific finding by a Court in a final adjudication from which there is no further right of appeal that (i) Director's/Executive Officer's conduct which is the subject of the Proceeding was not in good faith, and in the reasonable belief that his conduct was in, or not opposed to, the best interest of the Corporation, or (ii) with respect to any Proceeding which is criminal in nature, Director/Executive Officer had reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful;
b. for and to the extent payment is actually made to Director/Executive Officer under a valid and collectible insurance policy (which limitation shall not apply to any excess beyond the amount of payment to Director/Executive Officer under such insurance);
c. based upon or attributable to Director/Executive Officer receiving an improper personal benefit to which he was not legally entitled;
d. for an accounting of profits made or deemed by a Court to have been made from the purchase or sale by Director/Executive Officer of securities of the Corporation pursuant to Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and amendments thereto or similar provisions of any federal, state, or local statutory law or common law; or
e. based upon a specific finding by a Court in a final adjudication from which there is no further right of appeal that such indemnification is not lawful.
7. . For the purposes of Section 6 hereof, Director's/Executive Officer's conduct shall not be deemed to have been not in good faith, and not based in the reasonable belief that his conduct was in, or not opposed to, the best interest of the Corporation, Director/Executive Officer shall not be deemed to have had any reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful, nor shall any presumption arise that Director/Executive Officer did not meet any particular standard of conduct or have any particular belief or that a Court has determined that indemnification under this Agreement is not lawful if:
Presumptions in Making Determinations to Indemnify
a. Director's/Executive Officer's conduct was based on the reports or records, including financial statements, books of account, and other financial records, of the Corporation or another organization, and other information and opinions, in each case supplied to him or prepared by or under the supervision of (i) one or more officers or employees of the Corporation whom Director/Executive Officer reasonably believed to be reliable and competent in the matters presented, (ii) counsel, public accountants, or other persons as to matters which Director/Executive Officer reasonably believed to be within such person's professional or expert competence, or (iii) a duly constituted committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation upon which he does not serve, as to matters within its delegated authority, which committee Director/Executive Officer reasonably believed to merit confidence, unless it is determined that Director/Executive Officer had knowledge concerning the matter in question that would cause such reliance to be unwarranted; or
b. if any Proceeding is terminated by judgment, order, settlement (whether with or without court approval), or conviction, or if a plea of guilty or of , or its equivalent, is entered in any Proceeding.
nolo contendere
8. . Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, to the extent that Director/Executive Officer has been successful, on the merits or otherwise, in defense of any Proceeding or in defense of any claim, issue, or matter therein, including the dismissal of an action without prejudice, Director/Executive Officer shall be indemnified against all Expenses incurred in connection therewith.
Indemnification of Expenses in All Cases for Successful Defense
9. . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Expenses incurred by Director/Executive Officer in any Proceeding governed by Sections 3 or 4 shall be paid by the Corporation at reasonable intervals in advance of any final disposition of such Proceeding, in each case within ten (10) days after the Corporation receives Director's/Executive Officer's written request therefor, provided that Director/Executive Officer shall undertake to repay such amounts to the Corporation if it shall ultimately be determined by a Court in a final adjudication from which there is no further right of appeal that he was not entitled to indemnification of such Expenses. Such undertaking need not be secured and shall be accepted by the Board of Directors of the Corporation without reference to the financial ability of Director/Executive Officer to make repayment. Advancement of Expenses pursuant to this section shall not require approval of the Board of Directors or stockholders of the Corporation, or of any other person or body.
Advancement of Expenses
10. . Director/Executive Officer shall have the right to commence litigation in any Court to enforce this Agreement notwithstanding any previous determination not to provide indemnification hereunder. The Corporation hereby consents to the assertion of personal jurisdiction over it, and to venue, in any Court of record of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts or of the United States in the Commonwealth. The burden of proving that Director/Executive Officer is not entitled to indemnification or advancement of Expenses requested by Director/Executive Officer shall be on the Corporation.
Enforcement of this Agreement
11. . This Agreement and the indemnification provided by this Agreement shall not be deemed exclusive of or affect any other rights to which Director/Executive Officer may be entitled under the Corporation's Articles of Organization or By-Laws, any other agreement, any vote of stockholders or Disinterested Directors, the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office. The indemnification under this Agreement shall continue as to Director/Executive Officer even though he may have ceased to be a director or officer. The absence of any express provision for indemnification hereunder shall not limit any right of indemnification existing independently of this Agreement.
Indemnification Hereunder Not Exclusive
12. . If Director/Executive Officer is entitled under any provision of this Agreement to indemnification by the Corporation for some or a portion of the Losses or Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him in the investigation, defense, appeal, or settlement of any Proceeding but not for the total amount thereof, the Corporation shall nevertheless provide indemnification to Director/Executive Officer for that portion of such Losses or Expenses for which it is determined that Director/Executive Officer is entitled to be indemnified hereunder.
Partial Indemnification
13. . The Corporation shall, upon receipt of a written request from Director/Executive Officer, certifying, , that Director/Executive Officer has reasonable grounds to believe that Director/Executive Officer may be made a party to a Proceeding for which Director/Executive Officer may be entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation under this Agreement, create a Trust (the "Trust") for the benefit of Director/Executive Officer, the Trustee of which shall be chosen by Director/Executive Officer. From time to time, upon receipt of a written request from Director/Executive Officer, the Corporation shall fund the Trust in amounts sufficient to satisfy any and all Losses and Expenses reasonably anticipated at the time of such request for which the Corporation may indemnify Director/Executive Officer hereunder. The amount or amounts to be deposited in the Trust pursuant to the foregoing funding obligation shall be determined by mutual agreement of Director/Executive Officer and the Corporation or, if the Corporation and Director/Executive Officer are unable to reach such an agreement, by independent legal counsel selected by Director/Executive Officer. The terms of the Trust shall provide that except upon the consent of Director/Executive Officer and the Corporation, (i) the Trust shall not be revoked or the principal thereof invaded, without the written consent of Director/Executive Officer, (ii) the Trustee shall advance to Director/Executive Officer, within twenty (20) days of a request by Director/Executive Officer, any and all Expenses, Director/Executive Officer hereby agreeing to reimburse the trustee of the Trust for all Expenses so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by a Court in a final adjudication from which there is no further right of appeal that Director/Executive Officer is not entitled to be indemnified under this Agreement, (iii) the Trust shall continue to be funded by the Corporation in accordance with the funding obligations set forth in this section, (iv) the Trustee shall promptly pay to Director/Executive Officer any amounts to which Director/Executive Officer shall be entitled pursuant to this Agreement, and (v) all unexpended funds in the Trust shall revert to the Corporation upon a final determination by independent legal counsel selected by Director/Executive Officer or a Court that Director/Executive Officer has been fully indemnified with respect to the Proceeding giving rise to the establishment of the Trust in question under the terms of this Agreement.
Establishment of Trust
inter
alia
14. . If this Agreement or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on any ground by any Court, then the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify Director/Executive Officer as to Losses and Expenses with respect to any Proceeding to the fullest extent permitted by (i) any applicable portion of this Agreement that shall not have been so invalidated, or (ii) any applicable law, and the Corporation hereby consents and agrees that this Agreement may be modified accordingly by any Court.
Savings Clause
15. . All notices, requests, demands, and other communications in connection with this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given when received if personally delivered or mailed by certified mail or sent by nationwide overnight commercial courier to the parties hereto at the addresses listed below for them or to such other address as either party may give to the other party in the manner required by this section:

The waiver or the failure to take action with regard to any breach of any term or condition of this Agreement shall not be deemed to constitute a continuing waiver or a waiver of any other breach of the same or any other term or condition.

18.  . This Agreement shall be binding upon and be enforceable against the Corporation and its legal representatives, successors, and assigns, including any direct or indirect successor by purchase, merger, consolidation, or otherwise to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Corporation. All agreements and obligations of the Corporation under this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, Director/Executive Officer and Director's/Executive Officer's legal representatives, executors, administrators, heirs, beneficiaries, and distributees, and any other person representing the estate of Director/Executive Officer (collectively, "Person"), continuously for so long as Director/Executive Officer or any such Person or the estate of Director/Executive Officer, as the case may be, shall be subject to any Proceeding for which indemnification hereunder could have been sought by Director/Executive Officer.

PEABODY, MA (September 24, 2007)  Analogic Corporation (NASDAQ: ALOG), a leading designer and manufacturer of high-precision health and security imaging equipment, today announced revenues and earnings for its fourth quarter and twelve-month period ended July 31, 2007.
Revenues from continuing operations for the fourth quarter ended July 31, 2007, were $92,933,000, compared with the prior year's fourth-quarter revenues from continuing operations of $83,718,000, an increase of $9,215,000, or 11%. Net income from continuing operations for the quarter ended July 31, 2007, before discontinued operations and the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, was $8,322,000, or $0.60 per diluted share, compared with a net loss from continuing operations of $8,070,000, or a loss of $0.59 per diluted share, for the prior year's fourth quarter.
During the fourth quarter of the year ending July 31, 2007, Bio-Imaging Research, Inc. (BIR), of Lincolnshire, Illinois, of which Analogic had approximately 17% ownership, declared a dividend and made a dividend payment of $1,429,000 to the Company on May 24, 2007. Also on that day Analogic sold its entire ownership interest in BIR for approximately $3,714,000, of which $2,807,000 was paid in cash upon closing, with the remaining $907,000 to be held in escrow for up to two years to secure any indemnification claims. The Company recorded income before taxes on the sale and related dividend income of $4,036,000 during the quarter and will recognize the escrow balance, less any amount used to satisfy indemnification claims, as income before taxes as the cash is received.
During the quarter ended July 31, 2006, the Company recorded restructuring and asset impairment charges totaling $12,085,000 related to a $7,730,000 writedown of capitalized software and excess inventory related to a medical Computed Tomography (CT) development program, a $3,850,000 writedown related to the Company's decision to discontinue the development of a medical CT workstation, and asset impairment and restructuring charges of $505,000 related to the fiscal 2006 closure of the Company's SKY Computers subsidiary. The net loss attributable to discontinued operations and the disposal of discontinued operations for the three months ended July 31, 2006, was $453,000, or a loss of $0.04 per diluted share.
Net income for the fourth quarter ended July 31, 2007, was $8,322,000, or $0.60 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $8,523,000, or a loss of $0.63 per diluted share, for the prior year's fourth quarter.
Revenues for the twelve months ended July 31, 2007, were $340,782,000, compared with the prior year's revenues of $351,445,000, a decrease of $10,663,000, or 3%. Net income from continuing operations before discontinued operations and the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for the twelve-month period was $15,380,000, or $1.10 per diluted share, compared with $4,600,000, or $0.33 per diluted share, for the same period a year ago, an increase of $10,780,000, or 234%.
During the twelve-month period ended July 31, 2006, the Company recorded asset impairment charges of $14,876,000 related to a $7,730,000 writedown of capitalized software and inventory on hand in excess of future estimated requirements related to a medical CT development program, a $3,850,000 writedown related to the Company's decision to discontinue the development of a medical CT workstation, $2,805,000 related to the closure of SKY Computers, Inc., and $491,000 related to the writedown of certain assets to their net realizable value.
During the year ended July 31, 2006, the Company realized a net gain of $20,207,000, or $1.46 per diluted share, from the sale of its Camtronics Medical Systems subsidiary to Emageon, Inc. of Birmingham, Alabama, on November 1, 2005. As a result of the sale, the Company classified the Camtronics business as a discontinued operation and recast its financial statements accordingly to represent the operation as discontinued.
Net income attributable to discontinued operations, the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, and the gain on disposal of discontinued operations for the twelve months ended July 31, 2006, was $20,466,000, or $1.48 per diluted share.
Net income for the twelve months ended July 31, 2007, was $15,380,000, or $1.10 per diluted share, compared with a net income of $25,066,000, or $1.81 per diluted share, for the same period a year earlier.
Jim Green, Analogic President and CEO, said, "Several trends were evident in our health businesses this quarter. Sales of our high-performance CT subsystems were up significantly from a very good quarter a year earlier. Sales of ultrasound systems and subsystems, and of power systems for magnetic resonance imaging, were on a par with last year's strong performance." During the quarter Analogic announced that its Anrad subsidiary had concluded a supply agreement to develop and provide advanced flat-panel digital radiography detector plates to Siemens AG for next-generation Full-Field Digital Mammography (FFDM), which are particularly suitable for use in next-generation tomosynthesis systems. "We expect sales of amorphous Selenium-based, flat-panel detector plates for digital mammography to grow significantly over the course of the next several years," Green noted. During the quarter the Company also concluded an agreement granting CAS Medical Systems, Inc., of Branford, Connecticut, exclusive worldwide rights to market and sell Analogic's innovative LIFEGARD Family of non-invasive patient monitors.
Security revenues were up modestly over a weak quarter a year earlier as the Company shipped 15 EXplosive Assessment Computed Tomography (EXACT) Systems to L-3 Communications, up from 11 systems a year earlier. The Company shipped 52 EXACTs in fiscal 2007, compared to 107 a year earlier. Shortly after the quarter ended, the Company received a $17.5 million order for EXACT systems and upgrade components from L-3.
"The security systems business continues to offer us a number of opportunities," said Green. "We see a sustained demand for our current EXACT system and upgrades. We're also developing checked baggage screening systems for two potentially developing market segments new for Analogic: the KING COBRA for the many small to mid-sized airports that currently use expensive, labor-intensive screening procedures, and the XLB1100 for large, high-volume airports."
Addressing the checkpoint, a segment new to Analogic, at the end of the quarter the Company installed its first Carry-On Baggage Real-time Assessment (COBRA) system at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport in Ohio, the first "Auto-EDS" installed at any airport checkpoint in the world. An Automatic Explosives and Weapons Detection System, the COBRA has performed exceptionally well and been received enthusiastically by checkpoint inspectors and by passengers, who are no longer required to remove laptop computers or "3-1-1" bags of liquids from their carrying cases. The Company is scheduled to install additional COBRA prototypes as the primary screening devices at three additional airports over the next several months.
"This has been a year of significant transition," said Green. "Following a disappointing first quarter, income from operations has improved for three consecutive quarters. As I noted in June, the Company has eliminated losses in its end-user Medical Computed Tomography business and significantly reduced its losses in its Digital Radiography business. We trimmed some administrative expenses and sharpened the focus of our research and development efforts, reducing expenditures while continuing to invest in exciting breakthrough technologies, such as our new, high-power, non-contact
PowerLink. Significant advances in computed tomography, like the PowerLink, have application in both our health and security businesses. We continue to focus our resources on the health and security opportunities that have the greatest potential for long-term growth and profitability. We are confident that we have the building blocks  solid base businesses; advanced, proprietary technology; and a strong balance sheet  to help ensure Analogic's long-term success as "
The World Resource for Health and Security Technology.

Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On October 4, 2007, Analogic Corporation (the "Corporation") entered into indemnity agreements with Fred B. Parks, a director of the Corporation, and Donald B. Melson, an executive officer of the Corporation (each, an "Indemnitee"). The Corporation previously entered into substantially the same form of indemnity agreement with each of the following current directors and executive officers of the Corporation: M. Ross Brown (director), Bernard M. Gordon (director), James J. Judge (director), Michael T. Modic (director), Bruce W. Steinhauer (director), John A. Tarello (director), Edward F. Voboril (director), Gerald L. Wilson (director), John J. Millerick (executive officer), Alex A. Van Adzin (executive officer), Edmund F. Becker, Jr. (executive officer), and James Green (director and executive officer). Each indemnity agreement provides that, subject to certain limitations specified elsewhere therein, the Corporation shall indemnify the Indemnitee if he is a party to or is threatened to be made a pa rty to or is otherwise involved in any Proceeding, including, without limitation, a Proceeding by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor, against all Losses and Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with the defense or settlement of such Proceeding. Each indemnity agreement also provides that, subject to certain limitations specified elsewhere therein, the Corporation shall indemnify the Indemnitee if he is a party to or threatened to be made a party to or otherwise involved in any Proceeding by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he was or is a director and/or officer of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, employee, or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise, against all Losses and Expenses actually and reasonably incurred in connection with the defense or settlement of such Procee ding. Each indemnity agreement further provides that the Expenses incurred by the Indemnitee in any Proceeding governed by the relevant sections of the indemnity agreement shall be paid by the Corporation at reasonable intervals in advance of any final disposition of such Proceeding, provided that the Indemnitee shall undertake to repay such amounts to the Corporation if it shall ultimately be determined by a court in a final adjudication from which there is no further right of appeal that he was not entitled to indemnification of such Expenses. As used in each indemnity agreement, the term "Expenses" includes, without limitation thereto, expenses of investigations or judicial or administrative proceedings or appeals, attorneys and accounting fees and disbursements, taxes, expenses of being a witness in a Proceeding, and any expenses of establishing a right to indemnification under or otherwise enforcing the indemnity agreement. As used in each indemnity agreement, the term "Loss es" means amounts which the Indemnitee pays as a result of a claim or claims made against him in any Proceeding, including, without limitation, damages, judgments, liabilities, fines, penalties, and sums paid in compromise or settlement of a claim or claims. As used in each indemnity agreement, the term "Proceeding" shall include any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit, or proceeding, whether brought in the right of the Corporation or otherwise and whether of a civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative nature, in which the Indemnitee may be or may have been involved as a party, a witness, or otherwise, by reason of the fact that the Indemnitee is or was a director and/or officer of the Corporation, by reason of any action taken by him or of any inaction on his part while acting as such director and/or officer, or by reason of the fact that he is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, trustee, employee, partner, or agent of another corporation, partn ership, joint venture, trust, or other organization, whether or not he is serving in such capacity at the time any liability or expense is incurred for which indemnification or reimbursement shall be requested or provided for under the indemnity agreement. The foregoing description of the indemnity agreements is qualified in its entirety by reference to the form of indemnity agreement filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 10.1
This Agreement is made as of the day of by and between Analogic Corporation, a Massachusetts corporation (the "Corporation"), and (" " ["Director/Executive Officer"]), [a/an director/executive officer] of the Corporation.
     
Director/Executive Officer is currently serving as [a/an director/executive officer] of the Corporation. The Corporation wishes Director/Executive Officer to continue in such capacity. Director/Executive Officer is willing, under certain circumstances, to continue in such capacity.
In the past, in addition to the indemnification to which Director/Executive Officer is entitled pursuant to the By-Laws of the Corporation, and as additional consideration for Director's/Executive Officer's service, the Corporation has furnished, at its expense, directors' and officers' liability insurance to protect Director/Executive Officer in connection with such service. There has been, however, a substantial increase in corporate litigation which subjects directors and officers to expensive litigation risks at the same time that the availability of directors' and officers' liability insurance has been severely limited and the cost of such insurance has increased and may not be acceptable to the Corporation.
Director/Executive Officer has indicated his concern that the indemnities available under the Corporation's By-Laws and the liability insurance in effect or which may be obtained may not be adequate to protect him against the risks associated with his service to the Corporation. Director/Executive Officer has indicated that he may not be willing to continue in office unless adequate liability insurance, indemnification, or a combination of both will be provided. It is the express policy of the Corporation to indemnify its directors and executive officers so as to provide them with the maximum possible protection permitted by law.
Therefore, in order to induce Director/Executive Officer to continue to serve as [a/an director/executive officer], and in consideration of Director's/Executive Officer's continued service after the date hereof, the Corporation and Director/Executive Officer agree as follows:
1. . For purposes of this Agreement:
Definitions
a. The term "Court" means the court in which the Proceeding was brought or is pending or a court having subject matter jurisdiction and personal jurisdiction over the parties to the matter before such court;
b. "Disinterested Director" means a director of the Corporation who is not a party to the Proceeding(s) in question;
c. The term "Expenses" includes, without limitation thereto, expenses of investigations or judicial or administrative proceedings or appeals, attorneys' and accounting fees and disbursements, taxes, expenses of being a witness in a Proceeding, and any expenses of establishing a right to indemnification under or otherwise enforcing this Agreement;
d. The term "Losses" means amounts which Director/Executive Officer pays as a result of a claim or claims made against him in any Proceeding, including, without limitation, damages, judgments, liabilities, fines, penalties, and sums paid in compromise or settlement of a claim or claims;
e. The term "Proceeding" shall include any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit, or proceeding, whether brought in the right of the Corporation or otherwise and whether of a civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative nature, in which Director/Executive Officer may be or may have been involved as a party, a witness, or otherwise, by reason of the fact that Director/Executive Officer is or was a director and/or officer of the Corporation, by reason of any action taken by him or of any inaction on his part while acting as such director and/or officer, or by reason of the fact that he is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, trustee, employee, partner, or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other organization, whether or not he is serving in such capacity at the time any liability or expense is incurred for which indemnification or reimbursement shall be requested or provided for under this Agreement; and
f. References to "other organization" shall include employee benefit plans; references to "fines" shall include any excise tax or penalty assessed with respect to any employee benefit plan; references to "serving at the request of the Corporation" shall include any service as a director, officer, employee, or agent of the Corporation which imposes duties on, or involves services by, such director, officer, employee, or agent with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants, or its beneficiaries; and a person who acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in the interest of, or not opposed to, the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to have acted in a manner "in good faith, and in the reasonable belief that his conduct was in, or not opposed to, the best interest of the Corporation" as referred to in this Agreement.
2. . Director/Executive Officer agrees to serve or continue to serve as [a/an director/executive officer] of the Corporation for so long as he is duly elected or appointed or until the effective date of his written resignation.
Agreement to Serve
3. . The Corporation shall indemnify Director/Executive Officer if he is a party to or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved in any Proceeding, including, without limitation, a Proceeding by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor, against all Losses and Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by Director/Executive Officer in connection with the defense or settlement of such Proceeding.
Indemnity in Third-Party Proceedings
4. . The Corporation shall indemnify Director/Executive Officer if he is a party to or threatened to be made a party to or otherwise involved in any Proceeding by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he was or is a director and/or officer of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee, or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise, against all Losses and Expenses actually and reasonably incurred in connection with the defense or settlement of such Proceeding.
Indemnity in Proceedings by or in the Right of the Corporation
5. .
Right to Indemnification upon Application; Determination to Indemnify
a. Subject to the provisions of Section 9 hereof as to the Advancement of Expenses, indemnification under Sections 3 and 4 hereof shall be made no later than forty-five (45) days after the Corporation is given written request therefor by or on behalf of Director/Executive Officer. Director/Executive Officer shall give to the Corporation written notice as soon as practicable of any Proceeding for which indemnity will or could be sought hereunder; but the omission so to notify the Corporation shall not relieve it from any liability it may have to Director/Executive Officer to make indemnification payments hereunder.
b. Unless prohibited by the express provisions of an applicable statute in a specific case, indemnification pursuant to Sections 3 and 4 hereof and the advancement of Expenses pursuant to Section 9 hereof, as the case may be, shall be automatic and shall not require the approval of the Board of Directors or of the stockholders of the Corporation, or of any other person or body. If such an applicable statute does, however, expressly prohibit such mandatory indemnification in any such specific case, the Corporation, nevertheless, shall promptly cause a meeting of its Board of Directors or stockholders, as the case may be, to be called and held (or, if permitted to take action by written consent in lieu of a meeting, to obtain the requisite written consents) to take action within thirty (30) days of the written request for indemnification pursuant to Sections 3 or 4 or the advancement of Expenses pursuant to Section 9, as the case may be, to determine whether to approve such request. Such determination shall be made (i) by the Board of Directors of the Corporation by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of Disinterested Directors, or (ii) if such a quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable a quorum of Disinterested Directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (iii) by a special litigation/indemnification committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation appointed by the Board, or (iv) by the stockholders. Immediately upon such determination being so made, the Corporation shall furnish the indemnification or advancement requested. If a determination is made not to indemnify Director/Executive Officer or make the advancement, Director/Executive Officer shall have the right to seek an independent determination in favor of the request for indemnification or the advancement from a Court as contemplated under Section 10 hereof and an order requiring the Corporation to make the requested payments or to take such other action as ordered by such Court.
If the Corporation does not respond to a written request for indemnification pursuant to Sections 3 or 4 hereof or the advancement of Expenses pursuant to Section 9, as the case may be, within said thirty (30) day period, the Corporation shall be deemed to have waived any right to refuse to pay such claim under this Agreement or the right to require that the request be approved by the Board of Directors or the stockholders of the Corporation or by any other person or body.
6. . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Corporation shall not be required to furnish indemnification under Sections 3 or 4 of this Agreement in connection with any Proceeding:
Limitations to Indemnification Rights
a. based upon a specific finding by a Court in a final adjudication from which there is no further right of appeal that (i) Director's/Executive Officer's conduct which is the subject of the Proceeding was not in good faith, and in the reasonable belief that his conduct was in, or not opposed to, the best interest of the Corporation, or (ii) with respect to any Proceeding which is criminal in nature, Director/Executive Officer had reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful;
b. for and to the extent payment is actually made to Director/Executive Officer under a valid and collectible insurance policy (which limitation shall not apply to any excess beyond the amount of payment to Director/Executive Officer under such insurance);
c. based upon or attributable to Director/Executive Officer receiving an improper personal benefit to which he was not legally entitled;
d. for an accounting of profits made or deemed by a Court to have been made from the purchase or sale by Director/Executive Officer of securities of the Corporation pursuant to Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and amendments thereto or similar provisions of any federal, state, or local statutory law or common law; or
e. based upon a specific finding by a Court in a final adjudication from which there is no further right of appeal that such indemnification is not lawful.
7. . For the purposes of Section 6 hereof, Director's/Executive Officer's conduct shall not be deemed to have been not in good faith, and not based in the reasonable belief that his conduct was in, or not opposed to, the best interest of the Corporation, Director/Executive Officer shall not be deemed to have had any reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful, nor shall any presumption arise that Director/Executive Officer did not meet any particular standard of conduct or have any particular belief or that a Court has determined that indemnification under this Agreement is not lawful if:
Presumptions in Making Determinations to Indemnify
a. Director's/Executive Officer's conduct was based on the reports or records, including financial statements, books of account, and other financial records, of the Corporation or another organization, and other information and opinions, in each case supplied to him or prepared by or under the supervision of (i) one or more officers or employees of the Corporation whom Director/Executive Officer reasonably believed to be reliable and competent in the matters presented, (ii) counsel, public accountants, or other persons as to matters which Director/Executive Officer reasonably believed to be within such person's professional or expert competence, or (iii) a duly constituted committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation upon which he does not serve, as to matters within its delegated authority, which committee Director/Executive Officer reasonably believed to merit confidence, unless it is determined that Director/Executive Officer had knowledge concerning the matter in question that would cause such reliance to be unwarranted; or
b. if any Proceeding is terminated by judgment, order, settlement (whether with or without court approval), or conviction, or if a plea of guilty or of , or its equivalent, is entered in any Proceeding.
nolo contendere
8. . Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, to the extent that Director/Executive Officer has been successful, on the merits or otherwise, in defense of any Proceeding or in defense of any claim, issue, or matter therein, including the dismissal of an action without prejudice, Director/Executive Officer shall be indemnified against all Expenses incurred in connection therewith.
Indemnification of Expenses in All Cases for Successful Defense
9. . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Expenses incurred by Director/Executive Officer in any Proceeding governed by Sections 3 or 4 shall be paid by the Corporation at reasonable intervals in advance of any final disposition of such Proceeding, in each case within ten (10) days after the Corporation receives Director's/Executive Officer's written request therefor, provided that Director/Executive Officer shall undertake to repay such amounts to the Corporation if it shall ultimately be determined by a Court in a final adjudication from which there is no further right of appeal that he was not entitled to indemnification of such Expenses. Such undertaking need not be secured and shall be accepted by the Board of Directors of the Corporation without reference to the financial ability of Director/Executive Officer to make repayment. Advancement of Expenses pursuant to this section shall not require approval of the Board of Directors or stockholders of the Corporation, or of any other person or body.
Advancement of Expenses
10. . Director/Executive Officer shall have the right to commence litigation in any Court to enforce this Agreement notwithstanding any previous determination not to provide indemnification hereunder. The Corporation hereby consents to the assertion of personal jurisdiction over it, and to venue, in any Court of record of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts or of the United States in the Commonwealth. The burden of proving that Director/Executive Officer is not entitled to indemnification or advancement of Expenses requested by Director/Executive Officer shall be on the Corporation.
Enforcement of this Agreement
11. . This Agreement and the indemnification provided by this Agreement shall not be deemed exclusive of or affect any other rights to which Director/Executive Officer may be entitled under the Corporation's Articles of Organization or By-Laws, any other agreement, any vote of stockholders or Disinterested Directors, the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office. The indemnification under this Agreement shall continue as to Director/Executive Officer even though he may have ceased to be a director or officer. The absence of any express provision for indemnification hereunder shall not limit any right of indemnification existing independently of this Agreement.
Indemnification Hereunder Not Exclusive
12. . If Director/Executive Officer is entitled under any provision of this Agreement to indemnification by the Corporation for some or a portion of the Losses or Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him in the investigation, defense, appeal, or settlement of any Proceeding but not for the total amount thereof, the Corporation shall nevertheless provide indemnification to Director/Executive Officer for that portion of such Losses or Expenses for which it is determined that Director/Executive Officer is entitled to be indemnified hereunder.
Partial Indemnification
13. . The Corporation shall, upon receipt of a written request from Director/Executive Officer, certifying, , that Director/Executive Officer has reasonable grounds to believe that Director/Executive Officer may be made a party to a Proceeding for which Director/Executive Officer may be entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation under this Agreement, create a Trust (the "Trust") for the benefit of Director/Executive Officer, the Trustee of which shall be chosen by Director/Executive Officer.

Hand Delivered
November 21, 2007
Mr. Bernard M. Gordon Chairman of the Board of Directors Analogic Corporation 8 Centennial Drive Peabody, MA 01960
Dear Bernie:
I am sending you this letter to acknowledge my and the rest of the Analogic Board of Directors' appreciation for the role you played during fiscal year 2007 in stabilizing Analogic's operations, and subsequently, assuring a smooth transition to me of the Chief Executive Officer responsibilities. When you first accepted the interim Chief Executive Officer role, it was understood that you would spend approximately half of your time here at Analogic, and the other half at Neurologica. In reality, however, you spent far more than half of your time here at Analogic. Furthermore, your valuable service in the capacity of Advisor to the President from May through July 2007 (and since that time as Chairman of the Board) has enabled me to accelerate the pace of my orientation to Analogic's businesses, customers, employees, culture, etc. This assistance assured a smooth handoff of many of the successful initiatives you had underway while you served as CEO during the prior seven months,. The Board of Directors would like to recognize both your efforts and your success as both Chief Executive Officer and Advisor to the President during fiscal year 2007.
In addition, the Directors would like to acknowledge the long service you provided to Analogic as its Founder and Chief Executive Officer. Recognizing you benefited as a shareholder through the increased value of your founders shares, the Board would also like to recognize the fact that you worked for many years without many of the customary compensation elements typically afforded an individual in the position of Chief Executive Officer, including annual stock awards, supplemental pension benefits, perquisites, etc. In consideration of the above, and of your valuable assistance to me, and of the fact that your tenure as an employee of Analogic has officially come to an end, and of your agreements set forth below, the Board of Directors would like to present you with a special payment of $300,000. Please acknowledge your agreement with the following by signing and returning to me one of the duplicate originals of this letter:
Page 2 November 21, 2007 Bernard M. Gordon
Bernie, I would like to reiterate my sincere appreciation for your guidance since the time of my arrival at Analogic, and I look forward to a continued fruitful relationship with you both as an advisor and as a fellow Analogic Board member.
Sincerely,
James W. Green, President and CEO Analogic Corporation
/s/ JAMES W. GREEN
Acknowledged and agreed to:

For Further Information, Contact: John J. Millerick Senior Vice President & CFO (978) 326-4000
FOR IMMEDIATE WORLDWIDE RELEASE
Paul M. Roberts Director of Communications (978) 326-4213 proberts@analogic.com
PEABODY, MA (December 6, 2007)  Analogic Corporation (NASDAQ: ALOG), a leading designer and manufacturer of high-precision health and security imaging equipment, today announced results for its first quarter ended October 31, 2007.
Highlights of the quarter included:
Revenues for the first quarter ended October 31, 2007, were $94,201,000, compared with the prior year's first quarter revenues of $75,602,000, an increase of $18,599,000, or 25%. On a GAAP basis, net income for the first quarter was $6,388,000, or $0.48 per diluted share, compared with a net loss of $5,360,000, or a loss of $0.39 per diluted share, for the prior year's first quarter. The first quarter ended October 31, 2006, included pre-tax asset impairment charges of $9,705,000 associated with the Company's digital radiography systems business.
On a non-GAAP basis, earnings per share for the first quarter ended October 31, 2007, were $0.53 per diluted share, compared to $0.12 per diluted share for the prior year's first quarter. A reconciliation of all GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures is presented in the financial tables at the end of this news release.
President and CEO Jim Green said, "We are pleased with the solid improvement demonstrated this quarter in both our health and our security businesses. Medical technology revenues were $77,490,000, up 14% over the prior first quarter, while security revenues also improved from a very weak first quarter a year ago. Overall, this is a very good start to the new fiscal year."
Sales of medical imaging products were $52,119,000, up 15% over the prior year's first quarter. The growth was due to increased demand for our advanced subsystems for Computed Tomography (CT), including advanced multislice Data Acquisition Systems (DASs) and new Data Management Systems (DMSs), and for our Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Power Systems. Patient monitoring revenues were essentially flat for the quarter, and medical CT system revenues, as expected, were down from a very strong quarter a year earlier. Digital radiography product revenues were up marginally at $4,866,000, and our B-K Medical subsidiary, specializing in clinical ultrasound, met our expectations, with revenues of $20,505,000, up 5% over the prior year, exclusive of the impact of foreign exchange.
Green added, "We are optimistic about our medical business. We expect to see continuing growth in sales of our high-precision CT and MRI subsystems. During the quarter we received our first production orders for our new high-precision Radio Frequency (RF) amplifier for high-end, 3.0 Tesla Magnetic Resonance Imaging, a significant potential growth area. We also completed feasibility studies on the PowerLink, our innovative non-contact power system for CT, for multiple Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs). After the close of the quarter, B-K Medical introduced the Pro Focus OR, the first dedicated ultrasound system for the operating room. We are expecting continuing growth in demand for B-K Medical's equipment for brachytherapy treatment for prostate cancer, as part of the general growth in urological applications. We are enthusiastic about Anrad's prospects as it starts production of direct, digital, flat-panel detectors for Full-Field Digital Mammography (FFDM) systems."
Security technology revenues were $13,336,000, up from $4,639,000 a year earlier. This was due primarily to the shipment of 15 EXACT systems this quarter, compared to only 4 systems a year earlier. On August 15, 2007, the Company announced that it had received from L-3 Communications an order for $17.5 million in EXACT systems and upgrade equipment scheduled to begin shipping early in 2008.
In October, the Company received an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) order for up to 40 COBRA systems over two years and field support services for over five years at a combined potential value of $37.5 million. The IDIQ included an initial purchase order for 12 COBRA units with installation and support services valued at $7.6 million, and a potential additional $40 million for further engineering services over five years, for a combined maximum potential contract value of $77.5 million.
In summary, Green noted, "Overall, our medical business is doing well. We significantly reduced our loss in digital radiography, down to $1,815,000 for the quarter compared to a loss of $13,956,000, including a $9,705,000 writedown, for the prior first quarter. Our security business is performing at a modestly higher and more stable level than last year, and we are on plan to run it profitably at the current level of shipments. We are continuing development of two new checked-luggage scanning systems, the XLB1100designed for large, high-traffic, airports and the KING COBRA, designed primarily for small to mid-sized airports.
"We have also made a number of changes in the roles and responsibilities of the senior management team," Green added. In July, Doug Rosenfeld joined the Company as Vice President of Human Resources. After the close of the quarter John Fry joined the Company as Vice President, General Counsel, and Corporation Secretary, and John P. O'Connor was appointed Vice President of Engineering. Most recently, Peter Cempellin joined the Company as Vice President and General Manager of our Security Systems Division. Green concluded, "Our medical and security businesses grew substantially during the quarter, while we considerably strengthened an already strong management team. I am confident that we are well on the way to establishing the foundation for Analogic's long-term growth as ."

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This presentation includes non-GAAP financial measures that are not in accordance with, nor an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles.
Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are limited in value because they exclude charges that have a material effect on our reported results and, therefore, should not be relied upon as the sole financial measures to evaluate our financial results. The non-GAAP financial measures are meant to supplement, and to be viewed in conjunction with, GAAP financial results. An explanation and a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures is provided at the end of this press release.
Forward-Looking Statements
This press release contains the Company's or management's intentions, hopes, beliefs, expectations, or predictions. These are considered "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements (statements that are not historical facts) in this presentation are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Investors are cautioned that all forward-looking statements, including statements about product development, market and industry trends, strategic initiatives, regulatory approvals, sales, profits, expenses, price trends, research and development expenses and trends, and capital expenditures involve risk and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by such statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed in the Company's periodic reports filed with the SEC under the heading "Risk Factors." In addition, the forward-looking statements included in this press release represent the Company's views as of December 6, 2007. The Company anticipates that subsequent events and developments will cause the Company's views to change. However, while the Company may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, the Company specifically disclaims any obligation to do so. These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing the Company's views as of any date subsequent to December 6, 2007.
UNAUDITED SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION  RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP MEASURES
The Company provides non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP other (income) expense, non-GAAP income before taxes, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share as supplemental measures to GAAP regarding the Company's operational performance. These financial measures exclude the impact of certain items and, therefore, have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. The adjustments to these non-GAAP financial measures, and the basis for such adjustments, are outlined below:
Share-based compensation expense. The Company incurs expense related to share-based compensation included in its GAAP presentation of cost of sales, research and development, selling and marketing, general and administrative expense. Although share-based compensation is an expense of the Company and viewed as a form of compensation, these expenses vary in amount from period to period, and are affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within the control of management, such as the market price and volatility of the Company's shares, risk-free interest rates, the expected term and forfeiture rates of the awards. In accordance with SFAS No. 123R, share-based compensation expense is calculated as of the grant date of each share-based award, and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the grant date. Management believes that exclusion of these expenses allows comparisons of operating results that are consistent between periods and allows comparisons of the Company's operating results to those of other companies that disclose non-GAAP financial measures that exclude share-based compensation.
Executive transition expenses. In November 2006, John W. Wood Jr. resigned as President of the Company and was temporarily replaced by Bernard M. Gordon, who was appointed as our Executive Chairman, in which capacity he served as both our principal executive officer and Chairman of the Board. James W. Green was appointed as our President and CEO on May 21, 2007, replacing Mr. Gordon as our principal executive officer. Since his arrival Mr. Green has made and is continuing to make a number of changes in the senior leadership team reporting to him. As such, the Company has incurred charges for severance, executive search, relocation and other related expenses. Management believes these charges should be excluded from the non-GAAP results because they are one-time items not associated with the ongoing operations of the business.
Acquisition related expenses. The Company incurs amortization of intangibles and other expenses related to acquisitions it has made in recent years. The intangible assets are valued at the time of acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition. Management believes that exclusion of these expenses allows comparisons of operating results that are consistent over time for both our newly-acquired and long-held businesses.
Asset impairment charges. As a result of continuing losses in its Digital Radiography business and the related business outlook, the Company evaluated the net realizability of all of the related assets at October 31, 2006. As a result, the Company recorded an asset impairment charge of $9,705,000 associated with the write-down of the Company's Digital Radiography system business assets to their estimated fair values as a group based upon the present value of estimated future cash flows of the business. Of the $9,705,000 asset impairment charges, $8,625,000 was recorded to cost of sales and $1,080,000 was recorded to operating expenses. Management believes these charges should be excluded from the non-GAAP results because they are one-time items not associated with the ongoing operations of the business.
Gain on sale of investments. The Company has periodically sold investments in affiliated companies. On May 23, 2007, the Company sold its entire ownership interest in Bio-Imaging Research, Inc. ("BIR"), for approximately $3,714,000, of which approximately $2,807,000 was paid in cash upon closing and the remaining $907,000 was held in escrow for a period of up to two years from the date of closing to secure any indemnification claims, and a dividend of $1,429,000. The dividend and cash payment, net of book value of $200,000, were recorded as other income of $4,036,000 during the three months ended July 31, 2007. During the three months ended October 31, 2007, the Company received $84,000 as an initial escrow payment and recorded that amount as other income. This gain has been presented as a non-GAAP item for that period.
Adjustments for related tax impact. Finally, for purposes of calculating non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings (losses) per share, management adjusts the provision (benefit) for income taxes to tax effect the non-GAAP adjustments described above as they have a significant impact on the Company's income tax provision (benefit).
Management excludes the above-described expenses and their related tax impact in evaluating short-term and long-term operating trends in the Company's operations, and allocating resources to various initiatives and operational requirements. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial adjustments are useful to investors because they allow investors to evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making.
These non-GAAP financial measures have not been prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information provided in accordance with GAAP. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be computed in the same manner as similarly titled measures used by other companies.
The following table (in thousands, except per share data) reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.

Action at Meeting

This Article shall not be construed to invalidate any contract or other transaction which would otherwise be valid under the common or statutory law applicable thereto.

With respect to any such Proceedings to which such Covered Person notifies the Corporation:
Notification and Defense of Claim
(a) The Corporation will be entitled to participate in the defense at its own expense.
(b) Except as otherwise provided below in this subparagraph (b), the Corporation (jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified) will be entitled to assume the defense with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Covered Person.

The Covered Person shall have the right to employ his own counsel in such Proceeding but the fees and expenses of such counsel incurred after notice from the Corporation of its assumption of the defense shall be at the expense of the Covered Person except as provided in this paragraph. The fees and expenses of counsel shall be at the expense of the Corporation if (i) the employment of counsel by the Covered Person has been authorized by the Corporation, (ii) the Covered Person shall have concluded reasonably that there may be a conflict of interest between the Corporation and the Covered Person in the conduct of the defense of such action and such conclusion is confirmed in writing by the Corporation's outside counsel regularly employed by it in connection with corporate matters, or (iii) the Corporation shall not in fact have employed counsel to assume the defense of such proceeding. The Corporation shall be entitled to participate in, but shall not be entitled to assume the defense of any proceeding brought by or in the right of the Corporation or as to which the Covered Person shall have made the conclusion provided for in (ii) above and such conclusion shall have been so confirmed by the Corporation's said outside counsel.
(c) Notwithstanding any provision of this Article to the contrary, the Corporation shall not be obligated to indemnify the Covered Person under this Article for any amounts paid in settlement of any
 
Proceeding effected without its written consent. The Corporation shall not settle any Proceeding or claim in any manner which would impose any penalty, limitation, or disqualification of the Covered Person for any purpose without such Covered Person's written consent. Neither the Corporation nor the Covered Person will unreasonably withhold their consent to any proposed settlement.
(d) If it is determined that the Covered Person is entitled to indemnification other than as afforded under subparagraph (b) above, payment to the Covered Person of the additional amounts for which he is to be indemnified shall be made within ten (10) days after such determination.

Burden of Proof
(e) . The termination of any Proceeding or of any claim, issue, or matter therein, by judgment, order, settlement, or conviction, or upon a plea of guilty or of its equivalent, shall not (except as otherwise expressly provided in this Article) of itself adversely affect the right of a Covered Person to indemnification or create a presumption that a Covered Person did not act in Good Faith.

During the term of this Plan, each Non-Employee Director may elect to receive any or all of his or her Annual Retainer in the form of Deferred Stock Units. Elections to receive Deferred Stock Units pursuant to this Section 6.1 shall be subject to the provisions of this Article 6. If a Non-Employee Director fails to make any such election with respect to his or her Annual Retainer for a given calendar year, or fails to do so in timely fashion pursuant to Section 6.2, none of such Non-Employee Director's Annual Retainer for such calendar year shall be deferred pursuant to this Plan.
6.1 Deferral of Annual Retainers.
Each election described in Section 6.1, with respect to the Annual Retainer for any given calendar year, shall be made by a written notice of election, on a form provided by the Company, which notice is received by the Company no later than December 15 of the preceding calendar year. Each such election may apply solely to such given calendar year or to such given calendar year and one or more consecutively-succeeding calendar years as may be specified by the Participant in his or her election. Each new Non-Employee Director shall make an election with respect to his or her initial Annual Retainer within thirty (30) days after first becoming a Director, provided that such election shall be effective only with respect to amounts that would have
6.2 Election.
 
been received (absent the election) after the last day of the period during which the election may be made. If less than all of an Annual Cash Retainer or an Annual Share Retainer is deferred pursuant to such an election, the amount thereof deferred, respectively, may be made only in ten percent (10%) increments thereof.
The number of Deferred Stock Units to be granted in connection with an election pursuant to this Article 6 shall equal the dollar amount of the Annual Retainer being deferred divided by the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date the scheduled payment to the Director of the amount deferred would have been made.
6.3 Number of Deferred Stock Units.
Subject to the terms of this Plan, all Deferred Stock Units acquired under this Article 6 shall vest fully upon the acquisition of such Deferred Stock Units.
6.4 Vesting of Deferred Stock Units.
Article 7. Deferred Stock Units
Each Deferred Stock Unit shall have an Initial Value equal to the Fair Market Value determined for purposes of Section 6.3. Subsequent to such date of Award, the value of each Deferred Stock Unit shall change in direct relationship to changes in the value of a Share as determined pursuant to a Valuation. Valuations shall be made from time to time with respect to the issuance of: (a) Deferred Stock Units, including those issued by reason of the conversion of dividend equivalents pursuant to Section 7.2, and (b) quarterly reports pursuant to Section 7.6; and at such other times as the Compensation Committee, in its discretion, deems appropriate,
7.1 Value of Deferred Stock Units.
Dividend equivalents shall be earned on Deferred Stock Units provided under this Plan. Such dividend equivalents shall be converted into an equivalent amount of Deferred Stock Units, on the dividend payment date, based upon the Valuation of a Deferred Stock Unit on each date dividend equivalents are converted into Deferred Stock Units. The converted Deferred Stock Units will be fully vested upon conversion.
7.2 Dividend Equivalents.
Except as provided otherwise in this Plan, the payout of the Initial Value combined with the Increased Value or the Decreased Value of each grant of Deferred Stock Units shall be made in a single cash payment within thirty (30) days following the Participant's termination of service on the board or sooner, if so elected by the Participant as part of the election made pursuant to Section 6.2, on a date certain selected by the Participant; provided, however, such selected date may not be less than one year from the date on which such Deferred Stock Units are to be acquired as result of such election by such Participant pursuant to this Plan.
7.3 Timing and Amount of Payout.
Neither a Participant nor his or her beneficiary (as established pursuant to Section 10.3) is eligible to withdraw the Valuation credited to an Account (as defined Section 7.5) prior to the time specified in Section 7.3. However, such Valuation may be subject to early withdrawal if an unforeseeable emergency (within the meaning of Treas. Reg.  1.409A-3(i)(3)) occurs with respect to the Participant. For purposes of this Plan, an unforeseeable emergency is a severe financial hardship resulting from (1) an illness or accident of the Participant, the Participant's spouse, the Participant's beneficiary, or the Participant's dependent; (2) loss of the Participant's property due to casualty; or (3) other similar extraordinary and unforeseeable circumstances arising as a result of events beyond the control of the Participant. A distribution on account of unforeseeable emergency may not be made to the extent that such emergency is or may be relieved (a) through reimbursement or compensation from insurance or otherwise, (b) by liquidation of the Participant's assets (to the extent the liquidation of such assets would not cause severe financial hardship), or (c) by cessation of deferrals under this Plan. The Compensation Committee shall have sole discretion to determine whether to approve any hardship withdrawal, the amount of which shall be limited to the amount deemed by the Compensation Committee reasonably necessary to satisfy the emergency need (which may include amounts necessary to pay any federal, state, local or foreign income taxes or penalties reasonably anticipated to result from the distribution). The Compensation Committee's decision will be final and binding on all interested parties. If the
7.4 Hardship Withdrawals.
 
Compensation Committee approves a hardship withdrawal, (i) no election deferral which is (A) applicable for the remainder of the calendar year within which the hardship withdrawal is received or (B) applicable for the next succeeding calendar year if the Participant's election under Section 6.2 for the year in which the hardship withdrawal is received was applicable for such next succeeding calendar year, shall be given effect, and (ii) no election may be made by such Participant for such next succeeding calendar year (if the Participant's election for the year in which the hardship withdrawal is received was not applicable for such next succeeding calendar).
A Deferred Stock Unit Account (the "Account") shall be established and maintained by the Company for each Participant who receives Deferred Stock Units pursuant to this Plan. As the value of each Deferred Stock Unit changes pursuant to Section 7.1, the Account established on behalf of each Participant shall be adjusted accordingly. Each Account shall be the record of the Deferred Stock Units granted to the Participant pursuant to this Plan on each applicable grant date, shall be maintained solely for accounting purposes, and shall not require segregation of any Company assets.
7.5 Deferred Stock Unit Account.
Each Participant with Deferred Stock Units shall receive quarterly reports providing detailed information about his or her respective Account and changes in that Account during the preceding quarter.
7.6 Quarterly Reports.
Article 8. Reservation of Shares
The Company shall reserve and set aside One Hundred Thousand (100,000) shares of its authorized but unissued $.05 par value Common Stock ("Common Stock" for issuance under this Plan). Issuance of Deferred Stock Units from time to time shall not be deemed to reduce the number of authorized shares then remaining available for issuance under this Plan. In the event of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, combination of shares, or other similar change in capitalization, the number and class of securities available under this Plan shall be equitably adjusted by the Company in the manner determined by the Board or Compensation Committee.
Article 9. Amendment, Modification, and Termination
The board may amend, suspend, or terminate this Plan or any portion thereof at any time and from time to time, subject to all applicable laws, rules, regulations, and the like, including without limitation those which may require stockholder approval
9.1 Alteration, Termination Discontinuance Amendment, Suspension, and Amendment.
Unless required by law, no termination, amendment, or modification of this Plan shall in any material manner adversely affect any Award previously provided under this Plan, without the written consent of the Participant holding the Award.
9.2 Awards Previously Granted.
This Plan was adopted by the board of directors on November 26, 2007 and will become effective upon approval by our stockholders. No Award may be granted under this Plan after the day prior to the tenth anniversary of the date on which this Plan was approved by our stockholders. No Award shall be granted if the grant and/or issuance of Shares pursuant thereto, would be contrary to law or the regulations of any duly constituted authority having jurisdiction. Furthermore, if any term or provision of this Plan shall be deemed invalid, unlawful, or unenforceable, that term or provision in question shall be revised in order to be valid, lawful, and enforceable, but will not affect any other provision of this Plan.
9.3 Conditions to Effectiveness of the Plan.

Except where otherwise indicated by the context, any masculine term used herein also shall include the feminine; the plural shall include the singular and the singular shall include the plural.
10.1 Gender and Number.
The interests of any Participant or beneficiary entitled to payments hereunder shall not be subject to attachment or garnishment or other legal process by any creditor of any such Participant or beneficiary nor shall any such Participant or beneficiary have any right to alienate, anticipate, commute, pledge, encumber, transfer, or assign any of the benefits or rights which he or she may expect to receive, contingently or otherwise, under this Plan except as may be required by the tax withholding provisions of the Code or of a state's income tax act.

(b) Transfers by the Participant to a grantor trust established pursuant to Sections 674, 675, 676, and 677 of the Code for the benefit of the Participant or a person or persons who are members of his or her immediate family (or for the benefit of their descendants) shall be recognized and given effect, provided that any such transfer has not been disclaimed prior to the payment, and the trustee of such trust certifies to the Compensation Committee that such transfer occurred without any payment of consideration for such transfer.
Each Participant under this Plan may, from time to time, name any beneficiary or beneficiaries (who may be named contingently or successively) to whom any benefit under this Plan is to be paid in the event of his or her death. Each designation will revoke all prior designations by the same Participant, shall be in a form provided by the Company, and will be effective only when filed by the Participant in writing with the Compensation Committee during his or her lifetime. In the absence of any such designation, benefits remaining unpaid at the Participant's death shall be paid to the Participant's estate.
10.3 Beneficiary Designation.
Nothing in this Plan shall be deemed to create any obligation on the part of the board to nominate any Director for reelection by our stockholders.
10.4 No Right of Nomination.
In the event of any change in corporate capitalization of the Company, such as a stock split, or a corporate transaction, such as any merger, consolidation, separation, including a spin-off, or other distribution of stock or property of the Company, any reorganization (whether or not such reorganization comes within the definition of such term in Code Section 368) or any partial or complete liquidation of the Company, such adjustment shall be made in the number and class of Shares available for issuance under this Plan and the number and unit price of Deferred Stock Units that are outstanding under this Plan, as may be determined to be appropriate and equitable by the Compensation Committee, in its sole discretion, to prevent dilution or enlargement of rights.
10.5 Stock Splits/Stock Dividends.
All obligations of the Company under this Plan with respect to Awards granted hereunder shall be binding on any successor to the Company, whether the existence of such successor is the result of a direct or indirect purchase, merger, consolidation, or otherwise, of all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company.

The granting of Awards under this Plan shall be subject to all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, and to such approvals by any governmental agencies or national securities exchanges as may be required.
10.7 Requirements of Law.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On January 30, 2008, Analogic Corporation (the "Company") entered into a shares purchase agreement (the "Shares Purchase Agreement") with Chonqing Anke Medical Equipment Co. ("CA") pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell to CA 19.645% of its existing 44.645% equity interest (the "Shares Transfer") in Shenzhen Anke High Tech Co. Ltd ("SAHCO"), located in the Peoples Republic of China, for an aggregate cash consideration of US $2,000,000 (the "Shares Consideration"). Upon conclusion of the transaction, Analogic will hold a 25% equity interest in SAHCO. The Company had previously determined that its investment in SAHCO was impaired; and in the quarter ended January 31, 2006, the Company wrote off the residual net book value of its equity interest. Also on January 30, the parties entered into certain ancillary agreements (the "Ancillary Agreements"), including a debts repayment agreement (the "Debts Repayment Agreement") and a termination agreement (the "Termination Agreement"). The Share s Purchase Agreement also contemplates that the parties will enter into certain agreements relating to an equity joint venture (the "EJV Agreements") for the purpose of allocating certain Chinese trademark rights. The Debts Repayment Agreement relates to the repayment of approximately $643,000 in outstanding debt (the "Outstanding Debt") owed by SAHCO to the Company. The Company had previously determined that $750,000 in receivables due from SAHCO were impaired. Accordingly, in the quarter ended January 31, 2006, the Company recorded an impairment charge in the amount of $750,000. Subsequent to recording the impairment charge, the Company collected approximately $107,000 of the original receivable due from SAHCO. The Outstanding Debt has now been paid in full. The Company currently intends to resume delivery of certain products to SAHCO, which deliveries had previously been suspended. The Termination Agreement terminates certain prior agreements between SAHCO and the Company, including a n on-competition agreement relating to the Companys activities in China. Completion of the Shares Transfer and payment of the Shares Consideration is subject to certain conditions precedent, including Chinese government approvals. The Shares Purchase Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements were executed in English; SAHCO and CA have agreed to use their best efforts out to cause the translation and execution of Chinese versions thereof, as applicable. The terms of the Shares Purchase Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements, and the EJV Agreements were determined on the basis of arms-length negotiations. To the best knowledge of the Company, neither the Company nor any of its affiliates, any director or officer of the Company, or any associate of any such director or officer, had any material relationship with SAHCO or CA. The foregoing description does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Shares Purchase Agreement and the Term ination Agreement, which are filed with this report as Exhibits 2.1 and 2.2, respectively, and incorporated herein by reference.

FOR IMMEDIATE WORLDWIDE RELEASE

PEABODY, MA (March 6, 2008)  Analogic Corporation (NASDAQ: ALOG), a leading designer and manufacturer of high-precision health and security imaging equipment, today announced results for its second quarter ended January 31, 2008. Highlights of the quarter and recent events include:
COBRA and XLB1100 automatic Explosives Detection Systems (EDSs) for air carrier baggage applications
Revenues for the second quarter ended January 31, 2008, were $99,400,000, compared with the prior year's second quarter revenues of $88,358,000, an increase of $11,042,000, or 12%. On a GAAP basis, net income for the second quarter was $7,147,000, or $0.54 per diluted share, compared with a net income of $5,420,000, or $0.39 per diluted share, for the prior year's second quarter.
On a non-GAAP basis, net income for the second quarter ended January 31, 2008, was $7,831,000, or $0.59 per diluted share, compared to a net income of $6,449,000, or $0.46 per diluted share, for the prior year's second quarter.
Revenues for the six months ended January 31, 2008, were $193,601,000, compared with the prior year's first six-month revenues of $163,960,000, an increase of $29,641,000, or 18%. On a GAAP basis, net income for the six months ended January 31, 2008, was $13,535,000, or $1.02 per diluted share, compared with a net income of $60,000, or $0.00 per diluted share, for the prior year's first six months. The six months ended January 31, 2007, included pre-tax asset impairment charges of $9,705,000 associated with the Company's digital radiography systems business.
On a non-GAAP basis, net income for the six months ended January 31, 2008, was $14,890,000, or $1.12 per diluted share, compared to a net income of $8,065,000, or $0.58 per diluted share, for the prior year's first six months. Non-GAAP net income and other non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of certain items. A description of these non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of all GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures are presented in the financial tables at the end of this news release.
President and CEO Jim Green said, "Our medical business continued to show strong growth in the second quarter. Medical technology revenues were up 16% over the prior second quarter, and up 9% from the first quarter of fiscal year 2008. Security technology revenues were down 7% from a year earlier due primarily to a decline in engineering revenues, but security pre-tax income was $1,384,000, compared to a loss of $242,000 a year earlier. We have made substantial progress bringing our cost structure in line with our security business revenues."
Medical imaging revenues for the second quarter were $53,620,000, up more than 15% over the prior year's second quarter. The growth was primarily due to an increased demand for the Company's advanced subsystems for CT, including multislice DASs and Data Management Systems (DMSs), which integrate DASs with X-ray detectors. Revenues for patient monitors and OEM ultrasound probes and transducers were also up relative to last year's second quarter. Revenues from power systems for MRI were flat, and Medical CT revenues were down due to a short-term delay in supplier shipments. Digital Radiography revenues were $5,767,000, up from $3,967,000 in the prior second quarter, due in part to initial ramp up of flat-panel digital mammography detectors by our Anrad subsidiary. Revenues for our B-K Medical subsidiary, specializing in clinical ultrasound, were $24,698,000, up over the prior year due primarily to changes in foreign exchange rates.
Security technology revenues for the quarter were $12,875,000, down slightly from a year earlier. During the quarter, the Company shipped 18 EXplosive Assessment Computed Tomography (EXACT) systems to L-3 Communications, the same quantity shipped during the second quarter of fiscal 2007. The slight decrease in revenues was due to a decline in engineering revenues. Just after the close of the quarter, Analogic announced that it had received a $15 million order from L-3 for EXACT systems to begin shipping in June 2008.
Green added that the recent agreement to acquire Copley Controls Corporation, a leading OEM supplier of gradient amplifiers for MRI systems and of precision motion control systems, announced after the close of the quarter, was another major step forward for the Company. "The addition of Copley Controls will strongly complement our core medical business. With Copley's leading-edge technology in high-field gradient amplifiers, we will be able to expand our product offerings to our OEM customers, better address some significant emerging MRI opportunities in Asia, and further enhance our position as a leading OEM supplier of high-value medical imaging subsystems."
Optimistic regarding continuing growth, Green noted that at the annual Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) meeting in November 2007 both Siemens and Philips introduced top-of-the-line full-field digital mammography systems that incorporate Anrad's advanced digital flat-panel detectors. "We expect that production of these major new systems will ramp up over the next several quarters. Their introduction should generate significant growth in digital mammography and in the demand for Anrad's proprietary amorphous-Selenium-based digital mammography detectors over the next several years."
Green added, "We expect our COBRA automatic explosives and weapons detection system for aircraft passenger checkpoints to be qualified for sale by the U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) within the next several months. Before the end of the fiscal year we expect to begin shipping units under the Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) order received from the TSA last October. Concurrently, we anticipate that the KING COBRA system, designed to scan checked and checkpoint baggage at small to mid-sized airports, will be certified within the next several months and production-ready this summer. The XLB1100 ultra-high-speed, inline checked baggage scanning system is expected to be certified by the TSA several months after the KING COBRA and production-ready in calendar 2009. Subsequent to the end of the quarter we announced an expanded relationship with L-3 Communications, awarding them exclusive worldwide rights to market and service the KING COBRA and the XLB1100 Auto-EDS systems for air carrier checked-baggage applications. With the continuing growth in our medical businesses and the new opportunities in both health and security, I believe we are establishing the foundation for Analogic's long-term growth as ."

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This presentation includes non-GAAP financial measures that are not in accordance with, nor an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles.
Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are limited in value because they exclude charges that have a material effect on our reported results and, therefore, should not be relied upon as the sole financial measures to evaluate our financial results. The non-GAAP financial measures are meant to supplement, and to be viewed in conjunction with, GAAP financial results. An explanation and a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures are provided at the end of this press release.

Forward-Looking Statements
This press release contains the Company's or management's intentions, hopes, beliefs, expectations, or predictions. These are considered "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements (statements that are not historical facts) in this presentation are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Investors are cautioned that all forward-looking statements, including statements about product development, market and industry trends, strategic initiatives, regulatory approvals, sales, profits, expenses, price trends, research and development expenses and trends, and capital expenditures involve risk and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by such statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed in the Company's periodic reports filed with the SEC under the heading "Risk Factors." In addition, the forward-looking statements included in this press release represent the Company's views as of March 6, 2008. The Company anticipates that subsequent events and developments will cause the Company's views to change. However, while the Company may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, the Company specifically disclaims any obligation to do so. These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing the Company's views as of any date subsequent to March 6, 2008.
UNAUDITED SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION  RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP MEASURES
The Company provides non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP other (income) expense, non-GAAP income before taxes, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share as supplemental measures to GAAP regarding the Company's operational performance. These financial measures exclude the impact of certain items and, therefore, have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. The adjustments to these non-GAAP financial measures, and the basis for such adjustments, are outlined below:
Share-based compensation expense. The Company incurs expense related to share-based compensation included in its GAAP presentation of cost of sales, research and development, selling and marketing, general and administrative expense. Although share-based compensation is an expense of the Company and viewed as a form of compensation, these expenses vary in amount from period to period, and are affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within the control of management, such as the market price and volatility of the Company's shares, risk-free interest rates, the expected term and forfeiture rates of the awards. In accordance with SFAS No. 123R, share-based compensation expense is calculated as of the grant date of each share-based award, and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the grant date. Management believes that exclusion of these expenses allows comparisons of operating results that are consistent between periods and allows comparisons of the Company's operating results to those of other companies that disclose non-GAAP financial measures that exclude share-based compensation.
Executive transition expenses. In November 2006, John W. Wood Jr. resigned as President of the Company and was temporarily replaced by Bernard M. Gordon, who was appointed as our Executive Chairman, in which capacity he served as both our principal executive officer and Chairman of the Board. James W. Green was appointed as our President and CEO on May 21, 2007, replacing Mr. Gordon as our principal executive officer. Since his arrival Mr. Green has made and is continuing to make a number of changes in the senior leadership team reporting to him. As such, the Company has incurred charges for severance, executive search, relocation and other related expenses. Management believes these charges should be excluded from the non-GAAP results because they are one-time items not associated with the ongoing operations of the business.
Acquisition related expenses. The Company incurs amortization of intangibles and other expenses related to acquisitions it has made in recent years. The intangible assets are valued at the time of acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition. Management believes that exclusion of these expenses allows comparisons of operating results that are consistent over time for both our newly acquired and long-held businesses.
Asset impairment charges. As a result of continuing losses in its Digital Radiography business and the related business outlook, the Company evaluated the net realizability of all of the related assets at October 31, 2006. As a result, the Company recorded an asset impairment charge of $9,705,000 associated with the write-down of the Company's Digital Radiography system business assets to their estimated fair values as a group based upon the present value of estimated future cash flows of the business. Of the $9,705,000 asset impairment charges, $8,625,000 was recorded to cost of sales and $1,080,000 was recorded to operating expenses. Management believes these charges should be excluded from the non-GAAP results because they are one-time items not associated with the ongoing operations of the business.
Gain on sale of investments and other. During the three months ended October 31, 2007, the Company received $84,000 as an initial escrow payment related to the Q4 2007 sale of its interest in Bio-Imaging Research, which it recorded as other income. On November 1, 2006, the Company sold certain assets of SKY and its obligation to service sold products for a purchase price of $405,000. The $405,000 includes $225,000 in cash paid at closing, $150,000 in cash paid after the closing for additional inventory, and the assumption of $30,000 in liabilities. The Company recorded a gain of $205,000 from the sale in the three and six months ended January 31, 2007. On December 7, 2007, the Company received $555,000 from its insurance company as reimbursement for legal fees incurred in relation to an indemnification matter related to the Company's sale of its wholly-owned subsidiary Camtronics Medical Systems, Ltd. in November 2005. The $555,000 gain was recorded as other income during the three months and six months ended January 31, 2008. These gains have been presented as a non-GAAP item for that period.
Adjustments for related tax impact. Finally, for purposes of calculating non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings (losses) per share, management adjusts the provision (benefit) for income taxes to tax effect the non-GAAP adjustments described above as they have a significant impact on the Company's income tax provision (benefit).
Management excludes the above described expenses and their related tax impact in evaluating short-term and long-term operating trends in the Company's operations, and allocating resources to various initiatives and operational requirements. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial adjustments are useful to investors because they allow investors to evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making.
These non-GAAP financial measures have not been prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information provided in accordance with GAAP. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be computed in the same manner as similarly titled measures used by other companies.
The following table reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.

Item 2.01 Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
On April 14, 2008, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of March 5, 2008, by and among Analogic Corporation ("Analogic"), Canton Merger Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Analogic ("Merger Sub"), Copley Controls Corporation ("Copley"), the Principal Shareholders of Copley named therein, the Additional Shareholders of Copley named therein, and Matthew Lorber, as the Securityholders' Representative (the "Merger Agreement"), Merger Sub merged with and into Copley, with Copley continuing as the surviving corporation and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Analogic (the "Merger").
The consideration paid by Analogic on April 14, 2008 was $76.875 million in cash, which represented the agreed purchase price of $68.75 million plus an adjustment of $8.125 million. The adjustment resulted from Copley's estimated working capital as of the closing date, which included $5.0 million of cash, exceeding the working capital of $16.2 million as required under the terms of the Merger Agreement. The actual indebtedness (which was estimated to be zero) and working capital of Copley as of the closing date will be determined finally after the closing to determine if a further adjustment to the total consideration is required.
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Analogic deposited $8.75 million of the total consideration into an escrow fund to secure certain indemnification obligations of the former securityholders of Copley. On July 14, 2009, the remaining balance of the $8.75 million escrow fund in excess of any amounts held for unresolved claims will be distributed to the former securityholders of Copley. In addition, Analogic deposited (i) $1.0 million of the total consideration into an escrow fund to provide for any payment to Analogic if a further adjustment is required based on Copley's actual indebtedness and working capital as of the closing date and (ii) an additional $1.0 million of the total consideration into an escrow fund to provide for the expenses of the Securityholders' Representative.
Analogic and the former shareholders of Copley have elected to treat the merger as an asset purchase for tax purposes under Section 338(h)(10) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. As a result, Analogic will make a payment to the former shareholders of Copley of up to an additional $1.8 million in the aggregate as reimbursement for the adverse tax impact of the election on the former shareholders.
Analogic estimates that, subject to the final determination of Copley's actual indebtedness and working capital as of the closing date, the total consideration to be paid, including the full reimbursement for the adverse tax impact of the election on Copley's former shareholders, will be approximately $78.675 million.
The foregoing summary of the Merger Agreement does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the full text of the Merger Agreement, which was filed as Exhibit 2.1 to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by Analogic on March 6, 2008 and is incorporated herein by reference.
A copy of the press release announcing the completion of the Merger is filed with this report as Exhibit 99.1.

PEABODY, MA (April 15, 2008)  Analogic Corporation (NASDAQ: ALOG) today announced the successful completion of its acquisition of Copley Controls Corporation. Headquartered in Canton, Mass., Copley is a leading supplier of gradient amplifiers for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and precision motion control systems used in computer-controlled automation systems. Under the terms of the agreement, announced on March 6, 2008, Copley is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Analogic. The consideration paid by Analogic was $76.875 million in cash, which represented the agreed purchase price of $68.75 million plus an adjustment of $8.125 million. The adjustment resulted from Copley's estimated working capital as of the closing date, which included $5.0 million of cash, exceeding the working capital of $16.2 million as required under the terms of the agreement.
Analogic and the former shareholders of Copley have elected to treat the acquisition as an asset purchase for tax purposes. As a result, Analogic will make a payment to the former shareholders of Copley of up to an additional $1.8 million in the aggregate as reimbursement for the tax consequences of the transaction. Analogic estimates that, subject to the final determination of Copley's actual indebtedness and working capital as of the closing date, the total consideration to be paid, including the full reimbursement to Copley shareholders for the tax consequences of the transaction, will be approximately $78.675 million.
Analogic is a high-technology imaging and signal-processing company, providing products and services to Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) and end users in high-growth medical diagnostics and security markets. In addition to being a well known OEM supplier of computed tomography subsystems, Analogic is a leading supplier of Radio Frequency (RF) amplifiers for MRI systems. Copley, founded in 1984, is a leading OEM supplier of gradient amplifiers for MRI systems and of high-precision motion control systems.
In addition to its Canton headquarters, Copley has offices and local technical support in the United States, Europe, and Asia, comprising approximately 250 employees worldwide. Copley's revenues for the calendar year 2006 were $73.6 million; preliminary calendar year 2007 revenues are estimated to be $83 million. Analogic estimates that revenues
related to the acquisition will be approximately $83 million in calendar year 2008 and, excluding one-time purchase accounting adjustments, accretive to earnings in Analogic's fiscal year 2008 and fiscal years thereafter.
Jim Green, Analogic President and CEO, said, "The completion of this acquisition represents a major milestone for our Company. The addition of Copley, with its leading-edge technology in high-field gradient amplifiers and its solid customer base, will enable Analogic to expand its product offerings to its OEM customers, open up new opportunities in Asia, and enhance its position as a leading provider of medical subsystems for MRI scanners. Copley's growing and profitable motion control business provides additional opportunities and a new avenue of growth in the high-technology automation market."

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Copley Controls Corporation
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Copley Controls Corporation and its subsidiary at December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006
 
Copley Controls Corporation ("CCC") is engaged in the design and manufacture of high technology power amplifiers, amplifier systems and related equipment primarily sold in international markets. CCC's products are used in a variety of motion control applications and medical diagnostic systems, principally magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Copley Motion Systems LLC ("CMS") is a manufacturer of linear motor drives.
 
Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Copley Controls Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiary, CMS (collectively, the "Company"). All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The carrying values of these assets approximate their fair values.
Investments
Investments consist of auction rate municipal bonds. These investments are recorded at cost plus accrued interest, which approximates fair market value due to their variable interest rates which typically resets every week. As a result, there are no cumulative gross unrealized holding gains or losses from these investments. All income generated from these investments is recorded as interest income.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue from product sold directly to customers and distributors is recognized upon title passage of inventory. Title generally passes upon shipment, or when the Company places the goods at the disposal of the customer at an agreed-upon, predetermined location. Amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling charges are recorded as revenue upon shipment and the related costs are included in sales and marketing expense. For the years ended December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006, the amounts of shipping and handling charges incurred by the Company were $86,887 and $82,634, respectively.
Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoice amount and do not bear interest. The allowance for doubtful accounts is management's best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses on accounts receivable. The allowance is based on specific identification of probable losses. Management reviews the allowance for doubtful accounts on a monthly basis. Past due balances over 90 days and over a specified dollar amount are reviewed individually for collectibility. Account balances are charged off against the allowance when it is probable the receivable will not be recovered. The Company does not have any off-balance sheet credit exposure related to its customers.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market on a first-in, first-out ("FIFO") basis. The cost of inventories (which includes materials, labor and overhead) is determined on a standard cost basis, which approximates actual cost.
 
Copley Controls Corporation
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006
 
On an annual basis, the Company analyzes inventories. Inventory quantities on hand in excess of forecasted demand are considered to have reduced market value and, therefore, the cost basis is adjusted to the lower of cost or market.
Warranties
The Company's products are generally under warranty against defects in material and workmanship for twelve to eighteen months. Estimated warranty costs are accrued upon shipment of products to customers, based on prior sales history at current cost projections, adjusted periodically to reflect actual experience. These costs also include anticipated retrofit costs for specific products that may require component adjustment or replacement. The total amounts accrued for warranty costs at December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006 are $1,744,147 and $802,797, respectively, of which $1,289,421 and $471,720, respectively, are related to retrofit programs. Warranty expense, a component of cost of goods sold, for the years ended December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006 amounted to $1,883,141 and $871,228, respectively.
The warranty accrual activity for the years ended December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006 is as follows:
 
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are carried at cost. Major additions and improvements are capitalized, while ordinary maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gain or loss is recognized in income for the period.
The Company's property and equipment is being depreciated on a straight-line basis over a range of five to ten years. Leasehold improvements are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or the economic life of the asset.
In accordance with Statement of Position ("SOP") 98-1, , costs associated with the purchase and development of computer software are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the related asset. Total unamortized computer software costs at December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006 are $90,249 and $131,714, respectively. Amortization expense on capitalized computer software for the years ended December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006 was $41,465 and $41,395, respectively.
Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use
Accounting Periods
The Company has a 52/53-week fiscal year whereby the Company ends its fiscal year on the last Saturday of the calendar year. Fiscal years 2007 and 2006 consisted of 52 weeks each.
 
Copley Controls Corporation
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006
 
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Risks and Uncertainties
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to material concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and trade accounts receivable. The Company is exposed to credit risk to the extent of the amounts recorded on the balance sheet. Management believes cash and cash equivalents are placed with high quality financial institutions.
Exposure to losses on trade accounts receivable is principally dependent on each customer's financial condition. In evaluating trade receivables, the Company performs credit evaluations of its major customers' financial condition and monitors closely all related accounts receivable to limit financial exposure by regulating the length of time and amount of credit extended. In certain situations, the Company may require payments in advance. See Note 11 regarding customer concentrations.
The Company currently purchases certain critical components of its products from single-source suppliers. Although there are a limited number of manufacturers of these particular component parts, management believes that other suppliers could provide similar parts on comparable terms. A change in suppliers, however, could cause a delay in manufacturing and a possible loss of sales, which could affect operating results adversely.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
SFAS No. 107, , requires disclosure about the fair value of financial instruments.Financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable. The estimated fair values of these financial instruments approximates their carrying values.
Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Income Taxes
The Company has elected to be taxed under the provisions of Subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code. Under those provisions, the Company does not pay federal income taxes. The stockholders of the Company are liable for individual federal income taxes and a portion of state income taxes on their respective shares of the Company's taxable income. Accordingly, no provisions have been made in the accompanying financial statements for federal income taxes. For the years ended December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006, a state income tax was levied in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts at the corporate level since the Company's gross receipts exceeded nine million dollars. This provision was fully offset by the utilization of research and development and investment tax credits.
At December 29, 2007, the Company has Commonwealth of Massachusetts research and development credits available for carryforward of approximately $1,175,000, of which approximately $1,039,000 expire at various dates in the years 2016 to 2022. These credits are available to offset taxable income. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the realizability of these credits, a full valuation allowance has been recorded against the related deferred tax assets at December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006. As further discussed in Note 14, subsequent to year-end
 
Copley Controls Corporation
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006
 
the Company entered into an agreement and plan of merger whereby 100% of its common stock was sold. It is anticipated that the related tax gain on sale of the business in The Commonwealth of Massachusetts in 2008 will fully utilize all of the available credit carryforwards discussed above.
Recoverability of Long-Lived Assets
The Company's long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances provide evidence that suggest that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The Company assesses the recoverability of its long-lived assets by determining whether the carrying value can be recovered through projected undiscounted future cash flows. Management believes there has been no material impairment of its long-lived assets and, accordingly, no loss has been recognized for the years ended December 29, 2007 or December 30, 2006.
Research and Development
Research and development costs include costs directly associated with the development of new products and technology and are expensed as incurred. These costs totaled $6,873,333 and $5,344,031 for the years ended December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006, respectively. Engineering costs directly associated with manufacturing are capitalized as product costs and expensed to cost of sales in the period in which product sales are recognized. Engineering costs, primarily labor costs, not directly associated with manufacturing costs are expensed as incurred as a component of operating expenses.
Deferred Rental Credits
Deferred rental credits are amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease. At December 29, 2001, $435,000 of credits were established, which were generated as part of the Company's long-term lease in Canton, Massachusetts. During 2007 and 2006, the Company recognized $43,500 each year as a reduction in rent expense associated with these credits. The remaining unamortized credit of $174,000 at December 29, 2007 and $217,500 at December 30, 2006 is included in deferred rental credits in the consolidated balance sheets. Also included as a component of the deferred rental credits is the effect of recording rental expense on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease. At December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006, this amounted to approximately $349,000 and $342,800, respectively.
Other Comprehensive Income
The Company accounts for comprehensive income in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 130, This statement requires disclosure of comprehensive income and its components. Comprehensive income includes all changes in stockholders' equity during a period except those resulting from investments and distributions to stockholders.
Reporting Comprehensive Income.
Other comprehensive income consists of foreign currency translation adjustments arising from CMS using a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar. As reflected in the consolidated statements of stockholders' equity, accumulated other comprehensive income as of December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006 amounted to $282,992 and $259,676, respectively.
Advertising
The Company expenses advertising costs as they are incurred. Total advertising expense for the years ended December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006 was $238,199 and $249,991, respectively.

Stock Compensation
On January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), ("SFAS 123R") which revises SFAS No. 123, and supersedes APB No. 25, SFAS 123R requires all share-based payments to employees to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values using an option-pricing model, such as the Black-Scholes model, at the grant date. The Company used the prospective method of adoption, which requires compensation expense to be recorded for all stock options granted and restricted shares issued, beginning in the period of adoption. For share-based payments granted subsequent to December 31, 2005, compensation expense, based on the fair value at the date of grant, has been recognized in the consolidated statements of income as the related awards vest.
Share-Based Payment
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation ("SFAS 123"),
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees ("APB 25").
Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions
The financial position, results of operations and cash flows of CMS are translated from local currency into U.S. dollars as follows: (a) assets and liabilities at year end exchange rates, and (b) income statement items at the average exchange rates for the year. Translation adjustments are accumulated and presented as other comprehensive income or loss in the consolidated balance sheets.
Foreign currency transaction losses of $3,317 and $50,553 for the years ended December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006, respectively, are included in other income in the consolidated statements of income. The net gains and losses primarily arise from the borrowings and activities of CMS which manufactures linear motor drives in the United Kingdom.
Transactions whose terms are denominated in foreign currencies are recorded at the exchange rate of the foreign currency in effect on the transaction date. Realized and unrealized gains or losses between the transaction and settlement dates or balance sheet date on foreign currency transactions are included in the results of operations.
Reclassifications
Certain amounts in the prior period financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 157, . SFAS No. 157 provides a common definition of fair value and establishes a framework to make the measurement of fair value in generally accepted accounting principles more consistent and comparable. SFAS No. 157 also requires expanded disclosures to provide information about the extent to which fair value is used to measure assets and liabilities, the methods and assumptions used to measure fair value, and the effect of fair value measures on earnings. SFAS No. 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. 157-2, This guidance delays the effective date of SFAS No. 157, for nonfinancial assets and liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually) until fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. The Company is currently assessing the potential effect of SFAS No. 157 on its consolidated financial statements.

In July 2006, the FASB issued Financial Interpretation No. 48, ("FIN 48"), which is a change in accounting for income taxes. FIN 48 also specifies how tax benefits for uncertain tax positions are to be recognized, measured, and derecognized in financial statements; requires certain disclosures of uncertain tax matters; specifies how reserves for uncertain tax positions should be classified on the balance sheet and provides transition guidance, among other provisions. FIN 48 requires that the Company recognize in the financial statements, the impact of a tax position, if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit, based on the technical merits of the position. In January 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FIN 48-2, . This guidance delays the effective date of FIN 48 until years beginning after December 15, 2007 for private companies. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of FIN 48 on its consolidated financial statements.
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes  an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109
Effective Date of FASB Interpretation No. 48 for Certain Nonpublic Enterprises
In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, . This statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. Most of the provisions of SFAS No. 159 apply only to entities that elect the fair value option. However, the amendment to SFAS No. 115, , applies to all entities with available-for-sale and trading securities. SFAS No. 159 is effective as of the beginning of an entity's first fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2007. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of a fiscal year that begins on or before November 15, 2007, provided the entity also elects to apply the provision of SFAS No. 157.
The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115
Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities
In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), , which replaces SFAS No. 141, . The objective of SFAS No. 141 (R) is to improve the relevance, representational faithfulness, and comparability of the information that a reporting entity provides in its financial reports about a business combination and its effects. It establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer: (i) recognizes and measures the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree; (ii) recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase; and (iii) determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. This Statement applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008.

Depreciation expense for the years ending December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006 was $1,476,334 and $1,453,558, respectively.
 
On December 26, 2007, the Company settled a patent infringement matter with another party. The agreement settled all existing claims relative to prior use of the patent and required the other party to grant to the Company a nonexclusive, irrevocable, and perpetual license related to the relevant patents. The license is assignable in the event of a change in control in the Company, as defined. In exchange for the license, the Company is required to make a payment of $460,000, which has been included in accrued expenses and was capitalized on the balance sheet at December 29, 2007. The Company is amortizing this license over the life of the underlying patents, from February 2000 through February 2017, on a straight-line basis. Accordingly, the Company amortized approximately $205,000 related to periods prior to fiscal year 2007, which is included in general and administrative expenses. Approximately $27,000 related to fiscal year 2007 has been included in cost of goods sold.
Intangible assets consisted of the following at December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006:
 
Amortization expense for the years ending December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006 was $240,246 and $69,535, respectively.

Future expected amortization expense for intangible assets for each of the next five years and thereafter is as follows:
 
 
The Company has a revolving line of credit for up to $3,500,000. The line of credit, which is due on demand, originally bore interest at the bank's prime rate less 0.5%. A subsequent amendment to the loan agreement dated March 1, 2005 revised the interest rate to the bank's prime rate less 1.0% (6.25% at December 29, 2007). As of December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006, $0 was outstanding under the line of credit and $3,500,000 remained available for borrowing.
 
The Company has a retirement plan covering substantially all of its employees. The plan is intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company is not required to make any contributions to the plan. In 2006, the Company approved a contribution of $135,000 which was paid during 2007. In 2007, the Company approved a contribution of $135,000 which was paid during 2008. Accordingly, the Company's expense related to the years ended December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006 was $135,000 each year. These amounts have been included in the consolidated statements of income.
 
The Company occupies manufacturing and office facilities in Canton, Massachusetts under a long-term operating lease agreement expiring October 31, 2011, with two options to extend for an additional five years each. The operating lease requires the Company to pay base rent plus a pro rata share of real estate taxes and operating expenses. The annual rental payments aggregated to approximately $1,408,918 and $1,396,000 in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The Company was required to provide a security deposit, which was originally fulfilled by obtaining a standby letter of credit for $850,000. On August 5, 2005, the standby letter of credit was reduced to $300,000 as permitted in the operating lease agreement, concurrent with the Company having exceeded a net worth threshold of $20 million. Additionally, as part of this agreement, the Company received $435,000 in lease incentives, which are being amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the operating lease.

On February 7, 2002, the Company entered into a long-term sublease agreement at its Canton, Massachusetts facility. The agreement called for fixed monthly rent payments and expired on January 31, 2007, with an option to extend for an additional term expiring on January 31, 2012 or October 31, 2011, depending upon the Company's decision to exercise its first five-year lease renewal option. The sublessee was required to give the Company a security deposit at the inception of the lease. On November 2, 2006, the Company and the sublessee terminated their business relationship and the security deposit was applied to past due rent.
The Company assumed an existing operating lease from LDL for its Basildon, England facility. The modified agreement called for fixed monthly rent payments and expired on July 31, 2005. Since the operating lease expired, the lessor and the Company have entered into a tenancy-at-will arrangement which calls for quarterly prepayments of rent. This arrangement may be terminated by either party upon providing 30 days written notice. The Company has no current intention of terminating the arrangement. Accordingly, one year of rental payments is included in its commitment schedule below.
In 2007 and 2006, base rent expense under the Company's operating leases for manufacturing and office space amounted to approximately $1,335,000 and $1,317,000, respectively.
Future minimum rental payments under operating lease agreements, as of December 29, 2007 are as follows:
 
Legal Contingencies
The Company is subject to claims that arise in the normal course of business. In the opinion of management these matters are not expected to have a material effect on the consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company.
 
Stock-Based Compensation Plans
The Company has three stock plans: the 2006 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2006 Plan"), the 1993 Incentive Stock Option Plan (the "ISO Plan") and the 1993 Nonqualified Option Award Plan (the "Nonqualified Plan").
2006 Plan
During 2006, the Company issued the 2006 Equity Incentive Plan. The 2006 Plan is intended to encourage ownership of the Company's common stock by its directors, officers, employees and consultants through the grant of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options and restricted stock. The 2006 Plan is administered by a committee appointed by the Board of Directors. The aggregate number of shares that can be issued under the 2006 Plan is 20,000.

1993 ISO Plan
The Company has an Incentive Stock Option Plan for the benefit of its key employees. The ISO Plan is administered by a committee appointed by the Board of Directors which has the sole authority to grant options, set option prices and determine the vesting period over which options may be exercised. The options are to be granted at not less than the fair value of the stock on the date of the grant and will expire at various dates through January 2013. The options vest over a three- to four-year period. Under the ISO Plan, 40,000 shares were originally reserved for future grants.
1993 Nonqualified Plan
The Company has a Nonqualified Stock Option Plan which permits the issuance of stock options to selected directors of the Company and other nonemployees. The Nonqualified Plan is administered by a committee appointed by the Board of Directors which has the sole authority to grant options, set option prices and determine the vesting period over which the options may be exercised.

The employees are subject to continued employment during the restriction period.
The restricted stock awards vest over a four-year period. As of December 29, 2007 there were 1,125 nonvested restricted stock awards outstanding and $208,277, of total unrecognized compensation related to nonvested restricted stock awards, which is expected to be recognized over the remainder of the four-year vesting period and assumes that there will be no forfeitures. The Company recognized compensation expense of $80,628 and $33,595 using the straight-line attribution method over the vesting period, in accordance with SFAS 123R, for these awards during the years ended December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006, respectively.

Copley Controls Corporation
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006
 
During 2005, the Company recorded notes receivable from certain stockholders totaling $85,500. The full recourse notes bear interest at one-half percent over the prime rate, are collateralized by the stockholders' common stock and are payable, with accrued interest, in January 2009 and 2010. Interest income of approximately $7,400 and $12,000 was earned by the Company during the years ended December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006, respectively. These notes are classified as a reduction of stockholders' equity since the proceeds were used by the stockholders for the purchase of common stock in connection with the exercise of certain stock options. See also Note 14 regarding subsequent events related to notes receivable from stockholders.
 
The Company's trade accounts receivable result primarily from sales to customers in the semi-conductor, packaging equipment, and medical device industries, which are located throughout the United States and certain foreign markets. Sales to one customer, a major worldwide electronics company headquartered in Europe, accounted for approximately 70% and 67% of the Company's revenues for the years ended December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006, respectively. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of revenue. Accounts receivable from this customer amounted to approximately $6,554,000 and $5,820,000 at December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006, respectively.
 
During 2007 and 2006, the Company incurred expenses for legal, engineering, financial and marketing services, either from companies owned by stockholders of the Company or directly from stockholders totaling approximately $269,000 and $318,000, respectively. Additionally, amounts due to these parties totaling $56,594 and $38,962 were included in accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheets at December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006, respectively.
 
In February 1998, the Company adopted a stock redemption liquidity program (the "Program") as a means of providing liquidity to stockholders. Under the Program, the Company can at its election redeem stock of stockholders who have owned shares for at least twelve months. During 2007 and 2006, the Company did not redeem any stock. Cumulative redemptions under the Program totaled $4,050,060 as of December 29, 2007.
 
On March 4, 2008, the Company repurchased 400 shares of common stock that were originally issued on June 30, 2005 when a stock option holder exercised his option via an interest-bearing full recourse term note payable to the Company. The Company repurchased the shares for $74,067, comprised of a cash payment of $25,000 and the forgiveness of the note payable to the Company ($40,000 in principal, plus $9,067 in accrued interest thereon).

On March 5, 2008, the Company entered into an agreement and plan of merger with Analogic Corporation (NASD: ALOG), a leading original equipment manufacturer (OEM) supplier of radio frequency (RF) amplifiers for MRI systems. The merger closed on April 14, 2008, when Analogic Corporation purchased all of the outstanding common stock of the Company for approximately $76.875 million in cash, plus up to an additional $1.8 million in cash to reimburse the Company's shareholders for the tax consequences of the transaction.
Effective April 14, 2008 the Company's revolving line of credit (disclosed in Note 6) and letter of credit (disclosed in Note 8) were terminated.
 

Exhibit 99.3
Unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial data
The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial data set forth below is based on the historical consolidated financial statements of Analogic Corporation and its subsidiaries ("Analogic" or the "Company") and the historical consolidated financial statements of Copley Controls Corporation and its subsidiary ("Copley"), and adjustments described in the accompanying notes to the unaudited pro forma consolidated financial data. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial data is presented to give effect to the Company's acquisition of Copley (the "Merger"). The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet combines the historical consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of January 31, 2008 and Copley as of December 29, 2007, giving effect to the Merger as if it occurred on January 31, 2008. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statements of operations combine the historical consolidated statements of operations of the Company for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2007 and the six months ended January 31, 2008 and of Copley for the twelve months ended June 30, 2007 and the six months ended December 29, 2007, giving effect to the Merger as if it occurred on August 1, 2006.
The pro forma condensed consolidated statements of operations reflect only pro forma adjustments expected to have a continuing impact on the combined results beyond 12 months from the consummation of the Merger and have not been adjusted to reflect any operating efficiencies that may be realized by the Company as a result of the Merger. The Company expects to incur certain charges and expenses related to integrating the operations of itself and Copley. The Company is assessing the combined operating structure, business processes and circumstances that bear upon the operations, facilities and other assets of these businesses and is developing a combined strategic and operating plan. The objective of this plan will be to enhance productivity and efficiency of the combined operations. The nature of any integration-related charges and expenses may include provisions for personnel related costs, idle facility space, and other charges identified in connection with the development and implementation of the plan. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statements of operations do not reflect such charges and expenses.
The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial data are for illustrative purposes only, are hypothetical in nature and do not purport to represent what the Company's results of operations, balance sheet or other financial information would have been if the Merger had occurred as of the dates indicated or what such results will be for any future periods. The unaudited pro forma adjustments are based upon available information and certain assumptions that the Company believes are reasonable, including an allocation of the purchase price based on an estimate of fair value, and exclude certain non-recurring charges as disclosed. These estimates are preliminary and are based on information currently available and could change significantly. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial data and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements, including the related notes, of the Company included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 31, 2007 and its quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended January 31, 2008 and of Copley included in Exhibit 99.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K/A.

1. On April 14, 2008, the Company completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of Copley's Common Stock for cash consideration of $76,875, which represented the agreed purchase price pursuant to the Merger Agreement (the "Agreement") of $68,750 plus an adjustment of $8,125. The adjustment resulted from Copley's estimated working capital as of the closing date, which included $5,000 of cash, exceeding the working capital target of $16,200 as required under the terms of the Agreement. The Company and the former shareholders of Copley have elected to treat the acquisition as an asset purchase for tax purposes. As a result, the Company will make a payment to the former shareholders of Copley of up to an additional $1,800 in the aggregate as reimbursement for the tax consequences of the transaction. Analogic estimates that, subject to the final determination of Copley's actual indebtedness and working capital as of the closing date, the total purchase price to be paid, including the full reimbursement to Copley shareholders for the tax consequences of the Merger currently estimated at $1,000, estimated additional working capital adjustment payments of $787, and estimated transaction costs of $711, will be approximately $79,373.
Under the purchase method of accounting, the assets and liabilities of Copley will be recorded at their fair values as of the acquisition date and added to those of the Company. The reported financial condition and results of operations of the Company after completion of the Merger will reflect these values, but will not be restated retroactively to reflect historical financial position or results of operations of Copley.
The purchase price is determined as follows:
 
For purpose of this pro forma presentation, the estimated purchase price has been allocated, on a preliminary basis, to the acquired tangible and intangible assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values as of January 31, 2008 as follows:
 
 
Unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial data
NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (CONTINUED)
(in thousands, except per share data)
 
The amount allocated to acquired goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets has been attributed to the following categories based on preliminary valuation:
 
The identifiable intangible assets, other than goodwill, will be amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from 0.5 to 14 years on a straight-line basis, which approximates the anticipated economic benefits attributable to them.
The purchase price allocation above is preliminary and is presented for pro forma information only. Actual purchase price allocation will be based on the fair values of assets acquired, including current assets, fixed assets and identifiable intangible assets, and the fair values of the liabilities assumed as of April 14, 2008. The excess of the purchase price over the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired will be allocated to goodwill and will not be amortized in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "." The purchase price allocation will remain preliminary until management of the Company completes its valuation of the significant identifiable intangible assets acquired and determines the fair values of other assets and liabilities acquired. The final amounts allocated to assets and liabilities acquired could differ significantly from the amounts presented in the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

The following describes the pro forma adjustments related to the Merger made in the accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2008 and the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2007 and the six months ended January 31, 2008:

PEABODY, MA (June 5, 2008)  Analogic Corporation (NASDAQ: ALOG), a leading designer and manufacturer of high-precision health and security imaging equipment, announced today results for its third quarter ended April 30, 2008.
Highlights of the quarter and recent events include:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Revenues for the third quarter ended April 30, 2008, were $102,768,000, compared with the prior year's $83,889,000, an increase of 23%. Income from operations was $7,669,000, up 25% from a year earlier. Net income for the third quarter was $6,679,000, or $0.50 per diluted share, remaining flat to the prior year due primarily to lower interest income and a 36% higher tax rate.
Non-GAAP income from operations for the quarter ended April 30, 2008, was $9,401,000, up 37% from last year. Non-GAAP net income was $7,821,000, or $0.59 per diluted share, compared to $7,574,000, or $0.54 per diluted share, last year.
Revenues for the nine months ended April 30, 2008, were $296,369,000, compared to the prior year's nine-month revenues of $247,849,000, an increase of 20%. Income from operations was $21,863,000, up from a loss of $527,000 a year earlier. Net income was $20,214,000, or $1.52 per diluted share, compared to $7,058,000, or $0.50 per diluted share, last year. During the nine-month period ended April 30, 2007, the Company recorded pretax restructuring and asset impairment charges of $9,705,000.
Non-GAAP income from operations for the nine months ended April 30, 2008, was $26,233,000, up 123% from a year earlier. Non-GAAP net income for the nine months ended April 30, 2008, was $22,711,000, or $1.71 per diluted share, compared to non-GAAP net income of $15,639,000, or $1.12 per diluted share, for last year.
Non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of certain items. A description of these non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of all GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures are presented in the financial tables at the end of this news release.
President and CEO Jim Green said, "Our medical business exhibited solid growth in the third quarter despite continued slowness in the U.S. Computed Tomography (CT) market. Sales of medical technology products were $89,919,000, up 29% over the prior year, and up 7% from the second quarter of this year. Security technology product revenues were down 10% from a year earlier due primarily to a decrease in customer-funded projects."
Medical imaging product revenues for the third quarter were $58,550,000, up 25% over the prior year's third quarter. Digital radiography product revenues were $8,693,000, up significantly from last year due to the increasing shipments of amorphous Selenium, direct digital mammography flat-panel detectors. Revenues for B-K Medical's clinical ultrasound systems were $22,676,000, up 17%. Approximately one third of the increase was organic growth; the remainder was due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates.
During the quarter the Company began production ramp of a new 320-slice CT DAS, a new 16 slice CT DMS System, and a new family of high-precision 3.0T radio frequency amplifiers for major OEM customers. Our Copley group is similarly ramping up production of a new family of 1.5T and very-high-field 3.0T gradient amplifiers for a major OEM.
Security technology product revenues were down 10% for the quarter due primarily to a decrease in customer funding. The Company shipped 15 EXplosive Assessment Computed Tomography (EXACT) systems to L-3 Communications, the same number shipped during the prior year's third quarter. During the quarter the Company announced an expanded relationship with L-3 Communications, awarding worldwide rights to sell and service the KING COBRA and XLB1100 automatic Explosives Detection Systems (EDSs) to L-3, who will market them as the eXaminer SX and eXaminer XLB respectively for air carrier checked-baggage applications.
Green announced that the Board of Directors will present a director majority voting proposal for approval at the January 2009 Stockholders Meeting.
"We are pleased with the growth in medical revenues and are committed to driving further profitable growth," Green concluded. "The integration of Copley is proceeding to plan and our security group is preparing to put major new systems into production over the course of the next year. We remain well positioned to take advantage of opportunities for significant growth and to ensure our future as ."

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This presentation includes non-GAAP financial measures that are not in accordance with, nor an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles.
Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are limited in value because they exclude charges that have a material effect on our reported results and, therefore, should not be relied upon as the sole financial measures to evaluate our financial results. The non-GAAP financial measures are meant to supplement, and to be viewed in conjunction with, GAAP financial results. An explanation and a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures are provided at the end of this press release.

UNAUDITED SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATIONRECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP MEASURES
The Company provides non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP other (income) expense, non-GAAP income before taxes, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share as supplemental measures to GAAP regarding the Company's operational performance. These financial measures exclude the impact of certain items and, therefore, have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. The adjustments to these non-GAAP financial measures, and the basis for such adjustments, are outlined below:
Share-based compensation expense. The Company incurs expense related to share-based compensation included in its GAAP presentation of cost of sales, research and development, selling and marketing, general and administrative expense. Although share-based compensation is an expense of the Company and viewed as a form of compensation, these expenses vary in amount from period to period, and are affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within the control of management, such as the market price and volatility of the Company's shares, risk-free interest rates, the expected term and forfeiture rates of the awards. In accordance with SFAS No. 123R, share-based compensation expense is calculated as of the grant date of each share-based award, and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the grant date. Management believes that exclusion of these expenses allows comparisons of operating results that are consistent between periods and allows comparisons of the Company's operating results to those of other companies that disclose non-GAAP financial measures that exclude share-based compensation.
Executive transition expenses. In November 2006, John W. Wood Jr. resigned as President of the Company and was temporarily replaced by Bernard M. Gordon, who was appointed as our Executive Chairman, in which capacity he served as both our principal executive officer and Chairman of the Board. James W. Green was appointed as our President and CEO on May 21, 2007, replacing Mr. Gordon as our principal executive officer. Since his arrival Mr. Green has made and is continuing to make a number of changes in the senior leadership team reporting to him. As such, the Company has incurred charges for severance, executive search, relocation and other related expenses. Management believes these charges should be excluded from the non-GAAP results because they are one-time items not associated with the ongoing operations of the business.
Acquisition related expenses. The Company incurs amortization of intangibles and other expenses related to acquisitions, including the recent acquisition of Copley Controls Corporation. The intangible assets are valued at the time of acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition. Management believes that exclusion of these expenses allows comparisons of operating results that are consistent over time for both our newly acquired and long-held businesses.
Asset impairment charges. As a result of continuing losses in its Digital Radiography business and the related business outlook, the Company evaluated the net realizability of all of the related assets at October 31, 2006. As a result, the Company recorded an asset impairment charge of $9,705,000 associated with the write-down of the Company's Digital Radiography system business assets to their estimated fair values as a group based upon the present value of estimated future cash flows of the business. Of the $9,705,000 asset impairment charges, $8,625,000 was recorded to cost of sales and $1,080,000 was recorded to operating expenses. Management believes these charges should be excluded from the non-GAAP results because they are one-time items not associated with the ongoing operations of the business.
Gain on sale of investments and other. During the three months ended October 31, 2007, the Company received $84,000 as an initial escrow payment related to the Q4 2007 sale of its interest in Bio-Imaging Research, which it recorded as other income. On December 7, 2007, the Company received $555,000 from its insurance company as reimbursement for legal fees incurred in relation to an indemnification matter related to the Company's sale of its wholly owned subsidiary Camtronics Medical Systems, Ltd. in November 2005. The $555,000 gain was recorded as other income during the nine months ended April 30, 2008. On November 1, 2006, the Company sold certain assets of SKY and its obligation to service sold products for a purchase price of $405,000. The $405,000 includes $225,000 in cash paid at closing, $150,000 in cash paid after the closing for additional inventory, and the assumption of $30,000 in liabilities. The Company recorded a gain of $205,000 from the sale in the nine months ended April 30, 2007. These gains have been presented as a non-GAAP item for that period.
Adjustments for related tax impact. For purposes of calculating non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings (losses) per share, management adjusts the provision (benefit) for income taxes to tax effect the non-GAAP adjustments described above as they have a significant impact on the Company's income tax provision (benefit).
Management excludes the above-described expenses and their related tax impact in evaluating short-term and long-term operating trends in the Company's operations, and allocating resources to various initiatives and operational requirements. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial adjustments are useful to investors because they allow investors to evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making.
These non-GAAP financial measures have not been prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information provided in accordance with GAAP. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be computed in the same manner as similarly titled measures used by other companies.
The following table reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.

Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
 
On August 11, 2008
,
Analogic Corporation (the Company) adopted the Analogic Corporation Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan (the Plan), which will become effective September 1, 2008. The Plan administrator will be an administrative committee appointed by the Companys Board of Directors.
The Plan is for the benefit of a select group of the Companys management or highly compensated employees, which group includes the Companys executive officers. It
is an unfunded arrangement and is intended to be exempt from the participation, vesting, funding, and fiduciary requirements set forth in Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, and to comply with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (Section 409A).
 
The Plan is designed to allow participants to defer a percentage of their earned income, including up to a maximum of 25% of base salary and 100% of bonuses and performance-based compensation, subject to certain specified limitations set forth in the Plan. Amounts deferred by each participant are credited to a bookkeeping account maintained in the name of that participant. For each plan year, a participant may establish one or more sub-account(s) by making such a designation on his or her deferral election for that plan year. A participant may direct that his or her sub-accounts to be valued as if they were invested in one or more of the investment funds selected by the Company in multiples of one percent (1%).
 
In each plan year, t
he Company will credit to the account of each participant who makes deferrals under the Plan and who is eligible for and is receiving the maximum matching contribution allowed by law in the Companys qualified 401(k) plan for that plan year, a matching contribution in an amount equal to one-hundred percent (100%) of the deferrals contributed by the participant up to a maximum of four percent (4%) of the participants compensation, less the matching contribution made to the Companys qualified 401(k) plan on behalf of the participant.
Under the Plan, the
Company has the right to make discretionary contributions to some or all participants accounts in such amount and in such manner as may be determined by the Company.
The form and timing of distributions will be based on the designations made by participants on their deferral elections, including designating the form in which payments shall be made from the choices available under the Plan. Distributions may be made
in a single lump sum, or in annual installments as provided in the Plan. Payments, in any case, will be made in a single lump sum if the value of a participants account or a sub-account is $25,000 or less
at the time of a distribution event or at the time of a scheduled installment payment
.
No acceleration of the distributions under the Plan shall occur except as permitted under both the Plan and Section 409A.
The Company may, at any time, in its sole discretion, terminate the Plan or amend or modify the Plan, in whole or in part, except that no such termination, amendment or modification shall have any retroactive effect to reduce any amounts allocated to a participants accounts, and provided that such amendment or modification complies with Section 409A and regulations thereunder.
 
A copy of the Plan is filed with this
Current Report on
Form 8-K as Exhibit No. 10.1.

The Administrator is relieved of all responsibility in connection with its duties hereunder to the fullest extent permitted by law, short of breach of duty to the beneficiaries.
Benefits or payments under this Plan shall not be subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, attachment, or garnishment by creditors of the Participant or the Participants beneficiary, whether voluntary or involuntary, and any attempt to so anticipate, alienate, sell, transfer, assign, pledge, encumber, attach or garnish the same shall not be valid, nor shall any such benefit or payment be in any way liable for or subject to the debts, contracts, liabilities, engagement or torts of any Participant or beneficiary, or any other person entitled to such benefit or payment pursuant to the terms of this Plan, except to such extent as may be required by law.

15
Participation in this Plan shall not be construed to confer upon any Participant the legal right to be retained in the employ of the Employer, or give a Participant or beneficiary, or any other person, any right to any payment whatsoever, except to the extent of the benefits provided for hereunder. Each Participant shall remain subject to discharge to the same extent as if this Plan had never been adopted.
If the Administrator determines that any person to whom a benefit is payable under this Plan is incompetent by reason of physical or mental disability, the Administrator shall have the power to cause the payments becoming due to such person to be made to another for his or her benefit without responsibility of the Administrator or the Employer to see to the application of such payments. Any payment made pursuant to such power shall, as to such payment, operate as a complete discharge of the Employer, the Administrator and the Trustee.
If, at any time, any doubt exists as to the identity of any person entitled to any payment hereunder or the amount or time of such payment, the Administrator shall be entitled to hold such sum until such identity or amount or time is determined or until an order of a court of competent jurisdiction is obtained. The Administrator shall also be entitled to pay such sum into court in accordance with the appropriate rules of law. Any expenses incurred by the Employer, Administrator, and Trust incident to such proceeding or litigation shall be charged against the Account of the affected Participant.

Administrator of the Plan and the Trustee. Upon receipt of such notice, the Administrator or Trustee shall cease to make any payments to Participants who were Employees of the Employer or their beneficiaries and shall hold any and all assets attributable to the Employer for the benefit of the general creditors of the Employer.
16
The Employer may, at any time, in its sole discretion, amend or modify the Plan in whole or in part, except that no such amendment or modification shall have any retroactive effect to reduce any amounts allocated to a Participants Accounts, and provided that such amendment or modification complies with Codes Section 409A and related regulations thereunder.
The Employer further reserves the right to suspend the Plan in whole or in part, except that no such suspension shall have any retroactive effect to reduce any amounts allocated to a Participants Accounts, and provided that distribution of the vested Participant Accounts shall not be accelerated but shall be paid at such time and in such manner as determined under the terms of the Plan immediately prior to suspension as if the Plan had not been suspended.
The Employer further reserves the right to terminate the Plan in whole or in part, in the following manner, except that no such termination shall have any retroactive effect to reduce any amounts allocated to a Participants Accounts, and provided that such termination complies with Codes Section 409A and related regulations thereunder:

The Employer, in its sole discretion, may terminate the Plan and distribute all vested Participants Accounts no earlier than twelve (12) calendar months from the date of the Plan termination and no later than twenty-four (24) calendar months from the date of the Plan termination, provided however that the termination and distribution does not occur proximate to a down turn in the financial health of the Employer, that all other similar arrangements are also terminated by the Employer for affected Participants and no other similar arrangements are adopted by the Employer for affected Participants within a three (3) year period from the date of termination; or
(b)
 
The Employer may decide, in its sole discretion, to terminate the Plan in the event of a corporate dissolution taxed under Code Section 331, or with the approval of a bankruptcy court, provided that the Participants vested Account balances are distributed to Participants and are included in the Participants gross income in the latest of: (i) the calendar year in which the termination occurs; (ii) the calendar year in which the amounts deferred are no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture; or (iii) the first calendar year in which payment is administratively practicable.
The Employer may decide, in its discretion, to terminate the Plan in the event of a Change-in-Control and distribute all vested Participants Account balances
no earlier than thirty (30) days prior to the Change-in-Control and no later than twelve (12) months after the effective
date of the Change-in-Control, provided however that the Employer terminates all other similar arrangements.
17
All questions of interpretation, construction or application arising under or concerning the terms of this Plan shall be decided by the Administrator, in its sole and final discretion, whose decision shall be final, binding and conclusive upon all persons.

If any provision of this Plan is held invalid or unenforceable, its invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision of this Plan and this Plan shall be construed and enforced as if such provision had not been included therein. If the inclusion of any Employee (or Employees) as a Participant under this Plan would cause the Plan to fail to comply with the requirements of sections 201(2), 301(a)(3) and 401(a)(1) of ERISA, or Code Section 409A, then the Plan shall be severed with respect to such Employee or Employees, who shall be considered to be participating in a separate arrangement.

Ltd.
During the fiscal year ended July 31, 2007, the Company recorded pre-tax charges of $9,705,000 related to asset impairments as well as dividend income and a gain on the sale of the Company's 17% ownership in Bio-Imaging Research, Inc. totaling $4,036,000.
Income from operations on a non-GAAP basis for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2008, was $36,913,000, up 118% from a year earlier. Non-GAAP net income for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2008, was $29,956,000, or $2.26 per diluted share, compared to non-GAAP net income of $22,176,000, or $1.60 per diluted share, for last year.
Non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of certain items. A description of these non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of all GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures are presented in the financial tables at the end of this news release.
Revenues for the fourth quarter ended July 31, 2008, were $117,140,000, compared with the prior year's fourth-quarter revenues of $92,933,000, an increase of $24,207,000, or 26%.

Income from operations on a non-GAAP basis for the quarter ended July 31, 2008, was $10,680,000up 106% from the same quarter last year. Non-GAAP net income was $7,245,000, or $0.55 per diluted share, compared to $6,612,000, or $0.48 per diluted share, for the same quarter last year. Both GAAP and Non-GAAP net income include significant unfavorable effects of lower interest income and a higher tax rate versus the prior year.
,
During the fourth quarter ended July 31, 2008, Analogic announced the completion of a restructuring program to lower the Company's cost structure going forward. The program included a reduction in force that resulted in a one-time charge of $597,000, and a voluntary retirement program that resulted in a one-time charge of $3,419,000 in the fourth quarter. The Company also announced that it is amortizing Copley-acquisition-related intangible assets and inventory fair value adjustments, which resulted in a $3,156,000 charge in the fourth quarter.
Also during the fourth quarter the Company recognized a gain of $2,000,000 before taxes from the sale to Chonqing Anke Medical Equipment Co. of 20% of its existing 45% equity interest (for a remaining interest of 25%) in Shenzhen Anke High Tech Co. Ltd.
During the fourth quarter of the year ended July 31, 2007, the Company recognized a gain of $4,036,000 before taxes from the sale of its 17% ownership interest in Bio-Imaging Research, Inc., and related dividend income.
Jim Green, Analogic President and CEO, said "I am very pleased with the Company's achievements during FY2008. We were successful in accelerating growth of our Medical and Security Technology businesses, returning our Security Technology business to profitability, moving Digital Radiography to breakeven in the fourth quarter, completing the acquisition of Copley Controls, and making investments in technology, our channel, and our employees.
"With respect to the fourth quarter, we realized solid growth in revenues. Medical technology revenues were $101,274,000, up 27% over the prior year's fourth quarter, in large part due to the addition of Copley's revenues for a full quarter, and solid growth in Digital Radiography revenues. Ultrasound systems revenues were up as well, driven partly by favorable exchange rates. Security Technology revenues were up 27% from the prior fourth quarter."
"This has been a quarter with several significant milestones," said Green. "The integration of Copley Controls is proceeding according to plan. On a go-forward basis, we expect Copley to make a strong contribution to our profitability. Digital Radiography broke even in the fourth quarter for the first time. During the quarter, we received two major contracts from an OEM to supply new CT Data Acquisition Systems and a major OEM customer introduced a line of 3-Tesla MRI systems incorporating our new AN8135 solid-state RF amplifier. As announced earlier, we completed a significant restructuring in the quarter, which makes us a leaner and more productive organization.
We are a stronger, leaner business, and better prepared for the future, and look forward to exciting opportunities in 2009 and beyond to build on Analogic's long-term success as "
The World Resource for Health and Security Technology.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This presentation includes non-GAAP financial measures that are not in accordance with, nor an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles.
Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Consolidated Statements of Operations (GAAP) (in thousands, except per share data)
 
 
UNAUDITED SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION - RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP MEASURES
The Company provides non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP other (income) expense, non-GAAP income before taxes, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share as supplemental measures to GAAP regarding the Company's operational performance. These financial measures exclude the impact of certain items and, therefore, have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. The adjustments to these non-GAAP financial measures, and the basis for such adjustments, are outlined below:
The Company incurs expense related to share-based compensation included in its GAAP presentation of cost of sales, research and development, selling and marketing, and general and administrative expense. Although share-based compensation is an expense of the Company and viewed as a form of compensation, these expenses vary in amount from period to period, and are affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within the control of management, such as the market price and volatility of the Company's shares, risk-free interest rates, and the expected term and forfeiture rates of the awards. In accordance with SFAS No. 123R, share-based compensation expense is calculated as of the grant date of each share-based award, and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the grant date. Management believes that exclusion of these expenses allows comparisons of operating results that are consistent between periods and allows comparisons of the Company's operating results to those of other companies that disclose non-GAAP financial measures that exclude share-based compensation.
Share-based compensation expense.
As a result of continuing losses in its Digital Radiography systems business and the related business outlook, the Company evaluated the net realizability of all of the related assets at October 31, 2006. As a result, the Company recorded an asset impairment charge of $9,705,000 associated with the write-down of the Company's Digital Radiography systems business assets to their estimated fair values as a group based upon the present value of
Asset impairment charges.
estimated future cash flows of the business. Management believes these charges should be excluded in the non-GAAP results because they are one-time items not associated with the ongoing operations of the business.
The Company continuously strives to improve its operating efficiency. During the three months ended July 31, 2008, the Company offered a one-time voluntary retirement program to certain eligible U.S. employees. In addition, the Company terminated 32 employees in its Peabody, Massachusetts facility. Total cost of these activities was $4,016,000 in the three and twelve months ended July 31, 2008. Management believes that exclusion of these expenses allows for comparisons of operating results that are consistent over time.
Voluntary retirement and other restructuring costs.
In November 2006, John W. Wood Jr. resigned as President of the Company and was temporarily replaced by Bernard M. Gordon, who was appointed as our Executive Chairman, in which capacity he served as both our principal executive officer and Chairman of the Board. James W. Green was appointed as our President and CEO on May 21, 2007, replacing Mr. Gordon as our principal executive officer. Since his arrival Mr. Green has made and is continuing to make a number of changes in the senior leadership team reporting to him. As such, the Company has incurred charges for severance, executive search, relocation and other related expenses. Management believes these charges should be excluded from the non-GAAP results because they are one-time items not associated with the ongoing operations of the business.
Executive transition expenses.
The Company incurs amortization of intangibles and other expenses related to acquisitions, including the recent acquisition of Copley Controls Corporation. The intangible assets are valued at the time of acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition. Management believes that exclusion of these expenses allows comparisons of operating results that are consistent over time for both our newly acquired and long-held businesses.
Acquisition related expenses.
During the three months ended October 31, 2007, the Company received $84,000 as an initial escrow payment related to the sale of its interest in Bio-Imaging Research ("BIR") during the three months ended July 31, 2007, which it recorded as other income in the twelve months ended July 31, 2008. On December 7, 2007, the Company received $555,000 from its insurance company as reimbursement for legal fees incurred in relation to an indemnification matter related to the Company's sale of its wholly owned subsidiary Camtronics Medical Systems, Ltd. in November 2005. The $555,000 gain was recorded as other income during the twelve months ended April 30, 2008. On January 30, 2008, the Company agreed to sell to Chonqing Anke Medical Equipment Co., 20% of its existing 45% equity interest (for a remaining interest of 25%) in Shenzhen Anke High Tech Co. Ltd ("SAHCO") for aggregate compensation of $2,000,000. The Company recognized a $2,000,000 gain in other (income) expense during the three months ended July 31, 2008 when the cash was received. On November 1, 2006, the Company sold certain assets of AnaSky and its obligation to service sold products for a purchase price of $405,000. The $405,000 includes $225,000 in cash paid at closing, $150,000 in cash paid after the closing for additional inventory, and the assumption of $30,000 in liabilities. The Company recorded a gain of $205,000 from the sale in the twelve months ended July 31, 2007. During May 2007, the Company received a dividend from BIR and sold its entire ownership interest in BIR. The Company recorded income before taxes on the dividend and sale of $4,036,000 in the three and twelve months ended July 31, 2007. These gains have been presented as a non-GAAP item for the related periods as management believes they are one-time items not associated with the on-going operations of the business.
Gain on sale of investments and other.
For purposes of calculating non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings (losses) per share, management adjusts the provision (benefit) for income taxes to tax effect the non-GAAP adjustments described above as they have a significant impact on the Company's income tax provision (benefit).
Adjustments for related tax impact.
Management excludes the above-described expenses and their related tax impact in evaluating short-term and long-term operating trends in the Company's operations, and allocating resources to various initiatives and operational requirements. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial adjustments are useful to investors because they allow investors to evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making, however these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information provided in accordance with GAAP. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be computed in the same manner as similarly titled measures used by other companies.
The following table reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.

(b) On September 22, 2008, Bruce W. Steinhauer, a member of the Analogic Corporation's (the "Company") Board of Directors (the "Board"), stated that he will not stand for re-election as a member of the Board at the next annual meeting of the Company's stockholders. Dr. Steinhauer is a member of the Board's Audit Committee and Compensation Committee, and is Chairman of its Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.
(c) On September 23, 2008, Peter M. Howard, age 52, was appointed as a Senior Vice President and General Manager of the Company's OEM Products Group. Mr. Howard has been an employee of the Company since November 2003, first serving as General Manager of the Imaging Subsystems Division ("ISD"), and more recently as Vice President and General Manager of the OEM Medical Group, which includes ISD and the Medical CT Division) and as Vice President and General Manager of Copley Controls Corporation, which the Company acquired in April, 2008.
(e) On September 23, 2008, the Board approved an annual incentive bonus plan for fiscal 2009 (the "FY09 AIP"). The FY09 AIP is based on the achievement of revenue and adjusted diluted earnings per share targets. Under this plan, each of the Company's executive officers has been given a target award and has the opportunity to earn a maximum of two times the target. Any amount paid under this plan that is above the target award will be paid with 50% cash and 50% stock.
On September 23, 2008, the Board approved a long-term incentive plan (the "FY09 LTIP"). Under the FY09 LTIP, each of the Company's executive officers has been granted a long term incentive award which includes three components: performance contingent restricted stock, restricted stock based on continuous service, and stock options. Achievement of certain growth targets in our adjusted earnings per share over the three year period ending July 31, 2011 will result in the vesting of the performance contingent restricted shares based on a pre-defined formula. The measurement period for the shares to be earned based on performance is August 1, 2008 through July 31, 2011 and all shares earned based on achievement of the performance goals will cliff-vest at the end of the measurement period. The number of shares to be earned at the end of the three year period will be determined based on the achievement of a compounded adjusted earnings per share growth percentage.
The target bonus under the FY09 AIP for James W. Green, our President and Chief Executive Officer, is 80% of his $490,000 base salary, or $392,000. The target bonus under the FY09 AIP for John J. Fry, our Vice President, General Counsel and Corporation Secretary is 45% of his $294,500 base salary, or $132,525. The target bonus under the FY09 AIP for John J. Millerick, our Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Treasurer, is 40% of his $279,450 base salary, or $111,800. The target bonus under the FY09 AIP for Peter M. Howard, our Senior Vice President and General Manager of the OEM Medical Group, is 40% of his $276,925 base salary, or $110,770. The target bonus under the FY09 AIP for Donald B. Melson, our Vice President  Corporate Controller is 35% of his $225,000 base salary, or $78,750.
The table below summarizes the long term incentive awards made to executive officers under the FY09 LTIP:

PEABODY, MA (December 9, 2008) - Analogic Corporation (NASDAQ: ALOG), a leading designer and manufacturer of high-precision health and security imaging equipment, today announced results for its first quarter ended October 31, 2008.
Highlights of the quarter included:
Revenues of $101,552,000, up $7,351,000 or 8% over preceding first quarter
Net Income of $320,000 impacted by difficult operating and economic environment
Earnings Per Share:
GAAP: $0.02 per diluted share
Non-GAAP: $0.19 per diluted share
Medical Technology revenues up 10% over prior year, due primarily to Copley Controls acquisition
Security Technology profitability up 20% on 4% revenue decrease
Revenues for the first quarter ended October 31, 2008 were $101,552,000, compared with the prior year's first quarter revenues of $94,201,000, an increase of $7,351,000, or 8%. Loss from operations on a GAAP basis was $1,584,000. Gross margins were negatively impacted by product mix, increased manufacturing costs due to lower production volumes, and amortization costs related to the Copley acquisition. A $4,455,000, or 16%, increase in operating expenses was due primarily to the Copley acquisition. GAAP net income for the first quarter was $320,000, or $0.02 per diluted share, compared with $6,388,000, or $0.48 per diluted share, for the prior year's first quarter. Net income was also affected by a reduction in pretax interest income of $1,704,000.
Income from operations on a non-GAAP basis for the quarter ended October 31, 2008, was $1,673,000, compared with $7,536,000 for the prior year's first quarter. Non-GAAP net income was $2,551,000, or $0.19 per diluted share, compared to $7,081,000, or $0.53 per diluted share, for the prior year's first quarter.
Non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of certain items. A description of these non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of all GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures are presented in the financial tables at the end of this news release.
Sales of Medical Imaging products were $59,244,000, up 14% over the prior year's first quarter, due primarily to the inclusion of approximately $19,600,000 in Copley revenues.CT subsystem shipments were down during the first quarter due to continuing softness in the CT market, particularly in the U.S. The demand for CT systems, and therefore our subsystems, could remain soft for the near term. As indicated in our previous earnings call, there was also a substantial decrease in the shipment of integrated CT gantries to a major Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) in the radiation treatment market. Nonetheless, the overall radiation treatment market appears resilient, and we are beginning to see a recovery in orders from that customer. Revenues for magnetic resonance power systems were up substantially due to the inclusion of first-quarter revenues from Copley, which supplies advanced gradient amplifiers to OEMs. The Copley integration is proceeding well and on schedule. During the quarter we signe d a major agreement for next-generation gradient amplifiers that will enter production in mid-2010.
Digital Radiography product revenues were $7,454,000, up 53% over the prior year, reflecting sales of our amorphous Selenium direct digital mammography detectors to Siemens. We expect DR revenues to continue to improve quarter over quarter as we ramp up shipments of detectors to two other customers during this fiscal year.
B-K Medical revenues were $18,888,000, down 8%, due largely to anticipation of a recently introduced ultrasound system and to unfavorable exchange rates. B-K Medical announced its premier Pro Focus UltraView 2202 ultrasound platform last week at the Radiological Society of North America meeting in Chicago. This top-of-the-line unit will begin shipping this month, and early in 2009 B-K Medical will introduce another new system, designed to access adjacent markets, that it expects to begin shipping in the third quarter of this fiscal year.
Security Technology product revenues were $12,854,000, down 4% from $13,336,000 a year earlier, with 15 EXACT systems shipped in each quarter. The Company also shipped six new COBRA automatic explosives and weapons detection systems during the quarter, providing our 3-D, continuous-flow technology to the checkpoint. On September 25, the Company announced that it had received an order from L-3 Security and Detection Systems for approximately $10 million in EXACT systems and upgrade equipment scheduled to begin shipping this month. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, the U. S. Department of Homeland Security's (DHS's) Transportation Security Laboratory completed certification testing of the eXaminer SX baggage inspection system, designed for airports with size constraints or throughput requirements of up to 360 bags an hour. We believe that the system has satisfied the applicable testing criteria and expect to receive a formal notice of certification upon successful completion of DHS's usua l procedures relating to the certification process. Marketed worldwide by L-3 Communications, SX systems are expected to begin shipping in the second half of this fiscal year.
President and CEO Jim Green said, "As I indicated in our last earnings call, the first half of fiscal 2009 is proving to be a challenge, exacerbated by the global economic crisis. The Deficit Reduction Act (DRA) continues to affect our high-end CT DAS business. We are also working closely with our OEM customers as they gauge the effect of the current economic situation on their markets. Nonetheless, our magnetic resonance and digital radiography revenues improved year over year. Our Digital Radiography segment, focusing on digital mammography plates, was profitable for the second quarter in a row. While specialized ultrasound system revenues were down for the quarter, we expect to benefit from B-K Medical's introduction of two major new scanners. The Security Technology business is running profitably with a stable level of EXACT shipments. On the Security side, we look forward to continuing EXACT orders with revenue growth from the shipment of the new eXaminer SX systems beginning in the second half of this fiscal year, and of the eXaminer XLB, designed for large, high-traffic airports, in the first half of next fiscal year."
Green continued, "While the current economic environment is challenging, we believe that we are well positioned for both the short and long term. We continue to benefit from our strong balance sheet and prudent cash management strategies, and we remain well positioned to explore attractive acquisition opportunities. Even so, we are accelerating our efforts to optimize our operating structure and to align our spending with the current environment. Over the longer term, we expect to benefit from our considerable technological strength, the continuing growth in the number of medical imaging procedures performed around the world, and the opportunities for new baggage screening systems to meet the evolving needs of aviation security. As a result, we are well positioned for long-term growth as ."

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This presentation includes non-GAAP financial measures that are not in accordance with, nor an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles.
Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are limited in value because they exclude charges that have a material effect on our reported results and, therefore, should not be relied upon as the sole financial measures to evaluate our financial results. The non-GAAP financial measures are meant to supplement, and to be viewed in conjunction with, GAAP financial results. An explanation and a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures are provided at the end of this press release.

UNAUDITED SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP MEASURES
The Company provides non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP other (income) expense, non-GAAP income before taxes, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share as supplemental measures to GAAP regarding the Company's operational performance. These financial measures exclude the impact of certain items and, therefore, have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. The adjustments to these non-GAAP financial measures, and the basis for such adjustments, are outlined below:
The Company incurs expense related to share-based compensation included in its GAAP presentation of cost of sales, research and development, selling and marketing, and general and administrative expense. Although share-based compensation is an expense of the Company and viewed as a form of compensation, these expenses vary in amount from period to period, and are affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within the control of management, such as the market price and volatility of the Company's shares, risk-free interest rates, and the expected term and forfeiture rates of the awards. In accordance with SFAS No. 123R, share-based compensation expense is calculated as of the grant date of each share-based award, and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the grant date. Management believes that exclusion of these expenses allows comparisons of operating results that are consistent between periods and allows comparisons of the Company's operating results to those of other companies that disclose non-GAAP financial measures that exclude share-based compensation.
Share-based compensation expense.
In November 2006, John W. Wood Jr. resigned as President of the Company and was temporarily replaced by Bernard M. Gordon, who was appointed as our Executive Chairman, in which capacity he served as both our principal executive officer and Chairman of the Board. James W. Green was appointed as our President and CEO on May 21, 2007, replacing Mr. Gordon as our principal executive officer. Since his arrival Mr. Green has made and is continuing to make a number of changes in the senior leadership team reporting to him. As such, the Company has incurred charges for severance, executive search, relocation and other related expenses. Management believes these charges should be excluded from the non-GAAP results because they are one-time items not associated with the ongoing operations of the business.
Executive transition expenses.
The Company incurs amortization of intangibles and other expenses related to acquisitions it has made in recent years. The intangible assets are valued at the time of acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition. Management believes that exclusion of these expenses allows comparisons of operating results that are consistent over time for both our newly acquired and long-held businesses.
Acquisition related expenses.
During the three months ended October 31, 2007, the Company received $84,000 as an initial escrow payment related to the Q4 2007 sale of its interest in Bio-Imaging Research, which it recorded as other income.
Gain on sale of investments and other.
For purposes of calculating non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings (losses) per share, management adjusts the provision (benefit) for income taxes to tax effect the non-GAAP adjustments described above as they have a significant impact on the Company's income tax provision (benefit).
Adjustments for related tax impact.
Management excludes the above described expenses and their related tax impact in evaluating short-term and long-term operating trends in the Company's operations, and allocating resources to various initiatives and operational requirements. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial adjustments are useful to investors because they allow investors to evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by management in its financial and operational decision making.
These non-GAAP financial measures have not been prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information provided in accordance with GAAP. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be computed in the same manner as similarly titled measures used by other companies.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The following table reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.

At the Annual Meeting held on January 26, 2009, the Registrant's stockholders approved further amendments to the Registrant's Restated Articles of Organization and By-laws to implement majority voting in connection with the election of directors so as to require that a director standing for election in an uncontested election receive the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast in his or her election.

EXHIBIT D
The Restated Articles of Organization shall include the following Provision in Article 6:
f.
Classified Board of Directors
(1) The Directors of the Corporation shall be divided into three classes: Class I, Class II and Class III.

If the number of Directors is not evenly divisible by three, the Board of Directors shall determine the number of Directors to be elected initially into each class.

At each annual election held after the 1986 Annual Meeting of the Stockholders, the Directors elected to succeed those whose terms expire shall be identified as being of the same class as the Directors they succeed and shall be elected to hold office for a term to expire at the third annual meeting of the stockholders after their election, and until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified. If the number of Directors changes, any increase or decrease in Directors shall be apportioned among the classes so as to maintain all classes as equal in number as possible, and any additional Director elected to any class shall hold office for a term which shall coincide with the terms of the other Directors in such class and until his successor is duly elected and qualified.
(2) Sections 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 15 of ARTICLE TWO of the By-laws of the Company shall not be amended, repealed or altered except by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80% of the combined voting power of the then outstanding Voting Stock (as defined in Article 6. Section (e) of these Restated Articles of Organization), voting together as a single class.
(3) Notwithstanding any other provisions of these Restated Articles of Organization or the By-laws of the Corporation or the fact that a lesser percentage may be specified by law, these Restated Articles of Organization or the By-laws of the Corporation, the affirmative vote of the holders of least 80% of the combined voting power of the then outstanding Voting Stock (as defined in Article 6 Section (f) of these Restated Articles of Organization), voting together as a single class, shall be required to amend, alter, adopt any provision inconsistent with or to repeal this Provision.

EXHIBIT 3.2
 
As amended through January 26, 2009
Section 1. . The annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation shall be held on the date and at the time fixed, from time to time, by the Directors, provided that the date so fixed is within six months of the end of the fiscal year of the Corporation. The annual meeting shall be held at such place within the United States as may be designated in the notice of meeting. If the day fixed for the annual meeting shall fall on a legal holiday, the meeting shall be held on the next succeeding day not a legal holiday. In the event that no date for the annual meeting is established, a special meeting may be held in place thereof, and any business transacted at such special meeting in lieu of annual meeting shall have the same effect as if transacted or held at the annual meeting.
Annual Meeting
Section 2. . Special meetings of the stockholders may be called by the President or by the Directors, and shall be called by the Clerk, or in case of the death, absence, incapacity or refusal of the Clerk, by any other officer, upon written application of one or more stockholders who are entitled to vote at the meeting and who hold at least one-tenth part in interest of the capital stock entitled to vote at the meeting, stating the time, place and purposes of the meeting.
Special Meetings
Section 3. . All meetings of stockholders shall be held at the principal office of the Corporation unless a different place (within the United States) is fixed by the Directors or the President and stated in the notice of the meeting.
Place of Meetings
Section 4. . Notice of all meetings of stockholders shall be given as follows, to wit: a written notice, stating the place, day and hour thereof, and the purposes for which the meeting is to be held shall be given by the Clerk or by the person calling the meeting at least ten (10) days before the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote thereat and to each stockholder who, by law, the Articles of Organization, or these By-Laws, is entitled to such notice, by leaving such notice with him or at his residence or usual place of business, or by mailing it postage prepaid and addressed to such stockholder at his address as it appears upon the books of the Corporation. No notice need be given to any stockholder if a written waiver of notice, executed before or after the meeting by the stockholder or his attorney thereunto authorized is filed with the records of the meeting.
Notices
Section 5. . The holders of record of a majority in interest of the stock of the Corporation then issued and outstanding and entitled to vote, appearing in person or by proxy shall constitute a quorum, but a lesser number may adjourn the meeting from time to time without further notice.
Quorum
Section 6. . Each stockholder shall have one vote for each share of stock entitled to vote, and a proportionate vote for any fractional share entitled to vote, held by him of record according to the records of the Corporation, unless otherwise provided by the Articles of Organization. Stockholders may vote either in person or by written proxy dated not more than six months before the meeting named therein. Proxies shall be filed with the Clerk or other person responsible for recording the proceedings of the meeting before being voted. Except as otherwise limited therein, proxies shall entitle the persons named therein to vote at the meeting specified therein and at any adjourned session of such
Voting and Proxies
 
meeting but shall not be valid after final adjournment of the meeting. A proxy with respect to stock held in the name of two or more persons shall be valid if executed by one of them unless at or prior to exercise of the proxy the Corporation receives a specific written notice to the contrary from any one of them. A proxy purporting to be executed by or on behalf of a stockholder shall be deemed valid unless challenged at or prior to its exercise.
Section 7. . When a quorum is present, action of the stockholders on any matter properly brought before such meeting shall require the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the stock present or represented and entitled to vote and voting on such matter (or if there are two or more classes of stock entitled to vote as separate classes, then in the case of each such class, the holders of a majority of the stock of that class present or represented and entitled to vote and voting on a matter), provided that such majority shall be at least a majority of the number of shares required to constitute a quorum for action on such matter, except where a greater vote is required by law, the Articles of Organization or these By-Laws. Any election by stockholders shall be determined by a plurality of the votes cast by the stockholders entitled to vote at the election. No ballot shall be required for such election unless requested by a stockholder present or represented at the meeting and entitled to vote in the election.
Action at Meeting
Section 8. . Any action to be taken by stockholders may be taken without a meeting if all stockholders entitled to vote on the matter consent to the action by a writing filed with the records of the meetings of stockholders. Such consent shall be treated for all purposes as a vote at the meeting.
Special Action
Section 9. . The Directors may fix in advance a time which shall be not more than sixty (60) days prior to (a) the date of any meeting of stockholders, (b) the date for the payment of any dividend or the making of any distribution to stockholders, or (c) the last day on which the consent or dissent of stockholders may be effectively expressed for any purpose, as the record date for determining the stockholders having the right to notice of and to vote at such meeting and any adjournment thereof, the right to receive such dividend or distribution, or the right to give such consent or dissent. In such case only stockholders of record on such record date shall have such right, notwithstanding any transfer of stock on the books of the Corporation after the record date. Without fixing such record date the Directors may for any of such purposes close the transfer books for all or any part of such period.
Record Date
Section 1. . The business of the Corporation shall be managed by a Board of Directors which may exercise all the powers of the Corporation except as otherwise provided by law, by the Articles of Organization or by these By-Laws. In the event of a vacancy in the Board of Directors, the remaining Directors, except as otherwise provided by law, may exercise the powers of the full Board until the vacancy is filled.
Powers
Section 2. . A board of directors of such number, not less than five, nor more than ten, as shall be fixed by the board before each annual meeting of the stockholders, shall be elected by the stockholders at the annual meeting. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 7 of Article I, and except as provided in Section 3 of this Article II, each director shall be elected by the vote of the majority of the votes cast with respect to the director at any meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present; if, as of a date that is fourteen (14) days in advance of the date the Corporation files its definitive proxy statement with respect to such meeting (regardless of whether or not thereafter revised or supplemented) with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the number of nominees is greater than the number of directors to be elected, the directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast by the stockholders entitled to vote on the election of directors. For purposes of this Section, a majority of the votes cast means that the number of shares voted "for" a director must be greater than the number of votes cast "against" that director.
Number and Election
provided that
Section 3. . In the case of any vacancy in the Board of Directors from death, resignation, disqualification or other cause, including a vacancy resulting from enlargement of the Board, the election of a Director to fill such vacancy shall be by vote of a majority of the Directors then in office, whether or not constituting a quorum. The Director thus elected shall hold office for (1) the unexpired portion of the term of the Director whose place shall be vacant or (2) the unexpired portion of the term of
Vacancies
 
the class of Director added to the Board, as the case may be, and, in either case, until the election of his successor.
Section 4. . Subject to the rights of holders of any class or series of Preferred Stock, the number of Directors may be changed from time to time either by the shareholders or the Board of Directors.
Change in Size of Board
Section 5. . Until the division of Directors into classes is terminated as provided below, the Directors of the Corporation shall be divided into three classes: Class I, Class II, and Class III. Each class shall consist as nearly as may be possible, of one-third of the whole number of the Board of Directors.

From and after the 2011 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the Directors shall no longer be divided into classes. For so long as the Directors are divided into classes, (a) if the number of Directors changes, any increase or decrease in Directors shall be apportioned among the classes so as to maintain all classes as equal in number as possible, and any additional Director elected to any class shall hold office for a term which shall coincide with the terms of the other Directors in such class and until his successor is duly elected and qualified, (b) no decrease in the number of Directors constituting the Board of Directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent Director and (c) any Director elected to fill a vacancy shall hold office for the remainder of the full term of the class of Directors in which the vacancy occurred or the new directorship was created and until such Director's successor shall have been elected and qualified. Any Director may resign by delivering his written resignation to the Corporation at its principal office, or to the Chairman of the Board or Secretary.
Election, and Tenure
Section 6. . Subject to the rights of holders of any class or series of Preferred Stock, the removal of any Director or Directors or the entire Board of Directors may be effected only by the affirmative vote of a majority of (a) the Directors then in office, for cause, or (b) the shares outstanding and entitled to vote in the election of the Directors, with or without cause. "Cause" for purposes of this Section 6 shall mean only (1) conviction of a felony, (2) declaration of unsound mind by order of court, (3) gross dereliction of duty, (4) commission of an action involving moral turpitude or (5) commission of an action which constitutes intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law if such action in either event results both in an improper substantial personal benefit and a material injury to the Corporation. A Director may be removed by the shareholders or the Directors only at a meeting called for the purpose of removing him or her, and the meeting notice must state that the purpose, or one of the purposes, of the meeting is removal of the Director.
Removal
Section 7. . Immediately after each annual meeting of stockholders, or the special meeting held in lieu thereof, and at the place thereof, if a quorum of the Directors elected at such meeting was present thereat, there shall be a meeting of the Directors without notice; but if such a quorum of the Directors elected thereat was not present at such meeting, or if present, do not proceed immediately thereafter to hold a meeting of the Directors, the annual meeting of the Directors shall be called in the manner hereinafter provided with respect to the call of special meetings of Directors.

Section 9. . Special meetings of the Directors may be called by the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the President, the Treasurer, or by any two Directors, and shall be held at the time and place designated in the call thereof.
Special Meetings
Section 10. . Notice of all special meetings of the Directors shall be given to each Director by the Secretary, or if there be no Secretary, by the Assistant Secretary, or in case of the death, absence, incapacity or refusal of such persons, by the officer or one of the Directors calling the meeting. Notice shall be given to each Director in person or by telephone or by telegram sent to his business or home address at least twenty-four hours in advance of the meeting, or by written notice mailed to his business or home address at least four (4) days in advance of the meeting. Notice need not be given to any Director if a written waiver of notice, executed by him before or after the meeting, is filed with the records of the meeting, or to any Director who attends the meeting without protesting prior thereto or at its commencement the lack of notice to him. A notice or waiver of notice of a Directors' meeting need not specify the purposes of the meeting.

Subject to the restrictions, if any, noted on a certificate, and except with respect to uncertificated shares issued pursuant to Section 2 of this Article IV, the shares represented thereby shall be transferred on the books of the Corporation only by surrender to the Corporation or its transfer agent of the certificate therefor, properly endorsed or accompanied by a written assignment and power of attorney properly executed, with any necessary transfer stamps affixed, and with such proof of the authenticity of signature as the Corporation or its transfer agent may reasonably require.
Certificates of Shares of Stock
Section 2. . The Board of Directors may authorize the issue of some or all of the shares of any or all of the Corporation's classes or series without certificates. The authorization shall not affect shares already represented by certificates until they are surrendered to the Corporation. Within a reasonable time after the issue or transfer of shares without certificates, the Corporation shall send the shareholder a written statement of the information required by the Massachusetts Business Corporation Act, as in effect from time to time, to be on certificates.
Uncertificated Shares of Stock
Section 3. . The Corporation shall be entitled to treat the person in
Record and Beneficial Owners
 
whose name shares are registered in the records of the Corporation as the holder of the shares for all purposes, including the payment of dividends and the right to vote with respect thereto, or, if the Board of Directors has established a procedure by which the beneficial owner of shares that are registered in the name of a nominee will be recognized by the Corporation as the holder of such shares, the Corporation shall be entitled to treat the beneficial owner of shares as the holder of the shares to the extent of the rights granted by a nominee certificate on file with the Corporation. It shall be the duty of each stockholder to notify the Corporation of his or her address.
Section 4. . The Board of Directors may, subject to Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 106, Section 8-405, determine the conditions upon which a new certificate may be issued in place of any certificate alleged to have been lost, destroyed, or wrongfully taken. The Board of Directors may, in its discretion, require the owner of such certificate, or his or her legal representative, to give a bond, sufficient in its opinion, with or without surety, to indemnify the Corporation against any loss or claim which may arise by reason of the issue of the new certificate.
Lost or Destroyed Certificates
Except as the Directors may otherwise designate, the Chairman of the Board, President, or Treasurer may on behalf of this Corporation waive notice of, vote, and appoint any person or persons to act as proxy or attorney in fact for this Corporation (with or without power of substitution) at, any meeting of stockholders or shareholders of any other corporation or organization, the securities of which may be held by this Corporation.
Books, accounts, documents, and records of the Corporation shall be open to inspection by any Director at all times during the usual hours of business. The original, or attested copies, of the Articles of Organization, By-Laws, and records of all meetings of the incorporators and stockholders and the stock and transfer records, which shall contain the names of all stockholders and the record address and the amount of stock held by each, shall be kept in Massachusetts at the principal office of the Corporation, or at any office of its transfer agent or of the Clerk. Said copies and records need not all be kept in the same office. They shall be available at all reasonable times to the inspection of any stockholder for any proper purpose, but not to secure a list of stockholders for the purpose of selling said list or copies thereof or of using the same for a purpose other than in the interest of the applicant, as a stockholder, relative to the affairs of the Corporation.
Checks, notes, drafts, and other instruments for the payment of money drawn or endorsed in the name of the Corporation may be signed by any officer or officers or person or persons authorized by the Board of Directors to sign the same. No officer or person shall sign any such instruments as aforesaid unless authorized by the Board of Directors to do so.
 
The seal of the Corporation shall, subject to alteration by the Directors, bear its name, the word "Massachusetts", and the year of its incorporation.
Except as from time to time otherwise determined by the Directors, the fiscal year of the Corporation shall be the twelve months ending on the 31st day of July of each year.
Any and all of the Directors and officers of the Corporation, notwithstanding their official relations to it, may enter into and perform any contract or agreement of any nature between the Corporation and themselves, or any and all of the individuals from time to time constituting the Board of Directors of the Corporation, or any firm or corporation in which any such Director may be interested, directly or indirectly, whether such individual, firm, or corporation thus contracting with the Corporation shall thereby derive personal or corporate profits or benefits or otherwise; provided, that (i) the material facts of such interest are disclosed or are known to the Board of Directors or committee thereof which authorizes such contract or agreement; (ii) if the material facts as to such person's relationship or interest are disclosed or are known to the stockholders entitled to vote thereon, and the contract is specifically approved in good faith by a vote of the stockholders; or (iii) the contract or agreement is fair as to the Corporation as of the time it is authorized, approved, or ratified by the Board of Directors, a committee thereof, or the stockholders. Any Director of the Corporation who is interested in any transaction as aforesaid may nevertheless be counted in determining the existence of a quorum at any meeting of the Board of Directors which shall authorize or ratify any such transaction. This Article shall not be construed to invalidate any contract or other transaction which would otherwise be valid under the common or statutory law applicable thereto.

Notification and Defense of Claim
(a) The Corporation will be entitled to participate in the defense at its own expense.
(b) Except as otherwise provided below in this subparagraph (b), the Corporation (jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified) will be entitled to assume the defense with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Covered Person. After notice from the Corporation to the Covered Person of its election to assume the defense of a suit, the Corporation will not be liable to the Covered Person under this Article for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the Covered Person in connection with the defense of the Proceeding other than reasonable costs of investigation or as otherwise provided below in this subparagraph (b).

The Corporation shall be entitled to participate in, but shall not be entitled to assume the defense of any proceeding brought by or in the right of the Corporation or as to which the Covered Person shall have made the conclusion provided for in (ii) above and such conclusion shall have been so confirmed by the Corporation's said outside counsel.
(c) Notwithstanding any provision of this Article to the contrary, the Corporation shall not be obligated to indemnify the Covered Person under this Article for any amounts paid in settlement of any
 
Proceeding effected without its written consent. The Corporation shall not settle any Proceeding or claim in any manner which would impose any penalty, limitation, or disqualification of the Covered Person for any purpose without such Covered Person's written consent. Neither the Corporation nor the Covered Person will unreasonably withhold their consent to any proposed settlement.
(d) If it is determined that the Covered Person is entitled to indemnification other than as afforded under subparagraph (b) above, payment to the Covered Person of the additional amounts for which he is to be indemnified shall be made within ten (10) days after such determination.
Section 9. .

Covered Person seeking indemnification, or (c) by the vote of the holders of a majority of the Corporation's capital stock outstanding at the time entitled to vote thereon.
(b) . A Covered Person who seeks indemnification under this Article shall submit a request for indemnification, including such documentation and information as is reasonably available to such Covered Person and is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent such Covered Person is entitled to indemnification.

resumptions
(d) . The Corporation shall have the burden of proof to overcome the presumption described by Section 9(c) above in connection with the making by any person, persons, or entity of any determination contrary to that presumption.
Burden of Proof
(e) . The termination of any Proceeding or of any claim, issue, or matter therein, by judgment, order, settlement, or conviction, or upon a plea of guilty or of its equivalent, shall not (except as otherwise expressly provided in this Article) of itself adversely affect the right of a Covered Person to indemnification or create a presumption that a Covered Person did not act in Good Faith.
Effect of Other Proceedings
nolo contendere or
Section 10. . Any action, payment, advance determination other than a determination made pursuant to Section 9(a) above, authorization, requirement, grant of indemnification, or other action taken by the Corporation pursuant to this Article shall be effective exclusively through any Disinterested person so authorized by the Board of Directors of the Corporation, including the President or any Vice President of the Corporation.
Action by the Corporation
Section 11. . The rights of indemnification and to receive advancement of Expenses as provided by this Article shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which a Covered Person may at any time be entitled under applicable law, the Articles of Organization, these By-Laws, any agreement, a vote of stockholders, or a resolution of the Board of Directors, or otherwise. No amendment, alteration, rescission, or replacement of this Article or any provision hereof shall be effective as to a Covered Person with respect to any action taken or omitted by such Covered Person in such Covered

Insurance
Section 13. . The Corporation shall not be liable under this Article to make any payment of amounts otherwise indemnifiable hereunder if and to the extent that a Covered Person has otherwise actually received such payment under any insurance policy, contract, agreement, or otherwise.
No Duplicative Payment
Section 14. . In the event that any Covered Person seeks a judicial adjudication, or an award in arbitration, to enforce such Covered Person's rights under, or to recover damages for breach of, this Article, such Covered Person shall be entitled to recover from the Corporation, and shall be indemnified by the Corporation against, any and all expenses (of the types described in the definition of Expenses in Section 1 of this Article) actually and reasonably incurred by such Covered Person in seeking such adjudication or arbitration, but only if such Covered Person prevails therein. If it shall be determined in such adjudication or arbitration that the Covered Person is entitled to receive part but not all of the indemnification of expenses sought, the expenses incurred by such Covered Person in connection with such adjudication or arbitration shall be appropriately prorated.
Expenses of Adjudication
Section 15. . If any provision or provisions of this Article shall be held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever:
Severability
(a) the validity, legality, and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Article (including without limitation, each portion of any Section of this Article containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, that is not itself invalid, illegal, or unenforceable) shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby; and
(b) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this Article (including, without limitation, each portion of any Section of this Article containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, that is not itself invalid, illegal, or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent manifested by the provision held invalid, illegal, or unenforceable.
Unless the Articles of Organization of the Corporation provide otherwise, these By-Laws may at any time be amended by vote of the stockholders, provided that notice of the substance of the proposed amendment is stated in the notice of the meeting. If authorized by the Articles of Organization, the Directors may also make, amend, or repeal these By-Laws in whole or in part, except with respect to any provision thereof which by law, the Articles of Organization, or these By-Laws requires action by the stockholders. If the Directors make, amend, or repeal any By-Law, notice thereof stating the substance of such change shall be given to all stockholders entitled to vote on amending the By-Laws not later than the time of giving notice of the next stockholders' meeting. Any By-Law adopted by the Directors may be amended or repealed by the requisite vote of the stockholders.

PEABODY, MA (March 5, 2009)  Analogic Corporation (NASDAQ: ALOG), a leading designer and manufacturer of high-precision health and security imaging equipment, today announced results for its second quarter ended January 31, 2009.
Highlights of the quarter included:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Revenues for the second quarter ended January 31, 2009, were $102.7 million, compared with first quarter revenues of $101.6 million and the prior year's second quarter revenues of $99.4 million. Including restructuring charges of $3.5 million, loss from operations for the second quarter was $1.5 million compared with a loss of $1.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 and income of $7.8 million in the prior year's second quarter. During the quarter, the Company implemented plans to reduce its workforce by approximately 9% worldwide and expects to achieve cost avoidance of $9.8 million annually.
GAAP net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2009 was $1.4 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, compared with $0.3 million, or $0.02 per diluted share in the first quarter and $7.1 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, for the prior year's second quarter. Second quarter net income includes $1.6 million of discrete tax benefits primarily related to an IRS refund.
On a non-GAAP basis, income from operations for the second quarter of fiscal 2009 was $3.8 million compared with $1.7 million in the first quarter and $9.3 million in the prior year. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter was $5.2 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, compared with $2.6 million, or $0.19 per diluted share in the first quarter and $7.9 million, or $0.59 per diluted share, for the prior year's second quarter.
President and CEO Jim Green commented, "The global economy continues to be a challenge as hospitals reduce spending for large capital equipment, such as computed tomography (CT) medical imaging equipment, and industrial manufacturing firms reduce spending which in turn has an impact on our motion controls business. As I indicated previously, we are operating the business as though fiscal Q1 reset our revenue run rate. We have taken actions during the quarter to adjust the size of the business to maintain profitability and remain cash-flow positive at current revenue levels."
Green added, "We are now seeing the benefit of the Copley acquisition and we are leveraging our power amplifier engineering expertise across the business. Demand for Magnetic Resonance (MR) amplifiers remains steady. Our Digital Radiography (DR) segment has demonstrated year-to-year growth as our major original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) continue to adopt our direct digital conversion detectors for mammography systems. Recent, positive developments buoy the outlook for our Security segment. Overall, we are confident that Analogic remains well positioned for the current economy and beyond. "
Segment Revenues
Medical Imaging revenues were $61.8 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2009, up $2.5 million or 4% from the first quarter and $8.2 million or 15% over the prior year's second quarter, due primarily to revenue from Copley MR power systems. CT subsystem revenues were down during the second quarter due to continuing weakness in the healthcare capital equipment market, particularly in the U.S. Revenues for MR power systems were up over prior year due to the inclusion of second-quarter revenues from Copley, which supplies advanced gradient amplifiers to medical OEMs. During the quarter, new contracts were signed with OEM customers in CT and MR.
Digital Radiography revenues were $6.8 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2009, down $0.7 million or 9% from the first quarter and up $1.0 million or 17% over the prior year, driven by increasing sales of tomosynthesis-ready amorphous Selenium direct digital mammography detectors. We continue to expect revenue growth in DR as our customers introduce their systems outside the U.S., and when they receive regulatory clearance to sell in the U.S.
B-K Medical revenues were $20.8 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2009, up $2.0 million or 10% from the first quarter and down $3.9 million or down 16% from the prior year. Revenues were primarily impacted by currency, and to a lesser extent by the anticipation of new product introductions compared with the prior year. During the quarter, the new UltraView scanner began shipping, the first HistoScan
TM
units were sold in Europe and we launched a new consumable sterile biopsy guide. In addition, the new portable FlexFocus
TM
ultrasound scanner was introduced and is receiving positive feedback from prospective customers. We expect to start production of the FlexFocus in the third quarter.
Security Technology revenues were $11.2 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2009, down $1.6 million or 13% from the first quarter and also down 13% from a year earlier due to a decrease in sales of spare parts and accessories. During the quarter, the eXaminer
TM
SX Explosives Detection System (EDS) received TSA certification, enabling sales into small and midsize U.S. airports as well as opening the door for overseas markets. In addition, the TSA announced its intention to enter into sole source procurement awards with our distribution partner L-3 Communications for $344 million in baggage scanners incorporating Analogic's EDS technology. The new stimulus package also has the potential to generate additional demand.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This document includes non-GAAP financial measures that are not in accordance with, nor an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles.
Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are limited in value because they exclude charges that have a material effect on our reported results and, therefore, should not be relied upon as the sole financial measures to evaluate our financial results. The non-GAAP financial measures are meant to supplement, and to be viewed in conjunction with, GAAP financial results. An explanation and a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures are provided at the end of this press release.

UNAUDITED SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATIONRECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP MEASURES
The Company provides non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP other income, non-GAAP income before taxes, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share as supplemental measures to GAAP regarding the Company's operational performance. These financial measures exclude the impact of certain items and, therefore, have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. The adjustments to these non-GAAP financial measures, and the basis for such adjustments, are outlined below:
The Company incurs expense related to share-based compensation included in its GAAP presentation of cost of sales, research and development, selling and marketing, general and administrative expense. Although share-based compensation is an expense of the Company and viewed as a form of compensation, these expenses vary in amount from period to period, and are affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within the control of management, such as the market price and volatility of the Company's shares, risk-free interest rates, the expected term and forfeiture rates of the awards. In accordance with SFAS No. 123R, share-based compensation expense is calculated as of the grant date of each share-based award, and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the grant date. Management believes that exclusion of these expenses allows comparisons of operating results that are consistent between periods and allows comparisons of the Company's operating results to those of other companies that disclose non-GAAP financial measures that exclude share-based compensation.
Share-based compensation expense.
The Company incurs amortization of intangibles and other expenses related to acquisitions it has made in recent years. The intangible assets are valued at the time of acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition. Management believes that exclusion of these expenses allows comparisons of operating results that are consistent over time for both our newly acquired and long-held businesses.
Acquisition related expenses.
James W. Green was appointed as our President and CEO on May 21, 2007. Since his arrival Mr. Green made a number of changes in the senior leadership team reporting to him. As such, the Company incurred charges for severance, executive search, relocation and other related expenses. Management believes these charges should be excluded from the non-GAAP results because they were one-time items not associated with the ongoing operations of the business.
Executive transition expenses.
The Company continuously strives to improve its operating efficiency. During the three months ended January 31, 2009, the Company reduced its work force by 145 employees or approximately 9% worldwide. The total cost of these activities was $3,811,000 of which $3,488,000 was recorded as an operating expense during the three months ended January 31, 2009. An additional $323,000 was charged against restructuring accruals previously recorded as part of the Copley acquisition. Management believes that exclusion of these expenses allows for comparisons of operating results that are consistent over time.
Restructuring charge.
During the three months ended January 31, 2008, the Company received $555,000 from its insurance company as reimbursement for legal fees incurred in relation to an indemnification matter related to the Company's sale of its wholly-owned subsidiary Camtronics Medical Systems, Ltd. in November 2005. The $555,000 gain was recorded as other income during the three months ended January 31, 2008.
Gain on sale of investments and other.
For purposes of calculating non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, management adjusts the provision (benefit) for income taxes to tax effect the non-GAAP adjustments described above as they have a significant impact on the Company's income tax provision (benefit).
Adjustments for related tax impact.
Management excludes the above described expenses and their related tax impact in evaluating short-term and long-term operating trends in the Company's operations, and allocating resources to various initiatives and operational requirements. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial adjustments are useful to investors because they allow investors to evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making.
These non-GAAP financial measures have not been prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information provided in accordance with GAAP. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be computed in the same manner as similarly titled measures used by other companies.
The following table reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.

PEABODY, MA (June 4, 2009)  Analogic Corporation (NASDAQ: ALOG), a leading designer and manufacturer of high-precision medical and security imaging equipment, today announced results for its third quarter ended April 30, 2009.
Highlights during the quarter included:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Revenues for the third quarter ended April 30, 2009, were $93.6 million, compared with second quarter revenues of $102.7 million and the prior year's third quarter revenues of $102.8 million. Income from operations for the third quarter was $1.5 million compared with a loss of $1.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2009 and income of $7.7 million in the prior year's third quarter.
GAAP net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2009 was $2.3 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, compared with $1.4 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, in the second quarter and $6.7 million, or $0.50 per diluted share, for the prior year's third quarter.
On a non-GAAP basis, income from operations for the third quarter of fiscal 2009 was $3.3 million compared with $3.8 million in the second quarter and $9.4 million in the prior year. Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter was $3.1 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, compared with $3.4 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, in the second quarter and $8.0 million, or $0.59 per diluted share, for the prior year's third quarter.
Jim Green, President and CEO commented, "Economic conditions continue to put pressure on capital equipment spending, affecting the demand for CT, MR, and motion control related systems. We expect these trends to continue through the next couple of quarters, however, we will continue to manage our business for profitability and positive cash flow."
Green continued, "As our customers optimize their R&D expenses, they are coming to us more often for the development of new products. This increasing interest in Analogic as a development and manufacturing partner for critical subsystems will continue to benefit us in the future."
Segment Revenues
Medical Imaging revenues were $50.0 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2009, down $11.8 million from the second quarter and down $8.5 million over the prior year's third quarter. Imaging System and Subsystem revenues were down during the third quarter due to continued weakness in the healthcare capital equipment market, driven by poor economic conditions, particularly in the United States. During the quarter we implemented a major OEM contract that has the one-time effect of delaying $3 million in revenue recognition and increasing finished-goods inventory. This contract will have a similar impact in Q4, at which point revenue recognition should return to normal run rates.
Digital Radiography revenues were $10.3 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2009, up $3.5 million from the second quarter and up $1.6 million over the prior year, driven by increasing sales of tomosynthesis-ready amorphous Selenium direct digital mammography detectors to a major medical OEM. We continue to expect long-term revenue growth in DR as our customers introduce their systems outside the U.S., and as they receive regulatory clearance to sell them within the U.S.
BK Medical revenues were $19.2 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2009, down $1.6 million from the second quarter and down $3.5 million from the prior year. Revenues were negatively impacted by currency exchange rates and the delay in customer orders in anticipation of the new Flex Focus scanner.
Security Technology revenues were $12.2 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2009, up $1.0 million from the second quarter and up $1.5 million from a year earlier. During the third quarter we received a $16 million order from L-3 Communications for eXaminer 3DX and eXaminer SX systems, which will begin shipping in June 2009. This is the first order for the eXaminer SX since the U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) certified the system in January.

For purposes of calculating non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, management adjusts the provision (benefit) for income taxes to tax effect the non-GAAP adjustments described above as they have a significant impact on the Company's income tax provision (benefit). In addition from time-to-time, the Company recognizes certain non-recurring tax adjustments. In the three months ended January 31, 2009, the Company recorded $1,729,000 of discrete tax benefits of which $1,232,000 related to an income tax refund for R&D tax credits and $497,000 related the settlement of an income tax audit. In the three months ended April 30, 2009, the Company recorded $124,000 related to interest received on a tax refund. As these adjustments do not reflect the underlying performance of the business they have been excluded from Non-GAAP net income.

Management excludes the above-described expenses, their related tax impact and other non-recurring tax benefits in evaluating short-term and long-term operating trends in the Company's operations, and allocating resources to various initiatives and operational requirements.

(b)(e) On June 10, 2009, John J. Millerick, the Company's Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, resigned from those positions, effective July 5, 2009. In connection with his resignation and the termination of employment with the Company, the Company and Mr. Millerick entered into a Separation Agreement (the "Separation Agreement") on June 10, 2009. The full text of the Separation Agreement is attached as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference. The following description of the Separation Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Separation Agreement.
Under the Separation Agreement, Mr. Millerick will remain as an employee of the Company through September 29, 2009 (the "Separation Date"), notwithstanding his resignation as an officer effective July 5, 2009, to assist the Company with transitional matters. Under the Separation Agreement, the Company has agreed, provided that Mr. Millerick has not revoked the release described in the following paragraph, that, for the period starting on September 30, 2009 and continuing through and including September 29, 2010 (the "Severance Period"), the Company shall continue to pay to Mr. Millerick his annualized current base salary ($279,450), and will continue to pay the employer portion the health, dental and life insurance premiums for the continuation of Mr. Millerick's coverage under the Company's group plans. The Separation Agreement also makes provision for payment to Mr. Millerick for: any amount due and owing as a result of the Company's financial performance for the its fiscal year ending July 31, 2009 ("FY2009") under the Company's Annual Incentive Plan; and the sum of $30,000 for Mr. Millerick's transitional assistance relating to FY2009 and performing other services reasonably requested by the Company. In addition, certain options and restricted stock awards made to Mr. Millerick will vest on an accelerated basis or continue to vest beyond their original termination date in accordance with a schedule attached to the Separation Agreement.
Under the Separation Agreement, Mr. Millerick (a) is to fully and unconditionally release the Company and certain others from any and all claims, actions, liabilities, and the like of every kind and nature which Mr. Millerick has ever had against the Company and such parties, (b) agrees not to solicit employees of the Company during the Severance Period, and (c) acknowledges and reaffirms his obligation under applicable law and his Proprietary Information and Inventions Agreement with the Company dated January 31, 2000 (the "Proprietary Information Agreement"), including the obligation to keep confidential all non-public information concerning the Registrant. The Company released Mr. Millerick from his non-competition agreement with the Company.
(c) Michael L. Levitz has accepted an offer to join the Analogic Corporation (the "Company") as Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. Mr. Levitz and the Company have executed an agreement (the "Employment Agreement") dated June 8, 2009. The full text of the Employment Agreement is attached as Exhibit 10.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference. The following description of the Employment Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Employment Agreement.
Under the Employment Agreement, Mr. Levitz's at-will employment with the Company will commence on July 6, 2009. His initial annualized base salary will be $265,000. Beginning in the Company's fiscal year which begins on August 1, 2009 ("FY2010"), Mr. Levitz will be eligible, subject to Compensation Committee approval, to participate in the Company's FY2010 Annual Incentive Program, with a target bonus of 45% of his annualized base salary (i.e., $119,250). Mr. Levitz will also be eligible, again subject to Compensation Committee approval, to participate in the Company's FY2010 Long-Term Incentive Program, with a target of 100% of his annualized base salary (i.e., $265,000). As soon as practicable after his employment commences, Mr. Levitz will receive: (i) a grant of a time-based non-qualified stock option for 10,000 shares of common stock of the Company with a seven year term and which shall vest ratably (in equal increments of 25% per year) on the second, third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of the
grant date; and (ii) a restricted stock grant for 6,868 shares of common stock of the Company. The restrictions on these shares shall lapse ratably over three years beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date.
If Mr. Levitz is terminated by the Company other than for cause, death or disability, then provided Mr. Levitz has executed an general release in favor of the Company and certain others, the Company will pay Mr. Levitz his annualized base salary over a period of twelve months and pay the employer portion of continued coverage under the Company's group health and dental plans for that twelve-month period. If such termination of employment occurs within twenty-four months after a change in control of the Company, the Company will, in addition to providing the severance benefits described in the preceding sentence, pay to Mr. Levitz his target bonus under the Annual Incentive Plan for the year in which the termination occurs, payable at the time of termination. In addition, if the severance benefits due to Mr. Levitz following a change in control are subject to excise tax under the "parachute payment" provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, the Company will (subject to certain conditions) "gross up" the payments due to Mr. Levitz such that his net after-tax payment is equal to what it would have been absent such excise tax.

Exhibit 10.1
This Separation Agreement (the "Agreement") is entered into by and between Analogic Corporation (the "Company") and John J. Millerick ("Mr. Millerick").
A. Mr. Millerick has informed the Company that he wishes to resign from the Company in order to pursue other opportunities.
B. The parties desire to enter into a written agreement embodying their mutual understanding and promises concerning the orderly transition of Mr. Millerick's responsibilities and the resolution of all issues concerning Mr. Millerick's employment at the Company and the termination of that employment.
Now, therefore, in consideration of the mutual promises set forth below, and intending to be legally bound, the parties agree as follows:
1. .
Separation Date
a. Mr. Millerick hereby resigns, effective as of July 5, 2009, as Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Treasurer of the Company, and from such other elected or appointed positions that may be held by Mr. Millerick in and for the Company (or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates). Mr. Millerick agrees to execute such additional documents and take such other actions as the Company may request to reflect such resignation.
b. Notwithstanding the foregoing resignation, the parties agree that Mr. Millerick will remain employed by the Company until September 29, 2009 (the "Separation Date"). As of the end of the business day on the Separation Date, Mr. Millerick will cease to be an employee of the Company, and cease to hold any other position with the Company, its subsidiaries, affiliates and employee benefit plans. In consideration of the Company's promises under this Agreement, Mr. Millerick hereby waives and forever relinquishes any rights he may have under the Company's Severance Plan for Management Employees (the "Severance Plan") and any other severance pay plan or arrangement other than this Agreement. Mr. Millerick recognizes and agrees that this Section 1 would fully satisfy and discharge any obligation the Company might have to provide a "Notice Period" under the Severance Plan if Mr. Millerick did not waive and relinquish any rights he may have thereunder.
2. . The Company shall pay Mr. Millerick an amount equal to his daily rate of base salary as of the Separation Date multiplied by the number of accrued and unused vacation days (including any pro-rata portion thereof), less any applicable legally required or voluntarily authorized deductions and withholdings.
Payment for Vacation Days
3. . In full consideration of Mr. Millerick's acceptance of all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement and his execution of the Release of Claims and Agreement Not to Sue that is Exhibit A to this Agreement (the "Release") in accordance with the provisions of Section 14(b) below and his not revoking the Release during the revocation period
Severance Pay
set forth in Section 15 below, and subject to his performance hereunder, the Company shall also provide Mr. Millerick with the following special benefits, which Mr. Millerick acknowledges and agrees he is not owed, and to which he would not otherwise be entitled:
a. For the period starting on the day after the Separation Date (as defined in Section 1 of this Agreement) and continuing for one year thereafter (September 30, 2009, through and including September 29, 2010) (the "Severance Period"), the Company shall pay Mr. Millerick amounts equal to what was formerly his regular base salary, at the rate in effect on the Separation Date, less legally required and voluntarily authorized deductions and withholdings (the "Severance Pay"). The Severance Pay shall be paid to Mr. Millerick in accordance with the Company's customary payroll practices beginning promptly after the Separation Date, but in no event before the Effective Date (as defined in Section 17 of this Agreement). For the avoidance of doubt, the aggregate amount of Severance Pay will be $279,450.12, before legally required and voluntarily authorized deductions and withholdings. In addition, the Company shall continue to pay the employer portion of Mr. Millerick's group health (medical and dental) insurance and group life insurance premiums for continuing coverage during the Severance Period (the "Health Benefit"). Mr. Millerick hereby acknowledges and agrees that the Severance Pay will provide him with at least four (4) weeks more in salary continuation than he would otherwise be entitled to under the standard practices ordinarily applicable to management employees of the Company whose employment terminates under similar circumstances, and that the Health Benefit will provide him with at least four (4) weeks more in employer-paid group health insurance and group life insurance premiums than he would otherwise be entitled to under such standard practices.
b. Any amount due and owing as a result of Analogic financial performance for Fiscal Year 09 under the Analogic Annual Incentive Plan, as described under the Plan.
c. Any unpaid portions of the Severance Pay described in Section 3(a) of this Agreement shall be paid to Mr. Millerick's estate in the event of his death, on the condition that he has signed this Agreement and executed the Release in accordance with the provisions of Section 14(b) below and has not exercised his right to revoke the Release under Section 15 of this Agreement.
d. Title to the laptop computer, monitor, mobile phone, and printer used by Mr. Millerick at the Company as of the Separation Date will be delivered to Mr. Millerick after the Effective Date. A lump sum payment equal to $1,000 representing the estimated cost of mobile phone services and certain professional memberships will be made as soon as practicable, but no later than sixty (60) days, after the Effective Date. In addition, the telephone number that is associated with the mobile phone provided by Analogic will be transferred to Mr. Millerick, upon his request.
e. The Company will provide Mr. Millerick with career transition services through New Directions. The cost of providing such services shall be borne by the Company, such costs being paid no later than sixty (60) days after the Effective Date.
f. Notwithstanding the termination of Mr. Millerick's employment as set forth in this Agreement, any outstanding stock awards shall vest (or the restrictions shall lapse, as the case may be) according to the schedule attached hereto as Schedule 3f. Except as expressly modified in this Section 3(f), all other terms and conditions pertaining to the respective stock awards will remain in full force and effect.
Mr. Millerick recognizes and agrees that the provisions of this Section 3 and the other provisions of this Agreement would fully satisfy, discharge and exceed any obligation the Company might have to provide Mr. Millerick with "Severance Benefits" under the Severance Plan if Mr. Millerick did not waive and relinquish his rights thereunder pursuant to Section 1 of this Agreement.
4. . At the request of Analogic, Mr. Millerick will assist Analogic in the preparation of all securities or other filings that may be required in connection with or that relate to Analogic's fiscal year 2009. Mr. Millerick also agrees to cooperate with Analogic in transitioning his work and will provide such advice and perform such transition activities as are reasonably requested of him by the President and Chief Executive Officer of Analogic. In consideration of the foregoing, Analogic will pay Mr. Millerick the sum of $30,000.00, less legally required and voluntarily authorized deductions and withholdings, on or before July 31, 2009.
Other Assistance
5. .
Continuation of Certain Benefits
a. Mr. Millerick shall have all rights provided under federal or state law to continue participation in any group health (medical and dental) and life insurance plan sponsored by the Company in which he was a primary participant during his employment with the Company. After the end of the Severance Period, if Mr. Millerick elects to continue his participation in the Company's group health (medical and dental) plans under the federal Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 ("COBRA"), he shall sign and return to the Company within the time limits provided under COBRA the forms that he will receive under separate cover. Mr. Millerick's ability to elect to continue health insurance coverage under COBRA's provisions and life insurance coverage shall be determined in accordance with the governing insurance policies. Until the Release becomes effective in accordance with Section 14 below, Mr. Millerick's rights as to previously granted stock options and restricted stock awards, if any, shall be determined in accordance with the governing plan documents and, as applicable, the awards.
b. Except as may be otherwise provided in this Agreement, Mr. Millerick's right to any and all Company benefits will terminate on the Separation Date.
6. . Mr. Millerick acknowledges, warrants, and represents that on the Separation Date or upon earlier request by the Company, he will return all property owned by the Company that has been in his possession, custody, or control, including, but not limited to, any credit cards (or credit cards on which the Company is a guarantor), building or office keys, identification cards, laptops, telephones, pagers, and fax machines.

7. .

The Company will instruct its senior managers, officers, and directors not to disparage Mr. Millerick, personally or professionally.
No Solicitation or Disparagement; Competition
In addition, as of the Effective Date and as approved by the Compensation Committee of the Analogic Board of Directors, the Company shall be deemed to have released Mr. Millerick from any and all obligations not to compete with the Company following the Separation Date, including without limitation those arising out of those certain Non-Competition Agreements signed by Mr. Millerick during the period of his employment with the Company.

In the event of Mr. Millerick's breach and the Company's successful enforcement of its rights under this Agreement or the Release (or any other agreement or obligation binding on Mr. Millerick) by judgment or settlement, then in addition to any other remedies and damages available under law, the Company shall also be entitled to repayment of all monies paid to Mr. Millerick pursuant to this Agreement, and shall also be entitled to an award for all legal expenses and fees, including, but not limited to, the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel, incurred by the Company in connection with its efforts to obtain or enforce any benefit or right provided by this Agreement or the Release (or any other agreement or obligation binding on Mr. Millerick).

claim or defense that the Company has an adequate remedy at law.
22. . This Agreement is personal to Mr. Millerick and not assignable.
No Assignment
23. . This Agreement, including the Release, shall be governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, without regard to the conflict of laws principles thereof, except to the extent that the laws of the Commonwealth are preempted by federal law.

All disputes arising out of, or in connection with, the interpretation or breach of this Agreement or the Release, which are not promptly settled by mutual agreement of the parties, will be finally settled by arbitration in accordance with the National Rules for the Resolution of Employment Disputes of the American Arbitration Association. Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by both parties, such arbitration shall be conducted in Boston, Massachusetts.
Governing Law and Arbitration
24. . This Agreement, including the Release, contains the entire agreement between Mr. Millerick and the Company with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and the Release, and there are no promises, undertakings or understandings as to such subject matter outside of this Agreement or the Release, except as may otherwise be stated in this Agreement or the Release. This Agreement supersedes all prior or contemporaneous discussions, communications, understandings, negotiations, and agreements, whether written or oral, with respect to Mr. Millerick's employment at the Company, termination of that employment, and all related matters, except as may otherwise be stated in this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, neither this Agreement nor the Release supersedes the Proprietary Information Agreement, which continues in full force and effect. Mr. Millerick's rights to payments or employee benefits from the Company are specified exclusively and completely in this Agreement. This Agreement, including the Release, may only be modified or amended by a writing signed by an authorized officer of the Company and by Mr. Millerick.
Entire Agreement
25. .
Compliance with Code Section 409A
a. . It is intended that this Agreement comply with the requirements of, or qualify for an exemption from, Code Section 409A and the guidance issued thereunder. Any payments that qualify for the "short-term deferral" exception or another exception under Code Section 409A will be paid under the applicable exception. In no event may Mr. Millerick, directly or indirectly, designate the calendar year of any payment under this Agreement. Within the time period permitted by the applicable law, the Company may, in consultation with Mr. Millerick, modify this Agreement in order to cause the provisions of the Agreement to comply with the requirements of Code Section 409A, so as to avoid the imposition of taxes and penalties.
General
b. . Despite any contrary provision of this Agreement, all reimbursements and in-kind benefits provided under this Agreement will be made or provided in accordance with the requirements of Code Section 409A, including, where applicable, the requirement that (w) any reimbursement is for expenses incurred during Mr.
In-Kind Benefits and Reimbursements
Millerick's lifetime (or during a shorter period of time specified in this Agreement); (x) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in kind benefits provided, during a calendar year may not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in kind benefits to be provided, in any other calendar year; (y) the reimbursement of an eligible expense will be made no later than the last day of the calendar year following the year in which the expense is incurred; and (z) the right to reimbursement or in kind benefits is not subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit.
c. . Despite any contrary provision of this Agreement, if Mr. Millerick is considered a "specified employee" for purposes of Section 409A (as determined in accordance with the methodology established by the Company as in effect on the date of termination), (x) any payment that constitutes nonqualified deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code that is otherwise due to Mr. Millerick under this Agreement during the six-month period following his separation from service (as determined in accordance with Section 409A of the Code) will be accumulated and paid to Mr. Millerick on the first business day of the seventh month following his separation from service (the "Delayed Payment Date") and (y) in the event any equity compensation awards held by Mr. Millerick that vest upon termination of Mr. Millerick's employment constitute nonqualified deferred compensation within the meaning of Code Section 409A, the delivery of shares of common stock (or cash) as applicable in settlement of such awards shall be made on the earliest permissible payment date (including the Delayed Payment Date) or event under Code Section 409A on which the shares (or cash) would otherwise be delivered or paid. Mr. Millerick will be entitled to interest on any delayed cash payments from the date of termination to the Delayed Payment Date at a rate equal to the applicable federal short-term rate in effect under Code Section 1274(d) for the month in which the Millerick's separation from service occurs. If Mr. Millerick dies during the postponement period, the amounts and entitlements delayed on account of Section 409A shall be paid to the personal representative of his estate on the first to occur of the Delayed Payment Date or 30 days after the date of his death.
Delay of Payments
d. . Despite any contrary provision of this Agreement, any references to termination of employment or Mr. Millerick's date of termination shall mean and refer to the date of his "separation from service," as that term is defined in Section 409A of the Code and Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(h). Mr. Millerick and Analogic agree and anticipate that the level of bona fide services performed by Mr. Millerick after the Separation Date shall be permanently decreased beneath the level set forth in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(h) to constitute a "separation from service" of Mr. Millerick from Analogic.
Separate Payments
In Witness Whereof, the parties have executed this Agreement under seal by their signatures below.
 
 
Note: Unvested Shares/Options will vest as described above per the terms of the underlying grants.

Mr. Levitz has held a number of key financial leadership roles in high-growth, global technology companies, most recently Hologic, Inc., where he served as vice president and controller of that company's Cytyc business. Prior to its acquisition by Hologic, Mr. Levitz was vice president and corporate controller of Cytyc Corporation, a global, publicly held diagnostics and medical device manufacturer. Mike played an integral role in managing Cytyc's growth and integrating several mergers and acquisitions, valued at over $750 million. He also served as controller of NEON Communications, Inc. and was audit manager in the high technology practice at Arthur Andersen LLP. A certified public accountant, Mike graduated magna cum laude from the University of California at Santa Barbara with a bachelor of arts degree in business economics, with an emphasis in accounting.
"I am pleased to have a financial executive with Mike's background and talents join the Analogic team," noted Jim Green. "His wealth of experience in areas such as managing global financial operations, including financial reporting and controls, as well as integration of mergers and acquisitions, will help position Analogic for continued profitable growth. Mike will play a key role in interfacing with all of our financial stakeholders including investors and analysts."
Mike succeeds John Millerick, who has resigned from his position as Analogic's senior vice president, chief financial officer, and treasurer, effective July 5, 2009. Mr. Millerick will remain with Analogic through the end of September to assist the Company with the transition. "On behalf of Analogic, I would like to thank John for his years of service to the Company and wish him the best in his future endeavors," said Green.

Item 2.05 Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.
On July 31, 2009, Analogic Corporation (the "Registrant") committed to vacate a portion of its leased facility in Canton, MA. The Registrant vacated approximately 50% of the leased space, which was no longer being utilized due to consolidation of certain operations into the Registrant's Peabody, MA facility. The action was completed on July 31, 2009. Accordingly, the Registrant expects to incur a charge of approximately $1.0 million in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2009, which represents the ongoing lease payments for the vacated portion, net of estimated sublease income, over the remainder of the lease term, which ends in September 2011. The full text of a press release issued in connection with the commitment to vacate is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
Item 8.01 Other Events.
On August 5, 2009, the Registrant announced a reduction in its workforce by 6% worldwide, or 85 positions, which will result in a restructuring charge for severance and related costs of approximately $2.1 million in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2009. The full text of the press release issued in connection with the announcement is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
The information in Items 2.05 and 8.01 and the Exhibit attached hereto shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, except as expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.

PEABODY, MA (August 5, 2009)  Analogic Corporation (NASDAQ: ALOG), a leading provider of medical imaging and aviation security technology, announced that it has reduced its workforce by 6% worldwide and has vacated a portion of its Canton, Massachusetts facility. As a result, the Company will record a $3.1 million charge in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2009. The Company expects this action will result in annual expense savings of approximately $5 million, a portion of which will fund strategic growth initiatives.
The reduction in force, which affects 85 people across the business, will result in a $2.1 million charge for severance and related costs. In addition, the Company vacated approximately half of its Copley Controls facility in Canton, moving certain operations to its Peabody facility. Accordingly, the Company will record a charge of $1.0 million, which represents the ongoing lease payments for the vacated portion over the remainder of the lease term, which ends in 2011.
"We recognize that workforce reductions are difficult for everyone", commented Jim Green, president and CEO. "However, we have a commitment to improve our overall operational effectiveness and fund the ongoing investments needed to position Analogic for future growth. While market conditions over the past few quarters have been difficult, we remain optimistic as the market appears to be stabilizing."

PEABODY, MA (September 24, 2009)  Analogic Corporation (NASDAQ: ALOG), a leading designer and manufacturer of high-precision medical and security imaging equipment, today announced results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended July 31, 2009.
Highlights during the fourth quarter included:
 
 
 
 
Revenues for the fourth fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2009, were $98.3 million, compared with third quarter revenues of $93.6 million and the prior fiscal year's fourth quarter revenues of $117.1 million. Income (loss) from operations for the fourth quarter was ($2.6) million compared with income of $1.5 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2009 and income of $2.4 million in the prior year's fourth quarter. Reported results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 included a charge of $3.1 million ($2.0 million after tax) due to restructuring expenses related to a reduction in force and downsizing of facilities. Reported net income (loss) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 was ($0.3) million, or ($0.02) per diluted share, compared with income of $2.3 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, in the third quarter of fiscal 2009 and $3.3 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, for the prior year's fourth quarter.
On an adjusted, non-GAAP basis, income from operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 was $1.4 million compared with $3.3 million in the third quarter and $10.7 million in the prior year fourth quarter. Adjusted non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $1.4 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, compared with $3.1 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, in the third quarter of fiscal 2009 and $7.2 million, or $0.55 per diluted share, for the prior year's fourth quarter. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is included as an attachment to this press release.
For fiscal 2009, revenues were $396.1 million, compared with revenues of $413.5 million in fiscal 2008. Reported net income for fiscal year 2009 totaled $3.7 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, as compared with net income of $23.5 million, or $1.77 per diluted share, for fiscal 2008.
"Fiscal 2009 was a challenging year due to the global economic conditions, however market conditions appear to have stabilized," commented Jim Green, president and CEO. "In addition to our Digital Radiography and Security businesses performing well through the downturn, our CT business is stabilizing, and we are seeing increased demand in MRI and especially in our end-user specialized ultrasound business."
Segment Revenues
Medical Imaging revenues were $51.2 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, up $1.2 million from the third quarter and down $16.2 million over the prior year's fourth quarter.Revenues were up slightly during the fourth quarter due to increased shipments of MRI and motion controls products. During the quarter, the Company completed its transition to consigned inventory per a major OEM contract which had the effect of delaying approximately $1.5 million of revenue and increasing finished goods inventory.
Digital Radiography revenues were $8.4 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, down $1.9 million from the third quarter and down $0.4 million over the prior year. The decrease in revenue was driven by the phasing out of non-mammography detectors as the Company continues to focus the business on the premium segment of Selenium based full field digital mammography detectors.
BK Medical revenues were $23.7 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, up $4.5 million from the third quarter and down $1.4 million from the prior year. The increase in revenue during the fourth quarter was due primarily to increasing demand for the new FlexFocus ultrasound scanner coupled with a $1.9 million international tender.
Security Technology revenues were $12.8 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, up $0.6 million from the third quarter and down $0.1 million from a year earlier. During the quarter, the Company shipped the first production eXaminer SX and received a contract from the Transportation Security Administration for the completion of the OnGuard DualUse system for both check-bag and check-point applications in smaller airports.
Use of Adjusted Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This document includes adjusted non-GAAP financial measures that are not in accordance with, nor an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these adjusted non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles.
Adjusted non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are limited in value because they exclude charges that have a material effect on our reported results and, therefore, should not be relied upon as the sole financial measures to evaluate our financial results. The adjusted non-GAAP financial measures are meant to supplement, and to be viewed in conjunction with, GAAP financial results. An explanation and a reconciliation of our adjusted non-GAAP measures are provided at the end of this press release.

CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS
(Unaudited)
 
UNAUDITED SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATIONRECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP MEASURES
The Company provides adjusted non-GAAP gross margin, adjusted non-GAAP operating expenses, adjusted non-GAAP income from operations, adjusted non-GAAP income before income taxes, adjusted non-GAAP net income and adjusted non-GAAP diluted earnings per share as supplemental measures to GAAP regarding the Company's operational performance. These financial measures exclude the impact of certain items and, therefore, have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. The adjustments to these non-GAAP financial measures, and the basis for such adjustments, are outlined below:
The Company incurs expense related to share-based compensation included in its GAAP presentation of cost of sales, research and development, selling and marketing, general and administrative expense. Although share-based compensation is an expense of the Company and viewed as a form of compensation, these expenses vary in amount from period to period, and are affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within the control of management, such as the market price and volatility of the Company's shares, risk-free interest rates, and the expected term and forfeiture rates of the awards. In accordance with SFAS No. 123(R), share-based compensation expense is calculated as of the grant date of each share-based award, and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the grant date. Management believes that exclusion of these expenses allows comparisons of operating results that are consistent between periods and allows comparisons of the Company's operating results to those of other companies that disclose non-GAAP financial measures that exclude share-based compensation.
Share-based compensation expense.
The Company incurs amortization of intangibles and other expenses related to acquisitions it has made in recent years. The intangible assets are valued at the time of acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition. Management believes that exclusion of these expenses allows comparisons of operating results that are consistent over time for both our newly acquired and long-held businesses.
Acquisition related expenses.
James W. Green was appointed as our President and CEO on May 21, 2007. Since his arrival Mr. Green made a number of changes in the senior leadership team reporting to him. As such, the Company incurred charges in fiscal 2008 for severance, executive search, relocation and other related expenses.
Executive transition expenses.
Management believes these charges should be excluded from the adjusted non-GAAP results because they were items not associated with the ongoing operations of the business.
The Company continuously strives to improve its operating efficiency. During the three months ended July 31, 2009, the Company reduced its work force by 85 employees or approximately 6% worldwide and vacated 50% of its office facility in Canton, MA on July 31, 2009 as a result of moving certain operations to our Peabody facility. The total cost of these activities was $3,131,000, which was recorded as an operating expense during the three months ended July 31, 2009.
Restructuring and Voluntary Retirement charges.
During the three months ended January 31, 2009, the Company reduced its work force by 145 employees or approximately 9% worldwide. The total cost of these activities was $3,811,000 of which $3,488,000 was recorded as an operating expense during the three months ended January 31, 2009. An additional $323,000 was charged against restructuring accruals previously recorded as part of the Copley acquisition.
During the three months ended July 31, 2008, the Company offered a one-time voluntary retirement program to certain eligible U.S. employees. In addition, the Company terminated 32 employees in its Peabody, Massachusetts facility. Total cost of these activities was $4,016,000 in the three and twelve months ended July 31, 2008. Management believes that exclusion of these expenses allows for comparisons of operating results that are consistent over time.
During the three months ended July 31, 2009, the Company received $838,000 as the final escrow payment related to the sale of its interest in Bio-Imaging Research ("BIR") was recorded as other income in the twelve months ended July 31, 2009. During the three months ended October 31, 2007, the Company received $84,000 as an initial escrow payment related to the sale of its interest in BIR, which was recorded as other income in the twelve months ended July 31, 2008. On December 7, 2007, the Company received $555,000 from its insurance company as reimbursement for legal fees incurred in relation to an indemnification matter related to the Company's sale of its wholly owned subsidiary Camtronics Medical Systems, Ltd. in November 2005. The $555,000 gain was recorded as other income during the twelve months ended July 31, 2008. On January 30, 2008, the Company agreed to sell to Chonqing Anke Medical Equipment Co., 20% of its existing 45% equity interest (for a remaining interest of 25%) in Shenzhen Anke High Tech Co. Ltd ("SAHCO") for aggregate compensation of $2,000,000. The Company recognized a $2,000,000 gain in other (income) expense during the three months ended July 31, 2008 when the cash was received. These gains have been presented as a non-GAAP item for the related periods as management believes they are items not associated with the on-going operations of the business.
Gain on sale of other investments.
For purposes of calculating adjusted non-GAAP net income and adjusted non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, management adjusts the provision (benefit) for income taxes to tax effect the non-GAAP adjustments described above as they have a significant impact on the Company's income tax provision (benefit).
Taxes.
Periodically, the Company recognizes certain non-recurring tax adjustments. In the three months ended January 31, 2009, the Company recorded $1,729,000 of discrete tax benefits of which $1,232,000 related to an income tax refund for R&D tax credits and $497,000 related the settlement of an income tax audit. In the three months ended April 30, 2009, the Company recorded $124,000 related to interest received on a tax refund. In the three months ended July 31, 2009, the company recorded $244,000 for a tax refund and related interest. As these adjustments do not reflect the underlying performance of the business they have been excluded from Non-GAAP net income.
Management excludes the above-described expenses, their related tax impact and other non-recurring tax benefits in evaluating short-term and long-term operating trends in the Company's operations, and allocating resources to various initiatives and operational requirements. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial adjustments are useful to investors because they allow investors to evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making.
These non-GAAP financial measures have not been prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information provided in accordance with GAAP. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be computed in the same manner as similarly titled measures used by other companies.
The following table reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.

Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
(e) On October 14, 2009, Analogic Corporation ("we", "us", "our") approved an annual incentive bonus plan for fiscal 2010 (the "FY10 AIP"). For our executive officers who are not business unit heads, the FY10 AIP is based on the achievement of revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share targets. For our one executive officer who is a business unit head, the FY10 AIP is based on the achievement of targets for non-GAAP earnings per share, his business unit's direct profit, and his business unit's revenue. Under the FY10 AIP, each of our executive officers has been assigned a target cash award and has the opportunity to earn a maximum of two times the target based on performance relative to the criteria described above. Any amounts earned for performance in excess of target will be paid 50% in cash and 50% in our common stock. Our non-GAAP earnings per share are based on GAAP earnings per share adjusted for certain items that management considers to be non-operating, non-recurring or of a non-cash nature, such as share-based compensation expense, asset impairment charges, and acquisition related expenses. No such item is used to calculate a non-GAAP measure without the approval of the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The fiscal 2009 AIP was based on the achievement of revenue and adjusted diluted earnings per share targets.
The target bonus under the FY10 AIP for James W. Green, our President and Chief Executive Officer, is 90% of his $490,522 base salary, or $441,470. The target bonus under the FY10 AIP for John J. Fry, our Vice President, General Counsel and Corporation Secretary is 45% of his $295,022 base salary, or $132,760. The target bonus under the FY10 AIP for Peter M. Howard, our Senior Vice President and General Manager of the OEM Medical Group, is 45% of his $277,447 base salary, or $124,851. The target bonus under the FY10 AIP for Michael L. Levitz, our Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Treasurer, is 45% of his $265,000 base salary, or $119,250. The target bonus under the FY10 AIP for Donald B. Melson, our Vice President  Corporate Controller is 35% of his $225,522 base salary, or $78,933.
On October 14, 2009, we also approved the principal terms of a long-term incentive plan (the "FY10 LTIP"). Under the FY10 LTIP, each of our executive officers will receive a long-term incentive award of performance contingent restricted common stock, which will vest based upon achievement of certain targets over the three year period ending July 31, 2012 with respect to our cumulative non-GAAP earnings per share and our relative total shareholder return ("TSR"). Achievement in whole or in part of each target will result in the vesting of up to one-half of the performance contingent restricted shares awarded, based on a pre-defined formulas. All shares earned based on achievement of the performance targets will cliff-vest as of July 31, 2012. Relative TSR will be calculated based on our TSR relative to the performance of the companies in a peer group identified by the Compensation Committee.
As of October 14, 2009, shares available under our 2007 Restricted Stock Plan were sufficient in number to allow us to grant only one-third of the approved target number of shares for each executive officer (including covering the possibility of the maximum two times target being earned with respect to the shares granted). Accordingly, one-third of the approved target number of shares was granted to each executive officer on October 14, 2009. The grant of the other two-thirds of the target number is contingent on our Board adopting a new equity-based compensation plan, and such awards would be granted subject to our stockholders approving the new plan at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders expected to be held in January 2010.
The table below summarizes the long-term incentive awards approved and actually granted to executive officers under the FY10 LTIP:

PEABODY, MA (December 9, 2009)  Analogic Corporation (NASDAQ: ALOG), a leading designer and manufacturer of high-precision medical and security imaging equipment, today announced results for its first quarter ended October 31, 2009.
Highlights during the first quarter included:
 
 
 
 
 
 
Revenues for the first fiscal quarter ended October 31, 2009, were $95.4 million, compared with fourth quarter revenues of $98.3 million and the prior fiscal year's first quarter revenues of $101.6 million. Income from operations for the first quarter was breakeven compared with a loss of ($2.6) million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 which included $3.1 million of restructuring charges, and a loss of ($1.6) million in the prior year's first quarter. Reported net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2010 was $26,000, or $0.00 per diluted share, compared with a loss of ($0.3) million, or ($0.02) per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 and income of $0.3 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, for the prior year's first quarter.
On an adjusted, non-GAAP basis, income from operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2010 was $1.9 million compared with $1.4 million in the fourth quarter and $1.7 million in the prior year's first quarter. Adjusted non-GAAP net income for the first quarter was $1.3 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, compared with $1.4 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 and $2.6 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, for the prior year's first quarter. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is included as an attachment to this press release.
Jim Green, president and CEO, commented, " We are encouraged in our Medical Technology business as we have returned to profitability and are starting to see indications that the medical imaging markets are beginning to improve, as reflected by the increased order volume of our CT and MRI sub-systems during the quarter. While we are experiencing near-term lumpiness in our security business, we expect to return to normal run rates in the second half of our fiscal year and are committed to profitability in this business for the fiscal year. In addition, we are pleased to have announced our new relationship with Smiths Detection, a recognized leader in the aviation security field, as this represents a long-term growth opportunity for Analogic."
Green concluded, "As we have stated previously, one of our key financial goals is to achieve double-digit operating margins by FY2012. We are committed to achieving significant improvement in our operating margins, even at our current revenue run rate, through organic measures that are within our control. We will continue to focus on driving efficiencies throughout our businesses. Specifically, we have assembled a world-class operations team that is driving down our cost position by consolidating manufacturing operations, improving planning and supply chain management processes, increasing the use of automation in our manufacturing operations, and pursuing design-driven product cost reductions. Our recently announced presence in China provides additional low cost manufacturing and supply chain opportunities. We are confident that focusing on these and other items will drive enhanced profitability in each of the next three years on our pathway to double-digit operating margins by FY2012. We look forward to executing on these objectives and delivering value to shareholders."
Segment Revenues
Revenues from our CT and MRI segment, previously referred to as Medical Imaging, were $57.7 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2010, up $6.5 million from the fourth quarter and down $1.5 million over the prior year's first quarter. Revenues were up during the first quarter, as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, as the major medical OEMs have begun to increase their demand for new CT and MRI sub-systems.
Digital Radiography revenues were $8.2 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2010, down $0.2 million from the fourth quarter and up $0.7 million over the prior year. Demand for the Company's Selenium-based digital detector plates continues to grow as sales of digital mammography systems increase outside the U.S.
Our Specialized Ultrasound segment, previously referred to as BK Medical, generated revenues of $20 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2010, down $3.7 million from the fourth quarter and up $1.1 million from the prior year. The decrease in revenue during the first quarter primarily reflects seasonality in the business.
Security Technology revenues were $6.9 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2010, down $5.9 million from the fourth quarter and down $6.0 million from a year earlier primarily due to order delays from our OEM customer, L-3 Communications. We understand that these delays were driven by delays in TSA orders for checked baggage screening systems. The delay in order flow will impact segment revenues for the current fiscal year, but we are committed to profitability in this business. Separately, we were pleased to see that the eXaminer XLB received formal certification
from the TSA and the first order was received for system delivery in the third fiscal quarter. In addition, a contract was signed with a new security OEM customer, Smiths Detection, to develop high precision CT detection subsystem components for a next-generation checked-baggage explosives detection system.
Use of Adjusted Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This document includes adjusted non-GAAP financial measures that are not in accordance with, nor an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these adjusted non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles.
Adjusted non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are limited in value because they exclude charges that have a material effect on our reported results and, therefore, should not be relied upon as the sole financial measures to evaluate our financial results. The adjusted non-GAAP financial measures are meant to supplement, and to be viewed in conjunction with, GAAP financial results. An explanation and a reconciliation of our adjusted non-GAAP measures are provided at the end of this press release.

UNAUDITED SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION - RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP MEASURES
The Company provides adjusted non-GAAP gross margin, adjusted non-GAAP operating expenses, adjusted non-GAAP income from operations, adjusted non-GAAP income before income taxes, adjusted non-GAAP net income and adjusted non-GAAP diluted earnings per share as supplemental measures to GAAP regarding the Company's operational performance. These financial measures exclude the impact of certain items and, therefore, have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. The adjustments to these non-GAAP financial measures, and the basis for such adjustments, are outlined below:
The Company incurs expense related to share-based compensation included in its GAAP presentation of cost of sales, research and development, selling and marketing, general and administrative expense. Although share-based compensation is an expense of the Company and viewed as a form of compensation, these expenses vary in amount from period to period, and are affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within the control of management, such as the market price and volatility of the Company's shares, risk-free interest rates, and the expected term and forfeiture rates of the awards. In accordance with SFAS No. 123(R), share-based compensation expense is calculated as of the grant date of each share-based award, and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the grant date. Management believes that exclusion of these expenses allows comparisons of operating results that are consistent between periods and allows comparisons of the Company's operating results to those of other companies that disclose adjusted non-GAAP financial measures that exclude share-based compensation.
Share-based compensation expense.
The Company incurs amortization of intangibles and other expenses related to acquisitions it has made in recent years. The intangible assets are valued at the time of acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition. Management believes that exclusion of these expenses allows comparisons of operating results that are consistent over time for both our newly acquired and long-held businesses.
Acquisition related expenses.
The Company continuously strives to improve its operating efficiency. During the three months ended July 31, 2009, the Company reduced its work force by 85 employees or approximately 6% worldwide and vacated 50% of its office facility in Canton, MA on July 31, 2009 as a result of moving certain operations to our Peabody facility. The total cost of these activities was $3,131,000, which was recorded as an operating expense during the three months ended July 31, 2009.
Restructuring charges.
During the three months ended July 31, 2009, the Company received $838,000 as the final escrow payment related to the sale of its interest in Bio-Imaging Research ("BIR") was recorded as other income in the three months ended July 31, 2009.
Gain on sale of other investments.
For purposes of calculating adjusted non-GAAP net income and adjusted non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, management adjusts the provision (benefit) for income taxes to tax effect the non-GAAP adjustments described above as they have a significant impact on the Company's income tax provision (benefit).
Taxes.
Periodically, the Company recognizes certain non-recurring tax adjustments. In the three months ended July 31, 2009, the company recorded $244,000 for a tax refund and related interest. As these adjustments do not reflect the underlying performance of the business they have been excluded from adjusted Non-GAAP net income.
Management excludes the above-described expenses, their related tax impact and other non-recurring tax benefits in evaluating short-term and long-term operating trends in the Company's operations, and allocating resources to various initiatives and operational requirements. The Company believes that these adjusted non-GAAP financial adjustments are useful to investors because they allow investors to evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making.
These adjusted non-GAAP financial measures have not been prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information provided in accordance with GAAP. Further, these adjusted non-GAAP financial measures may not be computed in the same manner as similarly titled measures used by other companies.
The following table reconciles the adjusted non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.

No notice need be given to any stockholder if a written waiver of notice, executed before or after the meeting by the stockholder or his attorney thereunto authorized is filed with the records of the meeting.
Notices
Section 5. . The holders of record of a majority in interest of the stock of the Corporation then issued and outstanding and entitled to vote, appearing in person or by proxy shall constitute a quorum, but a lesser number may adjourn the meeting from time to time without further notice.
Quorum
Section 6. . Each stockholder shall have one vote for each share of stock entitled to vote, and a proportionate vote for any fractional share entitled to vote, held by him of record according to the records of the Corporation, unless otherwise provided by the Articles of Organization. Stockholders may vote either in person or by written proxy dated not more than six months before the meeting named therein. Proxies shall be filed with the Clerk or other person responsible for recording the proceedings of the meeting before being voted. Except as otherwise limited therein, proxies shall entitle the persons named therein to vote at the meeting specified therein and at any adjourned session of such meeting but shall not be valid after final adjournment of the meeting. A proxy with respect to stock held in the name of two or more persons shall be valid if executed by one of them unless at or prior to exercise of the proxy the Corporation receives a specific written notice to the contrary from any one of them. A proxy purporting to be executed by or on behalf of a stockholder shall be deemed valid unless challenged at or prior to its exercise.
Voting and Proxies
Section 7. . When a quorum is present, action of the stockholders on any matter properly brought before such meeting shall require the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the stock present or represented and entitled to vote and voting on such matter (or if there are two or more classes of stock entitled to vote as separate classes, then in the case of each such class, the holders of a majority of the stock of that class present or represented and entitled to vote and voting on a matter), provided that such majority shall be at least a majority of the number of shares required to constitute a quorum for action on such matter, except where a greater vote is required by law, the Articles of Organization or these By-Laws. Any election by stockholders shall be determined by a plurality of the votes cast by the stockholders entitled to vote at the election. No ballot shall be required for such election unless requested by a stockholder present or represented at the meeting and entitled to vote in the election.
Action at Meeting
Section 8. . Any action to be taken by stockholders may be taken without a meeting if all stockholders entitled to vote on the matter consent to the action by a writing filed with the records of the meetings of stockholders. Such consent shall be treated for all purposes as a vote at the meeting.
Special Action
Section 9. . The Directors may fix in advance a time which shall be not more than sixty (60) days prior to (a) the date of any meeting of stockholders, (b) the date for the payment of any dividend or the making of any distribution to stockholders, or (c) the last day on which the consent or dissent of stockholders may be effectively expressed for any purpose, as the record date for determining the stockholders having the right to notice of and to vote at such meeting and any adjournment thereof, the right to receive such dividend or distribution, or the right to give such consent or dissent. In such case only stockholders of record on such record date shall have such right, notwithstanding any transfer of stock on the books of the Corporation after the record date. Without fixing such record date the Directors may for any of such purposes close the transfer books for all or any part of such period.
Record Date
Section 1. . The business of the Corporation shall be managed by a Board of Directors which may exercise all the powers of the Corporation except as otherwise provided by law, by the Articles of Organization or by these By-Laws. In the event of a vacancy in the Board of Directors, the remaining Directors, except as otherwise provided by law, may exercise the powers of the full Board until the vacancy is filled.
Powers
Section 2. A board of directors of such number, not less than five, nor more than eleven, as shall be fixed by the board before each annual meeting of the stockholders, shall be elected by the stockholders at the annual meeting. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 7 of Article I, and except as provided in Section 3 of this Article II, each director shall be elected by the vote of the majority of the votes cast with respect to the director at any meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present; if, as of a date that is fourteen (14) days in advance of the date the Corporation files its definitive proxy statement with respect to such meeting (regardless of whether or not thereafter revised or supplemented) with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the number of nominees is greater than the number of directors to be elected, the directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast by the stockholders entitled to vote on the election of directors. For purposes of this Section, a majority of the votes cast means that the number of shares voted "for" a director must be greater than the number of votes cast "against" that director.
Number and Election.
provided that
Section 3. . In the case of any vacancy in the Board of Directors from death, resignation, disqualification or other cause, including a vacancy resulting from enlargement of the Board, the election of a Director to fill such vacancy shall be by vote of a majority of the Directors then in office, whether or not constituting a quorum. The Director thus elected shall hold office for (1) the unexpired portion of the term of the Director whose place shall be vacant or (2) the unexpired portion of the term of the class of Director added to the Board, as the case may be, and, in either case, until the election of his successor.
Vacancies
Section 4. . Subject to the rights of holders of any class or series of Preferred Stock, the number of Directors may be changed from time to time either by the shareholders or the Board of Directors.
Change in Size of Board
Section 5. . Until the division of Directors into classes is terminated as provided below, the Directors of the Corporation shall be divided into three classes: Class I, Class II, and Class III. Each class shall consist as nearly as may be possible, of one-third of the whole number of the Board of Directors. At the 2008 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the Class I Directors shall be elected by the shareholders for terms expiring at the 2011 Annual Meeting of Stockholders; at the 2009 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the Class II Directors shall be elected by the shareholders for terms expiring at the 2010 Annual Meeting of Stockholders; at the 2010 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, both the Class II and Class III Directors shall be elected by the shareholders for terms expiring at the 2011 Annual Meeting of Stockholders; and at the 2011 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and at each Annual Meeting of Stockholders thereafter, all Directors shall be elected by the shareholders for terms expiring at the next Annual Meeting of Stockholders (or, in each case above, until their successors shall be elected and qualified or their earlier death, resignation or removal). From and after the 2011 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the Directors shall no longer be divided into classes. For so long as the Directors are divided into classes, (a) if the number of Directors changes, any increase or decrease in Directors shall be apportioned among the classes so as to maintain all classes as equal in number as possible, and any additional Director elected to any class shall hold office for a term which shall coincide with the terms of the other Directors in such class and until his successor is duly elected and qualified, (b) no decrease in the number of Directors constituting the Board of Directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent Director and (c) any Director elected to fill a vacancy shall hold office for the remainder of the full term of the class of Directors in which the vacancy occurred or the new directorship was created and until such Director's successor shall have been elected and qualified. Any Director may resign by delivering his written resignation to the Corporation at its principal office, or to the Chairman of the Board or Secretary.
Election and Tenure
Section 6. . Subject to the rights of holders of any class or series of Preferred Stock, the removal of any Director or Directors or the entire Board of Directors may be effected only by the affirmative vote of a majority of (a) the Directors then in office, for cause, or (b) the shares outstanding and entitled to vote in the election of the Directors, with or without cause. "Cause" for purposes of this Section 6 shall mean only (1) conviction of a felony, (2) declaration of unsound mind by order of court, (3) gross dereliction of duty, (4) commission of an action involving moral turpitude or (5) commission of an action which constitutes intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law if such action in either event results both in an improper substantial personal benefit and a material injury to the Corporation. A Director may be removed by the shareholders or the Directors only at a meeting called for the purpose of removing him or her, and the meeting notice must state that the purpose, or one of the purposes, of the meeting is removal of the Director.
Removal
Section 7. . Immediately after each annual meeting of stockholders, or the special meeting held in lieu thereof, and at the place thereof, if a quorum of the Directors elected at such meeting was present thereat, there shall be a meeting of the Directors without notice; but if such a quorum of the Directors elected thereat was not present at such meeting, or if present, do not proceed immediately thereafter to hold a meeting of the Directors, the annual meeting of the Directors shall be called in the manner hereinafter provided with respect to the call of special meetings of Directors.
Annual Meeting
Section 8. . Regular meetings of the Directors may be held at such times and places as shall from time to time be fixed by resolution of the Board, and no notice need be given of regular meetings held at times and places so fixed; provided, however, that any resolution relating to the holding of regular meetings shall remain in force only until the next annual meeting of stockholders, or the special meeting held in lieu thereof, and that if at any meeting of Directors at which a resolution is adopted fixing the times or place or places for any regular meetings any Director is absent no meeting shall be held pursuant to such resolution until either each such absent Director has in writing or by telegram approved the resolution or seven (7) days have elapsed after copy of the resolution certified by the Clerk has been mailed, postage prepaid, addressed to each such absent Director at his last known home or business address.
Regular Meetings
Section 9. . Special meetings of the Directors may be called by the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the President, the Treasurer, or by any two Directors, and shall be held at the time and place designated in the call thereof.
Special Meetings
Section 10. . Notice of all special meetings of the Directors shall be given to each Director by the Secretary, or if there be no Secretary, by the Assistant Secretary, or in case of the death, absence, incapacity or refusal of such persons, by the officer or one of the Directors calling the meeting.

Said copies and records need not all be kept in the same office.

This Article shall not be construed to invalidate any contract or other transaction which would otherwise be valid under the common or statutory law applicable thereto.

Such statement or statements shall reasonably evidence the Expenses incurred by the Covered Person and shall include or be preceded or accompanied by an undertaking by or on behalf of the Covered Person to repay any Expenses if it shall ultimately be determined that such Covered Person is not entitled to be indemnified against such Expenses. Any advance and undertaking to repay pursuant to this Section 7 may be interest free and made without reference to the financial ability of the Covered Person to make such repayment.

With respect to any such Proceedings to which such Covered Person notifies the Corporation:
Notification and Defense of Claim
(a) The Corporation will be entitled to participate in the defense at its own expense.
(b) Except as otherwise provided below in this subparagraph (b), the Corporation (jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified) will be entitled to assume the defense with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Covered Person. After notice from the Corporation to the Covered Person of its election to assume the defense of a suit, the Corporation will not be liable to the Covered Person under this Article for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the Covered Person in connection with the defense of the Proceeding other than reasonable costs of investigation or as otherwise provided below in this subparagraph (b). The Covered Person shall have the right to employ his own counsel in such Proceeding but the fees and expenses of such counsel incurred after notice from the Corporation of its assumption of the defense shall be at the expense of the Covered Person except as provided in this paragraph. The fees and expenses of counsel shall be at the expense of the Corporation if (i) the employment of counsel by the Covered Person has been authorized by the Corporation, (ii) the Covered Person shall have concluded reasonably that there may be a conflict of interest between the Corporation and the Covered Person in the conduct of the defense of such action and such conclusion is confirmed in writing by the Corporation's outside counsel regularly employed by it in connection with corporate matters, or (iii) the Corporation shall not in fact have employed counsel to assume the defense of such proceeding. The Corporation shall be entitled to participate in, but shall not be entitled to assume the defense of any proceeding brought by or in the right of the Corporation or as to which the Covered Person shall have made the conclusion provided for in (ii) above and such conclusion shall have been so confirmed by the Corporation's said outside counsel.
(c) Notwithstanding any provision of this Article to the contrary, the Corporation shall not be obligated to indemnify the Covered Person under this Article for any amounts paid in settlement of any Proceeding effected without its written consent. The Corporation shall not settle any Proceeding or claim in any manner which would impose any penalty, limitation, or disqualification of the Covered Person for any purpose without such Covered Person's written consent. Neither the Corporation nor the Covered Person will unreasonably withhold their consent to any proposed settlement.
(d) If it is determined that the Covered Person is entitled to indemnification other than as afforded under subparagraph (b) above, payment to the Covered Person of the additional amounts for which he is to be indemnified shall be made within ten (10) days after such determination.
Section 9. .
Procedures
(a) Method of Determination. A determination (as provided for by this Article or if required by applicable law in the specific case) with respect to a Covered Person's entitlement to indemnification shall be made either (a) by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of Disinterested Directors, or (b) in the event that a quorum of the Board of Directors consisting of Disinterested Directors is not obtainable or, even if obtainable, such quorum of Disinterested Directors so directs, by Independent Counsel in a written determination to the Board of Directors, a copy of which shall be delivered to the Covered Person seeking indemnification, or (c) by the vote of the holders of a majority of the Corporation's capital stock outstanding at the time entitled to vote thereon.
(b) . A Covered Person who seeks indemnification under this Article shall submit a request for indemnification, including such documentation and information as is reasonably available to such Covered Person and is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent such Covered Person is entitled to indemnification.
Initiating Request
(c) P. In making a determination with respect to entitlement to indemnification hereunder, the person or persons or entity making such determination shall presume that the Covered Person is entitled to indemnification under this Article.
resumptions
(d) . The Corporation shall have the burden of proof to overcome the presumption described by Section 9(c) above in connection with the making by any person, persons, or entity of any determination contrary to that presumption.
Burden of Proof
(e) . The termination of any Proceeding or of any claim, issue, or matter therein, by judgment, order, settlement, or conviction, or upon a plea of guilty or of its equivalent, shall not (except as otherwise expressly provided in this Article) of itself adversely affect the right of a Covered Person to indemnification or create a presumption that a Covered Person did not act in Good Faith.
Effect of Other Proceedings
nolo contendere or
Section 10. . Any action, payment, advance determination other than a determination made pursuant to Section 9(a) above, authorization, requirement, grant of indemnification, or other action taken by the Corporation pursuant to this Article shall be effective exclusively through any Disinterested person so authorized by the Board of Directors of the Corporation, including the President or any Vice President of the Corporation.
Action by the Corporation
Section 11. . The rights of indemnification and to receive advancement of Expenses as provided by this Article shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which a Covered Person may at any time be entitled under applicable law, the Articles of Organization, these By-Laws, any agreement, a vote of stockholders, or a resolution of the Board of Directors, or otherwise. No amendment, alteration, rescission, or replacement of this Article or any provision hereof shall be effective as to a Covered Person with respect to any action taken or omitted by such Covered Person in such Covered Person's Corporate Status or with respect to any state of facts then or previously existing or any proceeding previously or thereafter brought or threatened based in whole or to the extent based in part upon any such state of facts existing prior to such amendment, alteration, rescission, or replacement.
Non-Exclusivity
Section 12. . The Corporation may maintain, at its expense, an insurance policy or policies to protect itself and any Covered Person, Officer, employee, or agent of the Corporation or another enterprise against liability arising out of this Article or otherwise, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify any such person against such liability under the Massachusetts Business Corporation Act.
Insurance
Section 13. . The Corporation shall not be liable under this Article to make any payment of amounts otherwise indemnifiable hereunder if and to the extent that a Covered Person has otherwise actually received such payment under any insurance policy, contract, agreement, or otherwise.
No Duplicative Payment
Section 14. . In the event that any Covered Person seeks a judicial adjudication, or an award in arbitration, to enforce such Covered Person's rights under, or to recover damages for breach of, this Article, such Covered Person shall be entitled to recover from the Corporation, and shall be indemnified by the Corporation against, any and all expenses (of the types described in the definition of Expenses in Section 1 of this Article) actually and reasonably incurred by such Covered Person in seeking such adjudication or arbitration, but only if such Covered Person prevails therein. If it shall be determined in such adjudication or arbitration that the Covered Person is entitled to receive part but not all of the indemnification of expenses sought, the expenses incurred by such Covered Person in connection with such adjudication or arbitration shall be appropriately prorated.
Expenses of Adjudication
Section 15. . If any provision or provisions of this Article shall be held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever:
Severability
(a) the validity, legality, and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Article (including without limitation, each portion of any Section of this Article containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, that is not itself invalid, illegal, or unenforceable) shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby; and

Exhibit 10.1
1.
Purpose
The purpose of this 2009 Stock Incentive Plan (the "Plan") of Analogic Corporation, a Massachusetts corporation (the "Company"), is to advance the interests of the Company's stockholders by enhancing the Company's ability to attract, retain and motivate persons who are expected to make important contributions to the Company and by providing such persons with equity ownership opportunities and performance-based incentives that are intended to better align the interests of such persons with those of the Company's stockholders. Except where the context otherwise requires, the term "Company" shall include any of the Company's present or future parent or subsidiary corporations as defined in Sections 424(e) or (f) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and any regulations thereunder (the "Code").
2.
Eligibility
All of the Company's employees and officers, as well as consultants and advisors to the Company (as such terms are defined and interpreted for purposes of Form S-8 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), or any successor form) are eligible to be granted Awards under the Plan. Each person who is granted an Award under the Plan is deemed a "Participant." "Award" means Options (as defined in Section 5), SARs (as defined in Section 6), Restricted Stock (as defined in Section 7), Restricted Stock Units (as defined in Section 7) and Other Stock-Based Awards (as defined in Section 8).
3.
Administration and Delegation
(a) . The Plan will be administered by the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board"). The Board shall have authority to grant Awards and to adopt, amend and repeal such administrative rules, guidelines and practices relating to the Plan as it shall deem advisable. The Board may construe and interpret the terms of the Plan and any Award agreements entered into under the Plan. The Board may correct any defect, supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency in the Plan or any Award in the manner and to the extent it shall deem expedient and it shall be the sole and final judge of such expediency. All decisions by the Board shall be made in the Board's sole discretion and shall be final and binding on all persons having or claiming any interest in the Plan or in any Award.
Administration by Board of Directors
(b) . To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Board may delegate any or all of its powers under the Plan to one or more committees or subcommittees of the Board (a "Committee"). All references in the Plan to the "Board" shall mean the Board or a Committee of the Board to the extent that the Board's powers or authority under the Plan have been delegated to such Committee.
Appointment of Committees
4.
Stock Available for Awards
(a) .
Number of Shares; Share Counting
(1) . Subject to adjustment under Section 10, Awards may be made under the Plan for up to 1,600,000 shares of common stock, $.05 par value per share, of the Company (the "Common Stock"), any or all of which Awards may be in the form of Incentive Stock Options (as defined in Section 5(b)).
Authorized Number of Shares
(2) . Subject to adjustment under Section 10, any Award that is not a Full-Value Award shall be counted against the share limits specified in Section 4(a)(1) as one share for each share of Common Stock subject to such Award and any Award that is a Full-Value Award shall be counted against the share limit specified in Section 4(a)(1) as 1.66 shares for each one share of Common Stock subject to such Full-Value Award. "Full-Value Award" means any Restricted Stock Award or Other Stock-Based Award with a per share price or per unit purchase price lower than 100% of Fair Market Value (as defined in Section 5(c)) on the date of grant. To the extent a share that was subject to an Award that counted as one share is returned to the Plan pursuant to Section 4(a)(3), each applicable share reserve will be credited with one share. To the extent that a share that was subject to an Award that counts as 1.66 shares is returned to the Plan pursuant to Section 4(a)(3), each applicable share reserve will be credited with 1.66 shares.
Fungible Share Pool
(3) . For purposes of counting the number of shares available for the grant of Awards under the Plan and under the sublimit contained in Section 4(b):
Share Counting
(A) all shares of Common Stock covered by an SAR shall be counted against the number of shares available for the grant of Awards under the Plan and against the sublimit in Section 4(b); provided, however, that SARs that may be settled only in cash shall not be so counted;
(B) if any Award (i) expires or is terminated, surrendered or canceled without having been fully exercised or is forfeited in whole or in part (including as the result of shares of Common Stock subject to such Award being repurchased by the Company at the original issuance price pursuant to a contractual repurchase right) or (ii) results in any Common Stock not being issued (including as a result of an independent SAR that was settleable either in cash or in stock actually being settled in cash), the unused Common Stock covered by such Award shall again be available for the grant of Awards; provided, however, in the case of Incentive Stock Options, the foregoing shall be subject to any limitations under the Code; and provided further, in the case of the exercise of an independent SAR, the number of shares counted against the shares available under the Plan and against the sublimit in Section 4(b) shall be the full number of shares subject to the SAR multiplied by the percentage of the SAR actually exercised, regardless of the number of shares actually used to settle such SAR upon exercise;
(C) shares of Common Stock delivered (either by actual delivery, attestation, or net exercise) to the Company by a Participant to (i) purchase shares of Common Stock upon the exercise of an Award or (ii) satisfy tax withholding obligations (including shares retained from the Award creating the tax obligation) shall not be added back to the number of shares available for the future grant of Awards; and
(D) shares of Common Stock repurchased by the Company on the open market using the proceeds from the exercise of an Award shall not increase the number of shares available for future grant of Awards.
(b) . Subject to adjustment under Section 10, the maximum number of shares of Common Stock with respect to which Awards may be granted to any Participant under the Plan shall be 150,000 per fiscal year. For purposes of the foregoing limit, the combination of an Option in tandem with an SAR shall be treated as a single Award. The per Participant limit described in this Section 4(b) shall be construed and applied consistently with Section 162(m) of the Code or any successor provision thereto, and the regulations thereunder ("Section 162(m)").
Section 162(m) Per-Participant Limit
(c) . In connection with a merger or consolidation of an entity with the Company or the acquisition by the Company of property or stock of an entity, the Board may grant Awards in substitution for any options or other stock or stock-based awards granted by such entity or an affiliate thereof. Substitute Awards may be granted on such terms as the Board deems appropriate in the circumstances, notwithstanding any limitations on Awards contained in the Plan. Substitute Awards shall not count against the overall share limit set forth in Section 4(a)(1) or any sublimits contained in the Plan, except as may be required by reason of Section 422 and related provisions of the Code.
Substitute Awards
5.
Stock Options
(a) . The Board may grant options to purchase Common Stock (each, an "Option") and determine the number of shares of Common Stock to be covered by each Option, the exercise price of each Option and the conditions and limitations applicable to the exercise of each Option, including conditions relating to applicable federal or state securities laws, as it considers necessary or advisable.
General
(b) . An Option that the Board intends to be an "incentive stock option" as defined in Section 422 of the Code (an "Incentive Stock Option") shall only be granted to employees of Analogic Corporation, any of Analogic Corporation's present or future parent or subsidiary corporations as defined in Sections 424(e) or (f) of the Code, and any other entities the employees of which are eligible to receive Incentive Stock Options under the Code, and shall be subject to the additional conditions and requirements of Section 422 of the Code and shall be construed consistently with the requirements of Section 422 of the Code. An Option that is not intended to be an Incentive Stock Option shall be designated a "Nonstatutory Stock Option." The Company shall have no liability to a Participant, or any other party, if an Option (or any part thereof) that is intended to be an Incentive Stock Option is not an Incentive Stock Option or if the Company converts an Incentive Stock Option to a Nonstatutory Stock Option.
Incentive Stock Options
(c) . The Board shall establish the exercise price of each Option and specify the exercise price in the applicable Option agreement. The exercise price shall be not less than 100% of the fair market value as determined by (or in a manner approved by) the Board ("Fair Market Value") on the date the Option is granted; provided that if the Board approves the grant of an Option effective as of a future date, the exercise price shall be not less than 100% of the Fair Market Value on such future date.
Exercise Price
(d) . No Option that vests solely based on the passage of time shall vest earlier than the first anniversary of its date of grant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board, either at the time an Option is granted or at any time thereafter, may allow an Option to accelerate and become vested, in whole or in part, prior to the first anniversary of its date of grant, in the event of a Change in Control Event (as defined in Section 10(c)(1)), the death or disability of the Participant, or the termination of the Participant's employment by or service to the Company under circumstances specified in the Award agreement.
Minimum Vesting
(e) . Each Option shall be exercisable at such times and subject to such terms and conditions as the Board may specify in the applicable option agreement; provided, however, that no Option shall be granted with a term in excess of 10 years.
Duration of Options
(f) . Options may be exercised by delivery to the Company of a notice of exercise in a form (which may be in electronic form) approved by the Company, together with payment in full (in the manner specified in Section 5(g)) of the exercise price for the number of shares for which the Option is exercised. Shares of Common Stock subject to the Option will be delivered by the Company as soon as practicable following exercise.
Exercise of Options
(g) . Common Stock purchased upon the exercise of an Option granted under the Plan shall be paid for as follows:
Payment Upon Exercise
(1) in cash or by check, payable to the order of the Company;
(2) except as may otherwise be provided in the applicable Option agreement or approved by the Board, in its sole discretion, by (i) delivery of an irrevocable and unconditional undertaking by a creditworthy broker to deliver promptly to the Company sufficient funds to pay the exercise price and any required tax withholding or (ii) delivery by the Participant to the Company of a copy of irrevocable and unconditional instructions to a creditworthy broker to deliver promptly to the Company cash or a check sufficient to pay the exercise price and any required tax withholding;
(3) to the extent provided for in the applicable Option agreement or approved by the Board, in its sole discretion, by delivery (either by actual delivery or attestation) of shares of Common Stock owned by the Participant valued at their Fair Market Value, provided (i) such method of payment is then permitted under applicable law, (ii) such Common Stock, if acquired directly from the Company, was owned by the Participant for such minimum period of time, if any, as may be established by the Board in its discretion and (iii) such Common Stock is not subject to any repurchase, forfeiture, unfulfilled vesting or other similar requirements;
(4) to the extent provided for in the applicable Nonstatutory Stock Option agreement or approved by the Board, in its sole discretion, by delivery of a notice of "net exercise" to the Company, as a result of which the Participant would pay the exercise price for the portion of the Option being exercised by cancelling a portion of the Option for such number of shares as is equal to the exercise price divided by the excess of the Fair Market Value on the date of exercise over the Option exercise price per share.
(5) to the extent permitted by applicable law and provided for in the applicable Option agreement or approved by the Board, in its sole discretion, by payment of such other lawful consideration as the Board may determine; or
(6) by any combination of the above permitted forms of payment.
(h) . Unless such action is approved by the Company's stockholders: (1) no outstanding Option granted under the Plan may be amended to provide an exercise price per share that is lower than the then-current exercise price per share of such outstanding Option (other than adjustments pursuant to Section 10) and (2) the Board may not cancel any outstanding option (whether or not granted under the Plan) and grant in substitution therefor new Awards under the Plan (other than Awards granted pursuant to Section 4(c)) covering the same or a different number of shares of Common Stock and having an exercise price per share lower than the then-current exercise price per share of the cancelled option, or take any other action under the Plan that constitutes a "repricing" within the meaning of the rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market ("NASDAQ").
Limitation on Repricing
6.
Stock Appreciation Rights
(a) . The Board may grant Awards consisting of stock appreciation rights ("SARs") entitling the holder, upon exercise, to receive an amount of Common Stock or cash or a combination thereof (such form to be determined by the Board) determined by reference to appreciation, from and after the date of grant, in the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock over the measurement price established pursuant to Section 6(b). The date as of which such appreciation is determined shall be the exercise date.
General
(b) . The Board shall establish the measurement price of each SAR and specify it in the applicable SAR agreement. The measurement price shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value on the date the SAR is granted; provided that if the Board approves the grant of a SAR effective as of a future date, the measurement price shall be not less than 100% of the Fair Market Value on such future date.
Measurement Price
(c) . Each SAR shall be exercisable at such times and subject to such terms and conditions as the Board may specify in the applicable SAR agreement; provided, however, that no SAR will be granted with a term in excess of 10 years.
Exercisability and Duration of SARs
(d) . SARs may be exercised by delivery to the Company of a notice of exercise in a form (which may be in electronic form) approved by the Company, together with any other documents required by the Board.
Exercise of SARs
(e) . Unless such action is approved by the Company's stockholders: (1) no outstanding SAR granted under the Plan may be amended to provide an exercise price per share that is lower than the then-current exercise price per share of such outstanding SAR (other than adjustments pursuant to Section 10) and (2) the Board may not cancel any outstanding SAR (whether or not granted under the Plan) and grant in substitution therefor new Awards under the Plan (other than Awards granted pursuant to Section 4(c)) covering the same or a different number of shares of Common Stock and having an exercise price per share lower than the then-current exercise price per share of the cancelled SAR, or take any other action under the Plan that constitutes a "repricing" within the meaning of the rules of NASDAQ.
Limitation on Repricing
7.
Restricted Stock; Restricted Stock Units
(a) . The Board may grant Awards entitling recipients to acquire shares of Common Stock ("Restricted Stock"), subject to the right of the Company to repurchase all or part of such shares at their issue price or other stated or formula price (or to require forfeiture of such shares if issued at no cost) from the recipient in the event that conditions specified by the Board in the applicable Award are not satisfied prior to the end of the applicable restriction period or periods established by the Board for such Award. The Board may also grant Awards entitling the recipient to receive shares of Common Stock or cash to be delivered at the time such Award vests ("Restricted Stock Units") (such grants of Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units are each referred to herein as a "Restricted Stock Award").

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board may, either at the time a Restricted Stock Award is made or at any time thereafter, waive its right to repurchase shares of Common Stock (or waive the forfeiture thereof) or remove or modify the restrictions applicable to the Restricted Stock Award, in whole or in part, prior to the first anniversary of its date of grant, in the event of a Change in Control Event, the death or disability of the Participant, or the termination of the Participant's employment by or service to the Company under circumstances specified in the Award agreement.
Minimum Vesting
(d) .
Additional Provisions Relating to Restricted Stock
(1) . Participants holding shares of Restricted Stock will be entitled to all ordinary cash dividends paid with respect to such shares, unless otherwise provided in the Restricted Stock agreement. Unless otherwise provided in the Restricted Stock agreement, if any dividends or distributions are paid in shares, or consist of a dividend or distribution to holders of Common Stock other than an ordinary cash dividend, the shares, cash or other property will be subject to the same restrictions on transferability and forfeitability as the shares of Restricted Stock with respect to which they were paid. Each dividend payment will be made no later than the end of the calendar year in which the dividends are paid to stockholders of that class of stock or, if later, the 15th day of the third month following the date the dividends are paid to stockholders of that class of stock.
Dividends
(2) . The Company may require that any stock certificates issued in respect of shares of Restricted Stock, as well as dividends or distributions paid on such Restricted Stock, shall be deposited in escrow, together with a stock power endorsed in blank, with the Company (or its designee). At the expiration of the applicable restriction periods, the Company (or such designee) shall deliver the certificates no longer subject to such restrictions to the Participant or if the Participant has died, to his or her Designated Beneficiary. "Designated Beneficiary" means (i) the beneficiary designated, in a manner determined by the Board, by a Participant to receive amounts due or exercise rights of the Participant in the event of the Participant's death or (ii) in the absence of an effective designation by a Participant, the Participant's estate.
Stock Certificates
(e) .
Additional Provisions Relating to Restricted Stock Units
(1) . Upon the vesting of and/or lapsing of any other restrictions (i.e., settlement) with respect to each Restricted Stock Unit, the Participant shall be entitled to receive from the Company one share of Common Stock or an amount of cash equal to the Fair Market Value of one share of Common Stock, as provided in the applicable Award agreement. The Board may, in its discretion, provide that settlement of Restricted Stock Units shall be deferred, on a mandatory basis or at the election of the Participant, in a manner that complies with Section 409A of the Code.
Settlement
(2) . A Participant shall have no voting rights with respect to any Restricted Stock Units.
Voting Rights
(3) . To the extent provided by the Board, in its sole discretion, a grant of Restricted Stock Units may provide Participants with the right to receive an amount equal to any dividends or other distributions declared and paid on an equal number of outstanding shares of Common Stock ("Dividend Equivalents"). Dividend Equivalents may be paid currently or credited to an account for the Participant, may be settled in cash and/or shares of Common Stock and may be subject to the same restrictions on transfer and forfeitability as the Restricted Stock Units with respect to which paid, as determined by the Board in its sole discretion, subject in each case to such terms and conditions as the Board shall establish, in each case to be set forth in the applicable Award agreement.
Dividend Equivalents

Other Stock-Based Awards
(a) . Other Awards of shares of Common Stock, and other Awards that are valued in whole or in part by reference to, or are otherwise based on, shares of Common Stock or other property, may be granted hereunder to Participants ("Other Stock-Based-Awards"), including without limitation Awards entitling recipients to receive shares of Common Stock to be delivered in the future. Such Other Stock-Based Awards shall also be available as a form of payment in the settlement of other Awards granted under the Plan or as payment in lieu of compensation to which a Participant is otherwise entitled. Other Stock-Based Awards may be paid in shares of Common Stock or cash, as the Board shall determine.
General
(b) . Subject to Section 8(c) and the other provisions of the Plan, the Board shall determine the terms and conditions of each Other Stock-Based Award, including any purchase price applicable thereto.
Terms and Conditions
(c) . No Other Stock-Based Award shall vest earlier than the first anniversary of its date of grant, unless the Award is granted in lieu of salary, bonus or other compensation otherwise earned by or payable to the Participant or vests based on performance conditions rather than continuous employment by or service to the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board, either at the time an Other Stock-Based Award is granted or at any time thereafter, may allow such Award to accelerate and become vested, in whole or in part, prior to the first anniversary of its date of grant, in the event of a Change in Control Event, the death or disability of the Participant, or the termination of the Participant's employment by or service to the Company under circumstances specified in the Award agreement.
Minimum Vesting
9.
Performance Awards
(a) . Restricted Stock Awards and Other Stock-Based Awards under the Plan may be made subject to the achievement of performance goals pursuant to this Section 9 ("Performance Awards").
Grants
(b) . Grants of Performance Awards to any Covered Employee (as defined below) intended to qualify as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) ("Performance-Based Compensation") shall be made only by a Committee comprised solely of two or more directors eligible to serve on a committee making Awards qualifying as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m). In the case of such Awards granted to Covered Employees, references to the Board or to a Committee shall be treated as referring to such Committee. "Covered Employee" shall mean any person who is, or whom the Committee, in its discretion, determines may be, a "covered employee" under Section 162(m)(3) of the Code.
Committee
(c) . For any Award that is intended to qualify as Performance-Based Compensation, the Committee shall specify that the degree of granting, vesting and/or payout shall be subject to the achievement of one or more objective performance measures established by the Committee, which shall be based on the relative or absolute attainment of specified levels of one or any combination of the following: revenue; revenue growth; return on capital; total shareholder return; stock price performance; cash flow; earnings per share; return on equity; return on assets or net assets; net income; operating income; earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and/or amortization; operating margin or profit margin; return on operating revenue; return on invested capital; market share; product development or product release schedules; new product innovation; product or other cost reductions; brand recognition/acceptance; product ship targets; sales of assets or subsidiaries; or customer satisfaction levels. Such goals may reflect absolute entity or business unit performance or a relative comparison to the performance of a peer group of entities or other external measure of the selected performance criteria and may be absolute in their terms or measured against or in relationship to other companies comparably, similarly or otherwise situated. The Committee may specify that such performance measures shall be adjusted to exclude any one or more of (i) extraordinary items, (ii) gains or losses on the dispositions of discontinued operations, (iii) the cumulative effects of changes in accounting principles, (iv) the writedown of any asset, and (v) charges for restructuring and rationalization programs. Such performance measures: (i) may vary by Participant and may be different for different Awards; (ii) may be particular to a Participant or the department, branch, line of business, subsidiary or other unit in which the Participant works and may cover such period as may be specified by the Committee; and (iii) shall be set by the Committee within the time period prescribed by, and shall otherwise comply with the requirements of, Section 162(m). Awards that are not intended to qualify as Performance-Based Compensation may be based on these or such other performance measures as the Board may determine.
Performance Measures
(d) . Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan, with respect to any Performance Award that is intended to qualify as Performance-Based Compensation, the Committee may adjust downwards, but not upwards, the number of shares payable pursuant to such Award, and the Committee may not waive the achievement of the applicable performance measures except in the case of the death or disability of the Participant or a Change in Control Event.
Adjustments
(e) . The Committee shall have the power to impose such other restrictions on Performance Awards as it may deem necessary or appropriate to ensure that such Awards satisfy all requirements for Performance-Based Compensation.
Other
10.
Adjustments for Changes in Common Stock and Certain Other Events
(a) . In the event of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, combination of shares, reclassification of shares, spin-off or other similar change in capitalization or event, or any dividend or distribution to holders of Common Stock other than an ordinary cash dividend, (i) the number and class of securities available under the Plan, (ii) the share counting rules and sublimit set forth in Sections 4(a) and 4(b), (iii) the number and class of securities and exercise price per share of each outstanding Option, (iv) the share and per-share provisions and the measurement price of each outstanding SAR, (v) the number of shares subject to and the repurchase price per share subject to each outstanding Restricted Stock Award and (vi) the share and per share-related provisions and the purchase price, if any, of each outstanding Other Stock-Based Award, shall be equitably adjusted by the Company (or substituted Awards may be made, if applicable) in the manner determined by the Board. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event the Company effects a split of the Common Stock by means of a stock dividend and the exercise price of and the number of shares subject to an outstanding Option are adjusted as of the date of the distribution of the dividend (rather than as of the record date for such dividend), then an optionee who exercises an Option between the record date and the distribution date for such stock dividend shall be entitled to receive, on the distribution date, the stock dividend with respect to the shares of Common Stock acquired upon such Option exercise, notwithstanding the fact that such shares were not outstanding as of the close of business on the record date for such stock dividend.
Changes in Capitalization
(b) .
Reorganization Events
(1) . A "Reorganization Event" shall mean: (a) any merger or consolidation of the Company with or into another entity as a result of which all of the Common Stock of the Company is converted into or exchanged for the right to receive cash, securities or other property or is cancelled, (b) any transfer or disposition of all of the Common Stock of the Company for cash, securities or other property pursuant to a share exchange or other transaction or (c) any liquidation or dissolution of the Company.
Definition
(2) . In connection with a Reorganization Event, the Board may take any one or more of the following actions as to all or any (or any portion of) outstanding Awards other than Restricted Stock on such terms as the Board determines: (i) provide that Awards shall be assumed, or substantially equivalent Awards shall be substituted, by the acquiring or succeeding corporation (or an affiliate thereof), (ii) upon written notice to a Participant, provide that all of the Participant's unexercised Awards will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such Reorganization Event unless exercised by the Participant (to the extent then exercisable) within a specified period following the date of such notice, (iii) provide that outstanding Awards shall become exercisable, realizable, or deliverable, or restrictions applicable to an Award shall lapse, in whole or in part prior to or upon such Reorganization Event, (iv) in the event of a Reorganization Event under the terms of which holders of Common Stock will receive upon consummation thereof a cash payment for each share surrendered in the Reorganization Event (the "Acquisition Price"), make or provide for a cash payment to Participants with respect to each Award held by a Participant equal to (A) the number of shares of Common Stock subject to the vested portion of the Award (after giving effect to any acceleration of vesting that occurs upon or immediately prior to such Reorganization Event) multiplied by (B) the excess, if any, of (I) the Acquisition Price over (II) the exercise or purchase price of such Award and any applicable tax withholdings, in exchange for the termination of such Award, (v) provide that, in connection with a liquidation or dissolution of the Company, Awards shall convert into the right to receive liquidation proceeds (if applicable, net of the exercise or purchase price thereof and any applicable tax withholdings) and (vi) any combination of the foregoing. In taking any of the actions permitted under this Section 10(b), the Board shall not be obligated by the Plan to treat all Awards, all Awards held by a Participant, or all Awards of the same type, identically.
Consequences of a Reorganization Event on Awards Other than Restricted Stock Awards
For purposes of clause (i) above, an Option shall be considered assumed if, following consummation of the Reorganization Event, the Option confers the right to purchase, for each share of Common Stock subject to the Option immediately prior to the consummation of the Reorganization Event, the consideration (whether cash, securities or other property) received as a result of the Reorganization Event by holders of Common Stock for each share of Common Stock held immediately prior to the consummation of the Reorganization Event (and if holders were offered a choice of consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock); provided, however, that if the consideration received as a result of the Reorganization Event is not solely common stock of the acquiring or succeeding corporation (or an affiliate thereof), the Company may, with the consent of the acquiring or succeeding corporation, provide for the consideration to be received upon the exercise of Options to consist solely of common stock of the acquiring or succeeding corporation (or an affiliate thereof) equivalent in value (as determined by the Board) to the per share consideration received by holders of outstanding shares of Common Stock as a result of the Reorganization Event.
(3) . Upon the occurrence of a Reorganization Event other than a liquidation or dissolution of the Company, the repurchase and other rights of the Company with respect to outstanding Restricted Stock shall inure to the benefit of the Company's successor and shall, unless the Board determines otherwise, apply to the cash, securities or other property which the Common Stock was converted into or exchanged for pursuant to such Reorganization Event in the same manner and to the same extent as they applied to such Restricted Stock; provided, however, that the Board may provide for termination or deemed satisfaction of such repurchase or other rights under the instrument evidencing any Restricted Stock or any other agreement between a Participant and the Company, either initially or by amendment. Upon the occurrence of a Reorganization Event involving the liquidation or dissolution of the Company, except to the extent specifically provided to the contrary in the instrument evidencing any Restricted Stock or any other agreement between a Participant and the Company, all restrictions and conditions on all Restricted Stock then outstanding shall automatically be deemed terminated or satisfied.
Consequences of a Reorganization Event on Restricted Stock
(c) .
Acceleration Upon a Change in Control Event
(1) . A "Change in Control Event" shall mean:
Definition
(A) any merger or consolidation in which (i) the Company is a constituent party or (ii) a subsidiary of the Company is a constituent party and the Company issues shares of its capital stock pursuant to such merger or consolidation (except, in the case of both clauses (i) and (ii) above, any such merger or consolidation involving the Company or a subsidiary in which the shares of capital stock of the Company outstanding immediately prior to such merger or consolidation continue to represent, or are converted into or exchanged for shares of capital stock that represent, immediately following such merger or consolidation, at least 51% by voting power of the capital stock of (x) the surviving or resulting corporation or (y) if the surviving or resulting corporation is a wholly owned subsidiary of another corporation immediately following such merger or consolidation, of the parent corporation of such surviving or resulting corporation);
(B) the issuance, sale or transfer, in a single transaction or series of related transactions, of capital stock representing at least 51% of the voting power of the outstanding capital stock of the Company immediately following such transaction;
(C) the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company; or
(D) a change in the composition of the Board that results in the Continuing Directors (as defined below) no longer constituting a majority of the Board (or, if applicable, the Board of Directors of a successor corporation to the Company), where the term "Continuing Director" means at any date a member of the Board (x) who was a member of the Board on the date of the initial adoption of the Plan by the Board or (y) who was nominated or elected subsequent to such date by at least a majority of the directors who were Continuing Directors at the time of such nomination or election or whose election to the Board was recommended or endorsed by at least a majority of the directors who were Continuing Directors at the time of such nomination or election; provided, however, that there shall be excluded from this clause (y) any individual whose initial assumption of office occurred as a result of an actual or threatened election contest with respect to the election or removal of directors or other actual or threatened solicitation of proxies or consents, by or on behalf of a person other than the Board.
(2) . The agreement evidencing any Award under the Plan may provide that the Award shall become immediately exercisable in whole or in part, free of some or all restrictions or conditions, or otherwise realizable in whole or in part, as the case may be, effective immediately prior to a Change in Control Event.
Effect on Awards
11.
General Provisions Applicable to Awards
(a) . Awards shall not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise encumbered by the person to whom they are granted, either voluntarily or by operation of law, except by will or the laws of descent and distribution or, other than in the case of an Incentive Stock Option, pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order, and, during the life of the Participant, shall be exercisable only by the Participant; provided, however, that the Board may permit or provide in an Award for the gratuitous transfer of the Award by the Participant to or for the benefit of any immediate family member, family trust or other entity established for the benefit of the Participant and/or an immediate family member thereof if the Company would be eligible to use a Form S-8 under the Securities Act for the registration of the sale of the Common Stock subject to such Award to such proposed transferee; provided further, that the Company shall not be required to recognize any such permitted transfer until such time as such permitted transferee shall, as a condition to such transfer, deliver to the Company a written instrument in form and substance satisfactory to the Company confirming that such transferee shall be bound by all of the terms and conditions of the Award. References to a Participant, to the extent relevant in the context, shall include references to authorized transferees. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing contained in this Section 11(a) shall be deemed to restrict a transfer to the Company.
Transferability of Awards
(b) .
Documentation
(1) Each Award, and (if applicable) the Participant's acceptance thereof, shall be evidenced in such form (written, electronic or otherwise) as the Board shall determine. Each Award may contain terms and conditions in addition to those set forth in the Plan.
(2) The agreement for any Award may include, or provide for the execution of a separate agreement that includes, restrictions on the Participant engaging in competitive activities during, and during a specified period of time following the termination of, such Participant's employment with or service to the Company, and may further provide that should the Company determine that such non-competition covenant has been violated, all or a portion of such Award shall terminate or be forfeited.
(c) . Except as otherwise provided by the Plan, each Award may be made alone or in addition or in relation to any other Award. The terms of each Award need not be identical, and the Board need not treat Participants uniformly.
Board Discretion
(d) . The Board shall determine the effect on an Award of the disability, death, termination or other cessation of employment, authorized leave of absence or other change in the employment or other status of a Participant and the extent to which, and the period during which, the Participant, or the Participant's legal representative, conservator, guardian or Designated Beneficiary, may exercise rights under the Award.
Termination of Status
(e) . The Participant must satisfy all applicable federal, state, and local or other income and employment tax withholding obligations before the Company will deliver stock certificates or otherwise recognize ownership of Common Stock under an Award. The Company may decide to satisfy the withholding obligations through additional withholding on salary or wages. If the Company elects not to or cannot withhold from other compensation, the Participant must pay the Company the full amount, if any, required for withholding or have a broker tender to the Company cash equal to the withholding obligations. Payment of withholding obligations is due before the Company will issue any shares on exercise, vesting or release from forfeiture of an Award or, if the Company so requires, at the same time as payment of the exercise or purchase price, unless the Company determines otherwise. If provided for in an Award or approved by the Board in its sole discretion, a Participant may satisfy such tax obligations in whole or in part by delivery (either by actual delivery or attestation) of shares of Common Stock, including shares retained from the Award creating the tax obligation, valued at their Fair Market Value; provided, however, except as otherwise provided by the Board, that the total tax withholding where stock is being used to satisfy such tax obligations cannot exceed the Company's minimum statutory withholding obligations (based on minimum statutory withholding rates for federal and state tax purposes, including payroll taxes, that are applicable to such supplemental taxable income). Shares used to satisfy tax withholding requirements cannot be subject to any repurchase, forfeiture, unfulfilled vesting or other similar requirements.
Withholding
(f) . Except as otherwise provided in Sections 5(d), 7(c) and 8(c) (with respect to minimum vesting), Sections 5(h) and 6(e) (with respect to repricings), Section 9 (with respect to Performance Awards) and Section 12(d) (with respect to actions requiring stockholder approval), the Board may amend, modify or terminate any outstanding Award, including but not limited to, substituting therefor another Award of the same or a different type, changing the date of exercise or realization, and converting an Incentive Stock Option to a Nonstatutory Stock Option. The Participant's consent to such action shall be required unless (i) the Board determines that the action, taking into account any related action, does not materially and adversely affect the Participant's rights under the Plan or (ii) the change is permitted under Section 10.
Amendment of Award
(g) . The Company will not be obligated to deliver any shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Plan or to remove restrictions from shares previously issued or delivered under the Plan until (i) all conditions of the Award have been met or removed to the satisfaction of the Company, (ii) in the opinion of the Company's counsel, all other legal matters in connection with the issuance and delivery of such shares have been satisfied, including any applicable securities laws and regulations and any applicable stock exchange or stock market rules and regulations, and (iii) the Participant has executed and delivered to the Company such representations or agreements as the Company may consider appropriate to satisfy the requirements of any applicable laws, rules or regulations.
Conditions on Delivery of Stock
(h) . Except as otherwise provided in Sections 5(d), 7(c) and 8(c) (with respect to minimum vesting) and Section 9 (with respect to Performance Awards), the Board may at any time provide that any Award shall become immediately exercisable in whole or in part, free of some or all restrictions or conditions, or otherwise realizable in whole or in part, as the case may be.
Acceleration
12.
Miscellaneous
(a) . No person shall have any claim or right to be granted an Award by virtue of the adoption of the Plan, and the grant of an Award shall not be construed as giving a Participant the right to continued employment or any other relationship with the Company. The Company expressly reserves the right at any time to dismiss or otherwise terminate its relationship with a Participant free from any liability or claim under the Plan, except as expressly provided in the applicable Award.
No Right To Employment or Other Status
(b) . Subject to the provisions of the applicable Award, no Participant or Designated Beneficiary shall have any rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares of Common Stock to be distributed with respect to an Award until becoming the record holder of such shares.
No Rights As Stockholder
(c) . The Plan shall become effective on the date the Plan is approved by the Company's stockholders (the "Effective Date"). Awards may be granted under the Plan prior to such stockholder approval, provided such Awards are specifically contingent upon the obtaining of such stockholder approval. No Awards shall be granted under the Plan after the expiration of 10 years from the Effective Date, but Awards previously granted may extend beyond that date.
Effective Date and Term of Plan
(d) . The Board may amend, suspend or terminate the Plan or any portion thereof at any time, provided that (i) no amendment that would require stockholder approval under the rules of NASDAQ may be made effective unless and until the Company's stockholders approve such amendment; and (ii) if NASDAQ amends its corporate governance rules so that such rules no longer require stockholder approval of material amendments to equity compensation plans, then, from and after the effective date of such amendment to the NASDAQ rules, no amendment to the Plan (A) materially increasing the number of shares authorized under the Plan (other than pursuant to Section 4(c) or 10), (B) expanding the types of Awards that may be granted under the Plan, or (C) materially expanding the class of participants eligible to participate in the Plan shall be effective unless and until the Company's stockholders approve such amendment. In addition, if at any time the approval of the Company's stockholders is required as to any other modification or amendment under Section 422 of the Code or any successor provision with respect to Incentive Stock Options, the Board may not effect such modification or amendment without such approval. Unless otherwise specified in the amendment, any amendment to the Plan adopted in accordance with this Section 12(d) shall apply to, and be binding on the holders of, all Awards outstanding under the Plan at the time the amendment is adopted, provided the Board determines that such amendment, taking into account any related action, does not materially and adversely affect the rights of Participants under the Plan. Awards may be made that are conditioned upon stockholder approval of any amendment to the Plan.
Amendment of Plan
(e) . The Board may from time to time establish one or more sub-plans under the Plan for purposes of satisfying applicable securities, tax or other laws of various jurisdictions. The Board shall establish such sub-plans by adopting supplements to the Plan containing (i) such limitations on the Board's discretion under the Plan as the Board deems necessary or desirable or (ii) such additional terms and conditions not otherwise inconsistent with the Plan as the Board shall deem necessary or desirable. All supplements adopted by the Board shall be deemed to be part of the Plan, but each supplement shall apply only to Participants within the affected jurisdiction and the Company shall not be required to provide copies of any supplement to Participants in any jurisdiction which is not the subject of such supplement.
Authorization of Sub-Plans
(f) . Except as provided in individual Award agreements initially or by amendment, if and to the extent any portion of any payment, compensation or other benefit provided to a Participant in connection with his or her employment termination is determined to constitute "nonqualified deferred compensation" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and the Participant is a specified employee as defined in Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, as determined by the Company in accordance with its procedures, by which determination the Participant (through accepting the Award) agrees that he or she is bound, such portion of the payment, compensation or other benefit shall not be paid before the day that is six months plus one day after the date of "separation from service" (as determined under Section 409A of the Code) (the "New Payment Date"), except as Section 409A of the Code may then permit. The aggregate of any payments that otherwise would have been paid to the Participant during the period between the date of separation from service and the New Payment Date shall be paid to the Participant in a lump sum on such New Payment Date, and any remaining payments will be paid on their original schedule. The Company makes no representations or warranty and shall have no liability to the Participant or any other person if any provisions of or payments, compensation or other benefits under the Plan are determined to constitute nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code but do not to satisfy the conditions of that section.
Compliance with Section 409A of the Code
(g) . Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan, no individual acting as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company will be liable to any Participant, former Participant, spouse, beneficiary, or any other person for any claim, loss, liability, or expense incurred in connection with the Plan, nor will such individual be personally liable with respect to the Plan because of any contract or other instrument he or she executes in his or her capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company. The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each director, officer, employee or agent of the Company to whom any duty or power relating to the administration or interpretation of the Plan has been or will be delegated, against any cost or expense (including attorneys' fees) or liability (including any sum paid in settlement of a claim with the Board's approval) arising out of any act or omission to act concerning the Plan unless arising out of such person's own fraud or bad faith.
Limitations on Liability
(h) . The provisions of the Plan and all Awards made hereunder shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, excluding choice-of-law principles of the law of any state that would require the application of the laws of a jurisdiction other than the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

PEABODY, MA (March 9, 2010)  Analogic Corporation (NASDAQ: ALOG), a leading designer and manufacturer of high-precision medical and security imaging equipment, today announced results for its second quarter ended January 31, 2010.
Highlights during the second quarter included:
 
 
 
 
Revenues for the second fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2010, were $103.3 million, compared with first quarter revenues of $95.4 million and the prior fiscal year's second quarter revenues of $102.7 million. Income from operations for the second quarter of fiscal 2010 was $5.0 million compared with breakeven results in the first quarter of fiscal 2010, and a loss of ($1.5) million in the prior year's second quarter. Reported net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2010 was $3.6 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, compared with $26,000, or $0.00 per diluted share, in the first quarter of fiscal 2010, and $1.4 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, for the prior year's second quarter.
On an adjusted, non-GAAP basis, income from operations for the second quarter of fiscal 2010 was $7.8 million compared with $1.9 million in the first quarter and $3.8 million in the prior year's second quarter. Adjusted non-GAAP net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2010 was $5.5 million, or $0.43 per diluted share, compared with $1.3 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, in the first quarter of fiscal 2010, and $3.4 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, for the prior year's second quarter. A reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted non-GAAP results is included as an attachment to this press release.
Jim Green, president and CEO, commented, "The results of the second quarter improved sequentially as we continue to see stabilization in our medical technology business and a return to more typical revenue run rates in our security business. We are pleased to see the improving operating margins, reflecting our focus on cost containment while continuing to drive revenue growth. We remain committed to driving operating efficiencies, continued profitability and positive cash flows."
Segment Revenues
Revenues from our CT and MRI segment were $55.3 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2010, down $2.4 million from the first quarter and down $6.5 million over the prior year's second quarter. Revenues during the second quarter decreased, from the first quarter of fiscal 2010, primarily reflecting lower customer-funded R&D efforts during the period and decreased, as compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2009, reflecting the global economic slowdown.
Digital Radiography revenues were $8.6 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2010, up $0.4 million from the first quarter and up $1.8 million over the prior year's second quarter. Demand for our Selenium-based digital detector plates continues to grow as sales of digital mammography systems increase outside the U.S.
Our Specialized Ultrasound segment generated revenues of $24.8 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2010, up $4.8 million from the first quarter and up $4.0 million from the prior year's second quarter. Revenues during the second quarter increased, as compared with the first quarter of 2010, reflecting seasonality and continued market adoption of the Flex Focus
TM
and Pro Focus
TM
UltraView systems. Revenues increased during the second quarter as compared with last year due primarily to increased penetration of new products.
Security Technology revenues were $12.8 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2010, up $5.9 million from the first quarter and up $1.6 million from the prior year's second quarter. During the quarter, we received $17 million in orders from L-3 Communications, including purchases of eXaminer 3DX Explosives Detection Systems (EDSs) and eXaminer XLB, as well as funding for upgrades to the full suite of eXaminer EDSs to meet U.S. and international certification standards.

UNAUDITED SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATIONRECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP MEASURES
We provide adjusted non-GAAP gross margin, adjusted non-GAAP operating expenses, adjusted non-GAAP income from operations, adjusted non-GAAP income before income taxes, adjusted non-GAAP net income, and adjusted non-GAAP diluted earnings per share as supplemental measures to GAAP regarding our operational performance. These financial measures exclude the impact of certain items and, therefore, have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. The adjustments to these non-GAAP financial measures, and the basis for such adjustments, are outlined below:
We incur expense related to share-based compensation included in the GAAP presentation of cost of sales, research and development, selling and marketing, general and administrative expense. Although share-based compensation is an expense and viewed as a form of compensation, these expenses vary in amount from period to period, and are affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within our control, such as the market price and volatility of our shares, risk-free interest rates, and the expected term and forfeiture rates of the awards. Share-based compensation expense is calculated as of the grant date of each share-based award, and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the grant date. Our management team believes that exclusion of these expenses allows comparisons of operating results that are consistent between periods and allows comparisons of our operating results to those of other companies that disclose adjusted non-GAAP financial measures that exclude share-based compensation.
Share-based compensation expense.
We incur amortization of intangibles and other expenses related to acquisitions it has made in recent years. The intangible assets are valued at the time of acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed after the acquisition. We believe that exclusion of these expenses allows comparisons of operating results that are consistent over time for both our newly acquired and long-held businesses.
Acquisition related expenses.
We continuously strive to improve the company's operating efficiency. During the three months ended January 31, 2010, we reduced our work force by 17 employees worldwide. The total cost,
Restructuring charges.
including severance and personnel related costs, was $764,000 and was recorded as an operating expense during the three months ended January 31, 2010. During the three months ended January 31, 2009, we reduced our work force by 145 employees or approximately 9% worldwide. The total cost of these activities was $3,811,000 of which $3,488,000 was recorded as an operating expense during the three months ended January 31, 2009. An additional $323,000 was charged against restructuring accrual previously recorded as part of the Copley acquisition. We believe that the exclusion of these expenses allows for comparisons of operating results that are consistent over time.
For purposes of calculating adjusted non-GAAP net income and adjusted non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, we adjust the provision (benefit) for income taxes to tax effect the non-GAAP adjustments described above as they have a significant impact on our income tax provision (benefit). In addition, from time-to-time, we recognize certain non-recurring tax adjustments. In the three months ended January 31, 2009, we recorded $1,729,000 of discrete tax benefits of which $1,232,000 related to an income tax refund for R&D tax credits and $497,000 related the settlement of an income tax audit.
Taxes.
We exclude the above-described expenses, their related tax impact and other non-recurring tax benefits in evaluating short-term and long-term operating trends in our operations, and allocating resources to various initiatives and operational requirements. We believe that these adjusted non-GAAP financial adjustments are useful to investors because they allow investors to evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making.
These adjusted non-GAAP financial measures have not been prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information provided in accordance with GAAP. Further, these adjusted non-GAAP financial measures may not be computed in the same manner as similarly titled measures used by other companies.
The following table reconciles the adjusted non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.

PEABODY, MA (April 29, 2010)  Analogic Corporation (NASDAQ: ALOG), a leading provider of medical imaging and aviation security technology, announced that it has combined the leadership of its OEM Medical businesses, linking its digital mammography detector business with its Peabody-based CT and MRI business. Effective May 1, Mervat Faltas will assume the role of senior vice president and general manager of the newly combined business unit reporting to Jim Green, president and CEO. Mervat was previously president of Analogic's ANRAD subsidiary, a leading developer and manufacturer of Selenium-based X-ray detector plates for digital mammography systems.
Mervat joined ANRAD in 2005 as vice president of operations and was named president in 2006. She successfully transitioned the business from general radiography to the high-growth digital mammography detector market, generating positive operating margins for six consecutive quarters. Prior to joining ANRAD, Mervat served as president and CEO of ITF Optical Technologies, a designer and manufacturer of advanced photonics solutions. While at ITF Optical, she also held positions as chief operating officer, senior vice president of R&D, and vice president of manufacturing support, developing the long-term strategic direction for the company, and focusing on operational improvements. While at EG&G/PerkinElmer and, before that, General Electric, she held various operations management positions focused on improving profitability through implementing manufacturing efficiencies. Mervat holds a bachelor of science degree in chemistry/physics from the American University in Cairo.
Peter Howard, who previously ran the CT and MRI OEM Medical business, has played a key role in new business development and will now focus on exploring new opportunities for applications of our technologies, and on newly developing markets.
Jim Green commented, "I am confident that this new business structure will better support our OEM customers worldwide. I am delighted to have Mervat Faltas as the leader of this new combined organization. Her talent and experience will be instrumental in improving the business across the board. In addition, I look forward to Peter's continued contribution in his new role."

PEABODY, MA (June 9, 2010)  Analogic Corporation (NASDAQ: ALOG), a leading provider of medical imaging and aviation security technology, today announced results for its third quarter ended April 30, 2010.
Highlights during the third quarter included:
 
 
 
Revenues for the third fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2010, were $107.2 million, compared with second quarter revenues of $103.3 million and the prior fiscal year's third quarter revenues of $93.6 million. Income from operations for the third quarter of fiscal 2010 was $6.2 million compared with $5.0 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2010, and $1.5 million in the prior year's third quarter. Reported net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2010 was $4.8 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, compared with $3.6 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, in the second quarter of fiscal 2010, and $2.3 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, for the prior year's third quarter.
Adjusted non-GAAP income from operations for the third quarter of fiscal 2010 was $8.3 million compared with $7.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2010, and $3.3 million in the prior year's third quarter. Adjusted non-GAAP net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2010 was $6.2 million, or $0.49 per diluted share, compared with $5.5 million, or $0.43 per diluted share, in the second quarter of fiscal 2010, and $3.1 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, for the prior year's third quarter. A reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted non-GAAP results is included as an attachment to this press release.
Jim Green, president and CEO, commented, "We continue to see improvement in our Medical Technology end markets. Our OEM Medical Imaging business performed well this quarter, with revenues growing 22% from last year. I am pleased to see continued penetration of our new Flex Focus family of specialized ultrasound products, as evidenced by 15% year-over-year revenue growth. Our security business remained stable in the quarter and the remainder of the fiscal year looks smooth. In addition to our strong revenue growth, I am also pleased to see continued improvement in overall operating margins as we progress toward our stated goal of double-digit operating margins by fiscal year 2012."
Segment Revenues
Revenues from our CT and MRI segment were $61.1 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2010, up $5.8 million from the second quarter and up $11.1 million from the prior year's third quarter. Revenues increased during the third quarter, reflecting the positive impact on hospital spending as a result of the improving global economy.
Digital Radiography revenues were $10.1 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2010, up $1.5 million from Q2 and down $0.2 million from the prior year's third quarter. The demand for our Selenium-based mammography detectors continues to improve.
Our Specialized Ultrasound segment generated revenues of $22.1 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2010, down $2.7 million from Q2 and up $2.9 million from Q3 of last year. Revenues decreased as compared with Q2 2010 due to normal seasonality as well as $1.0 million unfavorable foreign currency impact in Europe. Revenues increased compared with Q3 2009, which was due to the increasing demand for our Flex Focus family of specialized ultrasound scanners.
Security Technology revenues were $12.2 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2010, down $0.6 million from last quarter and flat from Q3 2009. Revenues were down slightly as compared with Q2 2010 due primarily to slightly lower shipment volume.
Use of Adjusted Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This document includes adjusted non-GAAP financial measures that are not in accordance with, nor an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these adjusted non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles.
Adjusted non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are limited in value because they exclude charges that have a material effect on our reported results and, therefore, should not be relied upon as the sole financial measures to evaluate our financial results. The adjusted non-GAAP financial measures are meant to supplement, and to be viewed in conjunction with, GAAP financial results. An explanation and a reconciliation of our adjusted non-GAAP measures are provided at the end of this press release.
Forward-Looking Statements
Any statements about future expectations, plans, and prospects for the Company, including statements containing the words " believes," " anticipates," " plans," " expects," and similar expressions, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including risks relating to product development and commercialization, limited demand for the Company's products, risks associated with competition, uncertainties associated with regulatory agency approvals, competitive pricing pressures, downturns in the economy, the risk of potential intellectual property litigation, and other factors discussed in our most recent quarterly report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, the forward-looking statements included in this presentation represent the Company's views as of the date of this document. While the Company anticipates that subsequent events and developments will cause the Company's views to change, the Company specifically disclaims any obligation to update these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing the Company's views as of any later date.

UNAUDITED SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION - RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP MEASURES
We provide adjusted non-GAAP gross margin, adjusted non-GAAP operating expenses, adjusted non-GAAP income from operations, adjusted non-GAAP income before income taxes, adjusted non-GAAP net income, and adjusted non-GAAP diluted earnings per share as supplemental measures to GAAP regarding our operational performance. These financial measures exclude the impact of certain items and, therefore, have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. The adjustments to these non-GAAP financial measures, and the basis for such adjustments, are outlined below:
We incur expense related to share-based compensation included in the GAAP presentation of cost of sales, research and development, selling and marketing, general and administrative expense. Although share-based compensation is an expense and viewed as a form of compensation, these expenses vary in amount from period to period, and are affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within our control, such as the market price and volatility of our shares, risk-free interest rates, and the expected term and forfeiture rates of the awards. Share-based compensation expense is calculated as of the grant date of each share-based award, and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the grant date. Our management team believes that exclusion of these expenses allows comparisons of operating results that are consistent between periods and allows comparisons of our operating results to those of other companies that disclose adjusted non-GAAP financial measures that exclude share-based compensation.
Share-based compensation expense.
We incur amortization of intangibles and other expenses related to acquisitions it has made in recent years. The intangible assets are valued at the time of acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed after the acquisition. We believe that exclusion of these expenses allows comparisons of operating results that are consistent over time for both our newly acquired and long-held businesses.
Acquisition related expenses.
We continuously strive to improve the company's operating efficiency. During the three months ended January 31, 2010, we reduced our work force by 17 employees worldwide. The total cost, including severance and personnel related costs, was $764,000 and was recorded as an operating expense during the three months ended January 31, 2010. During the three months ended January 31, 2009, we reduced our work force by 145 employees or approximately 9% worldwide. The total cost of these activities was $3,811,000 of which $3,488,000 was recorded as an operating expense during the three months ended January 31, 2009. An additional $323,000 was charged against restructuring accrual previously recorded as part of the Copley acquisition. We believe that the exclusion of these expenses allows for comparisons of operating results that are consistent over time.
Restructuring charges.
For purposes of calculating adjusted non-GAAP net income and adjusted non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, we adjust the provision (benefit) for income taxes to tax effect the non-GAAP adjustments described above as they have a significant impact on our income tax provision (benefit). In addition, from time-to-time, we recognize certain non-recurring tax adjustments. In the three months ended January 31, 2009, we recorded $1,729,000 of discrete tax benefits of which $1,232,000 related to an income tax refund for R&D tax credits and $497,000 related the settlement of an income tax audit. In the three months ended April 30, 2009, the Company recorded $124,000 related to interest received on a tax refund. As these adjustments do not reflect the underlying performance of the business they have been excluded from Non-GAAP net income.
Taxes.
We exclude the above-described expenses, their related tax impact and other non-recurring tax benefits in evaluating short-term and long-term operating trends in our operations, and allocating resources to various initiatives and operational requirements. We believe that these adjusted non-GAAP financial adjustments are useful to investors because they allow investors to evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making.
These adjusted non-GAAP financial measures have not been prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information provided in accordance with GAAP. Further, these adjusted non-GAAP financial measures may not be computed in the same manner as similarly titled measures used by other companies.
The following table reconciles the adjusted non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.

PEABODY, MA (September 21, 2010)  Analogic Corporation (NASDAQ: ALOG), a leading provider of medical imaging and aviation security technology, today announced results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended July 31, 2010.
Highlights during the fourth quarter included:
 
 
 
 
Revenues for the fourth fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2010, were $117.8 million, compared with third quarter revenues of $107.2 million and the prior fiscal year's fourth quarter revenues of $98.3 million. Income from operations for the fourth quarter was $9.8 million, compared with income of $6.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2010 and a loss of ($2.6) million in the prior year's fourth quarter. Reported net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 was $7.1 million, or $0.56 per diluted share, compared with income of $4.8 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, in the third quarter of fiscal 2010 and a loss of ($0.3) million, or ($0.02) per diluted share, for the prior year's fourth quarter.
On an adjusted non-GAAP basis, income from operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 was $12.5 million, compared with $8.3 million in the third quarter and $1.4 million in the prior year's fourth quarter. Adjusted non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $8.8 million, or $0.69 per diluted share, compared with $6.2 million, or $0.49 per diluted share, in the third quarter of fiscal 2010 and $1.4 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, for the prior year's fourth quarter. A reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted non-GAAP results is included as an attachment to this press release.
For fiscal 2010, revenues were $423.6 million, compared with revenues of $396.1 million in fiscal 2009, up 7%. Reported net income for fiscal year 2010 totaled $15.6 million, or $1.23 per diluted share, as compared with net income of $3.7 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, for fiscal 2009.
"Our fourth quarter results were very strong, rounding out a good fiscal 2010 for Analogic," commented Jim Green, president and CEO. "Our 2010 revenues increased 7% while our operating margins improved to 5%, a
significant improvement from a loss of (1%) in the previous year. With continued overall growth and an ongoing focus on operational effectiveness, I feel confident in our ability to achieve our fiscal 2012 target of double-digit operating margin."
Segment Revenues
Revenues from our CT and MRI segment were $63.4 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, up $2.3 million from the third quarter and up $12.2 million over the prior year's fourth quarter. Revenues in the fourth quarter were up 24% from Q4 2009 due to increased demand for our products as a result of improving market conditions.
Digital Radiography revenues were $9.9 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, down $0.1 million from the third quarter and up $1.5 million over the prior year. The increase in revenues of 18% from Q4 of 2009 was due primarily to increasing demand for our Selenium-based digital mammography plates sold outside of the U.S.
Our Specialized Ultrasound segment revenues were $23.0 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, up $0.9 million from the third quarter and down $0.6 million from the prior year. The slight decline in revenues compared with Q4 of 2009 was primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency effects. In comparison to Q3 of 2010, unfavorable foreign currency effects were offset by normal Q4 seasonal strength and the continued growth of our Flex Focus products.
Security Technology revenues were $18.7 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, up $6.5 million from the third quarter and up $5.9 million from a year earlier. Revenues were up 46% during the fourth quarter versus the prior year, and up 53% from Q3 of 2010 due to strong engineering revenues and shipments of our high- and medium-throughput certified explosives detection systems.

We continuously strive to improve its operating efficiency. During the three months ended January 31, 2010, we reduced our work force by 17 employees worldwide. The total cost, including severance and personnel related costs, was $764,000 and was recorded as an operating expense during the three months ended January 31, 2010.
During the three months ended July 31, 2009, we reduced our workforce by 85 employees or approximately 6% worldwide and vacated 50% of our office facility in Canton, MA on July 31, 2009 as a result of moving certain operations to our Peabody facility. The total cost of these activities was $3,131,000, which was recorded as an operating expense during the three months ended July 31, 2009.
During the three months ended January 31, 2009, we reduced our work force by 145 employees or approximately 9% worldwide. The total cost of these activities was $3,811,000 of which $3,488,000 was recorded as an operating expense during the three months ended January 31, 2009. An additional $323,000 was charged against restructuring accruals previously recorded as part of the Copley acquisition.
Gain on Sale of Other Investments
During the three months ended July 31, 2009, we received $838,000 as the final escrow payment related to the sale of its interest in an investment, which was recorded as other income in the twelve months ended July 31, 2009.
Taxes
For purposes of calculating adjusted non-GAAP net income and adjusted non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, we adjust the provision (benefit) for income taxes to tax effect the non-GAAP adjustments described above as they have a significant impact on our income tax provision (benefit). In addition, from time-to-time, we recognize certain non-recurring tax adjustments. In the three months ended January 31, 2009, we recorded $1,729,000 of discrete tax benefits of which $1,232,000 related to an income tax refund for R&D tax credits and $497,000 related to the settlement of an income tax audit. In the three months ended April 30, 2009, we recorded $124,000 related to interest received on a tax refund. In the three months ended July 31, 2009, we recorded $244,000 for a tax refund and related interest. As these adjustments do not reflect the underlying performance of the business they have been excluded from adjusted non-GAAP net income.
We exclude the above-described expenses, their related tax impact and other non-recurring tax benefits in evaluating short-term and long-term operating trends in our operations, and allocating resources to various initiatives and operational requirements. We believe that these adjusted non-GAAP financial adjustments are useful to investors because they allow investors to evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making.
These adjusted non-GAAP financial measures have not been prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information provided in accordance with GAAP. Further, these adjusted non-GAAP financial measures may not be computed in the same manner as similarly titled measures used by other companies.
The following table reconciles the adjusted non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.

(e) On September 16, 2010, Analogic Corporation ("we", "us", "our") approved an annual incentive bonus program for fiscal 2011 (the "FY11 AIP"). For our executive officers, the FY11 AIP is based on the achievement of revenue and adjusted non-GAAP earnings per share targets. Under the FY11 AIP, each of our executive officers has been assigned a target cash award and has the opportunity to earn a maximum of two times the target based on performance relative to the criteria described above. For our executive officers, any amounts earned for performance in excess of target will be paid 50% in cash and 50% in our common stock. Our adjusted non-GAAP earnings per share are based on GAAP earnings per share adjusted for certain items that management considers to be non-operating, non-recurring or of a non-cash nature, such as share-based compensation expense, restructuring charges, and acquisition related expenses. No such item is used to calculate an adjusted non-GAAP measure without the approval of the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.
The target bonus under the FY11 AIP for James W. Green, our President and Chief Executive Officer, is 90% of his $510,000 base salary for fiscal 2011, or $459,000. The target bonus under the FY11 AIP for John J. Fry, our Vice President, General Counsel and Corporation Secretary, is 50% of his $315,674 base salary for fiscal 2011, or $157,837. The target bonus under the FY11 AIP for Michael L. Levitz, our Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Treasurer, is 45% of his $288,850 base salary for fiscal 2011, or $129,983. The target bonus under the FY11 AIP for Donald B. Melson, our Vice President  Corporate Controller, is 35% of his $231,837 base salary for fiscal 2011, or $81,143.
On September 16, 2010, we approved a long-term incentive program (the "FY11 LTIP"). Under the FY11 LTIP, each of our executive officers will receive a long-term incentive award of performance contingent restricted stock units, which will vest based upon achievement of certain targets over the three year period ending July 31, 2013 with respect to our cumulative adjusted non-GAAP earnings per share and our relative total shareholder return ("TSR"). For our executive officers, achievement in whole or in part of each target will result in the vesting of up to one-half of the performance contingent restricted stock units awarded, based on pre-defined formulas. All restricted stock units earned based on achievement of the performance targets will cliff-vest on July 31, 2013. Relative TSR will be calculated based on our TSR relative to the performance of the Russell 2000 stock index.
The table below summarizes the long-term incentive awards approved and granted to executive officers under the FY11 LTIP on September 16, 2010:

PEABODY, MA (December 9, 2010)  Analogic Corporation (NASDAQ: ALOG), a leading provider of medical imaging and aviation security technology, today announced results for its first quarter ended October 31, 2010.
Operating highlights during the first quarter included:
 
The operating results for Analogic for the first quarter of fiscal 2011 exclude the results from the hotel business which was sold at the end of the first quarter and is classified as discontinued operations. Results from prior periods have also been revised for comparison purposes.
Revenue for the first fiscal quarter ended October 31, 2010, totaled $103.8 million, compared with fourth quarter revenue of $115.0 million and the prior fiscal year's first quarter revenue of $92.8 million. Reported income from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2011, which included a $3.6 million pre-tax restructuring charge related to the streamlining and consolidation of our operations, was $1.4 million, or $0.11 per diluted share. This compares with $7.0 million, or $0.55 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 and ($0.2) million, or ($0.01) per diluted share, for the prior year's first quarter.
Reported net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2011 was $2.6 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, compared with $7.1 million, or $0.56 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 and breakeven in the prior year's first quarter. During the quarter, we sold our hotel business for net proceeds totaling $10.5 million resulting in a net gain of $0.9 million. The gain on sale and the results of hotel operations are excluded from continuing operations.
Adjusted non-GAAP net income for the first quarter was $5.8 million, or $0.46 per diluted share, compared with $8.8 million, or $0.69 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, and $1.3 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, for the prior year's first quarter. A reconciliation of reported to adjusted non-GAAP results is included as an attachment to this press release.
Jim Green, president and CEO, commented, "Our Medical Technology business continues to see year-over-year improvement as hospital spending improves. We are especially pleased with the market acceptance of our new Flex Focus mobile ultrasound platform in spite of typical Q1 seasonality. Our Security Technology business continues to see variability as the TSA relies on bridge orders while the new certification testing is underway. All in all, our operating results for the first quarter are in line with our expectations and we are progressing toward our stated financial goals as we continue to drive growth and operational effectiveness."
Segment Revenue
Revenue from our Medical Imaging segment (formerly the CT, MRI and Digital Radiography segments) was $71.5 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2011, down $1.9 million from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 and up $5.6 million over the prior year's first quarter. Revenue was lower compared with Q4 of fiscal 2010 due primarily to the timing of mammography detector shipments. Revenues increased year over year due to greater demand for our OEM subsystems worldwide.
Our Ultrasound segment revenue was $21.1 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2011, down $2.0 million from the fourth quarter and up $1.0 million from the prior year. Revenue decreased compared with Q4 of fiscal 2010 due to normal seasonality, and increased year over year, driven by demand for our Flex Focus platform. Foreign currency had a $0.8 million positive impact on revenues in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 as compared to the fourth quarter and a ($1.1) million negative impact on revenues as compared to the prior year.
Security Technology revenue was $11.3 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2011, down $7.4 million from the fourth quarter and up $4.4 million from a year earlier. Quarterly revenue fluctuations reflect the timing of bridge orders from our OEM customer due to the Transportation Security Administration's deployment of a new procurement process.
Use of Adjusted Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This document includes adjusted non-GAAP financial measures that are not in accordance with, nor an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these adjusted non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles.
Adjusted non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are limited in value because they exclude charges that have a material effect on our reported results and, therefore, should not be relied upon as the sole financial measures to evaluate our financial results. The adjusted non-GAAP financial measures are meant to supplement, and to be viewed in conjunction with, GAAP financial results. An explanation and a reconciliation of our adjusted non-GAAP measures are provided at the end of this press release.
Forward-Looking Statements
Any statements about future expectations, plans, and prospects for the Company, including statements containing the words " believes," " anticipates," " plans," " expects," and similar expressions, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including risks relating to product development and commercialization, limited demand for the Company's products, risks associated with competition, uncertainties associated with regulatory agency approvals, competitive pricing pressures, downturns in the economy, the risk of potential intellectual property litigation, and other factors discussed in our most recent quarterly report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, the forward-looking statements included in this presentation represent the Company's views as of the date of this document. While the Company anticipates that subsequent events and developments will cause the Company's views to change, the Company specifically disclaims any obligation to update these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing the Company's views as of any later date.

UNAUDITED SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATIONRECONCILIATION OF REPORTED (GAAP) TO ADJUSTED NON-GAAP MEASURES
We provide adjusted non-GAAP gross profit, operating expenses, income from operations, income from continuing operations, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, net income and diluted net income per share as supplemental measures to reported results regarding our operational performance. These financial measures exclude the impact of certain items and, therefore, have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. The adjustments to these financial measures, and the basis for such adjustments, are outlined below:
Share-Based Compensation Expense
We incur expense related to share-based compensation included in the reported presentation of cost of sales, research and development, selling and marketing, general and administrative expense. Although share-based compensation is an expense and viewed as a form of compensation, these expenses vary in amount from period to period, and are affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within our control, such as the market price and volatility of our shares, risk-free interest rates, and the expected term and forfeiture rates of the awards. Share-based compensation expense is calculated as of the grant date of each share-based award, and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the grant date. Our management team believes that exclusion of these expenses allows comparisons of operating results that are consistent between periods and allows comparisons of our operating results to those of other companies that disclose adjusted non-GAAP financial measures that exclude share-based compensation.
Acquisition Related Expenses
We incur amortization of intangibles and other expenses related to acquisitions it has made in recent years. The intangible assets are valued at the time of acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed after the acquisition. We believe that exclusion of these expenses allows comparisons of operating results that are consistent over time for both our newly acquired and long-held businesses.
Restructuring Charges
During the three months ended October 31, 2010, we initiated a plan to reduce our work force by 104 employees worldwide as we continue to streamline our operations and consolidate our Denmark and Canton, MA manufacturing operations into our existing U.S. facilities. The total cost, including severance and personnel related costs, was $3,562,000 and was recorded as an operating expense during the three months ended October 31, 2010.
Gain on Sale of Hotel
During the first quarter of fiscal year 2011, we sold our hotel business and recorded an after-tax gain on sale of the hotel business of $924,000, or $0.07 per diluted share. This gain has been presented as an adjusted non-GAAP item as management believes it is not associated with the on-going operations of the business.
Taxes
For purposes of calculating adjusted non-GAAP net income and adjusted non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, we adjust the provision (benefit) for income taxes to tax effect the non-GAAP adjustments described above as they have a significant impact on our income tax provision (benefit). In addition, from time-to-time, we recognize certain non-recurring tax adjustments.
We exclude the above-described expenses, their related tax impact and other non-recurring tax benefits in evaluating short-term and long-term operating trends in our operations, and allocating resources to various initiatives and operational requirements. We believe that these adjusted non-GAAP financial adjustments are useful to investors because they allow investors to evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making.
These adjusted non-GAAP financial measures have not been prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information provided in accordance with GAAP. Further, these adjusted non-GAAP financial measures may not be computed in the same manner as similarly titled measures used by other companies.
The following table reconciles the adjusted non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.

PEABODY, MA (March 10, 2011)  Analogic Corporation (Nasdaq:ALOG), a leading provider of medical imaging and aviation security technology, today announced results for its second quarter ended January 31, 2011.
Operating highlights during the second quarter included:
 
 
 
 
 
Revenue for the second fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2011, totaled $117.3 million, compared with first quarter revenue of $103.8 million and the prior fiscal year's second quarter revenue of $101.5 million. Reported net income from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal 2011 was $5.3 million, or $0.42 per diluted share. This compares with $1.4 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, in the first quarter, and $3.9 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, for the prior year's second quarter. Non-recurring accounting items related to the transducer product line acquisition added $0.06 to diluted earnings per share in the second quarter of fiscal 2011.
Non-GAAP net income from continuing operations for the second quarter was $6.7 million, or $0.53 per diluted share, compared with $5.5 million, or $0.44 per diluted share, in the first quarter, and $5.7 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, for the prior year's second quarter. A reconciliation of reported to non-GAAP results is included as an attachment to this press release.
Jim Green, president and CEO, commented, "Our business continues to demonstrate solid top-line results in spite of reduced shipments in our Security business this quarter. In our Medical Imaging business, we saw increased demand across our product lines, with strong growth in sales of our CT subsystems and digital mammography detectors. In Ultrasound, sales in the U.S. grew significantly as we see the effects of our domestic sales channel investment, despite weakness in Europe and in certain distributor markets.
Segment Revenue
Revenue from our Medical Imaging segment was $82.3 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2011, up $10.9 million from the first quarter and up $18.4 million over the prior year's second quarter. Revenue growth was driven by growth across our product lines, with notable increases in CT, Digital Mammography, and OEM ultrasound transducer products. During the second quarter we acquired an OEM ultrasound transducer product line, which generated $2.1 million of sales during the quarter.
Our Ultrasound segment revenue was $24.6 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2011, up $3.5 million from the first quarter and down $0.3 million from the prior year. Ultrasound product revenue was up sequentially due to normal seasonality and growth in the U.S., and down slightly year over year due primarily to an unfavorable foreign currency impact, as well as a slowdown in Europe and certain distributor markets.
Security Technology segment revenue was $10.4 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2011, down $0.9 million from the first quarter and down $2.4 million from a year earlier. Quarterly revenue fluctuations reflect the timing of bridge orders from our OEM customer due to the Transportation Security Administration's deployment of a new procurement process.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This document includes non-GAAP financial measures that are not in accordance with, nor an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles.
Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are limited in value because they exclude charges that have a material effect on our reported results and, therefore, should not be relied upon as the sole financial measures to evaluate our financial results. The non-GAAP financial measures are meant to supplement, and to be viewed in conjunction with, GAAP financial results. An explanation and a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures are provided at the end of this press release.
Forward-Looking Statements
Any statements about future expectations, plans, and prospects for the Company, including statements containing the words " believes," " anticipates," " plans," " expects," and similar expressions, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including risks relating to product development and commercialization, limited demand for the Company's products, risks associated with competition, uncertainties associated with regulatory agency approvals, competitive pricing pressures, downturns in the economy, the risk of potential intellectual property litigation, and other factors discussed in our most recent quarterly report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, the forward-looking statements included in this presentation represent the Company's views as of the date of this document. While the Company anticipates that subsequent events and developments will cause the Company's views to change, the Company specifically disclaims any obligation to update these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing the Company's views as of any later date.

UNAUDITED SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION - RECONCILIATION OF REPORTED (GAAP) TO NON-GAAP MEASURES
We provide non-GAAP gross profit, operating expenses, income from operations, income from continuing operations, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, net income and diluted net income per share as supplemental measures to reported results regarding our operational performance. These financial measures exclude the impact of certain items and, therefore, have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. The adjustments to these financial measures, and the basis for such adjustments, are outlined below:
Share-Based Compensation Expense
We incur expense related to share-based compensation included in the reported presentation of cost of sales, research and development, selling and marketing, general and administrative expense. Although share-based compensation is an expense and viewed as a form of compensation, these expenses vary in amount from period to period, and are affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within our control, such as the market price and volatility of our shares, risk-free interest rates, and the expected term and forfeiture rates of the awards. Share-based compensation expense is calculated as of the grant date of each share-based award, and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the grant date. Our management team believes that exclusion of these expenses allows comparisons of operating results that are consistent between periods and allows comparisons of our operating results to those of other companies that disclose non-GAAP financial measures that exclude share-based compensation.
Acquisition Related Gains and Expenses
We incur amortization of intangibles and other expenses related to acquisitions we have made in recent years. The intangible assets are valued at the time of acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years
after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed after the acquisition. During the three months ended January 31, 2011, our results included accounting items related to an acquisition of an OEM ultrasound transducer and probe product line. The acquisition accounting items included a bargain purchase gain (i.e. the acquired assets exceeded the amount to be paid for the acquisition) of $1,042,000 recorded in general and administrative expenses within operating income. We believe the exclusion of this gain and acquisition related expenses allow comparisons of operating results that are consistent over time for both our newly acquired and long-held businesses.
Restructuring
During the three months ended October 31, 2010, we initiated a plan to reduce our work force by 104 employees worldwide as we continue to streamline our operations and consolidate our Denmark and Canton, MA manufacturing operations into our existing U.S. facilities. The total cost, including severance and personnel related costs, was $3,562,000 and was recorded as an operating expense during the three months ended October 31, 2010. We reduced restructuring charges by $134,000 in the three months ended January 31, 2011. During the three months ended January 31, 2010, we reduced our work force by 17 employees worldwide. The total cost, including severance and personnel related costs, was $764,000 and was recorded as an operating expense during the three months ended January 31, 2010.
Gain on Sale of Hotel
During the first quarter of fiscal year 2011, we sold our hotel business and recorded an after-tax gain on sale of the hotel business of $924,000, or $0.07 per diluted share. This gain has been presented as a non-GAAP item as management believes it is not associated with the on-going operations of the business.
Taxes
For purposes of calculating non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, we adjust the provision (benefit) for income taxes to tax effect the non-GAAP adjustments described above as they have a significant impact on our income tax provision (benefit). In addition, from time-to-time, we recognize certain non-recurring tax adjustments.
We exclude the above-described expenses, their related tax impact and other non-recurring tax benefits in evaluating short-term and long-term operating trends in our operations, and allocating resources to various initiatives and operational requirements. We believe that these non-GAAP financial adjustments are useful to investors because they allow investors to evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making.
These non-GAAP financial measures have not been prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information provided in accordance with GAAP. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be computed in the same manner as similarly titled measures used by other companies.
The following table reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.

PEABODY, MA (June 7, 2011)  Analogic Corporation (Nasdaq: ALOG), a leading provider of medical imaging and aviation security technology, today announced results for its third quarter ended April 30, 2011.
Highlights include:
 
 
 
 
Revenue for the third fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2011, totaled $117.2 million, compared with second quarter revenue of $117.3 million and the prior fiscal year's third quarter revenue of $105.5 million. Reported net income from continuing operations for the third quarter of fiscal 2011 was $4.3 million, or $0.35 per diluted share. This compares with $5.3 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, in the second quarter, and $5.1 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, for the prior year's third quarter. Included in reported diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of fiscal 2011 was $0.15 in share-based compensation expense, reflecting an increased accrual for performance-based compensation on greater likelihood of achieving our financial targets.
Non-GAAP net income from continuing operations for the third quarter was $6.7 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, compared with $6.7 million, or $0.53 per diluted share, in the second quarter, and $6.5 million, or $0.51 per diluted share, for the prior year's third quarter. A reconciliation of reported to non-GAAP results is included as an attachment to this press release.
Operating cash flows were negatively impacted during the third quarter due to an increase in inventory associated with the consolidation of our ultrasound manufacturing operations from Denmark into our existing manufacturing operations in the United States and China.
Jim Green, president and CEO, commented, "End markets in medical imaging continue to improve. In our Medical Imaging business, we saw strong growth in sales of our CT subsystems and had a record quarter in digital mammography. Our ultrasound revenues increased 8% compared with last year and we continue to invest in expansion of our direct sales force. Our Security business continued to see variability in shipments, however we are pleased to report that our backlog and expectations for the fourth quarter remain strong."
Green further stated, "In the fourth quarter we have taken steps to realign the operations within our medical business by combining our direct ultrasound systems business and our OEM ultrasound transducers business (reported within our Medical Imaging segment) under common leadership. We are also taking steps to reduce our operating cost structure in line with strategic priorities and believe that these changes, along with our previously announced consolidation of ultrasound manufacturing, will underpin improvements in operating margin supporting our fiscal 2012 profitability goals."
Green concluded, "These changes are in line with focusing our operating structure along our three core business lines, Medical Imaging, Ultrasound, and Security Technology, with the appropriate level of investment required to achieve our growth and profitability targets."
Segment Revenue
Revenue from our Medical Imaging segment was $83.0 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2011, up $0.7 million from the second quarter and up $11.9 million over the prior year's third quarter. Revenue was up sequentially and year-over-year driven by increasing demand for CT and mammography subsystems.
Our Ultrasound segment revenue was $23.9 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2011, down $0.6 million from the second quarter and up $1.8 million from the prior year. Revenue was lower compared with Q2 due largely to typical seasonality, and up from Q3 FY2010 on growing volume.
Security Technology segment revenue was $10.2 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2011, down $0.2 million from the second quarter and down $2 million from a year earlier. Quarterly revenue fluctuations reflect the timing of bridge orders from our OEM customer due to the Transportation Security Administration's deployment of a new procurement process and lower engineering revenues in the period.
Quarterly Cash Dividend
Analogic's Board of Directors, on June 1, 2011, declared a $0.10 cash dividend for each common share for its third fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2011. The cash dividend will be payable on June 30, 2011, to shareholders of record on June 20, 2011.

PEABODY, Mass. (September 20, 2011)  Analogic Corporation (Nasdaq:ALOG), a leading provider of medical imaging and aviation security technology, today announced results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended July 31, 2011.
Highlights during the fourth quarter included:
 
 
 
 
Highlights for fiscal year 2011 included:
 
 
 
 
Revenues for the fourth fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2011, were $135.3 million, compared with third quarter revenues of $117.2 million and the prior fiscal year's fourth quarter revenues of $115.0 million. GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 was $5.6 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, compared with income of $4.3 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, in the third quarter of fiscal 2011 and $7.1 million, or $0.56 per diluted share, for the prior year's fourth quarter. Included in net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 was $3.6 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, for restructuring charges primarily associated with the consolidation of our ultrasound business and streamlining of our overall operations.
Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $10.3 million, or $0.83 per diluted share, compared with $6.7 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, in the third quarter of fiscal 2011, and $8.8 million, or $0.69 per diluted share, for the prior year's fourth quarter. A reconciliation of reported to non-GAAP results is included as an attachment to this press release.
For fiscal 2011, revenues totaled $473.6 million, compared with revenues of $414.8 million in fiscal 2010, up 14%. GAAP net income for fiscal 2011 totaled $17.8 million, or $1.42 per diluted share, as compared with $15.6 million, or $1.23 per diluted share, for fiscal 2010. Non-GAAP net income for fiscal 2011 totaled $29.5 million, or $2.35 per diluted share, as compared with $21.7 million, or $1.72 per diluted share, for fiscal 2010.
Jim Green, president and CEO, commented, "I am very pleased with our strong performance in the fourth fiscal quarter, as we achieved the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit, year-over-year, revenue growth, and achieved 10% non-GAAP operating margins driven by strong demand for our medical imaging and security products. We continue to see growth in our Medical Imaging business across our product lines on growing customer demand. Our Ultrasound business saw solid growth and our Security business had an exceptional quarter."
"Fiscal year 2011 was a record year in revenues and we expect to stay on a growth trajectory," Green continued. "Our business is on solid footing as we completed the realignment of the business around our three fundamental pillars of Medical Imaging, Ultrasound, and Security in the fourth quarter and we are confident that we will achieve our previously stated financial goal of double-digit non-GAAP operating margin for fiscal 2012."
Segment Revenues
Revenue from our Medical Imaging segment was $89.3 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, up $6.3 million from the third quarter and up $16.0 million over the prior year's fourth quarter. Revenue was up sequentially and year over year driven by greater overall demand for our medical imaging products.
Our Ultrasound segment revenue was $26.8 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, up $2.8 million from the third quarter and up $3.8 million over the prior year. Revenue was up sequentially due to typical seasonality as well as addressing product supply constraints from the third quarter related to our manufacturing transition. Revenue grew year over year due to stronger demand for our Flex Focus ultrasound systems.
Security Technology segment revenue was $19.2 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, up $9.0 million from the third quarter and up $0.6 million from a year earlier. Revenue was up sequentially due mainly to the timing of shipments under bridge orders from our OEM customer as well as higher engineering revenues in the quarter. Revenues continue to remain variable under these bridge orders due to the Transportation Security Administration's deployment of a new procurement process.
Quarterly Cash Dividend
Analogic's Board of Directors, on September 15, 2011, declared a $0.10 cash dividend for each common share for its fourth fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2011. The cash dividend will be payable on October 18, 2011, to shareholders of record on October 5, 2011.

UNAUDITED SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION - RECONCILIATION OF REPORTED (GAAP) TO NON-GAAP MEASURES
We provide non-GAAP gross profit, operating expenses, income from operations, income from continuing operations, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, net income and diluted net income per share as supplemental measures to reported results regarding our operational performance. These financial measures exclude the impact of certain items and, therefore, have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. The adjustments to these financial measures, and the basis for such adjustments, are outlined below:
Share-Based Compensation Expense
We incur expense related to share-based compensation included in the reported presentation of cost of sales, research and development, selling and marketing, general and administrative expense. Although share-based compensation is an expense and viewed as a form of compensation, these expenses vary in amount from period to period, and are affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within our control, such as the market price and volatility of our shares, risk-free interest rates, and the expected term and forfeiture rates of the awards. Share-based compensation expense is calculated as of the grant date of each share-based award, and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the grant date. Our management team believes that exclusion of these expenses allows comparisons of operating results that are consistent between periods and allows comparisons of our operating results to those of other companies that disclose non-GAAP financial measures that exclude share-based compensation.
Acquisition Related Gains and Expenses
We incur amortization of intangibles and other expenses related to acquisitions we have made in recent years. The intangible assets are valued at the time of acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed after the acquisition. During fiscal year 2011, our results included accounting items related to an acquisition of an OEM ultrasound transducer and probe product line. The acquisition accounting items included a bargain purchase gain (i.e. the acquired assets exceeded the amount to be paid for the acquisition) of $1,042,000 recorded in general and administrative expenses within operating income. We believe the exclusion of this gain and acquisition related expenses allow comparisons of operating results that are consistent over time for both our newly acquired and long-held businesses.
Restructuring
During the three months ended July 31, 2011, we initiated a plan to reduce our work force by 51 employees worldwide as we continue to streamline our overall operations. The total cost, including severance and personnel related costs, was $3,585,000 and was recorded as an operating expense during the three months ended July 31, 2011. During the three months ended October 31, 2010, we initiated a plan to reduce our work force by 104 employees worldwide as we continue to streamline our operations and consolidate our Denmark and Canton, Mass. manufacturing operations into our existing U.S. facilities. The total cost, including severance and personnel related costs, was $3,562,000 and was recorded as an operating expense during the three months ended October 31, 2010. We adjusted restructuring charges by ($134,000) and $53,000 in the three months ended January 31, 2011 and July 31, 2011, respectively. During the three months ended January 31, 2010, we reduced our work force by 17 employees worldwide. The total cost, including severance and personnel related costs, was $764,000 and was recorded as an operating expense during the three months ended January 31, 2010.
Taxes
For purposes of calculating non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, we adjust the provision (benefit) for income taxes to tax effect the non-GAAP adjustments described above as they have a significant impact on our income tax provision (benefit). In addition, from time-to-time, we recognize certain non-recurring tax adjustments.
We exclude the above-described expenses, their related tax impact and other non-recurring tax benefits in evaluating short-term and long-term operating trends in our operations, and allocating resources to various initiatives and operational requirements. We believe that these non-GAAP financial adjustments are useful to investors because they allow investors to evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making.
These non-GAAP financial measures have not been prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information provided in accordance with GAAP. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be computed in the same manner as similarly titled measures used by other companies.
The following table reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.

(e) On September 15, 2011, Analogic Corporation ("we", "us", "our") approved an annual incentive bonus program for fiscal 2012 (the "FY12 AIP"). For our executive officers, the FY12 AIP is based on the achievement of revenue, non-GAAP earnings per share, and return on invested capital targets. Under the FY12 AIP, each of our executive officers has been assigned a target cash award and has the opportunity to earn a maximum of two times the target based on performance relative to the criteria described above. For our executive officers, any amounts earned for performance in excess of target will be paid 50% in cash and 50% in our common stock. Our non-GAAP earnings per share are based on GAAP earnings per share adjusted for certain items that we consider to be non-operating, non-recurring or of a non-cash nature, such as share-based compensation expense, restructuring charges, and acquisition-related expenses. No such item is used to calculate a non-GAAP measure without the approval of the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.
The target bonus under the FY12 AIP for James W. Green, our President and Chief Executive Officer, is 100% of his $525,000 base salary for fiscal 2012, or $525,000. The target bonus for John J. Fry, our Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Corporation Secretary, is 50% of his $328,301 base salary for fiscal 2012, or $164,151. The target bonus under the FY12 AIP for Michael L. Levitz, our Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Treasurer, is 50% of his $303,293 base salary for fiscal 2012, or $151,647. The target bonus under the FY12 AIP for Donald B. Melson, our Vice President  Corporate Controller, is 35% of his $237,633 base salary for fiscal 2012, or $83,172.
On September 15, 2011, we approved a long-term incentive program (the "FY12-14 LTIP"). Each of our executive officers received a long-term incentive award consisting of performance-contingent restricted stock units (the "RSUs") and non-statutory stock options (the "Stock Options") under the FY12-14 LTIP. The RSUs will vest based upon achievement of a cumulative non-GAAP earnings per share target and a relative total shareholder return ("TSR") target over the three year period ending July 31, 2014. For our executive officers, achievement in whole or in part of each target will result in the vesting of up to one-half of the RSUs awarded, based on pre-defined formulas. For each performance metric, above-target achievement will result in vesting of up to the total number of RSUs awarded, which is twice the target amount, based on pre-defined formulas. All RSUs earned based on achievement of the performance targets will cliff-vest on July 31, 2014. Relative TSR will be calculated based on our TSR relative to the performance of the Russell 2000 stock index. The Stock Options are subject to time-based vesting and will vest in three annual installments beginning on September 15, 2012 and ending on September 15, 2014.
As of September 15, 2011, units available under our 2009 Stock Incentive Plan were insufficient for us to grant the entirety of the approved FY12-14 LTIP awards for our executive officers. Accordingly, the Stock Options were granted to each executive officer on September 15, 2011. The grant of the RSUs is contingent on shareholder approval of additional units at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders expected to be held in January 2012.
The table below summarizes the long-term incentive awards for our named executive officers under the FY12-14 LTIP:

On October 11, 2011, Analogic Corporation (the "Borrower") entered into a $100 million five-year, revolving credit agreement ("Credit Agreement") with the financial institutions identified therein as lenders, Sovereign Bank as Administrative Agent, and TD Bank, N.A., as Documentation Agent. The Credit Agreement is guaranteed by the Borrower's material domestic subsidiaries as designated by the Borrower from time to time or as required under the Credit Agreement, and is supported by a pledge of 65% of the capital stock and equity equivalents of the Borrower's principal international subsidiary. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Credit Agreement.
Borrowings under the Credit Agreement may be used for general corporate purposes, the refinancing of existing unsecured lines of credit, for Permitted Acquisitions, for working capital and for related fees and expenses. Under specified circumstances, the facility can be increased up to $150 million in aggregate. The Credit Agreement replaces a $20 million credit facility with Sovereign Bank that had been renewed on an annual basis since 2001. The Credit Agreement contains certain customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, and events of default. Principal covenants include a maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio of 2.75:1.00 and a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio of 3.00:1.00.
The interest rate applicable to revolving loans under the Credit Agreement is at LIBOR plus an interest margin based on the Borrower's Consolidated Leverage Ratio or, if the Borrower elects or if no election is made, the applicable interest rate will be at the highest of: (1) the prime rate, (2) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, or (3) one-month LIBOR plus 1%. The Borrower will pay an unused commitment fee during the term of the Credit Agreement which varies between 0.20% and 0.35% depending on the Consolidated Leverage Ratio.
The obligations of the Borrower under the Credit Agreement may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Credit Agreement, which includes customary events of default including, without limitation, payment defaults, defaults in the performance of affirmative and negative covenants, the inaccuracy of representations or warranties, cross-defaults, bankruptcy and insolvency related defaults, defaults relating to judgments, an ERISA Event, the failure to pay specified indebtedness, and a change of control default.
The description of the Credit Agreement contained herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Credit Agreement, a copy of which is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

Status of Lenders; Tax Documentation
(ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if the Borrower is resident for tax purposes in the United States,
(A) any Lender that is a "United States person" within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 or such other documentation or information prescribed by applicable Laws or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements; and

(iii) Each Lender shall promptly (A) notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of any change in circumstances which would modify or render invalid any claimed exemption or reduction, and (B) take such steps as shall not be materially disadvantageous to it, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, and as may be reasonably necessary (including the re-designation of its Lending Office) to avoid any requirement of applicable Laws of any jurisdiction that the Borrower or the Administrative Agent make any withholding or deduction for taxes from amounts payable to such Lender.
(iv) If a payment made by the Borrower or any Loan Party hereunder or under any other Loan Document would be subject to United States withholding tax imposed pursuant to FATCA if any Lender fails to comply with applicable reporting and other requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times prescribed by applicable Laws or as reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, (A) two (2) accurate, complete and duly executed certifications prescribed by applicable Laws and/or reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent that establish that such payment is exempt from United States withholding tax imposed pursuant to FATCA, and (B) any other documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent sufficient for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such applicable reporting and other requirements of FATCA.

If the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer determines, in its good faith judgment, that it has received a refund or credit of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section, it shall pay to the Borrower an amount equal to such refund or credit (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund or credit), net of all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund or credit), that the Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer in the event the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. This subsection shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person.
provided
. If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to the LIBOR Rate, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the LIBOR Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars in the London interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, (i) any obligation of such Lender to make or continue LIBOR Rate Loans or to convert Base Rate Loans to LIBOR Rate Loans shall be suspended, and (ii) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender making or maintaining Base Rate Loans the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the LIBOR Rate component of the Base Rate, the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the LIBOR Rate component of the Base Rate, in each case until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, (x) the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all LIBOR Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the LIBOR Rate component of the Base Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such LIBOR Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such LIBOR Rate Loans and (y) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon the LIBOR Rate, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to the LIBOR Rate component thereof until the Administrative is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon the LIBOR Rate. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted.
3.02 Illegality
 
. If the Required Lenders determine that for any reason in connection with any request for a LIBOR Rate Loan or a conversion to or continuation thereof that (a) Dollar deposits are not being offered to banks in the London interbank eurodollar market for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such LIBOR Rate Loan, (b) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the LIBOR Base Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed LIBOR Rate Loan or in connection with an existing or proposed Base Rate Loan, or (c) the LIBOR Base Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed LIBOR Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, (x) the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain LIBOR Rate Loans shall be suspended, and (y) in the event of a determination described in the preceding sentence with respect to the LIBOR Rate component of the Base Rate, the utilization of the LIBOR Rate component in determining the Base Rate shall be suspended, in each case until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of LIBOR Rate Loans or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein.

Increased Costs Generally
(i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement reflected in the LIBOR Rate) or the L/C Issuer;
(ii) subject any Lender or the L/C Issuer to any tax of any kind whatsoever with respect to this Agreement, any Letter of Credit, any participation in a Letter of Credit or any LIBOR Rate Loan made by it, or change the basis of taxation of payments to such Lender or the L/C Issuer in respect thereof (except for Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes covered by and the imposition of, or any change in the rate of, any Excluded Tax payable by such Lender or the L/C Issuer); or
Section 3.01
(iii) impose on any Lender or the L/C Issuer or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement or LIBOR Rate Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any Loan the interest on which is determined by reference to the LIBOR Rate (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan), or to increase the cost to such Lender or the L/C Issuer of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit (or of maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue any Letter of Credit), or to reduce the amount of any sum
 
received or receivable by such Lender or the L/C Issuer hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender or the L/C Issuer, the Borrower will pay to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
(b) . If any Lender or the L/C Issuer determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or the L/C Issuer or any Lending Office of such Lender or such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's holding company, if any, regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's capital or on the capital of such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by the L/C Issuer, to a level below that which such Lender or the L/C Issuer or such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's policies and the policies of such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the L/C Issuer or such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's holding company for any such reduction suffered.
Capital Requirements
(c) . A certificate of a Lender or the L/C Issuer setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or the L/C Issuer or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in subsection (a) or (b) of this Section and delivered to the Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.
Certificates for Reimbursement
(d) . Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the L/C Issuer to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's right to demand such compensation, that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or the L/C Issuer pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than nine months prior to the date that such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the nine-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).
Delay in Requests
provided
. Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) from time to time, the Borrower shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of:
3.05 Compensation for Losses
(a) any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise);
 
(b) any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Borrower; or
(c) any assignment of a LIBOR Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to ;
Section 10.13
excluding any loss of anticipated profits but including any loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained. The Borrower shall also pay any customary administrative fees charged by such Lender in connection with the foregoing.
For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lenders under this , each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each LIBOR Rate Loan made by it at the LIBOR Base Rate used in determining the LIBOR Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the London interbank eurodollar market for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such LIBOR Rate Loan was in fact so funded.

ANALOGIC CORPORATION
Borrower
, the Borrower and the Guarantor are members of a group of related entities, the success of any one of which is dependent in part on the success of the other members of such group;
WHEREAS
, the Guarantor expects to receive substantial direct and indirect benefits from the extensions of credit to the Borrower by the Secured Parties pursuant to the Credit Agreement, the other Loan Documents, the Secured Cash Management Agreements and the Secured Hedge Agreements (which benefits are hereby acknowledged);
WHEREAS
, it is a condition precedent to the Lenders' and the L/C Issuer making any loans or otherwise extending credit to the Borrower under the Credit Agreement and the other Secured Parties extending any credit to the Borrower under the Secured Cash Management Agreements and the Secured Hedge Agreements that the Guarantor execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Secured Parties a guaranty substantially in the form hereof; and
WHEREAS
, the Guarantor wishes to guaranty the Borrower's obligations to the Secured Parties under or in respect of the Credit Agreement, the other Loan Documents, the Secured Cash Management Agreements and the Secured Hedge Agreements as provided herein;
WHEREAS
, the Guarantor hereby agrees with the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties as follows:
NOW, THEREFORE
The term "Obligations" and all other capitalized terms used herein without definition shall have the respective meanings provided therefor in the Credit Agreement.
1.
Definitions
.
The Guarantor hereby guarantees to the Secured Parties the full and punctual payment when due (whether at stated maturity, by required pre-payment, by acceleration or otherwise), as well as the performance, of all of the Obligations including all such which would become due but for the operation of the automatic stay pursuant to 362(a) of the Federal Bankruptcy Code and the operation of 502(b) and 506(b) of the Federal Bankruptcy Code. This Guaranty is an absolute, unconditional and
2.
Guaranty of Payment and Performance
.
 
continuing guaranty of the full and punctual payment and performance of all of the Obligations and not of their collectibility only and is in no way conditioned upon any requirement that any Secured Party first attempt to collect any of the Obligations from the Borrower or resort to any collateral security or other means of obtaining payment. Should the Borrower default in the payment or performance of any of the Obligations, the obligations of the Guarantor hereunder with respect to such Obligations in default shall, upon demand by the Administrative Agent, become immediately due and payable to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Secured Parties, without any additional demand or notice of any nature, all of which is expressly waived by the Guarantor. Payments by the Guarantor hereunder may be required by the Administrative Agent on any number of occasions. All payments by the Guarantor hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, in the manner and at the place of payment specified therefor in the Credit Agreement, for the account of the applicable Secured Parties. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the obligations of the Guarantor hereunder shall be limited to an amount equal to the largest amount that would not render its obligations hereunder subject to avoidance as a fraudulent transfer or conveyance under 548 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provisions of any similar federal or state law. Without limiting the foregoing, the Guarantor represents and warrants that it is organized and resident in the United States of America. The Guarantor shall make all payments hereunder without setoff or counterclaim and free and clear of and without deduction for any taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions, withholdings, compulsory loans, restrictions or conditions of any nature now or hereafter imposed or levied by any jurisdiction or any political subdivision thereof or taxing or other authority therein unless the Guarantor is compelled by law to make such deduction or withholding. If any such obligation is imposed upon the Guarantor with respect to any amount payable by it hereunder, the Guarantor, to the extent that the withholding or deduction is made on account of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, will pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the applicable Secured Parties, on the date on which such amount is due and payable hereunder, such additional amount in U.S. dollars as shall be necessary to enable the Secured Parties to receive the same net amount which the Secured Parties would have received on such due date had no such obligation been imposed upon the Guarantor. The Guarantor will deliver promptly to the Administrative Agent certificates or other valid vouchers for all taxes or other charges deducted from or paid with respect to payments made by the Guarantor hereunder. The obligations of the Guarantor under this paragraph shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and termination of this Guaranty.
The Guarantor further agrees, as the principal obligor and not as a guarantor only, to pay to the Administrative Agent, on demand, all costs and expenses (including court costs and legal expenses) incurred or expended by any Secured Party in connection with the Obligations, this Guaranty and the enforcement thereof, together with interest on amounts recoverable under this 3 from the time when such amounts become due until payment, whether before or after judgment, at the rate of interest for overdue principal set forth in the Credit Agreement, provided that if such interest exceeds the maximum amount permitted to be paid under applicable law, then such interest shall be reduced to such maximum permitted amount.
3.
Guarantor's Agreement to Pay Enforcement Costs, etc
.
 
The Guarantor agrees that the Obligations will be paid and performed strictly in accordance with their respective terms, regardless of any law, regulation or order now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction affecting any of such terms or the rights of any Secured Party with respect thereto. The Guarantor waives, to the extent permitted by applicable law, promptness, diligence, presentment, demand, protest, notice of acceptance, notice of any Obligations incurred and all other notices of any kind, all defenses which may be available by virtue of any valuation, stay, moratorium law or other similar law now or hereafter in effect, any right to require the marshalling of assets of the Borrower or any other entity or other person primarily or secondarily liable with respect to any of the Obligations, and all suretyship defenses generally. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Guarantor agrees to the provisions of any instrument evidencing, securing or otherwise executed in connection with any Obligation and agrees that the obligations of the Guarantor hereunder shall not be released or discharged, in whole or in part, or otherwise affected by (i) the failure of any Secured Party to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against the Borrower or any other entity or other person primarily or secondarily liable with respect to any of the Obligations; (ii) any extensions, compromise, refinancing, consolidation or renewals of any Obligation; (iii) any change in the time, place or manner of payment of any of the Obligations or any rescissions, waivers, compromise, refinancing, consolidation or other amendments or modifications of any of the terms or provisions of the Credit Agreement, the Note, the other Loan Documents or any other agreement evidencing, securing or otherwise executed in connection with any of the Obligations, (iv) the addition, substitution or release of any entity or other person primarily or secondarily liable for any Obligation; (v) the adequacy of any rights which any Secured Party may have against any collateral security or other means of obtaining repayment of any of the Obligations; (vi) the impairment of any collateral securing any of the Obligations, including without limitation the failure to perfect or preserve any rights which any Secured Party might have in such collateral security or the substitution, exchange, surrender, release, loss or destruction of any such collateral security; or (vii) any other act or omission which might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of the Guarantor or otherwise operate as a release or discharge of the Guarantor, all of which may be done without notice to the Guarantor. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Guarantor hereby expressly waives any and all rights or defenses arising by reason of (A) any "one action" or "anti-deficiency" law which would otherwise prevent any Secured Party from bringing any action, including any claim for a deficiency, or exercising any other right or remedy (including any right of set-off), against the Guarantor before or after such Secured Party's commencement or completion of any foreclosure action, whether judicially, by exercise of power of sale or otherwise, or (B) any other law which in any other way would otherwise require any election of remedies by any Secured Party.
4.
Waivers by Guarantor; Secured Parties' Freedom to Act
.
If for any reason the Borrower has no legal existence or is under no legal obligation to discharge any of the Obligations, or if any of the Obligations have become irrecoverable from the Borrower by reason of the Borrower's insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization or by other operation of law or for any other reason, this Guaranty shall nevertheless be binding on the Guarantor to the same extent as if the Guarantor at all times had been the principal obligor on all such Obligations. In the event that acceleration of the time for payment of any of the Obligations is stayed upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Borrower, or for any other
5.
Unenforceability of Obligations Against Borrower
.
 
reason, all such amounts otherwise subject to acceleration under the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Notes, the other Loan Documents or any other agreement evidencing, securing or otherwise executed in connection with any Obligation shall be immediately due and payable by the Guarantor.
6.
Subrogation; Subordination
.
Until the final payment and performance in full of all of the Obligations, the Guarantor shall not exercise and hereby waives any rights against the Borrower arising as a result of payment by the Guarantor hereunder, by way of subrogation, reimbursement, restitution, contribution or otherwise, and will not prove any claim in competition with any Secured Party in respect of any payment hereunder in any bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization case or proceedings of any nature; the Guarantor will not claim any setoff, recoupment or counterclaim against the Borrower in respect of any liability of the Guarantor to the Borrower; and the Guarantor waives any benefit of and any right to participate in any collateral security which may be held by any Secured Party.
6.1.
Waiver of Rights Against Borrower
.
The payment of any amounts due with respect to any indebtedness of the Borrower for money borrowed or credit received now or hereafter owed to the Guarantor is hereby subordinated to the prior payment in full of all of the Obligations. The Guarantor agrees that, after the occurrence of any default in the payment of any of the Obligations, the Guarantor will not demand, sue for or otherwise attempt to collect any such indebtedness of the Borrower to the Guarantor until all of the Obligations shall have been paid in full. If, notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the Guarantor shall collect, enforce or receive any amounts in respect of such indebtedness while any Obligations are still outstanding, such amounts shall be collected, enforced and received by the Guarantor as trustee for the Secured Parties and be paid over to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Secured Parties, on account of the Obligations without affecting in any manner the liability of the Guarantor under the other provisions of this Guaranty. Nothing in this Guaranty shall restrict the advance or payment of any extension of credit or financial accommodation by the Guarantor to or for the account of the Borrower prior to any default in the payment of the Obligations.
6.2.
.
Subordination
The provisions of this 6 shall be supplemental to and not in derogation of any rights and remedies of the Secured Parties under any separate subordination agreement which the Administrative Agent may at any time and from time to time enter into with the Guarantor for the benefit of the Secured Parties.
6.3.
.
Provisions Supplemental
Regardless of the adequacy of any collateral security or other means of obtaining payment of any of the Obligations, if a payment default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each of the Secured Parties and their respective Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final, in whatever currency) at any time held and other obligations (in whatever

All payments by the Guarantor hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, in the manner and at the place of payment specified therefor in the Credit Agreement, for the account of the applicable Secured Parties.

The obligations of the Guarantor under this paragraph shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and termination of this Guaranty.

PEABODY, Mass., Nov. 28, 2011 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE)  Analogic Corporation (Nasdaq: - ), enabling the world's medical imaging and aviation security technology, announced today the most comprehensive transformation of its corporate brand in its more than 40 year history, along with a rebranding of its products to more accurately reflect the Company's new vision and mission.
ALOG
News
With over 1,500 employees worldwide, including more than 400 engineers and scientists, Analogic is a global leader in medical imaging technology for high-performance computed tomography (CT) subsystems, procedure-driven ultrasound systems and transducers, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) power subsystems, digital mammography selenium-based detectors, and automated threat detection systems for airports. The new Analogic corporate logo design, along with associated product family brands of BK Medical, Sound Technology, and Copley Controls, employs a common global logo to reflect the products and technologies sold around the world. This new branding and common logo support our transformation to a unified global organization aligned along our three business units of Medical Imaging, Ultrasound, and Security Technology.
"Analogic has a strong heritage, as we have long been recognized as an innovative, technology-driven company based on engineering excellence," said Jim Green, president and CEO for Analogic. "Over the past four years, our Company has evolved, applying our expertise to the
needs of the market and focusing on our mission to create innovative technology to improve the practice of medicine and save lives. As our strategic realignment and new logo demonstrate, we are steadfast in our commitment to innovation and engineering excellence to improve the health and ensure the safety of people around the world."
The new strategic alignment of Analogic into three pillars-Medical Imaging, Ultrasound, and Security Technology-merges Analogic's businesses into a unified global business with one mission. Looking to the future, the Company will continue to commercialize new breakthroughs in precision imaging; extend its leading ultrasound technology into new adjacent clinical segments; drive new business opportunities in CT; expand imaging content with OEMs; and drive long-term growth in aviation security as its CT-based threat detection products are used in the recapitalization of the U.S. market and as Europe moves to higher detection levels for its airports.
"Analogic has an incredibly bright and promising future," continued Green. "We intend to leverage our global infrastructure to aggressively drive synergies, and we feel confident that we will meet our commitment of double-digit non-GAAP operating margins and mid to upper single digit revenue growth this fiscal year."
Analogic will unveil its new branding initiative, as well as showcase its leading CT, MRI, digital mammography, and ultrasound systems, at the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) 97

PEABODY, Mass. (December 8, 2011)  Analogic Corporation (Nasdaq:ALOG), enabling the world's medical imaging and aviation security technology, today announced results for its first quarter ended October 31, 2011.
Highlights during the first quarter included:
 
 
 
Revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2012 were $117.9 million, an increase of 14% compared with revenues of $103.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. GAAP net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2012 was $4.0 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, compared with net income of $2.6 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Included in our GAAP results during the first quarter of fiscal 2012, were pre-tax expenses totaling $1.4 million associated with the previously disclosed investigation involving our Danish subsidiary and certain of its foreign distributors. Of this amount, $1.0 million related to specific inquiry-related expenses and $0.4 million related to employee severance costs.
Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter was $6.7 million, or $0.53 per diluted share, compared with $5.8 million, or $0.46 per diluted share, in the prior year's first quarter. A reconciliation of reported to non-GAAP results is included as an attachment to this press release. For non-GAAP reporting purposes, we have excluded the $1.0 million portion of the inquiry-related pre-tax expenses described above.
Jim Green, president and CEO, commented, "We are pleased to again have achieved double-digit, year-over-year, revenue growth, driven by strong growth in our medical imaging and ultrasound businesses as we are expanding our presence with existing customers and beginning to penetrate new adjacent markets. Security product revenues increased while overall Security revenues were down slightly due to lower funded engineering this quarter. Overall we remain on track to achieving our financial goals of double-digit non-GAAP operating margins and mid-to-upper single digit revenue growth for FY 2012."
Green continued, "Shortly after quarter end, we completed our $30 million stock repurchase program. We remain committed to driving improvement in shareholder value."
Segment Revenues
At the end of fiscal 2011, we realigned our Ultrasound business, combining our direct sales Ultrasound systems business with our OEM Ultrasound transducer business under common leadership. As a result, our Ultrasound segment revenue now includes OEM transducer sales previously included in our Medical Imaging segment.
Revenue from our Medical Imaging segment was $72.7 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2012, up 13% from revenue of $64.2 million in the same period of fiscal 2011. Medical Imaging revenues were up during the quarter due largely to growth in sales of our digital mammography detector plates in addition to growth from our MRI and CT subsystems.
Our Ultrasound segment revenue was $34.6 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2012, up 22% from revenue of $28.4 million in the same period of fiscal 2011. Ultrasound revenue grew due to solid demand for our Flex Focus family of ultrasound systems for procedure-driven markets of urology and surgery, with over 20% growth in the United States. The growth in Ultrasound also reflects revenues from an OEM transducer product line we acquired in the second quarter of fiscal 2011.
Security Technology segment revenue was $10.6 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2012, down 6% from revenue of $11.3 million in the same period of fiscal 2011. A 35% increase in product revenue was offset by a decline in customer funded engineering revenue as we near the completion of current key projects.
Quarterly Cash Dividend
Analogic's Board of Directors, on December 5, 2011, declared a $0.10 cash dividend for each common share for its first fiscal quarter ended October 31, 2011. The cash dividend will be payable on December 29, 2011, to shareholders of record on December 19, 2011.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This document includes non-GAAP financial measures that are not in accordance with, nor an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles.
Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are limited in value because they exclude charges that have a material effect on our reported results and, therefore, should not be relied upon as the sole financial measures to evaluate our financial results. The non-GAAP financial measures are meant to supplement, and to be viewed in conjunction with, GAAP financial results. An explanation and a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures are provided at the end of this press release.
Forward-Looking Statements
Any statements about future expectations, plans, and prospects for the Company, including statements containing the words " believes," " anticipates," " plans," " expects," and similar expressions, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including risks relating to product development and commercialization, limited demand for the Company's products, risks associated with competition, uncertainties associated with regulatory agency approvals, competitive pricing pressures, downturns in the economy, the risk of potential intellectual property litigation, and other factors discussed in our most recent quarterly report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, the forward-looking statements included in this presentation represent the Company's views as of the date of this document. While the Company anticipates that subsequent events and developments will cause the Company's views to change, the Company specifically disclaims any obligation to update these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing the Company's views as of any later date.

UNAUDITED SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION - RECONCILIATION OF REPORTED (GAAP) TO NON-GAAP MEASURES
We provide non-GAAP gross profit, operating expenses, income from operations, income from continuing operations, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, net income and diluted net income per share as supplemental measures to reported results regarding our operational performance. These financial measures exclude the impact of certain items and, therefore, have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. The adjustments to these financial measures, and the basis for such adjustments, are outlined below:
Share-Based Compensation Expense
We incur expense related to share-based compensation included in the reported presentation of cost of sales, research and development, selling and marketing, general and administrative expense. Although share-based compensation is an expense and viewed as a form of compensation, these expenses vary in amount from period to period, and are affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within our control, such as the market price and volatility of our shares, risk-free interest rates, and the expected term and forfeiture rates of the awards. Share-based compensation expense is calculated as of the grant date of each share-based award, and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the grant date. Our management team believes that exclusion of these expenses allows comparisons of operating results that are consistent between periods and allows comparisons of our operating results to those of other companies that disclose non-GAAP financial measures that exclude share-based compensation.
B-K Distributor Matter Inquiry-Related Costs
As previously disclosed in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2011, the Company has identified transactions involving our Danish subsidiary, BK Medical, and certain of its foreign distributors, with respect to which the Company has raised questions concerning compliance with law and the Company's business policies. The Company has concluded that the identified transactions have been properly accounted for in our reported financial statements in all material respects. During the three months ended October 31, 2011 we incurred $997,000 of inquiry-related costs.
Acquisition Related Expenses
We incur amortization of intangibles and other expenses related to acquisitions we have made in recent years. The intangible assets are valued at the time of acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed after the acquisition.
Restructuring
During the three months ended October 31, 2010, we initiated a plan to reduce our work force by 104 employees worldwide as we continue to streamline our operations and consolidate our Denmark and Canton, Mass. manufacturing operations into our existing U.S. facilities. The total cost, including severance and personnel related costs, was $3,562,000 and was recorded as an operating expense during the three months ended October 31, 2010.
Taxes
For purposes of calculating non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, we adjust the provision (benefit) for income taxes to tax effect the non-GAAP adjustments described above as they have a significant impact on our income tax provision (benefit). In addition, from time-to-time, we recognize certain non-recurring tax adjustments.
We exclude the above-described expenses, their related tax impact and other non-recurring tax benefits in evaluating short-term and long-term operating trends in our operations, and allocating resources to various initiatives and operational requirements. We believe that these non-GAAP financial adjustments are useful to investors because they allow investors to evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making.
These non-GAAP financial measures have not been prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information provided in accordance with GAAP. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be computed in the same manner as similarly titled measures used by other companies.
The following table reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.

PEABODY, Mass. (March 6, 2012)  Analogic Corporation (Nasdaq:ALOG), enabling the world's medical imaging and aviation security technology, today announced results for its second quarter ended January 31, 2012.
Highlights during the second quarter included:
 
Revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 2012 were $126.4 million, an increase of 8% compared with revenues of $117.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2011. GAAP net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2012 was $19.6 million, or $1.59 per diluted share, compared with net income of $5.3 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, in the second quarter of fiscal 2011.
Included in our GAAP net income reported for the second quarter of fiscal 2012 was a $10.0 million tax refund received during the quarter associated with R&D tax credits, offset in part by $2.7 million ($1.7 million net of tax) of contingent consulting fees recorded as G&A expense associated with the tax refund. Results for the quarter also included a $2.5 million ($1.6 million net of tax) gain on the sale of an equity interest. Together, these items provided an $0.80 benefit to diluted net income per share.
Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter was $12.5 million, or $1.02 per diluted share, compared with $6.7 million, or $0.53 per diluted share, in the prior year's second quarter. Our non-GAAP results do not include the benefit from the tax refund, net of related fees, and gain on sale of equity interest noted above. A reconciliation of reported to non-GAAP results is included as an attachment to this press release.
For the first six months of fiscal 2012, revenues totaled $244.3 million, up 11% from the same period in the prior year. Year-to-date GAAP net income was $23.6 million, or $1.88 per diluted share, up 199% and 203% respectively, from the same period last year. Year-to-date non-GAAP net income was $19.2 million, or $1.53 per diluted share, up 54% from the same period last year.
Jim Green, president and CEO, commented, "Analogic continues to deliver outstanding performance, with our highest quarterly earnings in years. In spite of headwinds in the U.S. and European Medical Imaging markets, we continue to see strong, double-digit revenue growth in our Ultrasound business led by market penetration for our procedure-driven BK Medical Flex Focus product line and our Medical Imaging business remains solid. Security is also on track as product revenues again grew during the quarter and we solidify our relationships with our OEM customers. Analogic expects to achieve our stated financial target of double-digit non-GAAP operating margins for fiscal 2012, and I'm excited to say that increased demand in our security business gives us the confidence to increase our fiscal 2012 revenue outlook to high single-digit growth year-over-year."
Segment Revenues
Revenue from our Medical Imaging segment was $75.3 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2012, up 3% from revenue of $72.8 million in the same period of fiscal 2011. Year-to-date, Medical Imaging revenue was $147.9 million, up 8% from the prior year. Medical Imaging revenues were up during the quarter due largely to growth in sales of our MRI subsystems and digital mammography detector plates, offset in part by lower shipments of CT components due to customer ordering patterns.
Our Ultrasound segment revenue was $41.1 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2012, up 21% from revenue of $34.0 million in the same period of fiscal 2011. Year-to-date, Ultrasound revenue was $75.7 million, up 21% from the prior year. Ultrasound revenue grew due to solid demand for our Flex Focus family of ultrasound systems for procedure-driven markets of urology and surgery, as well as demand for our ultrasound transducers sold through OEMs.
Security Technology segment revenue was $10.1 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2012, down 3% from revenue of $10.4 million in the same period of fiscal 2011. Year-to-date, Security revenue was $20.7 million, down 5% from the prior year. Product revenue increased 15% during the quarter, which was offset by lower engineering revenue as we complete a key development project.
Quarterly Cash Dividend
Analogic's Board of Directors, on March 1, 2012, declared a $0.10 cash dividend for each common share for its second fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2012. The cash dividend will be payable on March 29, 2012, to shareholders of record on March 19, 2012.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This document includes non-GAAP financial measures that are not in accordance with, nor an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles.
Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are limited in value because they exclude charges that have a material effect on our reported results and, therefore, should not be relied upon as the sole financial measures to evaluate our financial results. The non-GAAP financial measures are meant to supplement, and to be viewed in conjunction with, GAAP financial results. An explanation and a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures are provided at the end of this press release.
Forward-Looking Statements
Any statements about future expectations, plans, and prospects for the Company, including statements containing the words "believes," "anticipates," "plans," "expects," and similar expressions, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including risks relating to product development and commercialization, limited demand for the Company's products, risks associated with competition, uncertainties associated with regulatory agency approvals, competitive pricing pressures, downturns in the economy, the risk of potential intellectual property litigation, and other factors discussed in our most recent quarterly report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, the forward-looking statements included in this presentation represent the Company's views as of the date of this document. While the Company anticipates that subsequent events and developments will cause the Company's views to change, the Company specifically disclaims any obligation to update these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing the Company's views as of any later date.

UNAUDITED SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATIONRECONCILIATION OF REPORTED (GAAP) TO NON-GAAP MEASURES
We provide non-GAAP gross profit, operating expenses, income from operations, income from continuing operations, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, net income and diluted net income per share as supplemental measures to reported results regarding our operational performance. These financial measures exclude the impact of certain items and, therefore, have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. The adjustments to these financial measures, and the basis for such adjustments, are outlined below:
Share-Based Compensation Expense
We incur expense related to share-based compensation included in the reported presentation of cost of sales, research and development, selling and marketing, general and administrative expense. Although share-based compensation is an expense and viewed as a form of compensation, these expenses vary in amount from period to period, and are affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within our control, such as the market price and volatility of our shares, risk-free interest rates, and the expected term and forfeiture rates of the awards. Share-based compensation expense is calculated as of the grant date of each share-based award, and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the grant date. Our management team believes that exclusion of these expenses allows comparisons of operating results that are consistent between periods and allows
comparisons of our operating results to those of other companies that disclose non-GAAP financial measures that exclude share-based compensation.
B-K Distributor Matter Inquiry-Related Costs
As previously disclosed in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2011, the Company has identified transactions involving our Danish subsidiary, BK Medical, and certain of its foreign distributors, with respect to which the Company has raised questions concerning compliance with law and the Company's business policies. The Company has concluded that the identified transactions have been properly accounted for in our reported financial statements in all material respects. During the three and six months ended January 31, 2012 we incurred $207,000 and $1,204,000, respectively of inquiry-related costs.
Acquisition Related Expenses
We incur amortization of intangibles and other expenses related to acquisitions we have made in recent years. The intangible assets are valued at the time of acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed after the acquisition. During the three and six months ended January 31, 2011, our results included accounting items related to an acquisition of an OEM ultrasound transducer and probe product line. The acquisition accounting items included a bargain purchase gain (i.e. the acquired assets exceeded the amount to be paid for the acquisition) of $1,042,000 recorded in general and administrative expenses within operating income. During the three and six months ended January 31, 2012 our results included an adjustment to contingent consideration for the acquisition of an OEM ultrasound transducer and probe product line of $43,000. We believe the exclusion of this gain and acquisition related expenses allow comparisons of operating results that are consistent over time for both our newly acquired and long-held businesses.
Restructuring
During the three months ended October 31, 2010, we initiated a plan to reduce our work force by 104 employees worldwide as we continue to streamline our operations and consolidate our Denmark and Canton, Mass. manufacturing operations into our existing U.S. facilities. The total cost, including severance and personnel related costs, was $3,562,000 and was recorded as an operating expense during the three months ended October 31, 2010.
Gain on sale of other investments
On July 25, 2011, we entered into an agreement to sell our 25% interest in our China-based affiliate for $2,500,000. The book value of our interest in the China-based affiliate was written down to $0 in fiscal 2006, and we, upon final approval of the transaction by the Chinese government, recorded a gain of $2,500,000 in the three and six months ended January 31, 2012.
Taxes
For purposes of calculating non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, we adjust the provision (benefit from) for income taxes to tax effect the non-GAAP adjustments described above as they have a significant impact on our income tax provision (benefit). In addition, from time-to-time, we recognize certain non-recurring tax adjustments. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2012, we received a refund of $12,007,000 as the result of the completion of an Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") audit of federal income tax returns for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2003, 2005, and 2008. The refund was largely the result of Federal research and
experimentation credits that carryover from the fiscal years 1991 through 2000 into the audited returns. We recorded a tax benefit for this refund, including the related interest, in the unaudited Consolidated Statement of Operations of $10,025,000 in the three and six months ended January 31, 2012. The tax benefit from the refund and interest were partially offset by related contingent professional fees of $2,714,000 recorded in general and administrative expenses within income from operations in the unaudited Consolidated Statement of Operations in the three and six months ended January 31, 2012. As these adjustments do not reflect the underlying performance of the business they have been excluded from non-GAAP net income.
We exclude the above-described expenses, their related tax impact and other non-recurring tax benefits in evaluating short-term and long-term operating trends in our operations, and allocating resources to various initiatives and operational requirements. We believe that these non-GAAP financial adjustments are useful to investors because they allow investors to evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making.
These non-GAAP financial measures have not been prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information provided in accordance with GAAP. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be computed in the same manner as similarly titled measures used by other companies.
The following table reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.

For the period starting on the Separation Date and continuing for 16 weeks thereafter, through and including November 19, 2012 (the "Severance Period"), the Company shall pay Mr. Melson regular amounts equal to what was formerly his regular base salary, at the rate in effect on the Separation Date, less legally required and voluntarily authorized deductions and withholdings (the "Severance Pay"). The Severance Pay shall be paid to Mr. Melson in accordance with the Company's customary payroll practices beginning promptly after the Separation Date, but in no event before the Effective Date (as defined in Section 16 of this Agreement). For the avoidance of doubt, the aggregate amount of Severance Pay will be $73,117.92, before legally required and voluntarily authorized deductions and withholdings. In addition, the Company shall continue to pay the employer portion of Mr. Melson's group health (medical and dental) insurance and group life insurance premiums for continuing coverage during the Severance Period (the "Health Benefit"). Mr. Melson hereby acknowledges and agrees that the Severance Pay will provide him with at least four (4) weeks more in salary continuation than he would otherwise be entitled to under the standard practices ordinarily applicable to management employees of the Company whose employment terminates under similar circumstances, and that the Health Benefit will provide him with at least four (4) weeks more in employer-paid group health insurance and group life insurance premiums than he would otherwise be entitled to under such standard practices.
b. Per the terms of the Analogic Corporation Annual Incentive Plan (the "Plan"), Mr. Melson will be eligible to receive a bonus award for Fiscal Year 2012. Mr. Melson's award will be based on the actual performance of Analogic Corporation and calculated in accordance with the Plan. His "Eligible Base Earnings" for the Plan
 
year will be based upon the amount of base salary payments made through Company payroll from the beginning of Fiscal Year 2012 through the Separation Date. For the avoidance of doubt, Mr. Melson will be eligible to receive a bonus award for Fiscal Year 2012 notwithstanding whether, at his sole discretion, he ceases employment with the Company prior to July 31, 2012.
c. Any unpaid portions of the Severance Pay described in Section 3(a) of this Agreement shall be paid to Mr. Melson's estate in the event of his death, on the condition that he has signed this Agreement and executed the Release in accordance with the provisions of Section 13(b) below and has not exercised his right to revoke the Release under Section 14 of this Agreement.
d. The Company will provide Mr. Melson with six months of career transition services through New Directions, Inc. The cost of providing such services shall be borne by the Company.
e. Any outstanding stock awards shall vest (or the restrictions shall lapse, as the case may be) according to the schedule attached hereto as Exhibit B. For the avoidance of doubt, Mr. Melson may, at his sole discretion, cease employment with the Company prior to July 31, 2012, and any such cessation of employment shall be treated as a termination by the Company without cause and shall not affect his right to vesting (or lapsing of restrictions, as the case may be) according to the schedule attached hereto as Exhibit B; provided, however the number of shares vested shall be adjusted to reflect the Separation Date. Except as expressly modified in this Section 3(e), all other terms and conditions pertaining to the respective stock awards will remain in full force and effect.
f. Mr. Melson recognizes and agrees that the provisions of this Section 3 and the other provisions of this Agreement would fully satisfy, discharge and exceed any obligation the Company might have to provide Mr. Melson with "Severance Benefits" under the Severance Plan if Mr. Melson did not waive and relinquish his rights thereunder pursuant to Section 1 of this Agreement.
4. .
Continuation of Certain Benefits
a. Mr. Melson shall have all rights provided under federal or state law to continue participation in any group health (medical and dental) and life insurance plan sponsored by the Company in which he was a primary participant during his employment with the Company. After the end of the Severance Period, if Mr. Melson elects to continue his participation in the Company's group health (medical and dental) plans under the federal Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 ("COBRA"), he shall sign and return to the Company within the time limits provided under COBRA the forms that he will receive under separate cover. Mr. Melson's ability to elect to continue health insurance coverage under COBRA's provisions and life insurance coverage shall be determined in accordance with the governing insurance policies.
 
b. Except as may be otherwise provided in this Agreement, Mr. Melson's right to any and all Company benefits will terminate on the Separation Date.
5. . Mr. Melson expressly acknowledges and agrees to return to the Company, and not retain, all Company files and documents (and any copies thereof in any form or media) and Company property, including without limitation, any Company credit card, cell phone, BlackBerry or similar device, computer, keys, key cards and vehicles Mr. Melson further expressly acknowledges and agrees that he shall abide by any and all contractual, common law and/or statutory obligations relating to protection and non-disclosure of the Company's trade secrets and/or confidential and proprietary documents and information.

6. . Mr. Melson agrees to leave intact all electronic Company documents, including those that he developed or helped to develop during his employment, and agrees to deliver to the Company on the Separation Date and earlier upon request the computer media on which such documents are stored and all passwords and keys necessary to access such documents. Mr. Melson warrants and represents to the Company that he has not concealed, falsified, deleted, destroyed, or altered any documents, emails, or other records of the Company, and that he has not copied any such materials without written permission from the Company, except as may be authorized by the Company's written policies.

This Agreement shall not limit any obligations that he may have under any other agreements that he may have with the Company, which he hereby reaffirms, nor any obligations he may have under applicable state or federal law or any other agreements that he may have with the Company. Mr. Melson acknowledges and reaffirms his obligations under his Proprietary Information and Inventions Agreement with the Company that was effective March 13, 2006 (the "Proprietary Information Agreement"), which shall continue in full force and effect. Any provision of this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, nothing in this Agreement is intended to waive any provision of the Proprietary Information Agreement.

Mr. Melson acknowledges and reaffirms his obligations under the Non-Competition Covenants of his Restricted Stock Unit Agreements with the Company for FY 2012, which shall continue in full force and effect.
No Solicitation or Disparagement; Competition
13. .

This Agreement supersedes all prior or contemporaneous discussions, communications, understandings, negotiations, and agreements, whether written or oral, with respect to Mr. Melson's employment at the Company, termination of that employment, and all related matters, except as may otherwise be stated in this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, neither this Agreement nor the Release supersedes the Proprietary Information Agreement, which continues in full force and effect.

This Agreement, including the Release, may only be modified or amended by a writing signed by an authorized officer of the Company and by Mr. Melson.
Entire Agreement
 
24. .
Compliance with Code Section 409A
a. . It is intended that this Agreement comply with the requirements of, or qualify for an exemption from, Code Section 409A and the guidance issued thereunder. Any payments that qualify for the "short-term deferral" exception or another exception under Code Section 409A will be paid under the applicable exception. In no event may Mr. Melson, directly or indirectly, designate the calendar year of any payment under this Agreement. Within the time period permitted by the applicable law, the Company may, in consultation with Mr. Melson, modify this Agreement in order to cause the provisions of the Agreement to comply with the requirements of Code Section 409A, so as to avoid the imposition of taxes and penalties.
General
b. . Despite any contrary provision of this Agreement, all reimbursements and in-kind benefits provided under this Agreement will be made or provided in accordance with the requirements of Code Section 409A, including, where applicable, the requirement that (w) any reimbursement is for expenses incurred during Mr. Melson's lifetime (or during a shorter period of time specified in this Agreement); (x) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in kind benefits provided, during a calendar year may not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in kind benefits to be provided, in any other calendar year; (y) the reimbursement of an eligible expense will be made no later than the last day of the calendar year following the year in which the expense is incurred; and (z) the right to reimbursement or in kind benefits is not subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit.
In-Kind Benefits and Reimbursements
c. . Despite any contrary provision of this Agreement, if Mr. Melson is considered a "specified employee" for purposes of Section 409A (as determined in accordance with the methodology established by the Company as in effect on the date of termination), (x) any payment that constitutes nonqualified deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code that is otherwise due to Mr. Melson under this Agreement during the six-month period following his separation from service (as determined in accordance with Section 409A of the Code) will be accumulated and paid to Mr. Melson on the first business day of the seventh month following his separation from service (the "Delayed Payment Date") and (y) in the event any equity compensation awards held by Mr. Melson that vest upon termination of Mr. Melson's employment constitute nonqualified deferred compensation within the meaning of Code Section 409A, the delivery of shares of common stock (or cash) as applicable in settlement of such awards shall be made on the earliest permissible payment date (including the Delayed Payment Date) or event under Code Section 409A on which the shares (or cash) would otherwise be delivered or paid. Mr. Melson will be entitled to interest on any delayed cash payments from the date of termination to the Delayed Payment Date at a rate equal to the applicable federal short-term rate in effect under Code Section 1274(d) for the month in which the Melson's separation from service occurs. If Mr. Melson dies during the postponement period, the amounts and entitlements delayed on account of Section 409A shall be paid to the personal representative of his estate on the first to occur of the Delayed Payment Date or 30 days after the date of his death.
Delay of Payments
 
d. . Despite any contrary provision of this Agreement, any references to termination of employment or Mr. Melson's date of termination shall mean and refer to the date of his "separation from service," as that term is defined in Section 409A of the Code and Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(h). Mr. Melson and Analogic agree and anticipate that the level of bona fide services performed by Mr. Melson after the Separation Date shall be permanently decreased beneath the level set forth in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(h) to constitute a "separation from service" of Mr. Melson from Analogic.
Separate Payments
In Witness Whereof, the parties have executed this Agreement under seal by their signatures below.

PEABODY, Mass. (June 6, 2012)  Analogic Corporation (Nasdaq:ALOG), enabling the world's medical imaging and aviation security technology, today announced results for its third quarter ended April 30, 2012.
Highlights during the third quarter (comparisons are against Q3 of fiscal 2011) included:
 
 
 
 
 
 
Revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2012 was $121.3 million, an increase of 3% compared with revenue of $117.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2011. GAAP net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2012 was $7.3 million, or $0.59 per diluted share, compared with net income of $4.3 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, in the third quarter of fiscal 2011.
Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter was $9.4 million, or $0.76 per diluted share, compared with $6.7 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, from the third quarter of fiscal 2011. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is included as an attachment to this press release.
 
 
For the first nine months of fiscal 2012, revenues totaled $365.6 million, up 8% from the same period in the prior year. Year-to-date GAAP net income was $31.0 million, or $2.45 per diluted share, up 154% and 153% respectively, from the same period of fiscal 2011. Year-to-date non-GAAP net income was $28.7 million, or $2.27 per diluted share, both up 49% from the same period of fiscal 2011.
Jim Green, president and CEO, commented, "New product introductions and our ongoing focus on cost control drove continued double-digit non-GAAP operating margins and non-GAAP EPS growth of 41% in our third fiscal quarter. Revenue growth in our higher margin Security and Ultrasound product lines more than offset Medical Imaging, which was challenged by changes in customer ordering patterns and by European economic head winds. We remain confident in our ability to achieve our previously stated financial goals for fiscal 2012."
Jim Green added, "We were also pleased to see Forbes magazine name Analogic one of America's Most Trustworthy Companies. This is an honor for our Company and we are very proud of this achievement."
Segment Revenue
Revenue from our Medical Imaging segment was $72.8 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2012, down 2% from revenue of $74.6 million in the same period of fiscal 2011. Year-to-date, Medical Imaging revenue was $220.7 million, up 4% from the prior year. Medical Imaging revenue was down slightly during the quarter due in part to changes in ordering patterns in CT (computed tomography), offset by continued growth in our MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) and digital mammography sales.
Our Ultrasound segment revenue was $33.9 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2012, up 5% from revenue of $32.4 million in the same period of fiscal 2011. Year-to-date, Ultrasound revenue was $109.6 million, up 16% from the prior year. The increase in Ultrasound revenue for the quarter was driven by a double-digit increase in sales in North America, offset by lower sales in Europe and an unfavorable foreign currency impact.
Security Technology segment revenue was $14.6 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2012, up 43% from revenue of $10.2 million in the same period of fiscal 2011. Year-to-date, Security revenue was $35.3 million, up 11% from the prior year. Product revenue grew 39% during the third quarter driven by increased demand for checked-baggage screening systems in North America.
Quarterly Cash Dividend
Analogic's Board of Directors, on June 4, 2012, declared a $0.10 cash dividend for each common share for its third fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2012. The cash dividend will be paid on July 2, 2012, to shareholders of record on June 20, 2012.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This document includes non-GAAP financial measures that are not in accordance with, nor an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles.
Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are limited in value because they exclude charges that have a material effect on our reported results and, therefore, should not be relied upon as the sole financial measure to evaluate our financial results. The non-GAAP financial measures are meant to supplement, and to be viewed in conjunction with, GAAP financial results. An explanation and a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures are provided at the end of this press release.
Forward-Looking Statements
Any statements about future expectations, plans, and prospects for the Company, including statements containing the words "believes," "anticipates," "plans," "expects," and similar expressions, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including risks relating to product development and commercialization, limited demand for the Company's products, risks associated with competition, uncertainties associated with regulatory agency approvals, competitive pricing pressures, downturns in the economy, the risk of potential intellectual property litigation, and other factors discussed in our most recent quarterly report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, the forward-looking statements included in this presentation represent the Company's views as of the date of this document. While the Company anticipates that subsequent events and developments will cause the Company's views to change, the Company specifically disclaims any obligation to update these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing the Company's views as of any later date.

UNAUDITED SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATIONRECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP MEASURES
We provide non-GAAP gross profit, operating expenses, income from operations, income from continuing operations, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, net income and diluted net income per share as supplemental measures to reported results regarding our operational performance. These financial measures exclude the impact of certain items and, therefore, have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. The adjustments to these financial measures, and the basis for such adjustments, are outlined below:
Share-Based Compensation Expense
We incur expense related to share-based compensation included in the GAAP presentation of cost of sales, research and development, selling and marketing, and general and administrative expense. Although share-based compensation is an expense and viewed as a form of compensation, these expenses vary in amount from period to period, and are affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within our control, such as the market price and volatility of our shares, risk-free interest rates, and the expected term and forfeiture rates of the awards. Additionally, a portion of our equity compensation is performance-based, which drives volatility in expense as estimated performance-based metrics are updated for actual and forecasted results. We believe that exclusion of these expenses allows comparisons of operating results that are consistent between periods and allows comparisons of our operating results to those of other companies that disclose non-GAAP financial measures that exclude share-based compensation.
BK Distributor Matter Inquiry-Related Costs
As previously disclosed in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2011, the Company has identified transactions involving our Danish subsidiary, BK Medical, and certain of its foreign distributors, with respect to which the Company has raised questions concerning compliance with law and the Company's business policies. The Company has concluded that the identified transactions have been properly accounted for in our GAAP financial statements in all material respects. During the nine months ended April 30, 2012 we incurred $1.2 million of inquiry-related costs and have excluded this amount from our non-GAAP results.
Acquisition Related Expenses
We incur amortization of intangibles and other expenses related to acquisitions we have made in recent years. The intangible assets are valued at the time of acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed after the acquisition. During the three and nine months ended April 30, 2011, our results included accounting items related to an acquisition of an OEM ultrasound transducer and probe product line. The acquisition accounting items included a bargain purchase gain (i.e. the acquired assets exceeded the amount to be paid for the acquisition) of $1.0 million recorded in general and administrative expenses within operating income. During the nine months ended April 30, 2012 our results included an adjustment to contingent consideration for the acquisition of an OEM ultrasound transducer and probe product line of less than $0.1 million. We believe the exclusion of this gain and acquisition related expenses allow comparisons of operating results that are consistent over time for both our newly acquired and long-held businesses.
Restructuring
During the nine months ended April 30, 2011 we initiated a plan to reduce our work force by 104 employees worldwide as we continue to streamline our operations and consolidate our Denmark and Canton, Mass. manufacturing operations into our existing U.S. facilities. The total cost of $3.4 million, including severance and personnel related costs, was recorded as an operating expense during the nine months ended April 30, 2011 and has been excluded from our non-GAAP results.
Gain on sale of other investments
On July 25, 2011, we entered into an agreement to sell our 25% interest in our China-based affiliate for $2.5 million. The book value of our interest in the China-based affiliate was written down to $0 in fiscal 2006, and we, upon final approval of the transaction by the Chinese government, recorded a gain of $2.5 million in the nine months ended April 30, 2012. This gain has been excluded from our non-GAAP results.
Taxes
For purposes of calculating non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, we adjust the provision (benefit from) for income taxes to tax effect the non-GAAP adjustments described above as they have a significant impact on our income tax provision (benefit). In addition, from time-to-time, we recognize certain non-recurring tax adjustments. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2012, we received a refund of $12.0 million as the result of the completion of an Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") audit of federal income tax returns for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2003, 2005, and 2008. The refund was largely the result of Federal research and
experimentation credits that carryover from the fiscal years 1991 through 2000 into the audited returns. We recorded a tax benefit for this refund, including the related interest, in the unaudited Consolidated Statement of Operations of $10.0 million in the nine months ended April 30, 2012. The tax benefit from the refund and interest were partially offset by related contingent professional fees of $2.7 million recorded in general and administrative expenses within income from operations in the unaudited Consolidated Statement of Operations in the nine months ended April 30, 2012. As these adjustments do not reflect the underlying performance of the business they have been excluded from non-GAAP net income.
We exclude the above-described expenses, their related tax impact and other non-recurring tax benefits in evaluating short-term and long-term operating trends in our operations, and allocating resources to various initiatives and operational requirements. We believe that these non-GAAP financial adjustments are useful to investors because they allow investors to evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making.
These non-GAAP financial measures have not been prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information provided in accordance with GAAP. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be computed in the same manner as similarly titled measures used by other companies.
The following table reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.

GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 was $12.1 million, or $0.96 per diluted share, compared with net income of $5.6 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011.
Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $16.6 million, or $1.32 per diluted share, compared with $10.3 million, or $0.83 per diluted share, from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is included as an attachment to this press release.
For fiscal 2012, revenues totaled $516.6 million, compared with revenues of $473.6 million in fiscal 2011, up 9%. GAAP net income for fiscal 2012 totaled $43.1 million, or $3.42 per diluted share (includes $8.3 million, or $0.66 per share, net benefit from a tax refund), as compared with $17.8 million, or $1.42 per diluted share, for fiscal 2011.

In addition, our fourth quarter results were very strong as we grew revenue 12%, to over $151 million, and grew non-GAAP operating margin by 5 points to 15% as compared with last year in spite of the challenging economic environment. These improvements in our business are a result of our new innovative products, expanded direct sales force, and improved worldwide operational efficiencies."
Green added, "Continuing to improve on our fiscal 2012 baseline, for fiscal 2013 we expect another year of high single-digit organic revenue growth on continued improving non-GAAP operating margin."

This gain has been excluded from our non-GAAP results.
Gain on sale of discontinued operation
During the first quarter of fiscal year 2011, we sold our hotel business, and realized net proceeds of $10.5 million after transaction costs. We recorded a gain on sale of the hotel business of $0.9 million, net of a tax provision of $0.5 million.

(e) On September 10, 2012 Analogic Corporation ("we", "us", "our") approved an annual incentive bonus program (the "FY13 AIP") for the fiscal year ending July 31, 2013 ("fiscal 2013"). For our executive officers, the FY13 AIP is based on the achievement of revenue, non-GAAP earnings per share, and return on invested capital targets. Under the FY13 AIP, each of our executive officers has been assigned a target cash award and has the opportunity to earn a maximum of two times the target based on performance relative to the criteria described above. Our non-GAAP earnings per share are based on GAAP earnings per share adjusted for certain items that we consider to be non-operating, non-recurring or of a non-cash nature, such as share-based compensation expense, restructuring charges, and acquisition-related expenses. No such item is used to calculate a non-GAAP measure without the approval of the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.
The target bonus under the FY13 AIP for James W. Green, our President and Chief Executive Officer, is 100% of his $540,750 base salary for fiscal 2013, or $540,750. The target bonus for Mervat Faltas, our Senior Vice President, Medical Imaging Business, is 50% of her $309,860 base salary for fiscal 2013, or $154,930. The target bonus for John J. Fry, our Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary, is 60% of his $341,433 base salary for fiscal 2013, or $204,860. The target bonus under the FY13 AIP for Michael L. Levitz, our Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Treasurer, is 60% of his $321,491 base salary for fiscal 2013, or $192,894.
On September 10, 2012, we approved a long-term incentive program (the "FY13-15 LTIP"). Each of our executive officers received a long-term incentive award under the FY13-15 LTIP consisting of the following components (i) restricted stock units that vest based upon achievement of a cumulative non-GAAP earnings per share performance target (the "EPS RSUs"), (ii) restricted stock units that vest based upon achievement of a relative total shareholder return ("TSR") performance target (the "TSR RSUs"), and (iii) nonstatutory stock options (the "Stock Options") that are subject to time-based vesting and will vest in three annual installments beginning on September 10, 2013 and ending on September 10, 2015. Relative TSR will be calculated based on our TSR relative to the performance of the Russell 2000 stock index.
The EPS and TSR RSUs vest based on the achievement of their respective performance targets over the three year period ending July 31, 2015. All RSUs earned based on achievement of the performance targets will cliff-vest on July 31, 2015. For our executive officers, performance is evaluated on a per-component basis. Accordingly, achievement in whole or in part of the relevant performance target of a performance-based component will result in the vesting of up to the target number of EPS or TSR RSUs awarded, as the case may be, based on pre-defined formulas. Above-target achievement of a performance-based component will result in vesting of up to twice the target number of EPS or TSR RSUs awarded, as the case may be, based on pre-defined formulas.
The table below summarizes the long-term incentive awards for our named executive officers under the FY13-15 LTIP:

Revenue Increase Driven by Medical Imaging and Security; Improved Operating Margin Over Previous Year
PEABODY, Mass. (December 6, 2012)  Analogic Corporation (Nasdaq:ALOG), enabling the world's medical imaging and aviation security technology, today announced results for its first quarter ended October 31, 2012.
Highlights for the first quarter (comparisons are against Q1 of fiscal 2012) included:
 
 
 
 
 
Revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2013 was $119.9 million, an increase of 2% compared with revenue of $117.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2012. GAAP net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2013 was $4.4 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, compared with net income of $4.0 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, in the first quarter of fiscal 2012. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter was $6.7 million, or $0.53 per diluted share, compared with $6.7 million, or $0.53 per diluted share, in the prior year's first quarter. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is included as an attachment to this press release.
Jim Green, president and CEO, commented, "Our business performance for the first quarter of fiscal 2013 exhibited typical seasonal fluctuations due in part to timing of hospital equipment purchases. While our overall revenue grew modestly during the quarter, our non-GAAP operating margins improved by 100 basis points compared with last year, due to our strength in pricing and continued focus on cost."
 
Green added, "In spite of market headwinds, we expect to achieve our stated FY 2013 financial goals of upper single digit revenue growth and 100 basis point improvement in full-year non-GAAP operating margin."
Segment Revenues
Revenue from our Medical Imaging segment was $76.0 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2013, up 5% from revenue of $72.7 million in the same period of fiscal 2012. Medical Imaging revenues improved during the quarter due largely to strong growth in MRI amplifier sales driven by migration to high-power wide-bore MRI systems. While CT revenues remained steady year over year, mammography and motion controls revenue declined during the quarter on market headwinds.
Our Ultrasound segment revenue was $31.7 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2013, down 8% from revenue of $34.6 million in the same period of fiscal 2012. Ultrasound revenue was unfavorably impacted by hospital purchasing hesitancy in the U.S., the short-term impact of U.S. sales territory adjustments as we expand sales force coverage, unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations, and distributor transitions in Eastern Europe.
Security Technology segment revenue was $12.2 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2013, up 15% from revenue of $10.6 million in the same period of fiscal 2012. Security revenue reflected continued growing demand for high-speed threat-detection systems for aviation security and increased customer funded engineering revenue.
Quarterly Cash Dividend
Analogic's Board of Directors, on December 4, 2012, declared a $0.10 cash dividend for each common share for its first fiscal quarter ended October 31, 2012. The cash dividend will be payable on December 28, 2012, to shareholders of record on December 18, 2012.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This document includes non-GAAP financial measures that are not in accordance with, nor an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles.
Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are limited in value because they exclude charges that have a material effect on our reported results and, therefore, should not be relied upon as the sole financial measures to evaluate our financial results. The non-GAAP financial measures are meant to supplement, and to be viewed in conjunction with, GAAP financial results. An explanation and a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures are provided at the end of this press release.
Forward-Looking Statements
Any statements about future expectations, plans, and prospects for the Company, including statements containing the words " believes," " anticipates," " plans," " expects," and similar expressions, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including risks relating to product development and commercialization, limited demand for the Company's products, risks associated with competition, uncertainties associated with regulatory agency approvals, competitive pricing pressures, downturns in the economy, the risk of potential intellectual property litigation, and other factors discussed in our most recent quarterly
report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, the forward-looking statements included in this presentation represent the Company's views as of the date of this document. While the Company anticipates that subsequent events and developments will cause the Company's views to change, the Company specifically disclaims any obligation to update these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing the Company's views as of any later date.

UNAUDITED SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATIONRECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP MEASURES
We provide non-GAAP operating income and margin, net income, and diluted net income per share as supplemental measures to reported results regarding our operational performance. These financial measures exclude the impact of certain items and, therefore, have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. The adjustments to these financial measures, and the basis for such adjustments, are outlined below:
Share-Based Compensation Expense
We incur expense related to share-based compensation included in the GAAP presentation of cost of sales, research and development, selling and marketing, and general and administrative expense. Although share-based compensation is an expense and viewed as a form of compensation, these expenses vary in amount from period to period, and are affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within our control, such as the market price and volatility of our shares, risk-free interest rates, and the expected term and forfeiture rates of the awards. Additionally, a portion of our equity compensation is performance-based, which drives volatility in expense as estimated performance-based metrics are updated for actual and forecasted results. We believe that exclusion of this expense allows comparisons of operating results that are consistent between periods and allows comparisons of our operating results to those of other companies that disclose non-GAAP financial measures that exclude share-based compensation.
BK Distributor Matter Inquiry-Related Costs
As previously disclosed in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2012, the Company has identified transactions involving our Danish subsidiary, BK Medical, and certain of its foreign distributors, with respect to which the Company has raised questions concerning compliance with law and the
Company's business policies. The Company has concluded that the identified transactions have been properly accounted for in our GAAP financial statements in all material respects. During the three months ended October 31, 2012 and 2011, we incurred $0.1 million and $1.0 million, respectively, of inquiry-related costs and have excluded this amount from our non-GAAP results.
Acquisition Related Expenses
We incur amortization of intangibles and other expenses related to acquisitions we have made in recent years. The intangible assets are valued at the time of acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed after the acquisition.
Taxes
For purposes of calculating non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, we adjust the provision for income taxes to tax effect the non-GAAP adjustments described above as they have a significant impact on our income tax provision. In addition, from time-to-time, we recognize certain non-recurring tax adjustments.
We exclude the above-described expenses, their related tax impact and other non-recurring tax benefits in evaluating short-term and long-term operating trends in our operations, and allocating resources to various initiatives and operational requirements. We believe that these non-GAAP financial adjustments are useful to investors because they allow investors to evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making.
These non-GAAP financial measures have not been prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information provided in accordance with GAAP. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be computed in the same manner as similarly titled measures used by other companies.
The following table reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.

Arrangement Agreement
On January 8, 2013, Analogic Corporation, a Massachusetts corporation ("Analogic"), 8385998 Canada Inc., a Canadian corporation and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Analogic ("Arrangement Sub"), Ultrasonix Medical Corporation, a Canadian corporation ("Ultrasonix"), and Scott Ratushny, Ronald Poelzer and Laurent Pelissier, solely in their capacity as the representatives of the Ultrasonix shareholders, entered into an Arrangement Agreement (the "Arrangement Agreement"), which contemplates the acquisition by Analogic of (i) all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Ultrasonix Medical Corporation (U.S.A.) and customer lists, intangibles and goodwill related solely to sales destined to the United States (the "U.S. Assets") and (ii) through Arrangement Sub, all of the outstanding equity securities of Ultrasonix pursuant to a "plan of arrangement" (the "Arrangement") under Canadian law (the "Acquired Securities"). Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Arrangement Agreement, which has been approved by the Boards of Directors of Analogic, Arrangement Sub and Ultrasonix, (i) Analogic will acquire the U.S. Assets and Arrangement Sub will acquire the Acquired Securities for total consideration equal to $83 million, subject to adjustment for unpaid transaction expenses, taxes, outstanding indebtedness, working capital and any change of control or similar payments, as detailed in the Arrangement Agreement and (ii) Ultrasonix will become a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Analogic.
The Arrangement is subject to customary closing conditions, including the approval of 66 2/3% of the votes cast by Ultrasonix's common shareholders at a meeting of Ultrasonix shareholders, the approval of the Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta and the attainment of all waivers, permits, consents, approvals or other authorizations from governmental entities as may be required for each party to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Arrangement Agreement. The dates for Ultrasonix's shareholder meeting for purposes of voting to adopt the Arrangement Agreement and for the closing of the Arrangement have not yet been determined, but the shareholder meeting and the closing of the Arrangement are expected to occur in late February, 2013. Pre-merger notification of the Arrangement under the United States Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and the Canada Competition Act is not required.
The Arrangement Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, covenants and agreements, including covenants with respect to the operation of the business of Ultrasonix and its subsidiaries between signing and closing, the absence of any development having (or that would reasonably be expected in the future to have) a "material adverse effect" on Ultrasonix, governmental filings and approvals, public disclosures and similar matters.
The Arrangement Agreement also provides for certain termination rights in favor of each of Analogic and Ultrasonix, including in the event of certain uncured breaches of representations and warranties or covenants by the other party and in the event that the Arrangement is not consummated on or before April 1, 2013.
In connection with the execution of the Arrangement Agreement, Analogic and Arrangement Sub entered into Support Agreements with certain shareholders of Ultrasonix beneficially owning in the aggregate approximately 67% of
the outstanding common shares of Ultrasonix as of the date of the Arrangement Agreement. Under the Support Agreements, the Supporting Parties have agreed during the term of the Support Agreements to vote all of their owned securities (i) in favor of the Arrangement, Arrangement Agreement and any other matter contemplated by the Arrangement Agreement and (ii) against any acquisition proposal or proposal that would delay, prevent or frustrate the Arrangement. All Supporting Parties, except for significant shareholders who are not employees of Ultrasonix or its subsidiaries or affiliated with directors of Ultrasonix or its subsidiaries, have also agreed (i) not to solicit or induce any person who was an employee or subcontractor of Ultrasonix or its subsidiaries on the date of the Support Agreement or the date the acquisition closes (the "Closing Date") to terminate his or her employment with, or otherwise cease his or her relationship with, Ultrasonix or its subsidiaries or to become an employee of such Supporting Party or any of its affiliates for a period of time commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the third anniversary of the Closing Date and (ii) not to hire or employ or use in any subcontracting arrangement any present or former employee of Ultrasonix or any of its subsidiaries for a period of one year from the Closing Date without the prior written consent of an authorized executive officer of Analogic or Arrangement Sub. In addition, the Support Agreements for certain of the Supporting Parties include restrictions on competition and the solicitation of customers of Ultrasonix or any of its subsidiaries for a period of time commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the first anniversary of the Closing Date in each country in which Ultrasonix or any of its subsidiaries has sold products or provided services at any time in calendar year 2011 or 2012.
The foregoing description of the Arrangement Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the full text of the Arrangement Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit 2.1, which is incorporated herein by reference.
The representations, warranties and covenants contained in the Arrangement Agreement were made only for the purposes of the Arrangement Agreement, were made as of specific dates, were made solely for the benefit of the parties to the Arrangement Agreement and may not have been intended to be statements of fact but, rather, as a method of allocating risk and governing the contractual rights and relationships among the parties to the Arrangement Agreement. The assertions embodied in those representations and warranties may be subject to important qualifications and limitations agreed to by Analogic and Ultrasonix in connection with negotiating their respective terms. Moreover, the representations and warranties may be subject to a contractual standard of materiality that may be different from what may be viewed as material to stockholders. For the foregoing reasons, none of Analogic's stockholders or any other person should rely on such representations and warranties, or any characterizations thereof, as statements of factual information at the time they were made or otherwise.
 
On January 8, 2013, Analogic issued a press release in connection with the proposed acquisition of Ultrasonix. The full text of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
Analogic has also prepared a slide deck that supplements the information contained in its press release. A copy of the slide deck is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2.
Forward-Looking Statements
Any statements about future expectations, plans, and prospects for Analogic, including statements containing the words " believes," " anticipates," " plans," " expects," and similar expressions, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Reliance should not be placed on any such statements because by their very nature, they are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties and can be affected by factors that could cause them to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Analogic can give no assurance that expectations will be attained. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including uncertainties as to the timing of the closing of the Arrangement; the possibility that various closing conditions for the transaction may not be satisfied or waived, including that a governmental entity may prohibit, delay or refuse to grant approval for the consummation of the transaction; the effects of disruption from the transaction making it more difficult to maintain relationships with employees, licensees, other business partners or governmental entities; other business effects, including the effects of industry, economic or political conditions outside of Analogic's or Ultrasonix's control; transaction costs; actual or contingent liabilities; uncertainties as to whether anticipated synergies will be realized; uncertainties as to whether Ultrasonix's business will be successfully integrated with Analogic's business; and other risks and uncertainties discussed in documents filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") by Analogic in its most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC, as updated by quarterly reports on Form 10-Q subsequently filed with the SEC. In addition, the forward-looking statements included herein represent Analogic's views as of the date of this report. While Analogic anticipates that subsequent events and developments will cause Analogic's views to change, Analogic specifically disclaims any obligation to update these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing Analogic's views as of any later date.

in reasonable detail (to the extent then known by the Buyer or Parent) the facts constituting the basis for such Third Party Action and the amount of the claimed damages. No delay or failure on the part of the Buyer or Parent in so notifying the Representatives shall relieve the Company Shareholders of any liability or obligation hereunder except to the extent of any damage or liability caused by or arising out of such delay or failure. Within 20 days after delivery of such notification, the Representatives may, upon written notice thereof to the Buyer and Parent, assume control of the defense of such Third Party Action with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer and Parent; that (i) the Representatives may only assume control of such defense if (A) they acknowledge in writing to the Buyer and Parent on behalf of all of the Company Shareholders that any damages, fines, costs or other liabilities that may be assessed against the Buyer or Parent in connection with such Third Party Action constitute Damages for which the Buyer or Parent shall be indemnified pursuant to this Article VI, (B) the ad damnum in such Third Party Action, taken together with the estimated costs of defense thereof and the Claimed Amount with respect to any unresolved claims for indemnification then pending, is less than or equal to the current balance of the Escrow Fund, and (C) an adverse resolution of the Third Party Action would not have a material adverse effect on the goodwill or reputation of the Buyer or Parent or the business, operations or future conduct of the Buyer or Parent and (ii) the Representatives may not assume control of the defense of any Third Party Action involving Taxes or criminal liability or in which equitable relief is sought against the Buyer or Parent or any of its subsidiaries. If the Representatives do not, or are not permitted under the terms hereof to, so assume control of the defense of a Third Party Action, the Buyer and/or Parent shall control such defense. The Non-controlling Party may participate in such defense at its own expense. The Controlling Party shall keep the Non-controlling Party advised of the status of such Third Party Action and the defense thereof and shall consider in good faith recommendations made by the Non-controlling Party with respect thereto. The Non-controlling Party shall furnish the Controlling Party with such information as it may have with respect to such Third Party Action (including copies of any summons, complaint or other pleading which may have been served on such party and any written claim, demand, invoice, billing or other document evidencing or asserting the same) and shall otherwise cooperate with and assist the Controlling Party in the defense of such Third Party Action. The fees and expenses of counsel to the Buyer and Parent with respect to a Third Party Action shall be considered Damages for purposes of this Agreement if (i) the Buyer or Parent controls the defense of such Third Party Action pursuant to the terms of this Section 6.2(a) or (ii) the Representatives assume control of such defense and the Buyer or Parent reasonably concludes that the Company Shareholders and the Buyer or Parent have conflicting interests or different defenses available with respect to such Third Party Action. Neither the Company Shareholders nor the Representatives shall agree to any settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any Third Party Action without the prior written consent of the Buyer and Parent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; that the consent of the Buyer and Parent shall not be required if the Representatives, on behalf of all of the Company Shareholders, agree in writing to pay any amounts payable pursuant to such settlement or judgment and such settlement or judgment includes a complete release of the Buyer and Parent from further liability and has no other adverse effect on the Buyer or Parent. Except as provided in Section 6.2(e) below, the Buyer and Parent shall not agree to any settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any such Third Party Action without the prior written consent of the Representatives, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

The Representatives may contest the payment of all or a portion of the Claimed Amount only based upon a good faith belief that all or such portion of the Claimed Amount does not constitute Damages for which the Buyer or Parent, as applicable, is entitled to indemnification under this Article VI. If no Response is delivered by the Representatives within such 20-day period, the Company Shareholders shall be deemed to have agreed that all of the Claimed Amount is owed to the Buyer or Parent, as applicable.

(d) During the 30-day period following the delivery of a Response that reflects a Dispute, the Representatives and the Buyer shall use good faith efforts to resolve the Dispute. If the Dispute is not resolved within such 30-day period, any party may commence an action to resolve such Dispute in a court of competent jurisdiction in the Province of Alberta in accordance with Section 9.11. If the Buyer is seeking to enforce the claim that is the subject of the Dispute pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, the Representatives and the Buyer shall deliver to the Escrow Agent, promptly following the resolution of the Dispute (whether by mutual agreement, arbitration, judicial decision or otherwise), a written notice executed by both parties instructing the Escrow Agent as to what (if any) portion of the Escrow Fund shall be distributed to the Buyer (which notice shall be consistent with the terms of the resolution of the Dispute).
(e) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section 6.2, if a third party asserts (other than by means of a lawsuit or a tax reassessment) that the Buyer is liable to such third party for a monetary or other obligation which may constitute or result in Damages for which the Buyer may be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article VI, and the Buyer reasonably determines that it has a valid business reason to fulfill such obligation, then (i) the Buyer shall be entitled to satisfy such obligation, without prior notice to or consent from the Representatives, (ii) the Buyer may subsequently make a claim for indemnification in accordance with the provisions of this Article VI, and (iii) the Buyer shall be reimbursed, in accordance with the provisions of this Article VI, for any such Damages for which it is entitled
 
to indemnification pursuant to this Article VI (subject to the right of the Representatives, on behalf of the Company Shareholders, to dispute the Buyer's entitlement to indemnification, or the amount for which it is entitled to indemnification, under the terms of this Article VI).

If the legal proceeding or written claim with respect to which an Expected Claim Notice has been given is definitively withdrawn or resolved in favor of the Buyer, the Buyer shall promptly so notify the Representatives. The rights to indemnification set forth in this Article VI shall not be affected by (i) any investigation conducted by or on behalf of the Buyer or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) by the Buyer, whether before or after the date of this Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect to the inaccuracy or noncompliance with any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation which is the subject of indemnification hereunder, or (ii) any waiver by the Buyer of any closing condition relating to the accuracy of representations and warranties or the performance of or compliance with agreements and covenants.

(b) Except for (i) claims based on fraud or Knowing Misrepresentation, (ii) claims based on a breach of any of the Fundamental Representations, (iii) claims under Sections 6.1(b) through Section 6.1(h), the Escrow Agreement shall be the exclusive means for the Buyer to collect any Damages for which it is entitled to indemnification under this Article VI from any Company Shareholder.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Buyer shall not attempt to collect any Damages directly from any Company Shareholder unless there are insufficient unclaimed Escrow Funds remaining to satisfy such Damages pursuant to the Escrow Agreement.

Per Share Price
This memorandum, including Schedule "A" attached hereto, is being sent to all holders of Options and is intended to provide holders of Options with an explanation regarding the treatment of your Options in relation to the Arrangement.
PLEASE BE ADVISED THAT THE SURRENDER OF YOUR OPTIONS MAY HAVE TAX CONSEQUENCES TO YOU. YOU SHOULD CONSULT YOUR OWN PROFESSIONAL TAX ADVISORS TO DISCUSS SUCH CONSEQUENCES.
Treatment of Your Options
You have a number of vested or unvested Options (or both), which were granted to you in your capacity as a director, officer or employee of or consultant to the Company or one of its subsidiaries. In connection with the Arrangement, the board of directors of the Company has authorized the accelerated vesting of all outstanding and unvested Options in order to provide you with the opportunity to exercise or surrender all of your Options immediately prior to the completion of the Arrangement.
With respect to all of your Options, including those for which accelerated vesting has been approved, the Company has agreed to offer you a cash payment (the "") for each Option equal to the "in-the-money amount" of such Option (less applicable statutory withholdings), such "in-the-money" amount for each Option being the estimated Per Share Price payable at the Effective Time (converted to the Canadian dollar equivalent based on the Bank of Canada noon exchange rate on the last business day preceding the Effective Date) less the exercise price of such Option.
Cash Payment Option
You are hereby cautioned that the exact amount of cash to be received for each Option will likely differ from the amount indicated above as a result of a number of factors including any difference in the actual amount of the Company's transaction expenses, working capital and net debt as at the Effective Time of the Arrangement from the assumed amounts indicated above.
The Company is also required to make certain statutory withholdings in respect of the taxable benefit arising from the surrender and cancellation of your Options, as solely determined by the Company. As a result, the Company will withhold from any cash payments to be received by you pursuant to the Cash Payment Option, an amount equal to the amount of withholdings that the Company is required to remit in connection with the surrender of your Options. By signing the Option Surrender Form attached hereto as Schedule "A", you are agreeing to surrender each of your outstanding Options (with effect immediately prior to the Effective Time) to the Company, in exchange for the right to receive that amount of cash consideration contemplated above (less applicable statutory withholdings). By signing the attached Option Surrender Form, you agree to accept such offer.
The signing of the attached Option Surrender Form does not affect your ability to exercise any vested Options in accordance with their terms prior to the Effective Time.
Upon receipt by the Company of your executed Option Surrender Form, you will have irrevocably agreed that effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, all of your rights, title and interest in relation to all of the Options held by you will be terminated, other than your right to receive the cash payment as set forth herein and in the Option Surrender Form, and you will have released the Company, Parent and the Buyer and their affiliates from any and all claims you may have in respect of all Options held by you.
If the Arrangement is not completed, the documentation evidencing the surrender of your Options in accordance with this memorandum and the Option Surrender Form and the irrevocable direction will be ineffective. You will not receive any payment for your Options and your Options will continue to exist (both vested and unvested) as if the Arrangement Agreement was never executed. For greater clarity, if the vesting of any of your Options was accelerated in anticipation of the Arrangement, those Options will revert to their previous vesting schedules.
You must complete the Option Surrender Form attached hereto (by signing at the bottom of each document where indicated) and return such forms to the attention of Don Wright of the Company at Fax:(604) 279-8559 or email: Don.Wright@ultrasonix.com, as soon as possible and in any event not later than

I hereby release the Company, Parent and the Buyer and each of their affiliates from any and all claims relating to my Options on the terms set out in the Memorandum.
I further understand that withholdings will apply in respect of the taxable benefit arising from the surrender of the Options, as solely determined by the Company, before the Company will process the surrender of my Options and I irrevocably direct the Company to withhold from any cash payments to be received by me pursuant to the Cash Payment Option, an amount equal to the amount of withholdings that the Company is required to remit in connection with the surrender of the Options.
I am aware of the restrictions imposed by the United States securities laws on the purchase or sale of securities, directly or indirectly, by any person who has received material, non-public information from the issuer of such securities and on the communication of such information to any other person when it is reasonably foreseeable that such other person is likely to purchase or sell such securities in reliance upon such information. Accordingly, I agree not to buy, sell, or otherwise deal in securities of Parent until three (3) trading days after the day on which Parent has publicly announced entering into the Arrangement Agreement.
I agree that the Parent and the Buyer are third party beneficiaries of my agreements and obligations under this Option Surrender Form.

PEABODY, Mass. (March 11, 2013)  Analogic Corporation (Nasdaq:ALOG), enabling the world's medical imaging and aviation security technology, today announced results for its second quarter ended January 31, 2013.
Highlights during the second quarter (comparisons are against Q2 of fiscal 2012) included:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2013 was $138.6 million, an increase of 10% compared with revenue of $126.4 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2012. GAAP net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2013 was $9.8 million, or $0.78 per diluted share, compared with net income of $19.6 million, or $1.59 per diluted share, in the second quarter of fiscal 2012. Included in our GAAP net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2012, as previously reported, was an $0.80 benefit to diluted net income per share due to a tax refund and a gain on sale of an equity interest.
 
 
Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter was $13.2 million, or $1.05 per diluted share, compared with $12.5 million, or $1.02 per diluted share, in the prior year's second quarter. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is included as an attachment to this press release.
For the first six months of fiscal 2013, revenue totaled $258.4 million, up 6% from the same period in the prior year. Year-to-date GAAP net income was $14.2 million, or $1.13 per diluted share, compared with $23.6 million, or $1.88 per diluted share, from the same period last year. Year-to-date non-GAAP net income was $19.9 million, or $1.58 per diluted share, compared with $19.2 million, or $1.53 per diluted share, in the same period last year.
Jim Green, president and CEO, commented, "We demonstrated very strong performance in our second quarter, in-line with our expectations, and we are on track to achieve our fiscal 2013 objectives. We saw solid demand in our Medical Imaging business for CT and MRI systems, driven by new product introductions. As we continued to drive direct end-customer sales, our Ultrasound business saw healthy growth in the U.S. and improvement in Europe. Lastly, our Security business achieved high double-digit growth as the market for high-speed threat detection systems accelerates."
"At the beginning of March, we completed the acquisition of Ultrasonix Medical, complementing our already strong Ultrasound product portfolio and sales channel, and accelerating penetration into the point-of-care market," Green continued. "We reaffirm our total company outlook for the year of upper single-digit revenue growth organically, and combined with the acquisition of Ultrasonix, we are targeting 10% revenue growth this fiscal year over last year. We also expect to improve annual non-GAAP operating margins by 100 basis points on a total company basis."

Revenue from our Medical Imaging segment was $80.7 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2013, up 7% from revenue of $75.3 million in the same period of fiscal 2012. Medical Imaging revenues were up during the quarter due primarily to strong growth in sales of CT and MRI products, offset by lower shipments of digital mammography detectors. Year to date, Medical Imaging revenue was $156.7 million, up 6% from the prior year.
Our Ultrasound segment revenue was $40.5 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2013, down 2% from revenue of $41.1 million in the same period of fiscal 2012. Higher direct sales in North America and Europe were offset during the quarter by lower OEM transducer sales and the impact of distributor transitions in Eastern Europe. Year to date, Ultrasound revenue was $72.1 million, down 5% from the prior year.
Security Technology segment revenue was $17.4 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2013, up 73% from revenue of $10.1 million in the same period of fiscal 2012. Security revenues were up during the quarter due primarily to strong shipments of high-speed threat detection systems as the market for high-speed threat detection systems accelerates. Year to date, Security revenue was $29.6 million, up 43% from the prior year.
 
 
Quarterly Cash Dividend
Analogic's Board of Directors, on March 7, 2013, declared a $0.10 cash dividend for each common share for its second fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2013. The cash dividend will be payable on April 2, 2013, to shareholders of record on March 22, 2013.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This document includes non-GAAP financial measures that are not in accordance with, nor an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles.
Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are limited in value because they exclude charges that have a material effect on our reported results and, therefore, should not be relied upon as the sole financial measures to evaluate our financial results. The non-GAAP financial measures are meant to supplement, and to be viewed in conjunction with, GAAP financial results. An explanation and a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures are provided at the end of this press release.

UNAUDITED SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATIONRECONCILIATION OF REPORTED (GAAP) TO NON-GAAP MEASURES
We provide income from operations, other income, net income, and diluted net income per share as supplemental measures to reported results regarding our operational performance. These financial measures exclude the impact of certain items and, therefore, have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. The adjustments to these financial measures, and the basis for such adjustments, are outlined below:
Share-Based Compensation Expense
We incur expense related to share-based compensation included in the reported presentation of cost of sales, research and development, selling and marketing, and general and administrative expense. Although share-based compensation is an expense and viewed as a form of compensation, these expenses vary in amount from period to period, and are affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within our control, such as the market price and volatility of our shares, risk-free interest rates, and the expected term and forfeiture rates of the awards. Our management team believes that exclusion of these expenses allows comparisons of operating results that are consistent between periods and allows comparisons of our operating results to those of other companies that disclose non-GAAP financial measures that exclude share-based compensation.
 
 
BK Medical Distributor Matter Inquiry-Related Costs
As previously disclosed in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2011, the Company has identified transactions involving our Danish subsidiary, BK Medical, and certain of its foreign distributors, with respect to which the Company has raised questions concerning compliance with law and the Company's business policies. The Company has concluded that the identified transactions have been properly accounted for in our reported financial statements in all material respects. During the three and six months ended January 31, 2013 we incurred $0.3 million and $0.4 million, respectively of inquiry-related costs.
During the three and six months ended January 31, 2012 we incurred $0.2 million and $1.2 million, respectively of inquiry-related costs.
Acquisition Related Expenses
We incur amortization of intangibles and other expenses related to acquisitions. The intangible assets are valued at the time of acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed after the acquisition. During the three and six months ended January 31, 2013 our results included acquisition costs for the Ultrasonix acquisition of $0.7 million. During the three and six months ended January 31, 2012 our results included an adjustment to contingent consideration for the acquisition of an OEM ultrasound transducer and probe product line of less than $0.1 million. We believe the exclusion of these acquisition related expenses allow comparisons of operating results that are consistent over time for both our newly acquired and long-held businesses.
Gain on sale of other investments
On July 25, 2011, we entered into an agreement to sell our 25% interest in our China-based affiliate for $2.5 million. The book value of our interest in the China-based affiliate was written down to $0 in fiscal 2006, and we, upon final approval of the transaction by the Chinese government, recorded a gain of $2.5 million in the three and six months ended January 31, 2012.
Taxes
For purposes of calculating non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, we adjust the provision (benefit from) for income taxes to tax effect the non-GAAP adjustments described above as they have a significant impact on our income tax provision (benefit). In addition, from time-to-time, we recognize certain non-recurring tax adjustments. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2012, we received a refund of $12.0 million as the result of the completion of an Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") audit of federal income tax returns for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2003, 2005, and 2008. The refund was largely the result of Federal research and experimentation credits that carryover from the fiscal years 1991 through 2000 into the audited returns. We recorded a tax benefit for this refund, including the related interest, in the unaudited Consolidated Statement of Operations of $10.0 million in the three and six months ended January 31, 2012. The tax benefit from the refund and interest were partially offset by related contingent professional fees of $2.7 million recorded in general and administrative expenses within income from operations in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations in the three and six months ended January 31, 2012. As these adjustments do not reflect the underlying performance of the business they have been excluded from non-GAAP net income.
 
 
We exclude the above-described expenses, their related tax impact and other non-recurring tax benefits in evaluating short-term and long-term operating trends in our operations, and allocating resources to various initiatives and operational requirements. We believe that these non-GAAP financial adjustments are useful to investors because they allow investors to evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making.
These non-GAAP financial measures have not been prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information provided in accordance with GAAP. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be computed in the same manner as similarly titled measures used by other companies.
The following table reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.

Item 2.05 Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.
On May 7, 2013, Analogic Corporation approved a plan of restructuring (which we refer to as the plan) to streamline our business and realize synergies following our acquisition of Ultrasonix Medical Corporation and to further optimize our overall operational footprint.
As part of the plan, we will close our ultrasound transducer operation in Englewood, Colorado. Activities at the Englewood facility will be consolidated with our existing ultrasound transducer operation in State College, Pennsylvania.
In addition to the plan, we previously commenced the process of consolidating manufacturing and certain support activities currently conducted at the Ultrasonix facility in Vancouver, Canada with operations at our existing facilities (which we refer to as the Vancouver manufacturing consolidation).
We expect to complete the implementation of both the plan and the Vancouver manufacturing consolidation by the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. With respect to the plan, we expect to incur total pre-tax charges of approximately $4.5 million, consisting of (i) facility-related charges, including charges in connection with the closure of the Englewood facility, of approximately $0.5 million; and (ii) employee termination charges, including charges in connection with the closure of the Englewood facility and optimization of our global operations, of approximately $4.0 million. With respect to the Vancouver manufacturing consolidation, we expect to incur employee-related charges of approximately $0.5 million.
Total pre-tax charges in connection with both the plan and the Vancouver manufacturing consolidation are together expected to be approximately $5.0 million. Of this amount, we expect to incur charges of approximately $0.5 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2013, $3.5 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, and $1.0 million in fiscal 2014. Substantially all of these charges will result in future cash expenditures.
This Current Report on Form 8-K contains statements that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by such forward looking statements as a result of various factors, including but not limited to employee separation and other costs that differ from the original estimates, the timing of future actions, and the factors discussed in our most recent quarterly report on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The forward-looking statements represent our views as of the date of this Current Report and should not be relied upon as representing our views as of any future date. We specifically disclaim any obligation to update these forward-looking statements.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

PEABODY, Mass. (May 13, 2013)  Analogic Corporation (Nasdaq:ALOG), enabling the world's medical imaging and aviation security technology, today announced a plan of restructuring to streamline its business and realize synergies following the acquisition of Ultrasonix Medical Corporation, and to further optimize its overall operational footprint.
The restructuring plan involves several elements, including the closure of an ultrasound transducer operation in Englewood, Colorado, and the consolidation of those activities with our existing ultrasound transducer operation in State College, Pennsylvania. In addition to this restructuring plan, we are in the process of consolidating manufacturing and certain support functions currently conducted at the Ultrasonix facility in Vancouver, Canada, with our other facilities. These activities will impact approximately 140 employees worldwide, principally in Englewood, Colorado and Vancouver, Canada.
We expect to complete these transitions by the end of fiscal 2014 and expect to incur total pre-tax charges of approximately $5 million. Of this amount, we expect to incur charges of $0.5 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2013, $3.5 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, and $1 million throughout fiscal 2014. The actions are expected to result in annual savings of over $6 million, a portion of which we expect beginning in fiscal 2014.
Jim Green, president and CEO, commented, "These restructuring activities are consistent with our ongoing strategy of leveraging our existing operational footprint and aligning our operations with our strategic objectives. Our Vancouver, Canada site will remain as the advanced development center for point-of-care ultrasound. The cost savings from these activities will enable ongoing investment in our advanced technologies while continuing to support our stated multi-year operating margin goals."
Michael Levitz, senior vice president and CFO, will discuss these restructuring activities during the Company's presentation to investors at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch 2013 Health Care Conference in Las Vegas, Nevada, on Tuesday, May 14. The presentation with question-and-answer session is scheduled to begin at 4:00 p.m. ET (1:00 p.m. PT) and will be webcast live. To view the presentation live or archived, please visit .

PEABODY, Mass. (June 4, 2013)  Analogic Corporation (Nasdaq:ALOG), enabling the world's medical imaging and aviation security technology, today announced results for its third quarter ended April 30, 2013.
Highlights during the third quarter (comparisons are against Q3 of fiscal 2012) included:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2013 was $125.8 million, an increase of 4% compared with revenue of $121.3 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2012. GAAP net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2013 was $5.2 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, compared with net income of $7.3 million, or $0.59 per diluted share, in the third quarter of fiscal 2012. Included in our GAAP net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2013 were $2.3 million of expenses (net of tax), or $0.18 per diluted share, associated with the acquisition of Ultrasonix and restructuring charges.
Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter was $9.6 million, or $0.76 per diluted share, compared with $9.4 million, or $0.76 per diluted share, in the prior year's third quarter. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is included as an attachment to this press release.
For the first nine months of fiscal 2013, revenue totaled $384.2 million, up 5% from the same period in the prior year. Year-to-date GAAP net income was $19.4 million, or $1.54 per diluted share, compared with $31.0 million, or $2.45 per diluted share, from the same period last year, which included a $0.79 benefit due to a tax refund and a gain on sale of an equity interest. Year-to-date non-GAAP net income was $29.5 million, or $2.34 per diluted share, compared with $28.7 million, or $2.27 per diluted share.
Jim Green, president and CEO, commented, "Our business continues to grow, even in this challenging market environment. Our Security business continues to demonstrate strong growth due to accelerating demand for high-speed threat detection systems outside of the U.S. Timing of shipments impacted our CT and MRI product lines in our Medical Imaging business, while digital mammography showed some modest growth. In Ultrasound, we successfully completed the Ultrasonix acquisition, implemented and stabilized the final sales structure, trained our reps on the full product portfolio, and are positioned for accelerating growth in our overall direct ultrasound business."
Green continued, "Given current market conditions and our Ultrasound transition to high margin direct products, we are revising our total company fiscal 2013 revenue guidance and now expect to generate mid to upper single digit revenue growth. We continue to expect non-GAAP operating margin improvement of 100 basis points over last year."
Segment Revenues
Revenue from our Medical Imaging segment was $71.6 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2013, down 2% from revenue of $72.8 million in the same period of fiscal 2012. Medical Imaging revenues were down slightly during the quarter due to unfavorable timing of MRI shipments and lower CT engineering revenue, offset in part by modest growth in digital mammography. Year to date, Medical Imaging revenue was $228.3 million, up 3% from the prior year.
Our Ultrasound segment revenue was $34.0 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2013, consistent with revenue in the same period of fiscal 2012. Sales of core procedure-driven surgery and urology ultrasound systems were flat compared with last year due to market headwinds and temporary sales force disruption as a result of our sales force expansion and channel integration following the acquisition of Ultrasonix in fiscal 2013. The acquisition of Ultrasonix added $3.4 million of revenue during the third quarter, which offset lower OEM transducer sales during the period. Year to date, Ultrasound revenue was $106.1 million, down 3% from the prior year.
Security Technology segment revenue was $20.1 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2013, up 38% from revenue of $14.6 million in the same period of fiscal 2012. Security revenues were up during the quarter due primarily to early production shipments of high-speed CT units for Smith Detection's new XCT system and continued strong demand for high-speed threat detection systems from L-3. Year to date, Security revenue was $49.7 million, up 41% from the prior year.
 
Quarterly Cash Dividend
Analogic's Board of Directors, on May 31, 2013, declared a $0.10 cash dividend for each common share for its third fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2013. The cash dividend will be payable on June 28, 2013, to shareholders of record on June 14, 2013.

UNAUDITED SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION  RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP MEASURES
We provide income from operations, other income, net income, and diluted net income per share as supplemental measures to reported results regarding our operational performance. These financial measures exclude the impact of certain items and, therefore, have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. The adjustments to these financial measures, and the basis for such adjustments, are outlined below:
Share-Based Compensation Expense
We incur expense related to share-based compensation included in the reported presentation of cost of sales, research and development, selling and marketing, and general and administrative expense. Although share-based compensation is an expense and viewed as a form of compensation, these expenses vary in amount from period to period, and are affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within our control, such as the market price and volatility of our shares, risk-free interest rates, and the expected term and forfeiture rates of the awards. Additionally, a portion of our equity compensation is performance-based, which drives volatility in expense as estimated performance-based metrics are updated for actual and forecasted results. Our management team believes that exclusion of these expenses allows comparisons of operating results that are consistent between periods and allows comparisons of our operating results to those of other companies that disclose non-GAAP financial measures that exclude share-based compensation.
 
BK Medical Distributor Matter Inquiry-Related Costs
As initially disclosed in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2011, the Company has identified transactions involving our Danish subsidiary, BK Medical, and certain of its foreign distributors, with respect to which the Company has raised questions concerning compliance with law and the Company's business policies. The Company has concluded that the identified transactions have been properly accounted for in our reported financial statements in all material respects. During the three and nine months ended April 30, 2013 we incurred $0.3 million and $0.7 million, respectively of inquiry-related costs. During the nine months ended April 30, 2012 we incurred $1.2 million of inquiry-related costs. There was no expense incurred during the three months ended April 30, 2012.
Acquisition Related Gains and Expenses
We incur amortization of intangibles and other expenses related to acquisitions. The intangible assets are valued at the time of acquisition, are then amortized over a period of up to several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed after the acquisition. We believe the exclusion of these acquisition related expenses allow comparisons of operating results that are consistent over time for both our newly acquired and long-held businesses.
Restructuring Charges
During our third quarter of fiscal year 2013, we commenced the process of consolidating manufacturing and certain support activities currently conducted at our Ultrasonix facility in Vancouver, Canada with operations at our existing facilities, which we refer to as the Vancouver manufacturing consolidation. The total cost, including severance and personnel related costs, we incurred as an operating expense in the three and nine months ended April 30, 2013 was $0.5 million.
Gain on Sale of Other Investments
On July 25, 2011, we entered into an agreement to sell our 25% interest in our China-based affiliate for $2.5 million. The book value of our interest in the China-based affiliate was written down to $0 in fiscal 2006, and we, upon final approval of the transaction by the Chinese government, recorded a gain of $2.5 million in the nine months ended April 30, 2012.
Taxes
For purposes of calculating non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, we adjust the provision (benefit from) for income taxes to tax effect the non-GAAP adjustments described above as they have a significant impact on our income tax provision (benefit). In addition, from time-to-time, we recognize certain non-recurring tax adjustments. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2012, we received a refund of $12.0 million as the result of the completion of an Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") audit of federal income tax returns for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2003, 2005, and 2008. The refund was largely the result of Federal research and experimentation credits that carryover from the fiscal years 1991 through 2000 into the audited returns. We
 
recorded a tax benefit for this refund, including the related interest, in the unaudited Consolidated Statement of Operations of $10.0 million in the three and nine months ended April 30, 2012. The tax benefit from the refund and interest were partially offset by related contingent professional fees of $2.7 million recorded in general and administrative expenses within income from operations in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations in the three and nine months ended April 30, 2012. As these adjustments do not reflect the underlying performance of the business they have been excluded from non-GAAP net income.
We exclude the above-described expenses, their related tax impact and other non-recurring tax benefits in evaluating short-term and long-term operating trends in our operations, and allocating resources to various initiatives and operational requirements. We believe that these non-GAAP financial adjustments are useful to investors because they allow investors to evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making.
These non-GAAP financial measures have not been prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information provided in accordance with GAAP. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be computed in the same manner as similarly titled measures used by other companies.
The following table reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.
