Date of Report
ITEM 9. Regulation FD Disclosure
Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On April 3, 2003, American Greetings Corporation ("the Corporation") reported its results for the fourth quarter and year ended February 28, 2003. The Corporation's earnings release for the fourth quarter and year ended February 28, 2003 is attached as Exhibit 99(a). The attached Exhibit is furnished pursuant to Item 9 and Item 12 on Form 8-K.
The earnings release contains non-GAAP financial measures. For purposes of Regulation G, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a registrant's historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statement of income, balance sheet or statement of cash flows (or equivalent statements) of the issuer; or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the most directly comparable measure so calculated and presented. In this regard, GAAP refers to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Corporation has provided reconciliations within the earnings release of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.
Adjusted EBITDA is presented in the earnings release because management believes that it is of interest to its investors and lenders in relation to its debt covenants, as certain of the debt covenants include adjusted EBITDA as a performance measure. The Corporation defines adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and certain other charges as specified in its debt agreements. Adjusted EBITDA does not represent cash flow from operations, as defined by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a substitute for net income or loss, or as an indicator of operating performance or whether cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs.
The other non-GAAP financial measures presented in the earnings release exclude charges related to initiatives that impacted the Corporation's results last year. These measures are presented because management uses this information excluding these charges in evaluating the results of the continuing operations of the Corporation and believes that this information provides the users of the financial statements a valuable insight into the operating results.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99(a) AMERICAN GREETINGS REPORTS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED NET INCOME AND STRONGER BALANCE SHEET FOR FOURTH QUARTER AND FISCAL 2003 ANTICIPATES EPS AND CASH FLOW IMPROVEMENTS, AS WELL AS DEBT REPAYMENTS, IN '04 REITERATES CONFIDENCE IN SENIOR MANAGEMENT TEAM; REAFFIRMS STRATEGIC DIRECTION CLEVELAND, Ohio (April 3, 2003) - American Greetings Corp. (NYSE: AM) today reported a $243 million year-over-year improvement in net income and a $107 million increase in its cash balance for the fiscal year ended Feb. 28, 2003. The Corporation also said it has funded its previously announced $143 million corporate-owned life insurance (COLI) net tax liability and announced its intent to repay its $118 million term loan in the first quarter of fiscal 2004. The Corporation achieved net income of $45.4 million, or 60 cents per share, on net sales of $525.9 million, for the fourth quarter ended Feb. 28, 2003. (Note: All per share numbers assume dilution.) This compares to a net loss of $13.1 million, or 20 cents per share, on net sales of $562.1 million in the fourth quarter last year. The 2002 fourth quarter and full year results have been reclassified to conform to EITF 01-09 (see Note 7). These results represent a $96.4 million improvement in fourth-quarter pretax income compared to last year. Excluding the $89.0 million of charges detailed in Note 8, pretax income increased $7.4 million, or 11 percent. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Morry Weiss said the Corporation's fourth quarter results show net income growth, despite sales shortfalls due to previously disclosed store losses. "Our prior year restructuring effort and ongoing initiatives to align our costs with our revenue base benefited our bottom line in the fourth quarter and throughout the year," Weiss said. For the full year, the Corporation reported net income of $121.1 million, or $1.63 per share, on net sales of $1.996 billion. Included in these results is a pretax gain of $12.0 million from the sale of an equity investment. This compares to a net loss of $122.3 million, or $1.92 per share, on net sales of $1.927 billion in the prior year. These results represent a $397.2 million improvement in full-year pretax income compared to last year. Excluding the $314.4 million of charges detailed in Notes 6 and 8, pretax income increased $82.7 million, or 70 percent. Excluding these charges and the pretax gain of $12.0 million on the sale of an equity investment, pretax income increased $70.7 million, or 60 percent. Adjusted EBITDA for the trailing four quarters was $344.7 million, compared to adjusted EBITDA for the year-ago trailing four quarters (which excludes charges) of $278.6 million. These results represent a $66.1 million, or 24 percent, improvement in full-year adjusted EBITDA. Excluding the pretax gain of $12.0 million on the sale of an equity investment, adjusted EBITDA increased $54.1 million, or 19 percent.
Adjusted EBITDA represents a non-GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) financial measure. A table reconciling this measure to the appropriate GAAP measure is included in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this release. Weiss said fiscal 2003 was a pivotal year for American Greetings. "We said at the outset of this year that our goal in fiscal 2003 would be to stabilize our business, and I'm happy to report that we have accomplished that objective," Weiss said. "We not only achieved our earnings per share estimates, but we also finished the year with a higher-than-expected cash balance and made improvements to our business that will reduce costs in fiscal 2004. In addition to these operational accomplishments, we also greatly enhanced our leadership team and established our vision for growth going forward." MANAGEMENT TRANSITION AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE As previously announced on Feb. 18, American Greetings has named Zev Weiss chief executive officer and has named Jeffrey Weiss president and chief operating officer. Morry Weiss, chairman and chief executive officer since 1992, will remain chairman of the board but will relinquish his role as chief executive officer in June. Jim Spira will resign as president and chief operating officer but will continue to serve as a member of the board of directors and as an advisor to management. "We believe these changes, coupled with the other key additions to our senior management team that we have announced throughout this year, position us to further develop and successfully implement our strategic vision for growth," Spira said. "We know our new team will provide the leadership to guide us through this pivotal period in our history and I look forward to working with both Zev and Jeff in my new role." American Greetings also announced today that Harry H. Stone, a member of the Corporation's board of directors since 1944, will become a director emeritus, effective June 1, 2003. At that time, Jeff Weiss will assume Stone's seat on the board, while Zev Weiss will fill a vacant seat. The Corporation's board maintains a majority of independent directors. In addition, its compensation and management development committee and its audit committee continue to be comprised entirely of independent directors. FISCAL YEAR 2004 ESTIMATES American Greetings expects its earnings per share for fiscal 2004 to be between $1.60 and $1.65. These estimates reflect previously disclosed store losses and gains. Due to the year-over-year impact of store changes, American Greetings expects stronger sales and net income results in the second half relative to the first half. These estimates also assume approximately $35 million of expenses to fund previously announced strategic initiatives during fiscal 2004. American Greetings also announced that it intends to utilize a portion of its current cash balance to pay off the entire outstanding amount of its $118 million term loan in the first quarter of fiscal 2004. In addition, the Corporation said it expects to generate more than $150 million in cash provided by operating and investing activities in fiscal 2004. "Our focus during fiscal 2004 will be on implementing the four key strategic initiatives - supply chain transformation, category innovation, strategic account management, and human capital development - that will serve as the foundation of our future growth," Zev Weiss said. "We have already taken steps in these initiatives at the end of fiscal 2003 with the announcement of our McCrory, Ark., distribution facility consolidation and with our management changes.
"We will continue to implement changes such as these throughout the coming year as a major component of our strategic vision for growth to further improve our operations going forward and to yield $50 million to $75 million in incremental pretax income over the next two years," Weiss added. CONFERENCE CALL ON THE WEB American Greetings will broadcast its fourth quarter conference call on the Internet at 10:30 a.m. Eastern time on Thursday, April 3, 2003. The live conference call will be accessible through the Investor Relations section of the American Greetings corporate Web site at http://corporate.americangreetings.com.

AMERICAN GREETINGS CORPORATION FOURTH QUARTER CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS FISCAL YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2003 (In thousands of dollars except share and per share amounts)
AMERICAN GREETINGS CORPORATION CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION FISCAL YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2003 (In thousands of dollars)
AMERICAN GREETINGS CORPORATION CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS FISCAL YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2003 (In thousands of dollars)
AMERICAN GREETINGS CORPORATION FOURTH QUARTER REPORT OF CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONS FISCAL YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2003 (In thousands of dollars except per share amounts) Note 1: Seasonal Nature of Business: A significant portion of the Corporation's business is seasonal in nature. Therefore, the results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results for the fiscal year taken as a whole. Note 2: Reclassifications: Certain amounts in the prior year financial statements have been reclassified to conform with the 2003 presentation. The Corporation adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 01-09, "Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer/Reseller" ("EITF 01-09"), effective March 1, 2002. As a result, certain amounts in the prior year financial statements have been reclassified. See Note 7 for further discussion. Note 3: Acquisitions: On September 12, 2001, the Corporation completed its acquisition of BlueMountain.com, a division of At Home Corporation, in a cash transaction. The consolidated results include the results of BlueMountain.com from the date of acquisition. On March 19, 2001, the Corporation completed its acquisition of all outstanding shares of Egreetings Network, Inc. ("Egreetings") in a cash transaction. The Corporation had previously held a minority interest in Egreetings. The consolidated results include the results of Egreetings from the date of acquisition. Note 4: Deferred Costs: In the normal course of its business, the Corporation enters into agreements with certain customers for the supply of greeting cards and related products. Under these agreements, the customer typically receives from the Corporation a combination of cash payments, credits, discounts, allowances and other incentive considerations to be earned by the customer as product is purchased from the Corporation over the effective time period of the agreement to meet a minimum purchase volume commitment. In the event a contract is not completed, the Corporation has a claim for unearned advances under the agreement. The Corporation periodically reviews the progress toward the commitment and adjusts the estimated amortization period accordingly to match the costs with the revenue associated with the agreement. The agreements may or may not specify the Corporation as the sole supplier of social expression products to the customer. The Corporation classifies the total contractual amount of the incentive consideration committed to the customer but not yet earned as a deferred cost asset at the inception of an agreement, or any future amendments.
Deferred costs estimated to be earned by the customer and charged to operations during the next twelve months are classified as "Prepaid expenses and other" in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, and the remaining amounts to be charged beyond the next twelve months are classified as "Other assets". A portion of the total consideration may be payable by the Corporation at the time the agreement is consummated. All future payment commitments are classified as liabilities at inception until paid. The payments that are expected to be made in the next twelve months are classified as "Other current liabilities" in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, and the remaining payment commitments beyond the next twelve months are classified as "Other liabilities". The Corporation maintains adequate reserves for deferred costs related to supply agreements and does not expect that the non-completion of any particular contract would result in a material loss. Note 5: Other (Income) Expense - net: During the year ended February 28, 2003, the Corporation sold an investment in a marketable security. The amount of the gain on the sale of $12,027 is included in "Other (income) expense-net" in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year. The amount of the proceeds received from the sale of $16,964 is included in "Other-net" investing activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended February 28, 2003. Note 6: Restructure and Other Charges: During the year ended February 28, 2002, the Corporation recorded a pretax restructuring charge of $56,715. This charge was for costs associated with the consolidation and rationalization of certain of the Corporation's domestic and foreign manufacturing and distribution operations, including employee severance and benefit termination costs. The restructure charge also included a charge for a change in the contractual relationship with a partner of the Corporation's Internet unit. The restructure charge included $29,053 for costs of severing employees, $2,054 for facility rationalization costs, $1,500 for lease exit costs, $17,727 for a change in the contractual relationship with a partner of the Corporation's Internet unit and $6,381 of other costs. The Corporation also recorded a pretax impairment charge of $37,000 to write-down goodwill related to its operating unit in Australasia. This amount is included in "Other (income) expense - net." In addition, the Corporation recorded a charge of $49,082 during 2002 to write down inventory in its domestic operations to net realizable value associated with its previously-announced initiatives and a $16,206 reduction in net sales for credits granted to customers for product on hand at their retail locations eliminated from the Corporation's brands and product lines. The inventory write-down is classified as material, labor, and other production costs. Also, $66,838 of other project-related costs associated with the restructure efforts were incurred during the year ended February 28, 2002.
The total pretax impact of these charges was $225,841. Also during the year ended February 28, 2002, the Corporation began implementing its scan-based trading business model with certain of its retail customers. The impact of its implementation was reductions in its net sales and material, labor and other production costs of $64,901 and $8,599, respectively, as well as implementation costs of $32,305, for a net pretax impact of approximately $88,607. The implementation was completed in 2002. The total pretax impact of these charges and the implementation of the scan-based trading business model was $314,448: Severance $29,053 Lease exit costs 1,500 Facility rationalization costs 2,054 Change in contractual relationship 17,727 Other costs 6,381 ----------- Restructure charge $56,715 Inventory write-down 49,082 Product line reduction 16,206 Scan-based trading initiative 88,607 Other administrative costs 66,838 Impairment loss 37,000 ----------- Total charges $314,448 Of the $314,448 incurred during the year ended February 28, 2002, $88,976 was incurred during the three months ended February 28, 2002, including restructure charge of $3,790. During the year ended February 28, 2003, the Corporation made payments of $15,603, principally for severance benefits. Included in "Accrued liabilities" at February 28, 2003 is $4,180 of costs not yet expended. The payment of certain termination benefits will not be completed until 2006. Note 7: Recent Accounting Pronouncements: In November 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") issued EITF 01-09, which addresses the accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including both a reseller of the vendor's products and an entity that purchases the vendor's products from a reseller. EITF 01-09 also codifies and reconciles related guidance issued by the EITF including EITF No. 00-25, "Vendor Income Statement Characterization of Consideration Paid to a Reseller of the Vendor's Products", and EITF 00-14, "Accounting for Certain Sales Incentives". EITF 01-09 outlines the presumption that consideration given by a vendor to a customer, a reseller or a customer of a reseller is to be treated as a reduction of revenue. The Corporation adopted EITF 01-09, effective March 1, 2002, as required. Certain amounts related to incentive payments, amortization of deferred costs
and other customer benefits have been reclassified in the prior year results to conform with the 2003 presentation. Those reclassifications resulted in decreases to material, labor and other production costs of $55,244 and $11,375 for the year and three months ended February 28, 2002, respectively; and selling, distribution and marketing costs of $373,150 and $82,858 for the year and three months ended February 28, 2002, respectively, with corresponding decreases in net sales in those periods. These reclassifications did not affect net income for those periods. On March 1, 2002, the Corporation adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets". This Statement, which supersedes APB Opinion No. 17, "Intangible Assets", eliminates the requirement to amortize goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, addresses the amortization of intangible assets with a defined life and addresses the impairment testing and recognition for goodwill and intangible assets. SFAS No. 142 applies to goodwill and intangible assets arising from transactions completed before and after the Statement's effective date. Upon adoption, the Corporation discontinued amortization of its goodwill in accordance with this Statement. For the year and three months ended February 28, 2002, the Corporation's results included $12,389 and $2,912, respectively, of amortization expense related to goodwill included in "Other (income) expense - net" in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. In addition, this Statement requires goodwill to be tested for impairment at least annually at a level of reporting defined in the Statement as a "reporting unit". The Corporation completed the first step of the traditional impairment test for goodwill during the three months ended August 31, 2002 and determined there were no indicators of impairment as of March 1, 2002. The Corporation completed its annual test for impairment on December 2, 2002 and did not record an impairment charge for goodwill in 2003. In October 2001, SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets", was issued. This Statement, which supersedes SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of", provides a single accounting model for the disposal of long-lived assets. Although retaining many of the fundamental recognition and measurement provisions of SFAS No. 121, the Statement significantly changes the criteria that would have to be met to classify an asset as held-for-sale. Assets held-for-sale are stated at the lower of their fair values or carrying amounts and depreciation is no longer recognized. The Corporation adopted this Statement effective March 1, 2002. In April 2002, SFAS No. 145, "Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections", was issued. SFAS No. 145 is effective for fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002. SFAS No. 145 requires that debt extinguishment must meet the criteria under APB Opinion No. 30 to be classified as an extraordinary item. This Statement also amends SFAS
No. 13 to require sale-leaseback accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects similar to sale-leaseback transactions. The Corporation does not believe that adoption of this Statement will have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Corporation. In June 2002, SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Exit or Disposal Activities", was issued. SFAS No. 146 is effective for disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. SFAS No. 146 requires that liabilities for one-time termination benefits that will be incurred over future service periods should be measured at the fair value as of the termination date and recognized over any future service period. These liabilities should be adjusted for subsequent changes resulting from revisions to either the timing or amount of estimated cash flows, discounted at the original credit-adjusted risk-free rate. Interest on the liability would be accreted and charged to expense as an operating item. In the normal course of business, in the fourth quarter of 2003, the Corporation undertook numerous individual and independent cost reduction programs that included charges for employee severance costs. While none of the independent programs were material individually, aggregate severance costs of $8,864 for approximately 500 positions were accrued at the end of 2003. All severance is expected to be paid by the end of 2004. In November 2002, FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 45, "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others", was issued. FIN No. 45 elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued. It also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of FIN No. 45 are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002 irrespective of the guarantor's fiscal year-end. The disclosure requirements in FIN No. 45 are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after December 15, 2002. No additional disclosures are required by the Corporation related to this Interpretation. In December 2002, SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and Disclosure" was issued. SFAS No. 148 amends the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123 and requires expanded and more prominent disclosure of the effects of an entity's accounting policy in respect to stock-based employee compensation. The disclosure requirements in SFAS No. 148 are effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002 and for financial reports containing condensed consolidated financial statements for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2002. In February 2003, the Corporation adopted the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 148.
Note 8: Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures: This earnings release contains non-GAAP financial measures. For purposes of Regulation G, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a registrant's historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statement of income, balance sheet, or statement of cash flows (or equivalent statements) of the issuer; or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the most directly comparable measure so calculated and presented. In this regard, GAAP refers to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Corporation has provided a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The Corporation incurred several charges related to initiatives that impacted its results last year. As such, the Corporation generated pretax income excluding charges of $67.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2002. The Corporation generated pretax income excluding charges of $118.1 million for the full year in 2002. Below is a reconciliation of these results (in millions): --------------------------------- 2002 Fourth Year Quarter -------------------------------- Pretax loss $(21.1) ($196.3) Charges: Scan-based trading 4.2 88.6 Business reorganization 84.8 208.1 Internet contract changes 17.7 ----------- ----------- Total charges 89.0 314.4 ----------- ----------- Pretax income before charges $ 67.9 $118.1 =========== ===========
Certain covenants of the Corporation's debt agreements are based on calculations of adjusted earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). As such, adjusted EBITDA was $278.6 million for the full year. The Corporation incurred several charges related to initiatives that impacted its calculation of adjusted EBITDA last year. Below is a reconciliation of pretax income to adjusted EBITDA (in millions): -------------------------------- 2003 2002 -------------------------------- Pretax income (loss) $ 200.8 $(196.3) Interest expense 79.1 78.6 Depreciation & amortization 64.8 84.3 Charges - 312.0* -------------------------------- Adjusted EBITDA $344.7 $278.6 ================================ * Refinancing costs totaling $2.4 million are excluded in the calculation of adjusted EBITDA. Below is a reconciliation of "Cash provided by operating activities" to adjusted EBITDA. -------------------------------- 2003 2002 -------------------------------- Cash provided by operating $ 77.0 $ 36.4 activities Restructure and impairment charges 15.6 (74.5) 12.0 - Gain on sale of marketable security Deferred income taxes 24.5 (13.4) Changes in operating assets and 56.8 13.5 liabilities Interest expense 79.1 78.6 Income tax expense (benefit) 79.7 (74.0) Charges - 312.0 -------------------------------- Adjusted EBITDA $ 344.7 $ 278.6 ================================ EBITDA is presented in the earnings release because management believes that it is of interest to its investors and lenders in relation to its debt covenants, as certain of the debt covenants include adjusted EBITDA as a performance measure.
The other non-GAAP financial measures presented in the earnings release exclude charges related to initiatives that impacted the Corporation's results last year. These measures are presented because management uses this information in evaluating the results of the continuing operations of the Corporation and believes that this information provides the users of the financial statements a valuable insight into the operating results.

ITEM 9. Regulation FD Disclosure
Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On June 24, 2003, American Greetings Corporation ("the Corporation") reported its results for the first quarter ended May 31, 2003. The Corporation's earnings release for the first quarter ended May 31, 2003 is attached as Exhibit 99(a). The attached Exhibit is furnished pursuant to Item 9 and Item 12 on Form 8-K.
The earnings release contains non-GAAP financial measures. For purposes of Regulation G, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a registrant's historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statement of income, balance sheet or statement of cash flows (or equivalent statements) of the issuer; or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the most directly comparable measure so calculated and presented. In this regard, GAAP refers to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Corporation has provided reconciliations within the earnings release of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.
Adjusted EBITDA is presented in the earnings release because management believes that it is of interest to its investors and lenders in relation to its debt covenants, as certain of the debt covenants include adjusted EBITDA. The Corporation defines adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and certain other charges as specified in its debt agreements. Adjusted EBITDA does not represent cash flow from operations, as defined by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a substitute for net income or loss, or as an indicator of operating performance or whether cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs.

No.

 
EXHIBIT 99(a)
CLEVELAND (June 24, 2003)  American Greetings Corporation (NYSE: AM) today reported operating results in line with its estimate for the first quarter of fiscal 2004.
The Corporation achieved net income of $19.7 million, or 27 cents per share, on net sales of $454.3 million, for the first quarter ended May 31, 2003 (all per share figures assume dilution). These results compare to net income of $44.5 million, or 60 cents per share, on net sales of $484.2 million in the first quarter last year. Included in the prior period is a $12.0 million pretax gain due to the sale of an equity investment.
The Corporation's first-quarter results reflect the impact of several previously discussed factors, which reduced pretax income by approximately $27 million in the period. The items previously cited by the Corporation as reducing its first-quarter pretax income were:
Based on its improving credit profile, American Greetings has made modifications to the financial covenants within its senior secured credit facility including the elimination of its minimum EBITDA covenant. However, certain of the Corporation's remaining covenants incorporate EBITDA as a component of the calculation. EBITDA represents a non-GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) financial measure. A table reconciling this measure to the appropriate GAAP measure is included in the notes to the first-quarter report of consolidated operations included in this release. EBITDA for the first quarter of fiscal 2004 was $71.5 million, compared to $110.3 million in the prior period. Adjusted EBITDA for the trailing four quarters ended May 31, 2003, was $305.9 million, compared to adjusted EBITDA for the year-ago trailing four quarters of $324.4 million. Last year's first-quarter and trailing four-quarter adjusted EBITDA results include a pretax gain of $12.0 million due to the sale of an equity investment.
 
"Our first quarter performance is in line with our expectations," said chief executive officer Zev Weiss. The Corporation projects a loss per share for the second quarter of 13 cents to 18 cents, a quarter in which it has historically reported a net loss due to the seasonal nature of its business. The Corporation realized a net loss of $15.8 million, or 24 cents per share, for the second quarter ended Aug. 31, 2002. "Our supply chain transformation effort, which is focusing resources on key relationships and streamlining workflows, is on track to yield benefits later this fiscal year," said president and chief operating officer Jeff Weiss.

Exhibit 99(a) AMERICAN GREETINGS REPORTS IMPROVED SECOND-QUARTER RESULTS - EPS ahead of prior-year second quarter - Integration of 1,400 stores from major account on budget and on schedule - Supply chain transformation progress continues CLEVELAND (Sept. 25, 2003) - American Greetings Corporation (NYSE: AM) today reported results in line with its estimate for the second quarter of fiscal 2004. American Greetings realized a net loss of $9.7 million, or 15 cents per share, on net sales of $403.5 million, for the fiscal 2004 second quarter ended Aug. 31, 2003 (all per-share amounts assume dilution). These results compare to a net loss of $15.8 million, or 24 cents per share, on net sales of $396.9 million in the second quarter last year. The Corporation historically realizes a net loss in its second quarter because of the seasonal nature of its business. The Corporation reported net income of $10.0 million, or 15 cents per share, on net sales of $857.9 million, for the first half of fiscal 2004. This compares to net income of $28.7 million, or 41 cents per share, on net sales of $881.1 million, for the same period last year. Last year's first-half results include a $12 million pretax gain from the sale of an equity investment. EBITDA for the second quarter of fiscal 2004 was $17.6 million, compared to $10.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2003. EBITDA for the trailing four quarters ended Aug. 31, 2003, was $313.1 million, compared to EBITDA for the year-ago trailing four quarters of $339.1 million. EBITDA represents a non-GAAP financial measure, and is presented because certain of the Corporation's credit agreement covenants incorporate EBITDA as a component of their calculations. A table reconciling EBITDA to the appropriate GAAP measure is included in the notes to this release. MANAGEMENT COMMENTS AND OUTLOOK "Our second-quarter performance is in line with our projections," said Chief Executive Officer Zev Weiss. "We had a meaningful improvement in our second-quarter results, due in part to our focus on cost management. Our cost management efforts included supply chain benefits that offset their related costs within the quarter. We are pleased with the progress of the supply chain initiative to date. We are also pleased with the progress we are making in the conversion of 1,400 stores for a major account, a project that is on budget and on schedule for completion before calendar year end due to the exceptional effort of our associates." American Greetings projects earnings per share of 68 cents to 73 cents for the third quarter of fiscal 2004. The Corporation realized earnings per share of 62 cents for the third quarter of fiscal 2003.

AMERICAN GREETINGS CORPORATION SECOND QUARTER REPORT OF CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONS FISCAL YEAR ENDING FEBRUARY 29, 2004 (Unaudited) (In thousands of dollars except share and per share amounts) Note 1: Seasonal Nature of Business: A significant portion of the Corporation's business is seasonal in nature. Therefore, the results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results for the fiscal year taken as a whole. Note 2: Reclassifications: Certain amounts in the prior year financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the 2004 presentation. Note 3: Deferred Costs: In the normal course of its business, the Corporation enters into agreements with certain customers for the supply of greeting cards and related products. Under these agreements, the customer typically receives from the Corporation a combination of cash payments, credits, discounts, allowances and other incentive considerations to be earned by the customer as product is purchased from the Corporation over the effective time period of the agreement to meet a minimum purchase volume commitment. In the event a contract is not completed, the Corporation has a claim for unearned advances under the agreement. The Corporation periodically reviews the progress toward the commitment and adjusts the estimated amortization period accordingly to match the costs with the revenue associated with the agreement. The agreements may or may not specify the Corporation as the sole supplier of social expression products to the customer. The Corporation classifies the total contractual amount of the incentive consideration committed to the customer but not yet earned as a deferred cost asset at the inception of an agreement, or any future amendments. Deferred costs estimated to be earned by the customer and charged to operations during the next twelve months are classified as "Prepaid expenses and other" in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, and the remaining amounts to be charged beyond the next twelve months are classified as "Other assets". 6
A portion of the total consideration may be payable by the Corporation at the time the agreement is consummated. All future payment commitments are classified as liabilities at inception until paid. The payments that are expected to be made in the next twelve months are classified as "Other current liabilities" in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, and the remaining payment commitments beyond the next twelve months are classified as "Other liabilities". The Corporation maintains adequate reserves for deferred costs related to supply agreements and does not expect that the non-completion of any particular contract would result in a material loss. Note 4: Other (Income) - Net : During the three months ended May 31, 2002, "Other (income) - net" included $12,027 of income on the sale of a marketable security investment. The amount of the proceeds received from the sale of the marketable security investment of $16,964 is included in "Other" investing activities in the Statement of Cash Flows for the period. Note 5: Recent Accounting Pronouncements: In April 2002, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 145, "Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13 and Technical Corrections", was issued. SFAS No. 145 is effective for fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002. SFAS No. 145 requires that debt extinguishment must meet the criteria under APB Opinion No. 30 to be classified as an extraordinary item. This Statement also amends SFAS No. 13 to require sale-leaseback accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects similar to sale-leaseback transactions. The Corporation adopted this Statement effective March 1, 2003. During the three months ended May 31, 2003, the Corporation paid the outstanding balance of its $117,988 term loan and recorded a charge of $4,639 for the write off of the deferred financing costs and a premium associated with the early retirement of that loan. In December 2002, SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and Disclosure" was issued. SFAS No. 148 amends the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123 and requires expanded and more prominent disclosure of the effects of an entity's accounting policy in respect to stock-based employee compensation. The disclosure requirements in SFAS No. 148 are effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002 and for financial reports containing condensed consolidated financial statements for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2002. Beginning with its financial statements for the year ended February 28, 2003, the Corporation has adopted the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 148. 7
In January 2003, Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" was issued. Interpretation No. 46 provides guidance for identifying a controlling interest in a Variable Interest Entity ("VIE") established by means other than voting interests. Interpretation No. 46 also requires consolidation of a VIE by an enterprise that holds such a controlling interest. The effective date for this Interpretation for the Corporation is September 1, 2003. The Corporation has not yet determined the impact, if any, this Interpretation will have on the financial statements of the Corporation. In May 2003, SFAS No. 150, "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity", was issued. SFAS No. 150 establishes standards for how certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity are classified. This Statement requires that a financial instrument that is within its scope be classified as a liability (or as an asset in some circumstances). SFAS No. 150 is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. This Corporation has not yet determined the impact, if any, this Statement will have on the financial statements of the Corporation. Note 6: Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures: This earnings release contains non-GAAP financial measures. For purposes of Regulation G, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a registrant's historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statement of income, balance sheet, or statement of cash flows (or equivalent statements) of the issuer; or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the most directly comparable measure so calculated and presented. In this regard, GAAP refers to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Corporation has provided a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. 8
Certain covenants of the Corporation's debt agreements are based on calculations of earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). As such, EBITDA was $17.6 million for the three months ended August 31, 2003.

ITEM 7. Financial Statements and Exhibits. (c) Exhibits. The following is furnished as an Exhibit to this Report. Exhibit 99(a) - Earnings Release - Third Quarter Ended November 30, 2003. ITEM 12. Results of Operations and Financial Condition. On December 23, 2003, American Greetings Corporation ("the Corporation") reported its results for the nine months and third quarter ended November 30, 2003. The Corporation's earnings release for the nine months and third quarter ended November 30, 2003 is furnished as Exhibit 99(a) to this Form 8-K. The earnings release contains non-GAAP financial measures. For purposes of Regulation G, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a registrant's historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statement of income, balance sheet or statement of cash flows (or equivalent statements) of the issuer; or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the most directly comparable measure so calculated and presented. In this regard, GAAP refers to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Corporation has provided reconciliations within the earnings release of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Adjusted EBITDA is presented in the earnings release because management believes that it is of interest to its investors and lenders in relation to its debt covenants, as certain of the debt covenants include adjusted EBITDA. The Corporation defines adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and certain other charges as specified in its debt agreements. Adjusted EBITDA does not represent cash flow from operations, as defined by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a substitute for net income or loss, or as an indicator of operating performance or whether cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs.
SIGNATURE Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized. AMERICAN GREETINGS CORPORATION By /s/ Joseph B. Cipollone ---------------------------- Joseph B. Cipollone Vice President Corporate Controller Chief Accounting Officer December 23, 2003 EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibit No. - --- 99(a) Earnings Release - Third Quarter Ended November 30, 2003.

Exhibit 99(a) American Greetings Announces Solid Third-Quarter Results - Greeting card performance drives 4.6 percent net sales increase in quarter - Third-quarter results in line with estimate - Estimate for fiscal 2004 lowered to $1.48 to $1.53 per share - Corporation repurchases $64 million of high-yield debt CLEVELAND, Dec. 23 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- American Greetings Corporation (NYSE: AM) today announced results in line with its estimate for the third quarter of fiscal 2004. The Corporation also announced the repurchase of $63.6 million of its 11.75 percent subordinated notes. American Greetings reported net income of $46.4 million, or 60 cents per share, on net sales of $616.0 million, for the fiscal 2004 third quarter ended Nov. 30, 2003 (all per-share amounts assume dilution). Included in this quarter's results are $13.8 million in costs related to the debt repurchase. Excluding these costs, American Greetings realized earnings per share of 70 cents on net income of $54.1 million. These results compare to net income of $47.0 million, or 62 cents per share, on net sales of $588.8 million in the third quarter last year. The Corporation reported net income of $56.4 million, or 78 cents per share, on net sales of $1.5 billion, for the first three quarters of fiscal 2004. Included in the year-to-date results are $18.4 million of costs incurred in the first and third fiscal quarters for debt repurchases totaling $181.6 million. Excluding these costs, American Greetings realized earnings per share of 91 cents on net income of $66.7 million for the first three quarters. Last year, the Corporation reported net income of $75.7 million, or $1.03 per share, on net sales of $1.5 billion for the same period. Last year's results include a $12.0 million pretax gain from the sale of an equity investment. EBITDA for the third quarter of fiscal 2004 was $121.9 million, compared to $113.4 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2003. EBITDA for the trailing four quarters ended Nov. 30, 2003, was $321.6 million, compared to EBITDA for the year-ago trailing four quarters of $343.4 million. Last year's results include a $12.0 million pretax gain from the sale of an equity investment. EBITDA represents a non-GAAP financial measure, and is presented because certain of the Corporation's credit agreement covenants incorporate EBITDA as a component of their calculations. A table reconciling EBITDA to the appropriate GAAP measure is included in the notes to this release. Management Comments and Outlook "We are satisfied with our year-to-date performance, including our recent debt repurchases; however, despite strong sales and cash flow in the third quarter, early holiday sales are below our expectations," said Chief Executive Officer Zev Weiss. "This softness in our seasonal business will most likely impact our greeting card, gift wrap and retail operations in the fourth quarter. As a result, we are revising our earnings per share estimate for the full fiscal year 2004 to $1.48 to $1.53." Conference Call on the Web American Greetings will broadcast its third-quarter conference call live on the Internet at 9:30 a.m. Eastern time today. The conference call will be accessible through the Investor Relations section of the American Greetings Web site at http://corporate.americangreetings.com . A replay of the call will be available on the site.

Therefore, the results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results for the fiscal year taken as a whole. Note 2: Reclassifications: Certain amounts in the prior year financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the 2004 presentation. Note 3: Deferred Costs: In the normal course of its business, the Corporation enters into agreements with certain customers for the supply of greeting cards and related products. Under these agreements, the customer typically receives from the Corporation a combination of cash payments, credits, discounts, allowances and other incentive considerations to be earned by the customer as product is purchased from the Corporation over the effective time period of the agreement to meet a minimum purchase volume commitment. In the event a contract is not completed, the Corporation has a claim for unearned advances under the agreement. The Corporation periodically reviews the progress toward the commitment and adjusts the estimated amortization period accordingly to match the costs with the revenue associated with the agreement. The agreements may or may not specify the Corporation as the sole supplier of social expression products to the customer. The Corporation classifies the total contractual amount of the incentive consideration committed to the customer but not yet earned as a deferred cost asset at the inception of an agreement, or any future amendments. Deferred costs estimated to be earned by the customer and charged to operations during the next twelve months are classified as "Prepaid expenses and other" in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, and the remaining amounts to be charged beyond the next twelve months are classified as "Other assets". A portion of the total consideration may be payable by the Corporation at the time the agreement is consummated. All future payment commitments are classified as liabilities at inception until paid. The payments that are expected to be made in the next twelve months are classified as "Other current liabilities" in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, and the remaining payment commitments beyond the next twelve months are classified as "Other liabilities". The Corporation maintains adequate reserves for deferred costs related to supply agreements and does not expect that the non-completion of any particular contract would result in a material loss. Note 4: Other (Income) - Net : During the three months ended May 31, 2002, "Other (income) -- net" included $12,027 of income on the sale of a marketable security investment. The amount of the proceeds received from the sale of the marketable security investment of $16,964 is included in "Other" investing activities in the Statement of Cash Flows for the period. Note 5: Recent Accounting Pronouncements: In April 2002, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 145, "Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13 and Technical Corrections", was issued. SFAS No. 145 is effective for fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002. SFAS No. 145 requires that debt extinguishment must meet the criteria under APB Opinion No. 30 to be classified as an extraordinary item. This Statement also amends SFAS No. 13 to require sale- leaseback accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects similar to sale-leaseback transactions. The Corporation adopted this Statement effective March 1, 2003. During the three months ended May 31, 2003, the Corporation paid the outstanding balance of its $117,988 term loan and recorded a charge of $4,639 for the write-off of the deferred financing costs and a premium associated with the early retirement of that loan. During the three months ended November 30, 2003 the Company repurchased $63,630 of its 11.75% senior subordinated notes and recorded a charge of $13,750 for the write-off of deferred financing costs and the premium associated with the note repurchase. The write-offs for the deferred financing fees and premium related to these transactions were included in Interest Expense. In December 2002, SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation -- Transition and Disclosure" was issued. SFAS No. 148 amends the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123 and requires expanded and more prominent disclosure of the effects of an entity's accounting policy in respect to stock-based employee compensation. The disclosure requirements in SFAS No. 148 are effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002 and for financial reports containing condensed consolidated financial statements for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2002. Beginning with its financial statements for the year ended February 28, 2003, the Corporation has adopted the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 148. In January 2003, Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" was issued. Interpretation No. 46 provides guidance for identifying a controlling interest in a Variable Interest Entity ("VIE") established by means other than voting interests. Interpretation No. 46 also requires consolidation of a VIE by an enterprise that holds such a controlling interest. On December 17, 2003, the FASB completed deliberations of the proposed modifications to Interpretation No. 46; the decisions reached include: (1) Deferral of the effective date; (2) Provisions for additional scope exceptions for certain other variable interests; and (3) Clarification of the impact of troubled debt restructurings on the requirement with respect to VIEs. Based on the Board's decisions, all public companies must apply the provisions of the Interpretation or the Revised Interpretation to variable interests in a special purpose entity ("SPE") created before February 1, 2003 no later than periods ending after December 15, 2003. Companies are required to apply the revised provisions to variable interests in non-SPEs held in the entity no later than the end of the first interim or annual reporting period ending after March 15, 2004. The Corporation does not believe that this Interpretation will have a material impact on the financial statements of the Corporation. In May 2003, SFAS No. 150, "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity", was issued. SFAS No. 150 establishes standards for how certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity are classified. This Statement requires that a financial instrument that is within its scope be classified as a liability (or as an asset in some circumstances). SFAS No. 150 is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. This Statement had no impact on the financial statements of the Corporation. Note 6: Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures: This earnings release contains non-GAAP financial measures. For purposes of Regulation G, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a registrant's historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statement of income, balance sheet, or statement of cash flows (or equivalent statements) of the issuer; or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the most directly comparable measure so calculated and presented. In this regard, GAAP refers to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Corporation has provided a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Certain covenants of the Corporation's debt agreements are based on calculations of earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). As such, EBITDA was $121.9 million for the three months ended November 30, 2003. Below is a reconciliation of net income to EBITDA (in millions): Three Months Ended November 30 2003 2002 Net income $46.4 $47.0 Interest expense 30.6 19.6 Income tax expense 29.0 30.9 Depreciation and amortization 15.9 15.9 EBITDA $121.9 $113.4 Below is a reconciliation of "Cash used by operating activities" to EBITDA (in millions): Three Months Ended November 30 2003 2002 Cash used by operating activities $(4.0) $(163.3) Deferred income taxes 23.2 25.7 Changes in operating assets and liabilities 43.1 200.5 Interest expense 30.6 19.6 Income tax expense 29.0 30.9 EBITDA $121.9 $113.4 Below are reconciliations of net income (loss) to adjusted EBITDA for the four quarters ended November 30, 2003 and 2002 (in millions): Net income: Year ended February 28, 2003 $121.1 Less: nine months ended November 30, 2002 75.7 Add: nine months ended November 30, 2003 56.4 Net income, four quarters ended November 30, 2003 101.8 Interest expense, four quarters ended November 30, 2003 90.7 Income tax expense, four quarters ended November 30, 2003 65.5 Depreciation and amortization, four quarters ended November 30, 2003 63.6 Adjusted EBITDA, four quarters ended November 30, 2003 $321.6 Net income (loss): Year ended February 28, 2002 $(122.3) Less: nine months ended November 30, 2001 (109.2) Add: nine months ended November 30, 2002 75.7 Net income, four quarters ended November 30, 2002 62.6 Interest expense, four quarters ended November 30, 2002 78.8 Income tax expense, four quarters ended November 30, 2002 41.9 Depreciation and amortization, four quarters ended November 30, 2002 71.1 Charges, four quarters ended November 30, 2002 (see note below) 89.0 Adjusted EBITDA, four quarters ended November 30, 2002 $343.4 Note: Charges for the four quarters ended November 30, 2002 include the costs associated with the consolidation and rationalization of certain of the Corporation's operations, including employee severance and benefit termination costs, the implementation of the scan-based trading business model and other costs.

AMERICAN GREETINGS CORPORATION By /s/ Joseph B. Cipollone ----------------------- Joseph B. Cipollone Vice President Corporate Controller Chief Accounting Officer March 31, 2004 EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibit No. - --- 99(a) Earnings Release - Fourth Quarter Ended February 29, 2004.

Exhibit 99(a) American Greetings Announces Earnings Per Share for Fiscal 2004 in Line with Projections * Cash flow from operating and investing activities of $259 million substantially exceeds estimate * Corporation announces intent to make tender offer for 11.75 percent notes * Including tender, debt reduction over 13 months expected to total nearly $400 million CLEVELAND, March 31 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- American Greetings Corporation (NYSE: AM) today announced results in line with its December estimate for the fiscal year ended Feb. 29, 2004. The Corporation also announced its intent to make a tender offer for its 11.75 percent senior subordinated notes due 2008. American Greetings reported net income of $48.3 million, or 62 cents per share, on net sales of $535.0 million, for the fiscal 2004 fourth quarter ended Feb. 29, 2004 (all per-share amounts assume dilution). These results compare to net income of $45.4 million, or 60 cents per share, on net sales of $525.9 million in the fourth quarter last year. For the full year, the Corporation reported net income of $104.7 million, or $1.40 per share, on net sales of $2.0 billion. Included in the 2004 year- to-date results are $18.4 million in pretax costs ($10.4 after taxes) incurred in the first and third quarters for debt repurchases totaling $181.6 million. Excluding these costs, American Greetings realized earnings per share of $1.53 on net income of $112.2 million for the full year. The Corporation believes its results excluding these costs are useful for the purpose of providing a comparable analysis to the prior year. Last year, the Corporation reported net income of $121.1 million, or $1.63 per share, on net sales of $2.0 billion for the same period. Last year's results included a $12.0 million pretax gain from the sale of an equity investment. Tender offer American Greetings announced its intent to make a cash tender offer for all of its $196.4 million outstanding 11.75 percent senior subordinated notes due July 2008. The Corporation is undertaking this initiative in an effort to reduce its future interest expense and to increase its financial flexibility. The offer is subject to an amendment of the credit agreement for the Corporation's revolving credit facility. American Greetings anticipates receiving this amendment by the expiration date of the tender offer. The expected commencement date of this offer is April 14, 2004, and the expected expiration date is May 12, 2004. This press release constitutes neither an offer to purchase nor a solicitation of an offer to sell the notes. Additional details related to the intended tender offer are available in the Corporation's Form 8-K furnished on March 31, 2004. Management comments and fiscal year 2005 outlook Chief Executive Officer Zev Weiss said fiscal 2004 was a year in which American Greetings made substantial progress toward its long-term goals. "We are pleased that we achieved our revised earnings per share estimate and generated cash flow from operating and investing activities of $259 million," Weiss said. "Our exceptional cash flow enabled us to pay down $182 million of debt during fiscal 2004 and has left us with sufficient cash to eliminate our high-yield debt in the first quarter. With our tender offer, we expect to have reduced debt nearly $400 million within a 13-month period, which will result in long-term benefits in the form of interest expense savings." Weiss said the Company's focus on executing its strategic initiatives will remain its top priority. "While we have made meaningful improvements in our business over the past year, we will continue to focus on driving costs out of our supply chain in fiscal 2005," Weiss said. "We will also refine our longer- term strategy for growing our top line and will begin to implement some of our initial growth programs during the year." American Greetings anticipates its earnings per share for the first quarter of fiscal year 2005 will be between 29 and 34 cents. For the full year, the Corporation projects its earnings per share to be between $1.63 and $1.68. The Corporation has not included an estimate for the costs associated with its bond tender offer in its first-quarter or full-year projections. The Corporation also projects cash flow from operating and investing activities of approximately $200 million in fiscal year 2005. Planned stock sale by Chairman American Greetings announced that Morry Weiss, chairman of the board, has advised the Corporation that he may sell up to 800,000 shares of American Greetings class A and B stock, including shares subject to options, some of which the Corporation may buy back and place into treasury stock. Weiss, age 63, is considering these sales as part of a multiyear estate planning strategy. As reported in the Corporation's proxy, Weiss held 1.8 million shares and options in June of 2003. Weiss has also advised the Company that he may enter into a 10b5-1 plan to assist in the execution of this estate- planning strategy.

EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibit No. - --- 99(a) Earnings Release - First Quarter Ended May 31, 2004.

Exhibit 99(a) American Greetings Announces First-Quarter Results * Licensing contribution stronger than expected * Tender offer for high-yield debt successfully completed; will generate ongoing interest expense savings * Corporation adjusts EPS estimate for tender impact CLEVELAND, June 29 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- American Greetings Corporation (NYSE: AM) today announced its first-quarter results for the fiscal year ending Feb. 28, 2005. Despite soft sales, the Corporation slightly exceeded its earnings estimate due in part to a stronger-than-expected earnings contribution from its outbound licensed properties. The Corporation reported net income of $4.2 million, or 6 cents per basic share, on net sales of $445.7 million, for the fiscal 2005 first quarter ended May 31, 2004. This compares to reported net income of $19.7 million, on net sales of $454.3 million, for the fiscal 2004 first quarter ended May 31, 2003. Included in the fiscal 2005 results are $39.0 million in pretax costs ($23.9 million after tax) incurred during the quarter for debt repurchases totaling $186.2 million. Last year's results include $4.6 million of pretax costs ($2.8 million after tax) associated with the early pay down of $118.0 million of term debt. Excluding after-tax costs associated with debt repurchases from both periods, American Greetings would have achieved net income of $28.1 million this year, compared to $22.5 million in the first quarter last year. The Corporation believes its results excluding these costs are useful for the purpose of providing a comparable analysis of operating results for the two periods. Tender offer completed During the quarter, American Greetings successfully completed a tender offer for $186.2 million of its $196.4 million outstanding 11.75 percent senior subordinated notes due July 2008. While this initiative reduced net income in the quarter, it will reduce its future interest expense and increase its strategic and financial flexibility. On May 11, 2004, the Corporation amended and restated its credit agreement to reflect its improved credit profile. With the completion of the tender offer and earlier debt reductions, the Corporation has reduced debt a total of $368 million within a 13-month period. The pay down of this debt reduces annual interest expense by about $38 million. Management comments and second quarter estimate Chief Executive Officer Zev Weiss said the first quarter continued the recent trends of both supply chain improvements and healthy earnings from licensing. "Our cost-reduction efforts were on track in the quarter, and our licensing results were better than expected," Weiss said. "Cash flow was strong once again, as we continue to focus on improving our balance sheet. "For the fiscal year, our estimate of $1.63 to $1.68 per share is now equivalent to $1.46 to $1.51 per share taking into account the costs and benefits from our tender offer," Weiss said. "For the second fiscal quarter, we are projecting our earnings per basic share to be about breakeven," Weiss said. The second quarter is one in which American Greetings has historically reported a net loss due to the seasonal nature of its business. Last year, the Corporation reported a net loss of 15 cents per basic share for the second quarter. Retail executive joins board American Greetings also announced that Joseph Hardin has been elected to its board of directors. Hardin fills a vacancy on the board with a term that expires in 2006. Hardin, 59, most recently served as chief executive officer of Kinko's Inc., a digital document solutions provider, from May 1997 until his retirement in January 2001. Prior to joining Kinko's, he was president and chief executive officer of SAM'S CLUB, the wholesale division of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. "Joe Hardin's retail background and supply chain experience make him a valuable member of our board of directors," Weiss said.

EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibit No. 99 Press release dated July 30, 2004

Exhibit 99 American Greetings Announces Sale of Magnivision CLEVELAND, July 30 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- American Greetings Corp. (NYSE: AM) today announced it has signed a letter of agreement to sell its Magnivision nonprescription reading glasses subsidiary to an affiliate of AAi.FosterGrant in a cash transaction. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. Zev Weiss, chief executive officer of American Greetings, said the sale of Magnivision reflects the Corporation's strategy of focusing resources on businesses that are closely related to its core competence of social expression. "As we have stated, we are evaluating our entire business portfolio," Weiss said, "and Magnivision, while a strong and profitable company, is a better strategic fit for AAi.FosterGrant than it is for us. We decided that we can generate more value for our shareholders by divesting Magnivision than by operating it ourselves." The Corporation expects the transaction, which is subject to Hart-Scott- Rodino approval and other applicable conditions, to close in approximately 30 to 60 days. Magnivision will become a part of the AAi.FosterGrant family of companies once the sale is final. AAi.FosterGrant, a designer and marketer of sunglasses, reading glasses, optical frames and jewelry, is located in Smithfield, R.I. and employs about 1,200 people worldwide. About Magnivision Magnivision is the world's largest manufacturer and distributor of nonprescription reading glasses sold over the counter. Located in Miramar, Fla., Magnivision generates gross sales of approximately $80 million and employs about 200 full-time associates and about 1,000 part-time merchandisers.

EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibit No. Description - ----------- ----------- 99(a) Earnings Release - Second Quarter Ended August 31, 2004.

Exhibit 99(a) American Greetings Announces Improved Results and Initiates Dividend - Company reports second quarter EPS of 10 cents versus net loss of 15 cents in prior period - Licensing income remains strong - Forecast for cash flow increased for the year by 25% to $250 million - Company initiates quarterly cash dividend of 6 cents per share CLEVELAND, Sept. 29 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- American Greetings Corporation (NYSE: AM) today announced its financial results for the second fiscal quarter ended August 31, 2004. Despite flat net sales in the second quarter, the Corporation exceeded its prior year earnings per share results due primarily to increased licensing income, reduced supply chain costs and lower interest expense. The Corporation's Board of Directors authorized the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend of 6 cents per share. Second Quarter As a result of the letter of agreement announced on July 30th to sell the Magnivision subsidiary, the Corporation has classified its Magnivision subsidiary as a discontinued operation. The Corporation has provided financial results on continuing operations as well as net results of discontinued operations (the assets held for sale). The Corporation reported net income from continuing operations of $5.9 million, or 9 cents per share, on net sales of $391.9 million, for the fiscal 2005 second quarter ended August 31, 2004 (all per-share amounts assume dilution). This compares to a reported net loss from continuing operations of $10.6 million, or 16 cents per share, on net sales of $390.9 million, for the year earlier period. Discontinued operations contributed approximately $1 million of net income or 1 cent per share to both the second quarter of fiscal 2005 as well as the second quarter of fiscal 2004. Net sales were flat compared to the prior period as incremental revenue from acquisitions in the AG Interactive segment and favorable foreign exchange movements were offset by lower revenues in both the retail segment and the fixtures business. Pretax income increased $27.2 million from a loss of $17.6 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2004 to $9.6 million of income in the second quarter of fiscal 2005. Management Comments Zev Weiss, Chief Executive Officer said, "In the second quarter, we were able to generate much improved performance over last year for both earnings and cash flow. The earnings improvement was due primarily to increased income from licensing, reduced implementation costs related to our ongoing supply chain transformation and lower interest expense because of our prepayment of debt. We were also very pleased by our cash flow results which were driven by increased earnings and a continued focus on improving our balance sheet." Third Quarter and Full Year Estimates "For the third fiscal quarter, we are projecting our earnings per share to be between 67 cents and 72 cents," Weiss said. Last year, the Corporation reported earnings per share of 60 cents for the third quarter. "Our initial fiscal year 2005 earnings estimate of $1.63 to $1.68 per share was adjusted last quarter to earnings of $1.46 to $1.51 per share to take into account the costs and benefits from our tender offer," Weiss continued. "We are not changing the adjusted EPS estimate. However, because our cash flow was so strong in our first half, we are raising the estimate for fiscal 2005 cash flow from operating and investing activities by 25% from $200 million to $250 million." Dividend Initiated The Corporation's Board of Directors has authorized the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend of 6 cents per share for shareholders of record at the close of business on October 19, 2004, payable on October 29, 2004. Weiss said, "We previously stated that we would announce our plans on ways to enhance shareholder value in the second fiscal half. Now, we have taken the first step in returning capital to shareholders by initiating a dividend."

The conference call will be accessible through the Investor Relations section of the American Greetings Web site at http://corporate.americangreetings.com .

Exhibit 99(a) AMERICAN GREETINGS ANNOUNCES IMPROVED RESULTS - Company reports third quarter EPS of 78 cents versus 60 cents in prior year period - Continuing Operations exceeds Company's estimate - Announces sale of Magnivision for $77 million. Substantial gain boosts quarterly Net Income and EPS - Company declares quarterly cash dividend of 6 cents per share CLEVELAND, Dec. 23 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- American Greetings Corporation (NYSE: AM) today announced its financial results for the third fiscal quarter ended November 30, 2004. The Corporation exceeded its prior year earnings per share results due primarily to a substantial gain on the sale of its Magnivision subsidiary. The Corporation declared a quarterly cash dividend of 6 cents per share. Third Quarter As a result of the announced sale of the Magnivision subsidiary, that business unit has been classified as a discontinued operation. The Corporation has presented financial results on continuing operations as well as net results of discontinued operations. For the fiscal 2005 third quarter ended November 30, 2004, the Corporation reported net income from continuing operations of $40.3 million or 51 cents per share compared to $45.1 million or 58 cents per share for continuing operations in the prior year (all per-share amounts assume dilution). Discontinued operations contributed $22.4 million of net income or 27 cents per share to the third quarter of fiscal 2005 primarily due to the gain on the sale of Magnivision. In the prior year's third quarter, discontinued operations contributed $1.3 million of net income or 2 cents per share. Within this year's third quarter, the Company realized a $35.5 million pre-tax gain on the sale of Magnivision. This gain was reflected in discontinued operations. The Company also recorded $16.6 million of expense associated with a 300 person overhead reduction program, $13.0 million of expense to reflect a change in timing for greeting card returns associated with a revised merchandising strategy and $8.2 million of expense associated with a plant closure. These expenses were all reflected in continuing operations for the third quarter. On a consolidated basis, for the third quarter of fiscal 2005, American Greetings reported net income of $62.8 million or 78 cents per share, on net sales of $586 million. In the third fiscal quarter of 2004, the Company reported net income of $46.4 million or 60 cents per share on net sales of $604 million. In the prior year's third fiscal quarter, the Company incurred $13.8 million of pre-tax costs associated with a repurchase of the Company's bonds and these costs were included in continuing operations. Net sales were down versus the prior period's third quarter as lower revenues in both the retail segment and seasonal gift wrap business were combined with the $13.0 million non-cash accrual to reflect an adjusted
merchandising strategy for seasonal product. These reductions to sales were partially offset by incremental revenue from acquisitions in the AG Interactive segment and favorable foreign exchange movements. Year-to-Date Results The Corporation reported net income of $73.9 million or 97 cents per share, on net sales of $1.41 billion, for the first three quarters of fiscal 2005. Included in the year-to-date results are $39 million of pre-tax costs incurred (during the first quarter) for debt repurchases. In fiscal 2004, the Corporation reported net income of $56.4 million or 78 cents per share, on net sales of $1.44 billion. The prior year's results include $18.4 million of pre- tax costs incurred for debt repurchases (in both the first and third quarters). Management Comments and Outlook Zev Weiss, Chief Executive Officer said, "In the third quarter, we continued to focus on reducing our costs in both our supply chain and in our overhead structure. While never a pleasant task, we recognize the necessity of taking these actions due to the continuing changes in our business. The savings resulting from these actions will be reinvested into our business in fiscal 2006. Without these costs, we surpassed our estimate for the quarter." Weiss added, "Within the quarter, we closed on the Magnivision sale. We felt that our Magnivision subsidiary would be a better fit under an owner with a strategic focus on glasses. Given the sale price, we are pleased with the value provided to our shareholders." Weiss continued, "After quarter end, we entered into an agreement with The Hatchery, a family entertainment and property-development firm. Through continued investment, we are committed to enhancing the licensing business model that we have grown over the last few years." "For the full year, we are projecting our earnings per share from continuing operations to be between $1.02 and $1.07. This estimate is in line with previous guidance of $1.46 to $1.51 per share when adjusted for the full year impact of the three programs described above," Weiss said. Dividend Declaration The Corporation's Board of Directors authorized the declaration of a quarterly cash dividend of 6 cents per share for shareholders of record at the close of business on January 12, 2005, payable to those shareholders on January 24, 2005. Conference call on the Web American Greetings will broadcast its conference call live on the Internet at 9:30 a.m. Eastern time today. The conference call will be accessible through the Investor Relations section of the American Greetings Web site at http://corporate.americangreetings.com .

Exhibit 99.1
CLEVELAND (January 11, 2005)  American Greetings Corporation (NYSE: AM) today announced the resignation of Chief Financial Officer Bob Ryder, effective January 28, 2005. Ryder, who joined the company in September 2002, has accepted a position as Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative officer of IMG.
Zev Weiss, Chief Executive Officer said, "Bob has played an important role on the team that has driven significant improvements throughout our business. He's helped improve our balance sheet and grow cash flow, has built a strong finance and accounting team and significantly enhanced processes and disciplines. That team and those processes will ensure the continued excellence of our financial operation. While I'm sorry to see Bob go, I recognize he's moving into a broader role at IMG."
Bob Ryder said, "The decision to leave American Greetings was very difficult as I found my time working with the AG management team implementing our many improvements very rewarding. Within finance specifically, we have reorganized around strong leaders and greatly increased functionality. It is very difficult to leave this team behind. However, the prospect of working with IMG and Forstmann Little and the opportunity to participate in the ownership structure was too great to pass up."
IMG is the world's premier sports and lifestyle marketing and management company, and was purchased by privately-held investment firm Forstmann Little & Co. in late 2004.
American Greetings has retained Korn/Ferry International to conduct a search for Mr. Ryder's successor. In the interim, the majority of Mr. Ryder's responsibilities will be assumed jointly by Stephen Smith, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations and Joseph Cipollone, Vice President and Corporate Controller. Both will report directly to Weiss. Catherine Kilbane, Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary and a direct report to Weiss, will assume responsibility for the tax and audit functions.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
On February 16, 2005, the Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Board of Directors approved an amendment to the terms of the American Greetings Corporation ("American Greetings") Key Management Annual Incentive Plan (the "Annual Incentive Plan") that are currently in effect for fiscal 2005. The amended terms will be effective for fiscal 2006. All officers, including the Chief Executive Officer and American Greetings' other five most highly compensated officers for its last completed fiscal year (the "Named Executive Officers"), and certain key employees of American Greetings are entitled to participate in the Annual Incentive Plan. The principal changes to the terms of the Annual Incentive Plan for fiscal 2006 compared to the fiscal 2005 terms are as follows:
The fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2006 Annual Incentive Plan target bonus award levels, as a percentage of base salary, for executive officers of American Greetings are as follows:
 
Under the Annual Incentive Plan, a bonus equal to a multiple of the executive officer's target bonus percentage will be paid depending on the level of performance achieved with respect to the performance measures described above. For fiscal 2005, the maximum bonus opportunity for executive officers is 250% of their target bonus if 125% of each of the corporate and business unit performance goals are met and the executive officer receives the highest individual performance rating. For fiscal 2006, the maximum bonus opportunity for executive officers is 200% of their target bonus if 125% of each of the corporate and business unit performance goals are met and the executive officer receives the highest individual performance rating. Where any of the performance levels falls below these maximum thresholds, the bonus payable will vary depending on the executive officer's performance under each performance measure. Except for incentive compensation earned by the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Operating Officer, fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2006 incentive compensation earned by executive officers under the Annual Incentive Plan is paid entirely in cash. A portion of up to the target bonus award levels of the incentive compensation that may be earned by the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Operating Officer will be paid in Class B common shares of American Greetings in the manner described in the fourth bullet on page 24 under the heading "Chief Executive Officer Compensation" of American Greetings' Proxy Statement dated May 17, 2004, for its Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on June 25, 2004, that was filed with the Commission on Schedule 14A on May 17, 2004, which description is incorporated herein by reference.
Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Principal Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Principal Officers
In connection with the resignation of the Chief Financial Officer of American Greetings on January 31, 2005, on February 16, 2005, Joseph B. Cipollone (age 46) was designated American Greetings' interim principal financial officer solely for purposes of its filings pursuant to, and executing certifications required under, the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Exhibit 99(a) AMERICAN GREETINGS ANNOUNCES RECORD CASH FLOW, $200 MILLION SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM AND INCREASE TO DIVIDEND . Record Cash Flow highest in 98-year history . Share Repurchase program of $200 million to start immediately . Company increases quarterly cash dividend 33% to 8 cents per share . Continuing Operations exceed Company estimate for the fourth quarter CLEVELAND, April 5 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- American Greetings Corporation (NYSE: AM) today announced its financial results for the fourth fiscal quarter and fiscal year ended February 28, 2005, the initiation of $200 million share repurchase program and a 33% increase to its quarterly cash dividend. Fourth Quarter On net sales of $490.9 million for the fiscal 2005 fourth quarter ended February 28, 2005, American Greetings reported pretax income of $28.0 million and income from continuing operations of $21.4 million or 28 cents per share (all per-share amounts assume dilution). Included in these results are $6.4 million of pretax expense for a previously announced plant closure, $29.8 million of pretax expense related to the conversion of two accounts to scan based trading and a $4.9 million pretax expense for a correction in the accounting treatment for certain operating leases. After-tax results were temporarily improved by a net tax benefit of $4.2 million that was primarily due to a change in tax laws. Without these expenses, American Greetings would have achieved pretax income of $69.0 million. The Company believes providing its results excluding these expenses is useful for investors who are calculating comparability to prior years and estimates. These results compare to fiscal 2004 fourth quarter net sales of $518.2 million, pretax income of $73.0 million and income from continuing operations of $44.8 million or 58 cents per share. The Company's December earnings per share estimate of 45 cents for the fourth quarter (which excluded only the plant closure charge) equated to $57.2 million of pretax income. Full Year Results For the full year of fiscal 2005, on net sales of $1.90 billion, the Corporation's continuing operations reported pretax income of $108.2 million and income of $70.6 million or 95 cents per share. Included in the 2005 results were $118.3 million of pretax expenses for the following activities: debt repurchases, the conversion of accounts to scan based trading, a 300 person overhead reduction program, a change in timing for certain greeting card terms associated with a revised merchandising strategy, a plant closure and a correction to accounting for leases. Also included in the 2005 results was a net tax benefit of $4.2 million.
In the prior fiscal year, the Corporation's continuing operations generated net sales of $1.95 billion, pretax income of $159.9 million and net income of $98.0 million or $1.32 per share. Included in the 2004 results were $18.4 million of pretax expenses for debt repurchases. Management Comments Chief Executive Officer Zev Weiss said, "I am pleased with the exceptional cash flow we were able to generate this year. The cash flow from the past three years has allowed us to reduce our net debt by approximately $1 billion from its highest point in November 2001. Our significantly improved financial position permits us to not only return capital to our shareholders by repurchasing shares and increasing the dividend but also to support continued business development." Outlook For the first quarter of fiscal 2006, American Greetings anticipates its continuing operations' revenues will be flat to up slightly versus the prior year with earnings per share between 25 cents and 30 cents. For the full fiscal year 2006, the Corporation projects its revenues to be up approximately 1% with earnings per share to be between $1.46 and $1.51. The Corporation projects the combination of cash flow from operating activities and cash flow from investing activities to be approximately $200 million during fiscal year 2006 (excluding any net changes in short-term investments). The Corporation has not included in its estimate the effects of any share repurchase activity or the transitional effect of the adoption of Financial Accounting Standard 123R -- Share-Based Payment (but has included the effect of options granted after the adoption of 123R). Share Repurchase American Greetings announced that its Board of Directors has authorized a program to repurchase up to $200 million of the class A common shares of its stock over the next 12 months. These repurchases will be made through a 10b5-1 program in open market or privately negotiated transactions in compliance with the SEC's Rule 10b-18, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other factors. Dividend Declaration The Corporation's Board of Directors authorized an increase to the quarterly dividend. The Company announced an increase to the quarterly cash dividend of 2 cents per share. A cash dividend of 8 cents per share will be paid on May 5, 2005 to shareholders of record at the close of business on April 25, 2005. Conference call on the Web American Greetings will broadcast its conference call live on the Internet at 9:30 a.m. Eastern time today. The conference call will be accessible through the Investor Relations section of the American Greetings Web site at http://corporate.americangreetings.com .

Exhibit 99.1 AMERICAN GREETINGS ANNOUNCES IMPROVED FIRST QUARTER EARNINGS AND REPURCHASE OF 2 MILLION SHARES - Earnings per share ahead of prior year - Company repurchases approximately 2 million shares under $200 million program CLEVELAND, June 30 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- American Greetings Corporation (NYSE: AM) today announced its first quarter results for the fiscal quarter ended May 31, 2005. For the first quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company reported net sales of $443.3 million, pretax income of $43.1 million and net income of $26.4 million or 35 cents per share (all per-share amounts assume dilution). Included in these results are $4.1 million of pretax expenses recognized during the quarter for both the previously announced plant closure and the call of $10.2 million of outstanding 11.75% notes. This year's first quarter reported results compare to net sales of $433.5 million, pretax income of $4.8 million and income from continuing operations of $2.9 million or 4 cents per share for the first quarter of fiscal 2005. The prior year's first quarter included $39.0 million of pretax expenses associated with the retirement of $186.2 million of debt and $3.1 million of income from the gain on the sale of a marketable security. Management Comments and Outlook Chief Executive Officer Zev Weiss said, "We are off to a good start this fiscal year as we are seeing the very early stages of the benefit of additional focus on our core consumer. We have been concentrating our resources on efforts to increase our point of sale results while maintaining a relentless focus on cost containment to help support margins." The Company updated its fiscal year earnings per share estimate due to both the Securities and Exchange Commission's April 2005 decision to delay the implementation of new rules on the expensing of employee stock options as well as the effects of share repurchases. The Company's fiscal year estimate provided in April was $1.46 to $1.51 per share. The Company previously anticipated adopting Financial Accounting Standard 123R during its third fiscal quarter. The delay in adoption of the new accounting rules until March of 2006 causes the previous estimate to be increased by 4 cents per share. In addition, share repurchases through the end of the first quarter, net of lost interest income during the year, will add approximately 2 cents to the Company's estimate. The combination of the change in adoption date of the accounting rules as well as the effects from the first quarter share repurchases increase the range of estimated earnings per share by 6 cents for fiscal 2006 from $1.46 to $1.51 up to $1.52 to $1.57.
The second quarter is one in which American Greetings has historically reported a net loss due to the seasonal nature of its business. For the second quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company is projecting earnings per share to be between a loss of 6 cents and a loss of 1 cent. This estimate would compare to income from continuing operations of 9 cents per share in the prior year's second quarter. Included in the 9 cents of earnings per share was a pretax gain of $10 million resulting from the modification of certain agreements for the Company's licensing activities. Financing Activities The Company purchased more than 1.9 million shares of common stock for $45.5 million during the first fiscal quarter of 2006 under its previously announced $200 million share repurchase program. During the quarter, the Company provided notice to bondholders that the remaining $10.2 million of debt with a coupon of 11.75% would be called during the second quarter. Once repurchased, the entire original issuance of $260 million of 11.75% notes will have been prepaid over the previous two-year period. The Company's Board of Directors authorized a cash dividend of 8 cents per share to be paid on August 1, 2005 to shareholders of record at the close of business on July 20, 2005.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
To align a portion of the performance-based incentive compensation of Mr. Zev Weiss, the Chief Executive Officer, and Mr. Jeffrey Weiss, the President and Chief Operating Officer, with the long-term interests of the shareholders of American Greetings Corporation ("American Greetings"), in March 2003, the Compensation and Management Development Committee determined that a percentage of their performance-based incentive compensation should be in the form of American Greetings Class B common shares. As a result, with respect to amounts earned under the American Greetings Key Management Annual Incentive Plan (the "Annual Incentive Plan") in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2005, Messrs. Zev Weiss and Jeffrey Weiss were eligible to receive the following amounts: (1) cash in an amount equal to one-half of the incentive compensation earned under the Annual Incentive Plan and (2) a number of Class B common shares determined by dividing the dollar value of up to one-half of the target incentive compensation by the closing price of American Greetings Class A common shares as of March 3, 2003, discounted by one-third. None of such shares were earned with respect to fiscal 2004. In fiscal 2005, Messrs. Zev Weiss and Jeff Weiss earned 34,208 and 25,656 Class B common shares (the "Annual Target Amount"), respectively. The Committee intended in its March 2003 determination to grant at that time a number of performance shares covering five fiscal years such that shares are available for each of Messrs. Zev Weiss and Jeffrey Weiss to earn part of their incentive compensation in shares in this manner for a period of five fiscal years (through fiscal 2008) if performance goals are met. Messrs. Zev Weiss and Jeff Weiss would also have the ability in fiscal 2009 and 2010 to earn a portion of any shares not earned during such five years. This means that for five fiscal years through fiscal 2008, each year Messrs. Zev Weiss and Jeffrey Weiss would be eligible to earn up to an amount of such initial grant of performance shares equal to their respective Annual Target Amounts of Class B common shares. If they did not earn any shares in a particular year during the initial five-year period, Messrs. Zev Weiss and Jeffrey Weiss would be entitled to earn those shares, up to the Annual Target Amount, in each of fiscal 2009 and 2010.
As part of and to implement this program, on August 2, 2005, the Compensation and Management Development Committee granted 102,624 and 76,968 performance shares to Messrs. Zev Weiss and Jeffrey Weiss, respectively, under the American Greetings 1997 Equity and Performance Incentive Plan and pursuant to Performance Share Grant Agreements. The performance shares represent the right to receive Class B common shares upon the achievement of management objectives over a five-year performance period. The number of performance shares actually earned will be based on the percentage of the officer's target incentive award, if any, that he achieves during the performance period under the Annual Incentive Plan. Each officer will be entitled to payment of a portion of his performance shares (not to exceed the Annual Target Amount) equal to the percentage of the officer's target incentive award, if any, that he achieves under the Annual Incentive Plan for a given fiscal year during the performance period. If the officer achieves 100% of his target incentive award under the Annual Incentive Plan in each of the first three of American Greetings' five fiscal years ending during the performance period, he will be deemed to have earned 100% of the performance shares. If the officer earns a portion but less than 100% of the Annual Target Amount of performance shares with respect to any fiscal year for which he is eligible to earn performance shares, he shall forfeit the remaining portion of the Annual Target Amount not earned with respect to such fiscal year. If the officer does not earn any performance shares with respect to a fiscal year during the performance period for which he is eligible to earn performance shares, the officer will be entitled to earn those shares, up to the Annual Target Amount, in the forth and fifth years of the performance period based on the percentage of the target incentive award the officer achieves under the Annual Incentive Plan with respect to fiscal 2009 and 2010.
Subject to certain adjustments, the officers may not earn more than the total grant of performance shares and, with respect to any fiscal year, no officer may earn more than the Annual Target Amount of performance shares. Any portion of the performance shares not earned as of the end of the performance period will be forfeited. All of the performance shares not otherwise previously earned or forfeited will be deemed earned and shall be issued upon a change in control of American Greetings, the officer's death or disability or a termination without cause. In connection with the grant of performance shares, each officer's fiscal 2006 target cash bonus under
 
the Annual Incentive Plan was reduced by one-half to 50% of base salary for Mr. Zev Weiss and to 45% of base salary for Mr. Jeffrey Weiss.
The Committee expects to consider whether to grant next year up to the Annual Target Amount of additional performance shares to each of Messrs. Zev Weiss and Jeffrey Weiss to enable such officers to earn shares that were not earned with respect to fiscal 2004. Any such grant will be subject to the Committee's approval and will be based on the officers' performance and such other factors as the Committee determines appropriate.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereto duly authorized.

On August 16, 2005, American Greetings Corporation ("American Greetings") and Mr. Michael J. Merriman, Jr., entered into an employment agreement under which Mr. Merriman will serve as the Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of American Greetings, effective September 1, 2005. A brief description of the material terms of the employment agreement is contained in Item 5.02 of this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Principal Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Principal Officers

Cipollone was designated American Greetings' interim principal financial officer solely for purposes of its filings pursuant to, and executing certifications required under, the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As contemplated by his designation, Mr. Cipollone was intended to serve as the principal financial officer on a temporary basis until the appointment of a new Chief Financial Officer of American Greetings or as the Board of Directors shall otherwise determine. Accordingly, Mr. Cipollone's position as the interim principal financial officer of American Greetings will terminate on September 1, 2005, the effective date of Mr. Merriman's appointment as Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of American Greetings. Mr. Cipollone will remain as the Principal Accounting Officer, and Vice President, Corporate Controller of American Greetings.
(c) Effective September 1, 2005, Mr. Merriman will serve as the Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of American Greetings. Mr. Merriman will also serve as the Principal Financial Officer of American Greetings. Mr. Merriman, age 49, has been a private investor since April 2004. Mr. Merriman was the President and Chief Executive Officer of Royal Appliance Manufacturing Co., a publicly-held manufacturer and marketer of Dirt Devil vacuum cleaners, from 1995 until April 2004 and was its Chief Financial Officer from 1992 to 1995. Prior to working with Royal Appliance, Mr. Merriman, a Certified Public Accountant, was a partner in the audit practice of Arthur Andersen & Co.

If Mr. Merriman is involuntarily terminated by American Greetings (for reasons other than a gross violation of his obligations to American Greetings as "gross violation" is defined in his employment agreement), or Mr. Merriman resigns because his duties are reduced to that of a position below that of his then current level, his compensation is reduced, or there is a change of control in the ownership of American Greetings, or Mr. Merriman resigns because after 36 months, but before 48 months after the date of his hire, he has not been offered responsibility for operating and managing a material business unit of American Greetings, Mr. Merriman's agreement provides that he will be entitled to either (i) severance under American Greetings severance policy then in effect or (ii) the following severance benefits: 12 months base salary at his salary in effect as of the date of the severance event; continued participation in the Annual Incentive Plan for the fiscal year in which the severance event occurs; immediate vesting of any stock options that would have vested within 12 months of the date of the severance event, provided that if vesting is so accelerated, such accelerated vesting will apply only to 40,000 of the options to purchase 60,000 shares described in paragraph 2 above; continued participation at an active employee rate in American Greetings' health care programs for a period of 12 months following the date of the severance event; and continued use of his company automobile for a period of 30 days following the date of the severance event. As a condition to receiving severance under his employment agreement, Mr. Merriman must execute a waiver and release of claims in a form satisfactory to American Greetings.
          Under his employment agreement, Mr. Merriman is prohibited from disclosing American Greetings' confidential information or trade secrets acquired during the course of his employment.

Date: September 29, 2005
 

 
Exhibit 99.1
CLEVELAND (September 29, 2005)  American Greetings Corporation (NYSE: AM) today announced its second quarter results for the fiscal quarter ended August 31, 2005, reported that it had repurchased an incremental 2 million shares and announced an 8 cent per share cash dividend.
For the second quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company reported net sales of $387.6 million, pretax income of $8.3 million and net income of $3.2 million or 5 cents per share (all per-share amounts assume dilution).
Second Quarter Results
These results compare to net sales of $392.1 million, pretax income of $9.6 million and income from continuing operations of $5.9 million or 9 cents per share for the second quarter of fiscal 2005.
Contributing to the Company's second quarter, greeting card performance increased slightly more than 3% versus the prior year's second quarter with the domestic business responsible for the improvement. The online portion of the interactive business continued to grow, driving a more than $2 million pretax earnings improvement over the prior period. Somewhat offsetting these improvements in performance during the second quarter was weakness within the international operations.
The Company purchased 2.0 million shares of common stock for $51.0 million during the second quarter of 2006 under its previously announced $200 million share repurchase program. The second quarter repurchases bring the year-to-date purchases to 3.9 million shares of common stock for $96.5 million. Share repurchases during the second quarter, net of lost interest income during the year, will add approximately 3 cents to the Company's full year estimate.
Financing Activities
The Company's Board of Directors authorized a cash dividend of 8 cents per share to be paid on October 31, 2005 to shareholders of record at the close of business on October 19, 2005.
 
Chief Executive Officer Zev Weiss said, "I am pleased with our performance in the first half of the year. Our core greeting card business has improved, especially domestically. We will continue to invest in our card business as we enhance our mix of product at retail."
Management Comments and Outlook
For the third quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company is projecting earnings per share to be between 70 cents and 75 cents. This estimate would compare to income from continuing operations of 51 cents per share in the prior year's third quarter. Included in the 51 cents of earnings per share were pretax costs of $37.8 million resulting from a plant closure, an overhead reduction program and a revised merchandising strategy.
American Greetings will broadcast its conference call live on the Internet at 9:30 a.m. Eastern time today. The conference call will be accessible through the Investor Relations section of the American Greetings Web site at . A replay of the call will be available on the site.

The information in this Item 2.02 of this Current Report on Form 8-K (including the exhibit attached hereto) is being furnished under Item 2.02 and shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or otherwise subject to the liability of such section, or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
Item 2.06 Material Impairments.
In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," American Greetings is required to evaluate the carrying value of its goodwill for potential impairment on an annual basis or an interim basis if there are indicators of potential impairment.
As previously disclosed in the American Greetings' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2005, the fair value of the Retail Operations segment and one international reporting unit, determined for the purpose of testing goodwill for impairment, has declined due primarily to declining results and cash flows in the past two years. Corporate management has been closely monitoring the short-term performance of these businesses, including taking actions intended to improve results of operations and cash flows, and establishing performance indicators within each of these businesses in order to assess the progress of the businesses throughout fiscal 2006.
During the month of November 2005, indicators emerged within these businesses that led American Greetings to conclude that a SFAS 142 goodwill impairment test was required to be performed during the third quarter. Within the international reporting unit, located in Australia, there were two primary indicators.
There were three primary indicators that emerged within the Retail Operations segment during the month.
While these events individually may not indicate the need for goodwill impairment testing, taken in combination, American Greetings concluded that testing was required in the third quarter. Based on the foregoing, on December 7, 2005, American Greetings concluded that the goodwill of the Retail Operations segment and its Australian operating unit was materially impaired and on December 8, 2005, announced that pre-tax goodwill impairment charges of approximately $43 million (after-tax of approximately $33 million) are expected. American Greetings estimates that based on its preliminary analysis, the goodwill impairment charge for its Australian reporting unit will be approximately $25 million and the goodwill impairment charge for its Retail Operations segment will be approximately $18 million. This amount represents all of the goodwill of these reporting units. The estimated goodwill impairment charges, which do not result in current or future cash expenditures, will be recorded in accordance with SFAS No. 142 in American Greetings' third quarter financial
 
results. The actual amount of the goodwill impairment charge will not be finalized until American Greetings has completed its impairment testing.

Date: December 12, 2005

 
CLEVELAND (December 8, 2005)  American Greetings Corporation (NYSE: AM) today announced a revised earnings estimate for its fiscal third quarter ending November 30, 2005, and reported that it had repurchased an incremental 2.1 million shares during the quarter.
For the third quarter ending November 30, 2005, the Company is projecting earnings from continuing operations per diluted share to be between 15 and 18 cents. The Company had anticipated third quarter earnings per diluted share between 70 and 75 cents. Contributing to the Company's revised guidance were unanticipated further weaknesses within its UK operations and disappointing Christmas shipments of domestic promotional gift wrap.
Revised Third Quarter Estimate
Events during the quarter led to goodwill impairment testing in two of the Company's businesses. As a result of the testing, pre-tax goodwill impairment charges of approximately $43 million (after-tax of approximately $33 million) are expected for the quarter and also contributed to the reduction in the estimate. The two businesses involved in the goodwill impairment testing were an Australian operating unit and the Company's retail operations segment. The goodwill impairment charges are non-cash. The Company will be issuing further guidance for its fourth quarter and full-year estimates with the release of its third quarter earnings.
The Company will release its fiscal third quarter 2006 results on Thursday, December 22, 2005, and will webcast its conference call at 9:30 a.m. ET that same day.
Third Quarter Earnings Release
Chief Executive Officer Zev Weiss said, "While we are disappointed with the performance of our United Kingdom and promotional gift wrap businesses, we are pleased that our initiatives in the North American cards business are creating positive momentum."
Management Comment
 
The Company purchased 2.1 million shares of common stock for $52.6 million during the fiscal third quarter under its previously announced $200 million share repurchase program. The average number of common shares outstanding (assuming dilution) during the fiscal third quarter was 78.7 million. The third quarter repurchases bring the year-to-date purchases to 6.0 million shares of common stock for $149.1 million.
Financing Activities

Along with greeting cards, its product lines include gift wrap, party goods, candles, stationery, calendars, educational products, ornaments and electronic greetings.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
On December 14, 2005, the Board of Directors of American Greetings Corporation ("American Greetings") authorized amendments to each of its Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the "SERP"), the Key Management Annual Incentive Plan for Fiscal Years 2005 and 2006, (the "Annual Incentive Plan") and the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan. On December 14, 2005, the Board also adopted the Outside Directors' Deferred Compensation Plan and American Greetings entered into a Consulting Agreement with one of its directors, Joseph S. Hardin, Jr.
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan
The amendments to the SERP implement a number of changes designed primarily to address the new requirements imposed by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the "Act"). Specifically, the SERP was amended to define when the employment relationship ends for purposes of determining when covered executives will be paid compensation under the plan; make the process for payment of benefits more mechanical; delay payment of benefits for six (6) months if employment ends for reasons other than disability or death; and permit early payment in circumstances that would otherwise pose practical administrative problems, such as satisfying certain tax withholding obligations that arise before payments otherwise can be made. Executive officers and certain other officers of American Greetings participate in the SERP. A copy of the amendments to the SERP is included as an exhibit to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
Annual Incentive Plan
The amendments to the Annual Incentive Plan also were adopted to address the new requirements imposed by the Act and ensure that distributions under the Annual Incentive Plan fall within the short-term deferral rules and thus are not subject to the Act. In particular, the amendments clarify that any cash bonuses earned under the Annual Incentive Plan must be paid within two and one-half months following the end of American Greetings' fiscal year in which the benefit being distributed is earned and clarify what constitutes a disability for purposes of determining when a distribution is to be paid to a participant on account of the participant becoming permanently disabled. Executive officers and certain other employees of American Greetings participate in the Annual Incentive Plan. A copy of the amendments to the Annual Incentive Plan is included as an exhibit to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
Executive Deferred Compensation Plan
Under the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan, a participant may elect to defer all or a portion of his or her annual salary, bonus and other compensation for a period of time. The Board adopted amendments to the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan primarily to address the new requirements imposed by the Act by, among other things,

Executive officers and certain other officers of American Greetings may elect to participate in the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan. A copy of the amendments to the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan is included as an exhibit to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
Outside Directors' Deferred Compensation Plan
Outside directors are currently eligible to defer compensation received in their capacity as directors of American Greetings. In connection with the amendments to the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan, American Greetings has adopted the Outside Directors' Deferred Compensation Plan, which is intended to operate similar to the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan. Under the plan, Directors who are not also employees of American Greetings may elect to defer all or a portion of their compensation for a period of time, which deferred compensation will be paid out either in a lump sum or in installments over time, based on the participant's election. The Outside Directors' Deferred Compensation Plan is intended to be an unfunded plan for purposes of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. A copy of the Outside Directors' Deferred Compensation Plan is included as an exhibit to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
Consulting Arrangement
On December 14, 2005, American Greetings retained one of its Directors, Mr. Joseph S. Hardin, Jr., as an independent consultant pursuant to the terms of a consulting agreement, a copy of which is filed as an exhibit to this Current Report on Form 8-K. Under the terms of the consulting agreement, Mr. Hardin will provide certain general management and strategy consulting services. Mr. Hardin will receive a one-time retainer of $13,000 and will be paid a daily rate of $1,600 per day, plus expenses, based on services actually rendered. Either American Greetings or Mr. Hardin may terminate the consulting agreement at any time and for any reason. In accordance with the New York Stock Exchange rules, the Board of Directors has determined that the consulting arrangement with Mr. Hardin does not constitute a material relationship with American Greetings and that Mr. Hardin will continue to qualify as "independent" under the New York Stock Exchange rules.

On December 22, 2005, American Greetings issued a press release reporting its results for the third quarter ended November 30, 2005. A copy of this press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
The information in this Item 2.02 of this Current Report on Form 8-K (including the exhibit attached hereto) is being furnished under Item 2.02 and shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or otherwise subject to the liability of such section, or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
c) Exhibits.
           Exhibit 99.1 - Press Release - Reporting Results for the third quarter ended November 30, 2005.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereto duly authorized.
 

 
Exhibit 99.1
CLEVELAND (December 22, 2005)  American Greetings Corporation (NYSE: AM) today announced its third quarter results for the fiscal quarter ended November 30, 2005, and announced an 8 cent per share cash dividend.
For the third quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company reported net sales of $558.6 million, pre-tax income of $25.0 million and income from continuing operations of $10.3 million or 16 cents per share (all per-share amounts assume dilution). Included in the 16 cents of earnings per share was a non-cash pre-tax goodwill impairment charge of $43.2 million (after-tax of approximately $33 million) that reduced earnings per share by 42 cents during the quarter. The Company believes that providing the earnings per share impact of the impairment charge is useful for investors who are focusing on core operating results and calculating comparability to prior periods and estimates.
Third Quarter Results
In the prior year's third quarter, the Company reported net sales of $586.2 million, pre-tax income of $65.8 million and income from continuing operations of $40.3 million or 51 cents per share. Included within the prior year's third quarter were previously reported charges that reduced pre-tax income from continuing operations by $37.8 million.
Chief Executive Officer Zev Weiss said, "We have recently reviewed various investment strategies, the probability of success and the return profile of each alternative, and have concluded that our best investment is in our own greeting card business. We believe our card business is poised for meaningful improvement. To enable that improvement, we are considering an investment of approximately $70 million to $100 million over the next couple of years, with the majority of that investment occurring during fiscal 2007."
Management Comments and Outlook
Weiss added, "We have also considered many other ways to wisely deploy the outstanding cash flow of the last few years and have concluded that in addition to an investment in cards, we should also invest in our own shares when we believe they are trading at a discount to intrinsic value. We are considering a more aggressive share repurchase program and several other changes to our capital structure, including replacing our convertible bond, which matures in July, 2006. Our objective in making these focused investments in our business is to generate higher earnings per share over the long term."
For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company is projecting earnings per share to be between 44 cents and 59 cents. For the full fiscal year 2006, the Company is projecting earnings per share between $1.03 and $1.18 (including the $33 million after-tax effect of the goodwill impairment charge) and between $1.45 and $1.60 without the impairment. The Company believes that providing the estimate excluding the impairment charge is useful for investors who are calculating comparability to prior years and estimates. The Company has included in its estimate the completion of its $200 million share repurchase program.
 
The Company purchased 2.1 million shares of common stock for $52.6 million during the fiscal third quarter of 2006 under its previously announced $200 million share repurchase program. The third quarter repurchases bring the year-to-date purchases to 6.0 million shares of common stock for $149.1 million.
Financing Activities
The Company's Board of Directors authorized a cash dividend of 8 cents per share to be paid on January 23, 2006 to shareholders of record at the close of business on January 11, 2006.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
New Credit Facility
On April 4, 2006, American Greetings Corporation ("American Greetings") entered into a new $650 million Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement"), dated April 4, 2006, among various lending institutions party thereto (the "Lenders"), National City Bank, as the global agent, joint lead arranger, joint bookrunner, swing line lender, LC Issuer and collateral agent, UBS Securities LLC, as joint lead arranger, joint bookrunner and syndication agent, and KeyBank National Association, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., and LaSalle Bank National Association, as documentation agents.
Pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement, American Greetings and certain additional foreign subsidiary borrowers that may become parties to the Credit Agreement from time to time may borrow, repay and re-borrow up to $350 million under a revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility includes a $95 million Canadian subfacility and also allows American Greetings to borrow from time to time in Euros, British pounds, Australian dollars, New Zealand dollars and Yen. Under the Credit Agreement, American Greetings may also borrow up to $300 million under a multiple draw term loan facility under which it may request one or more term loans until April 4, 2007. The obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by American Greetings' material domestic subsidiaries (the "Guarantors") and are secured by substantially all of the personal property of American Greetings and each of the Guarantors, including a pledge of all of the capital stock or other equity interests in substantially all of American Greetings' domestic subsidiaries and 65% of the capital stock or other equity interest in American Greetings' material first tier foreign subsidiaries. The revolving loans will mature on April 4, 2011, and the term loans will mature on April 4, 2013. Each term loan will amortize in equal quarterly installments equal to .25% of the amount of such term loan, beginning on April 4, 2007, with the balance payable on April 4, 2013. The proceeds of the borrowings under the Credit Agreement may be used (i) to refinance existing indebtedness, (ii) to make share repurchases from shareholders, (iii) to fund capital expenditures, (iv) to provide working capital, (v) to fund permitted acquisitions, and (vi) for other general corporate purposes. The Credit Agreement replaces the 2004 Credit Agreement described below under Item 1.02.
Term loans under the Credit Agreement will bear interest at a rate per annum based on either the London Inter-Bank Offer Rate ("LIBOR") plus 150 basis points or based on the alternate base rate plus 25 basis points. The alternate base rate ("ABR") is the higher of National City Bank's prime rate or the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%. Revolving loans that are denominated in US dollars will bear interest at a rate per annum based on the then applicable LIBOR or ABR rate, in each case, plus margins adjusted according to American Greetings' leverage ratio. Revolving loans that are denominated in Canadian Dollars will bear interest at a rate based on the greater of (i) the annual rate of interest established from time to time by the Canadian Administrative Branch of the global agent as its reference rate then in effect for determining interest rates on Canadian Dollar denominated commercial loans in Canada, and (ii) the annual rate of interest based on the Canadian Dollar Offer Rate ("CDOR") plus 0.50% per annum, and in each case plus margins adjusted according to American Greetings' leverage ratio. Revolving loans denominated in a designated foreign currency will bear interest at a rate to be based on the offered rate for deposits in the applicable designated foreign currency plus margins adjusted according to American Greetings' leverage ratio. Swingline loans will bear interest at a quoted rate agreed upon by American Greetings and the swingline lender.
The Credit Agreement contains certain restrictive covenants that are customary for similar credit arrangements, including covenants relating to financial reporting and notification, compliance with laws, preservation of existence, maintenance of books and records, use of proceeds, maintenance of properties and insurance, and limitations on liens, dispositions, issuance of debt, investments, payment of dividends, repurchases of capital stock, acquisitions, and transactions with affiliates. There are also financial covenants that require American Greetings to maintain a maximum leverage ratio (consolidated indebtedness minus unrestricted cash over consolidated EBITDA), and a minimum interest coverage ratio (consolidated EBITDA over consolidated interest expense). The Credit Agreement also requires American Greetings to make certain mandatory prepayments of outstanding indebtedness using the net cash proceeds received from certain dispositions, events of loss and additional indebtedness that American Greetings may incur from time to time.

The 2004 Credit Agreement consisted of a $200 million revolving facility maturing on May 10, 2008, and was secured by the domestic assets of American Greetings (including personal and real property) and a 65% interest in the capital stock of certain of its foreign subsidiaries. The 2004 Credit Agreement contained various restrictive covenants, some of which required that American Greetings meet specified periodic financial ratios, minimum net worth, maximum leverage, and interest coverage. The 2004 Credit Agreement also placed certain restrictions on the ability of American Greetings to incur additional indebtedness, to engage in acquisitions of other businesses, to repurchase its own capital stock and pay shareholder dividends. American Greetings did not incur any termination penalties in connection with the termination of the 2004 Credit Agreement.
Certain of the lenders party to the 2004 Credit Agreement and their affiliates have provided, from time to time, and may continue to provide, investment banking, commercial banking, financial and other services to American Greetings, including letters of credit, depository and account processing services, for which American Greetings has paid and intends to pay customary fees.

Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
On April 6, 2006, American Greetings announced that it commenced a cash tender offer for all of its $300 million of outstanding 6.10% senior notes due August 1, 2028 and a consent solicitation to amend the related note indenture. The consent solicitation seeks consents from holders of the notes to eliminate certain restrictive covenants and events of default from the note indenture. American Greetings is undertaking this initiative in an effort to acquire all of the outstanding notes and to increase its financial flexibility.
The tender offer and consent solicitation are subject to the terms and conditions set forth in American Greetings' Offer to Purchase and Consent Solicitation Statement dated April 6, 2006 (the "Offer to Purchase and Consent Solicitation Statement") and will expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on May 24, 2006, unless extended.
The purchase price (the "Offer Consideration") per $1,000 principal amount of notes to be paid for each validly tendered note will be (i) the present value on the Payment Date (as defined below) of $1,000 (the amount payable for the notes on August 1, 2008, the date on which holders may require American Greetings to repurchase the notes (the "Put Date")) and the present value of all the interest that would be payable on, or accrue from, the last interest payment date until the Put Date, based on the assumption that the notes will be repaid in full on the Put Date, in each case, determined on the basis of a yield (the "Offer Yield") to the Put Date equal to the sum of (a) the yield to maturity (the "Reference Yield") on the 3.25% U.S. Treasury Note due August 15, 2008 (the "Reference Security"), as calculated in accordance with standard market practice, based on the bid price for such Reference Security as of 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on May 22, 2006 (or such time and date as may be extended, such time and date, the "Price Determination Date"), as displayed on the Bloomberg Government Pricing Monitor on Page "BBT5" (the "Reference Page") or any recognized quotation source, plus (b) 50 basis points (the "Fixed Spread"), minus accrued and unpaid interest from the last interest payment date to, but not including, the date of payment (the "Payment Date") (the consideration referred to in clause (i) is referred to as the "Total Consideration"), minus (ii) an amount equal to the consent payment, being rounded to the nearest cent per $1,000 principal amount of the notes. Holders that validly tender their notes shall also receive accrued and unpaid interest from the last interest payment date to, but not including, the Payment Date (the "Accrued Interest"), which is expected to be a date promptly following the date on which American Greetings accepts notes for payment pursuant to the tender offer and the consent solicitation (the "Acceptance Date"). The Acceptance Date is expected to be Wednesday, May 24, 2006, and the Payment Date is expected to be Thursday, May 25, 2006.
A consent payment of $15 per $1,000 of principal amount of notes will be paid on the Payment Date to holders who tender their notes and provide their consents to the proposed indenture amendments at or prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on April 19, 2006. Notes tendered and consents delivered at or prior to 5:00 p.m. on April 19, 2006 may not be withdrawn or revoked after that time. Holders of notes tendered after such date will not receive a consent payment.
The offer is subject to several conditions, including the tender of, and the receipt of consents from holders of, at least 66 2/3% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes, the execution of a supplemental indenture amending the note indenture, the receipt by American Greetings of sufficient gross proceeds from the consummation of a contemplated public offering or private placement of new senior notes, a portion of which proceeds would be used to purchase the notes tendered in the tender offer, and the receipt by American Greetings of the consent of the global agent under the Credit Agreement described above under Item 1.01, and other customary conditions. American Greetings anticipates receiving the consent under the Credit Agreement by the expiration date of the tender offer. American Greetings may amend, extend or terminate the tender offer and consent solicitation at its sole discretion.
This announcement constitutes neither an offer to purchase nor a solicitation of an offer to sell the notes. The tender offer and consent solicitation will be made only pursuant to the Offer to Purchase and Consent Solicitation Statement and related materials, which will be delivered to all note holders. Persons with questions regarding the tender offer and the consent solicitation should contact UBS Securities LLC, the Dealer Manager and Solicitation Agent, at (888) 722-9555 ext. 4210, or Global Bondholder Services Corporation, the Information Agent, at (866) 795-2200.

Section 3.01 .
Increased Costs, Illegality, etc
(a) In the event that (x) in the case of clause (i) below, the Global Agent or (y) in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) below, any Lender, shall have determined on a reasonable basis (which determination shall, absent manifest error, be final and conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto):
(i) on any date for determining the interest rate applicable to any Fixed Rate Loan for any Interest Period that, by reason of any changes arising after the Closing Date, adequate and fair means do not exist for ascertaining the applicable interest rate on the basis provided for in this Agreement for such Fixed Rate Loan; or
(ii) at any time, that such Lender shall incur increased costs or reductions in the amounts received or receivable by it hereunder in an amount that such Lender deems material with respect to any Fixed Rate Loans (other than any increased cost or reduction in the amount received or receivable resulting from the imposition of or a change in the rate of taxes or similar charges) because of (x) any change since the Closing Date in any applicable law, governmental rule, regulation, guideline, order or request (whether or not having the force of law), or in the interpretation or administration thereof and including the introduction of any new law or governmental rule, regulation, guideline, order or request (such as, for example, but not limited to, a change in official reserve requirements, but, in all events, excluding reserves already includable in the interest rate applicable to such Fixed Rate Loan pursuant to this Agreement) or (y) other circumstances adversely affecting the London interbank market or the Canadian commercial banking market or the position of such Lender in any such market; or
(iii) at any time, that the making or continuance of any Fixed Rate Loan has become unlawful by compliance by such Lender in good faith with any change since the Closing Date in any law, governmental rule, regulation, guideline or order, or the interpretation or application thereof, or would conflict with any thereof not having the force of law but with which such Lender customarily complies, or has become impracticable as a result of a contingency occurring after the Closing Date that materially adversely affects the London interbank market or the Canadian commercial banking market;
, and in each such event, such Lender (or the Global Agent in the case of clause (i) above) shall (x) on or promptly following such date or time and (y) within 10 Business Days of the date on which such event no longer exists give notice (by telephone confirmed in writing) to the Company and to the Global Agent of such determination (which notice the Global Agent shall promptly transmit to each of the other Lenders). Thereafter (x) in the case of clause (i) above, the affected Type of Fixed Rate Loans shall no longer be available until such time as the Global Agent notifies the Borrowers and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice by the Global Agent no longer exist, and any Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Continuation or Conversion given by any Borrower with respect to such Type of Fixed Rate Loans that have not yet been incurred, Converted or Continued shall be deemed rescinded by the applicable Borrower or, in the case of a Notice of Borrowing other than a Borrowing of Foreign Currency Loans, shall, at the option of such Borrower, be deemed converted into a Notice of Borrowing
then
 
for Base Rate Loans to be made on the date of Borrowing contained in such Notice of Borrowing, (y) in the case of clause (ii) above, the applicable Borrower shall pay to such Lender, upon written demand therefor, such additional amounts (in the form of an increased rate of, or a different method of calculating, interest or otherwise as such Lender shall determine) as shall be required to compensate such Lender, for such increased costs or reductions in amounts receivable hereunder (a written notice as to the additional amounts owed to such Lender, showing the basis for the calculation thereof, which basis must be reasonable, submitted to such Borrower by such Lender shall, absent manifest error, be final and conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto) and (z) in the case of clause (iii) above, such Borrower shall take one of the actions specified in Section 3.01(b) as promptly as possible and, in any event, within the time period required by law.
(b) At any time that any Fixed Rate Loan is affected by the circumstances described in Section 3.01(a)(ii) or (iii), the applicable Borrower may (and in the case of a Fixed Rate Loan affected pursuant to Section 3.01(a)(iii) such Borrower shall) either (i) if the affected Fixed Rate Loan is then being made pursuant to a Borrowing, by giving the Global Agent telephonic notice (confirmed promptly in writing) thereof on the same date that such Borrower was notified by a Lender pursuant to Section 3.01(a)(ii) or (iii), cancel said Borrowing, or, in the case of any Borrowing other than a Borrowing of Foreign Currency Loans, convert the related Notice of Borrowing into one requesting a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans or require the affected Lender to make its requested Loan as a Base Rate Loan, or (ii) if the affected Fixed Rate Loan is then outstanding, upon at least one Business Day's notice to the Global Agent, require the affected Lender to Convert each such Fixed Rate Loan into a Base Rate Loan or, in the case of a Foreign Currency Loan, prepay in full such Foreign Currency Loan; that if more than one Lender is affected at any time, then all affected Lenders must be treated the same pursuant to this Section 3.01(b).
provided, however,
(c) If any Lender shall have determined that after the Closing Date, the adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation regarding capital adequacy, or any change therein, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency charged by law with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by such Lender or its parent corporation with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank, or comparable agency, in each case made subsequent to the Closing Date, has or would have the effect of reducing by an amount reasonably deemed by such Lender to be material to the rate of return on such Lender's or its parent corporation's capital or assets as a consequence of such Lender's commitments or obligations hereunder to a level below that which such Lender or its parent corporation could have achieved but for such adoption, effectiveness, change or compliance (taking into consideration such Lender's or its parent corporation's policies with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time, within 15 days after demand by such Lender (with a copy to the Global Agent), the applicable Borrower(s) shall pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or its parent corporation for such reduction. Each Lender, upon determining in good faith that any additional amounts will be payable pursuant to this Section 3.01(c), will give prompt written notice thereof to the applicable Borrower(s), which notice shall set forth, in reasonable detail, the basis of the calculation of such additional amounts, which basis must be reasonable, although the failure to give any such notice shall not release or diminish any of such Borrower's obligations to pay additional amounts pursuant to this Section 3.01(c) upon the subsequent receipt of such notice.
(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) no Lender shall be entitled to compensation or payment or reimbursement of other amounts under Section 3.01 or Section 3.04 for any amounts incurred or accruing more than 120 days prior to the giving of notice to the applicable Borrower of additional costs or other amounts of the nature described in such Sections, and (ii) no Lender shall demand compensation for any reduction referred to in Section 3.01(c) or payment or
 
reimbursement of other amounts under Section 3.04 if it shall not at the time be the general policy or practice of such Lender to demand such compensation, payment or reimbursement in similar circumstances under comparable provisions of other credit agreements.
Section 3.02 . Each Borrower shall compensate each Lender (including the Swing Line Lender), upon its written request (which request shall set forth the detailed basis for requesting and the method of calculating such compensation), for all reasonable losses, costs, expenses and liabilities (including, without limitation, any loss, cost, expense or liability incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds required by such Lender to fund its Fixed Rate Loans or Swing Loans and costs associated with foreign currency hedging obligations incurred by such Lender in connection with any Fixed Rate Loan, but excluding any loss of the Applicable Margin on such Loans) which such Lender may sustain in connection with any of the foregoing: (i) if for any reason (other than a default by such Lender or the Global Agent) a Borrowing of Fixed Rate Loans or Swing Loans does not occur on a date specified therefor in a Notice of Borrowing or a Notice of Continuation or Conversion (whether or not withdrawn by such Borrower or deemed withdrawn pursuant to Section 3.01(a)); (ii) in connection with the adjustment of any of the Obligations pursuant to Section 2.10; (iii) if any repayment, prepayment, Conversion or Continuation of any of its Fixed Rate Loans occurs on a date that is not the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto or any Swing Loan is paid prior to the Swing Loan Maturity Date applicable thereto; (iv) if any prepayment of any of its Fixed Rate Loans is not made on any date specified in a notice of prepayment given by such Borrower; (v) as a result of an assignment by a Lender of any Fixed Rate Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto pursuant to a request by such Borrower pursuant to Section 3.05(b); or (vi) as a consequence of (x) any other default by such Borrower to repay or prepay its Fixed Rate Loans when required by the terms of this Agreement or (y) an election made pursuant to Section 3.05(b). The written request of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered to the Company and each other Borrower responsible therefor and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such request within 10 days after receipt thereof.
Breakage Compensation
Section 3.03 .
Net Payments
(a) All payments made by each Borrower hereunder, under any Note or any other Loan Document, and all payments made by the Company pursuant to its guaranty obligations under Article X, shall be made without setoff, counterclaim or other defense. Except as provided for in Section 3.03(b), all such payments will be made free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for, any present or future taxes, levies, imposts, duties, fees, assessments or other charges of whatever nature now or hereafter imposed by any jurisdiction or by any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein with respect to such payments (but excluding, except as provided in the second succeeding sentence, any tax imposed on or measured by the net income or net profits of a Lender and franchise taxes imposed on it pursuant to the laws of the jurisdiction under which such Lender is organized or the jurisdiction in which the principal office or the Domestic Lending Office or Foreign Lending Office of such Lender, as applicable, is located or any subdivision thereof or therein) and all interest, penalties or similar liabilities with respect to such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, duties, fees, assessments or other charges (all such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, duties, fees, assessments or other charges being referred to collectively as ""). If any Taxes are so levied or imposed, the applicable Borrower agrees to pay the full amount of such Taxes and such additional amounts as may be necessary so that every payment by it of all amounts due hereunder, under any Note or under any other Loan Document, after withholding or deduction for or on account of any Taxes will not be less than the amount provided for herein or in such Note or in such other Loan Document. If any amounts are payable in respect of Taxes pursuant to the preceding sentence, such Borrower agrees to reimburse each Lender, upon the written request of such Lender for taxes imposed on or measured by the net income or profits of such Lender by reason of the
Taxes
 
payment of such Taxes and net of any tax benefits received by such Lender pursuant to the laws of the jurisdiction in which such Lender is organized or in which the principal office or Domestic Lending Office or Foreign Lending Office of such Lender is located, as the case may be, or under the laws of any political subdivision or taxing authority of any such jurisdiction in which the principal office or the Domestic Lending Office or Foreign Lending Office of such Lender is located, as the case may be, and for any withholding of income or similar taxes imposed by the United States of America or, in the case of any Canadian Lender, Canada as such Lender shall determine are payable by, or withheld from, such Lender in respect of such amounts so paid to or on behalf of such Lender pursuant to the preceding sentence and in respect of any amounts paid to or on behalf of such Lender pursuant to this sentence, which request shall be accompanied by a statement from such Lender setting forth, in reasonable detail, the computations used in determining such amounts. Each Borrower will furnish to the Global Agent within 45 days after the date the payment of any Taxes, or any withholding or deduction on account thereof, is due pursuant to applicable law certified copies of tax receipts, or other evidence satisfactory to the respective Lender, evidencing such payment by such Borrower. Each Borrower will indemnify and hold harmless the Global Agent and each Lender, and reimburse the Global Agent or such Lender upon its written request, for the amount of any Taxes attributable to such Borrower so levied or imposed and paid or withheld by such Lender.
(b) Each Lender that is not a United States Person (as such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) for Federal income tax purposes agrees to provide to the Company and the Global Agent on or prior to the Closing Date, or in the case of a Lender that is an assignee or transferee of an interest under this Agreement pursuant to Section 11.05 (unless the respective Lender was already a Lender hereunder immediately prior to such assignment or transfer and such Lender is in compliance with the provisions of this Section), on the date of such assignment or transfer to such Lender, and from time to time thereafter if required by the Company or the Global Agent: (i) two accurate and complete original signed copies of Internal Revenue Service Forms 1001, 4224, W-8BEN, W-8ECI, W-8EXP or W-8IMY (or successor, substitute or other appropriate forms) certifying to such Lender's entitlement to a complete exemption from, or a reduced rate of withholding from, United States withholding tax with respect to payments to be made under this Agreement, any Note or any other Loan Document, or (ii) if the Lender cannot deliver the appropriate Internal Revenue Service Forms referred to in clause (i) above, (x) a certificate in form and substance satisfactory to the Global Agent (any such certificate, an "") and (y) other appropriate documentation certifying to such Lender's entitlement to a complete exemption from, or reduced rate of withholding from, United States withholding tax with respect to payments of interest to be made under this Agreement, any Note or any other Loan Document. In addition, each Lender agrees that from time to time after the Closing Date, when a lapse in time or change in circumstances renders the previous certification obsolete or inaccurate in any material respect, it will deliver to the Company and the Global Agent two new accurate and complete original signed copies of the applicable Internal Revenue Service Form, or an Exemption Certificate and related documentation, as the case may be, and such other forms as may be required to confirm or establish the entitlement of such Lender to a continued exemption from or reduction in United States withholding tax with respect to payments under this Agreement, any Note or any other Loan Document, or it shall immediately notify the Company and the Global Agent of its inability to deliver any such Form or Exemption Certificate and related documentation, in which case such Lender shall not be required to deliver any such Form or Exemption Certificate and related documentation pursuant to this Section 3.03(b). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 3.03(a), but subject to Section 11.05(c) and the immediately succeeding sentence, (x) each Borrower shall be entitled, to the extent it is required to do so by law, to deduct or withhold income or other similar taxes imposed by the United States (or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein) from interest, fees or other amounts payable hereunder for the account of any Lender that is not a United States Person (as such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) for United States federal income tax purposes and that has not provided to the Company such Forms or such Exemption Certificate and related documentation that
Exemption Certificate
 
establish a complete exemption from or reduction in the rate of such deduction or withholding and (y) no Borrower shall be obligated pursuant to Section 3.03(a) to gross-up payments to be made to a Lender in respect of income or similar taxes imposed by the United States or any additional amounts with respect thereto (A) if such Lender has not provided to the Company the Internal Revenue Service forms required to be provided to the Company pursuant to this Section 3.03(b) or (B) in the case of a payment other than interest, to a Lender described in clause (ii) above, to the extent that such forms do not establish a complete exemption from withholding of such taxes. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the preceding sentence or elsewhere in this Section 3.03 and except as specifically provided for in Section 11.05(c), each Borrower agrees to pay additional amounts and indemnify each Lender in the manner set forth in Section 3.03(a) (without regard to the identity of the jurisdiction requiring the deduction or withholding) in respect of any Taxes deducted or withheld by it as described in the previous sentence as a result of any changes after the Closing Date in any applicable law, treaty, governmental rule, regulation, guideline or order, or in the interpretation thereof, relating to the deducting or withholding of income or similar Taxes.
(c) If any Lender, in its sole opinion, determines that it has finally and irrevocably received or been granted a refund in respect of any Taxes paid as to which indemnification has been paid by any Borrower pursuant to this Section, it shall promptly remit to such Borrower such refund (including any interest received in respect thereof), net of all out-of-pocket costs and expenses; that such Borrower agrees to promptly return any such refund (plus interest) to such Lender in the event such Lender is required to repay such refund to the relevant taxing authority. Any such Lender shall provide such Borrower with a copy of any notice of assessment from the relevant taxing authority (redacting any unrelated confidential information contained therein) requiring repayment of such refund. Nothing contained herein shall impose an obligation on any Lender to apply for any such refund or disclose its tax returns or any other information regarding its taxes that it reasonably deems confidential.
provided, however,
Section 3.04 . If after the Closing Date, the adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change therein, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any LC Issuer or any Lender with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) by any such authority, central bank or comparable agency (in each case made subsequent to the Closing Date) shall either (i) impose, modify or make applicable any reserve, deposit, capital adequacy or similar requirement against Letters of Credit issued by such LC Issuer or such Lender's participation therein, or (ii) shall impose on such LC Issuer or any Lender any other conditions affecting this Agreement, any Letter of Credit or such Lender's participation therein; and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such LC Issuer or such Lender of issuing, maintaining or participating in any Letter of Credit, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such LC Issuer or such Lender hereunder (other than any increased cost or reduction in the amount received or receivable resulting from the imposition of or a change in the rate of taxes or similar charges), then, upon demand to the applicable Borrowers by such LC Issuer or such Lender (a copy of which notice shall be sent by such LC Issuer or such Lender to the Global Agent), each such Borrower shall pay to such LC Issuer or such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate any such LC Issuer or such Lender for such increased cost or reduction. A certificate submitted to such Borrower by any LC Issuer or any Lender, as the case may be (a copy of which certificate shall be sent by such LC Issuer or such Lender to the Global Agent), setting forth, in reasonable detail, the basis for the determination of such additional amount or amounts necessary to compensate any LC Issuer or such Lender as aforesaid shall be conclusive and binding on such Borrower absent manifest error, although the failure to deliver any such certificate shall not release or diminish any of such Borrower's obligations to pay additional amounts pursuant to this Section.
Increased Costs to LC Issuers

Change of Lending Office; Replacement of Lenders
(a) Each Lender agrees that, upon the occurrence of any event giving rise to the operation of Section 3.01(a)(ii) or (iii), Section 3.01(c), Section 3.03 or Section 3.04 with respect to such Lender, it will, if requested by the Company, use reasonable efforts (subject to overall policy considerations of such Lender) to designate another Domestic Lending Office or Foreign Lending Office for any Loans or Commitments affected by such event; that such designation is made on such terms that such Lender and its Domestic Lending Office or Foreign Lending Office, as the case may be, suffer no economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage, with the object of avoiding the consequence of the event giving rise to the operation of any such Section.
provided, however,
(b) If (i) any Lender requests any compensation, reimbursement or other payment under Section 3.01(a)(ii) or (iii), 3.01(c) or Section 3.04 with respect to such Lender, (ii) any Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or Governmental Authority pursuant to Section 3.03, or (iii) any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, then the Company may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Global Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with the restrictions contained in Section 11.05(c)), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an Eligible Assignee that shall assume such obligations; that (x) the Company shall have received the prior written consent of the Global Agent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, (y) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the applicable Borrower or Borrowers (in the case of all other amounts, including any breakage compensation under Section 3.02), and (z) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation, reimbursement or other payments required to be made under Section 3.01(a)(ii) or (iii), (c) or Section 3.04 with respect to such Lender, or resulting from any required payments to any Lender or Governmental Authority pursuant to Section 3.03, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation, reimbursement or payments. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Company to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.
provided, however,
(c) Nothing in this Section 3.05 shall affect or postpone any of the obligations of the Borrowers or the right of any Lender provided in Section 3.01, Section 3.03 or Section 3.04.

Upon the acceptance of a successor's appointment as Global Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring (or retired) Global Agent, and the retiring Global Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents (if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this paragraph).

(D) upon surrender of the old Notes, if any, upon request of the new Lender, new Notes will be issued, at the Borrowers' expense, to such new Lender and to the assigning Lender, to the extent needed to reflect the revised Commitments; and
(E) unless waived by the Global Agent, the Global Agent shall receive at the time of each such assignment, from the assigning or assignee Lender, the
 
payment of a non-refundable assignment fee of $3,500, except, in the case of (i) one or more assignments to an Affiliate of the assigning Lender or an Approved Fund of the assigning Lender, in which case the assignment fee for all such assignments shall be $1,000, and (ii) an assignment involving either the Global Agent (in its capacity as a Lender) or the Syndication Agent (in its capacity as a Lender), in which case there shall be no fee required.
(ii) To the extent of any assignment pursuant to this subpart (c), the assigning Lender shall be relieved of its obligations hereunder with respect to its assigned Commitments.
(iii) At the time of each assignment pursuant to this subpart (c) to a Person that is not already a Lender hereunder and that is not a United States Person (as such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) for Federal income tax purposes the respective assignee Lender shall provide to the Company and the Global Agent the appropriate Internal Revenue Service Forms (and, if applicable an Exemption Certificate) described in Section 3.03(b). To the extent that an assignment of all or any portion of a Lender's Commitment and related outstanding Obligations pursuant to this subpart (c) would, at the time of such assignment, result in increased costs under Section 3.01 from those being charged by the respective assigning Lender prior to such assignment, then the Company shall not be obligated to pay such increased costs (although the Borrowers shall be obligated to pay any other increased costs of the type described above resulting from changes after the date of the respective assignment).
(iv) With respect to any Lender, the transfer of any Commitment of such Lender and the rights to the principal of, and interest on, any Loan made pursuant to such Commitment shall not be effective until such transfer is recorded on the Lender Register maintained by the Global Agent with respect to ownership of such Commitment and Loans and prior to such recordation all amounts owing to the transferor with respect to such Commitment and Loans shall remain owing to the transferor. The registration of assignment or transfer of all or part of any Commitments and Loans shall be recorded by the Global Agent on the Lender Register only upon the acceptance by the Global Agent of a properly executed and delivered Assignment Agreement pursuant to this subpart (c).

No such pledge, or any assignment pursuant to or in lieu of an enforcement of such a pledge, shall relieve the transferor Lender from its obligations hereunder.
(d) . Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Section, no transfer or assignment of the interests or obligations of any Lender hereunder or any grant of participation therein shall be permitted if such transfer, assignment or grant would require any Borrower to file a registration statement with the SEC or to qualify the Loans under the "Blue Sky" laws of any state.

Section 11.06 . No failure or delay on the part of the Global Agent or any Lender in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder or under any other Loan Document and no course of dealing between the Borrowers and the Global Agent or any Lender shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder or under any other Loan Document preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege hereunder or thereunder. No notice to or demand on any Borrower in any case shall entitle such Borrower to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances or constitute a waiver of the rights of the Global Agent or the Lenders to any other or further action in any circumstances without notice or demand. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan or any LC Issuance shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default or Event of Default, regardless of whether the Global Agent, any Lender or any LC Issuer may have had notice or knowledge of such Default or Event of Default at the time. The rights and remedies herein expressly provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies that the Global Agent or any Lender would otherwise have.

Exhibit 99.1
 
CLEVELAND (April 6, 2006)  American Greetings Corporation (NYSE: AM) today announced its results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended February 28, 2006, significant refinancing activities and an 8 cent per share cash dividend.
Fourth Quarter Results
For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company reported net sales of $509.3 million, pre-tax income from continuing operations of $63.1 million and income from continuing operations of $50.6 million or 70 cents per share (all per-share amounts assume dilution). In December, the Company had anticipated fourth quarter earnings per share of 44 cents to 59 cents. The Company's lowered fourth quarter tax rate and reduced share count were the drivers for the difference between the reported earnings per share and the anticipated earnings per share.
During the quarter, the Company decided to sell its South African business unit and as a result has categorized this business as a discontinued operation for all periods presented in its financial statements. This business unit contributed $5.4 million in net sales in the fiscal fourth quarter and $18.4 million during fiscal 2006.
Fiscal Year 2006 Results
For the fiscal year ended February 28, 2006, the Company reported net sales of $1,885.7 million, pre-tax income from continuing operations of $138.9 million and income from continuing operations of $90.1 million or $1.23 per share. Included in the $1.23 of earnings per share was a non-cash pre-tax goodwill impairment charge recorded in the third quarter of $43.2 million (after-tax of approximately $33 million) that reduced earnings per share by 42 cents. In December, the Company had anticipated full year earnings per share of $1.03 to $1.18, including the goodwill impairment charge, and $1.45 to $1.60 exclusive of the goodwill impairment charge. The Company believes that providing the earnings per share impact of the impairment charge is useful for investors who are focusing on core operating results and calculating comparability to prior periods and estimates.
Management Comments
Chief Executive Officer Zev Weiss said, "As we celebrate our 100
th
year as a Company, we continue to focus on the activities consumers have looked to us to provide for those 100 years: Meaningful connections to help them express and celebrate their lives. To improve our ability to enable those connections, we expect to spend almost $75 million during our 101
st
year. The expenditures will enhance both our product, such as the quality of our cards, and the merchandising of that product, such as the fixtures on which the product is displayed."
Weiss added, "Besides a focus on our card business, we are significantly enhancing our capital structure to permit simultaneous expenditures in both our core card business as well as an investment in our own shares. Our objective in making these concurrent investments is to generate higher earnings per share over the long-term. We believe our shares are trading at a discount to intrinsic value. Based upon our performance and our share price, we may purchase additional shares beyond the current repurchase program."
Financing Activities
The Company is taking the following actions to change its capital structure, the collective result of which is $1 billion of new or amended financial facilities. The following financing activities have recently been completed or will likely be completed over the next two months:
 
 
Share Repurchases and Dividend Declaration
During the fourth fiscal quarter, the Company purchased 4.3 million shares of common stock for $93.8 million. Approximately $51 million of the share repurchase spending during the quarter was completed under a repurchase program initiated in April of 2005 and completed in January of 2006. Approximately $43 million of the share repurchase spending was completed under a second $200 million repurchase program announced in February of 2006. With an additional $52.8 million spent after the fiscal year end (during March 2006) for 2.5 million shares, the Company has repurchased about $96 million of common stock or roughly 48% of its second repurchase program.
The Company's Board of Directors authorized a cash dividend of 8 cents per share to be paid on May 1, 2006 to shareholders of record at the close of business on April 21, 2006.
Management Outlook
For fiscal 2007, the Company is projecting earnings per share to be between 80 cents and $1.00. The Company has included in its estimate a $74 million expenditure in its card business, the completion of its second $200 million share repurchase program, the completion of its exchange offer for its convertible subordinated notes, the completion of its tender offer for its 6.1% senior notes and the issuance of $200 million of new 10-year senior unsecured notes. The estimate includes the amortization of deferred financing costs, but not one-time costs such as premium payments related to the financing activities. Also included in the estimate is the anticipated expense for stock options as required upon the adoption of a new accounting rule known as FAS 123R.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On May 19, 2006, American Greetings Corporation entered into an Underwriting Agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement"), with UBS Securities LLC, J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., and McDonald Investments Inc., as the managing underwriters, in connection with an underwritten public offering (the "Offering") of $200,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 7
 3
/
8
% Senior Notes due 2016 (the "Notes"). The Underwriting Agreement includes indemnification and contribution obligations and other terms and conditions customary in agreements of this type. The Offering is expected to be completed on May 24, 2006. Upon completion of the Offering, the Notes will be issued pursuant to the Indenture (defined below) with the following terms:
The Notes will mature on June 1, 2016 and will bear interest at a fixed rate of 7
 3
/
8
% per annum, payable semi-annually on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing December 1, 2006. The Notes will be our general unsecured obligations. The Notes will rank equally with our other senior unsecured indebtedness and senior in right of payment to all of our obligations that are, by their terms, expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes. The Notes will be effectively subordinated to all of our secured indebtedness, including borrowings under our new credit facility, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. The Notes will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future obligations of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes. On the issue date, none of our subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes.
Except as set forth below, the notes may not be redeemed prior to June 1, 2011. At any time or from time to time on or after June 1, 2011, we, at our option, may redeem the notes, in whole or in part, at the redemption prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount) set forth below, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to the redemption date, if redeemed during the 12-month period beginning June 1 of the years indicated:
 
In addition, at any time prior to June 1, 2011, the notes may also be redeemed or purchased (by American Greetings or any other person) in whole or in part, at our option, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus the Applicable Premium as of, and accrued but unpaid interest, if any, to, the date of redemption or purchase (the "Redemption Date") (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).
"Applicable Premium" means, with respect to a Note at any Redemption Date, the greater of:
(1) 1.0% of the principal amount of such Note; and
(2) the excess of:
(a) the present value at such Redemption Date of (1) the redemption price of such Note on June 1, 2011 (such redemption price being that described above) plus (2) all required remaining scheduled interest payments due on such Note through June 1, 2011, other than accrued interest to such Redemption Date, computed using a discount rate equal to the Treasury Rate plus 50 basis points per annum discounted on a semi-annual bond equivalent basis, over
(b) the principal amount of such Note on such Redemption Date.
"Treasury Rate" means, with respect to a Redemption Date, the yield to maturity at the time of computation of United States Treasury securities with a constant maturity (as compiled and published in the most recent Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.15(519) that has become publicly available at least two business days prior to such Redemption Date
 
(or, if such Statistical Release is no longer published, any publicly available source of similar market data)) most nearly equal to the period from such Redemption Date to June 1, 2011, , that if the period from such Redemption Date to June 1, 2011 is not equal to the constant maturity of a United States Treasury security for which a weekly average yield is given, the Treasury Rate shall be obtained by linear interpolation (calculated to the nearest one-twelfth of a year) from the weekly average yields of United States Treasury securities for which such yields are given, except that if the period from such Redemption Date to June 1, 2011 is less than one year, the weekly average yield on actually traded United States Treasury securities adjusted to a constant maturity of one year shall be used.
; provided
however
At any time or from time to time prior to June 1, 2009, at our option, we may redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes with the net cash proceeds of one or more Qualified Equity Offerings (as defined in the Indenture) at a redemption price equal to 107.375% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to the date of redemption; that (1) at least 65% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes remains outstanding immediately after the occurrence of such redemption and (2) the redemption occurs within 90 days of the date of the closing of any such Qualified Equity Offering.
provided
Upon the occurrence of any "change of control" (as defined in the Indenture), each holder of Notes will have the right to require us to purchase all of that holder's Notes for a cash price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes to be purchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase.
In connection with the Offering, we will enter an Indenture (the "Indenture") with The Bank of Nova Scotia Trust Company of New York, as trustee (the "Trustee"). The Indenture will provide for the issuance by American Greetings of the Notes. The Indenture will contain certain covenants that, among other things, will limit our ability and the ability of certain of our restricted subsidiaries to:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The foregoing description of the Indenture and the Notes is qualified in its entirety by reference to the copy of the forms of such documents attached hereto as Exhibits 4.1 and 4.2, and incorporated herein by reference.
The Notes are registered pursuant to the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-134029) that American Greetings filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on May 11, 2006 relating to the public offering from time to time of debt securities of American Greetings pursuant to Rule 415 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Registration Statement").

If UBS elects to terminate this Agreement as provided in this Section 8, the Company and each other Underwriter shall be notified promptly in writing.

Schedule C
(c) If any action, suit or proceeding (each, a "") is brought against a person (an "") in respect of which indemnity may be sought against the Company or an Underwriter (as applicable, the "") pursuant to subsection (a) or (b), respectively, of this Section 9, such indemnified party shall promptly notify such indemnifying party in writing of the institution of such Proceeding and such indemnifying party shall assume the defense of such Proceeding, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party and payment of all fees and expenses; , , that the omission to so notify such indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability which such indemnifying party may have to any indemnified party under this Section 9, except to the extent such indemnifying party has been materially prejudiced by such failure; , , that the omission to so notify such indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying

party from any liability which such indemnifying party may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 9. The indemnified party or parties shall have the right to employ its or their own counsel in any such case, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party or parties unless the employment of such counsel shall have been authorized in writing by the indemnifying party in connection with the defense of such Proceeding or the indemnifying party shall not have, within a reasonable period of time in light of the circumstances, employed counsel to defend such Proceeding or such indemnified party or parties shall have reasonably concluded that there may be defenses available to it or them which are different from, additional to or in conflict with those available to such indemnifying party (in which case such indemnifying party shall not have the right to direct the defense of such Proceeding on behalf of the indemnified party or parties), in any of which events such fees and expenses shall be borne by such indemnifying party and paid as incurred (it being understood, however, that such indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (in addition to any local counsel) in any one Proceeding or series of related Proceedings in the same jurisdiction representing the indemnified parties who are parties to such Proceeding). The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any Proceeding effected without its written consent, such indemnifying party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the indemnified party or parties from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the second sentence of this Section 9(c), then the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any Proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 60 business days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have fully reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement and (iii) such indemnified party shall have given the indemnifying party at least 30 days' prior written notice of its intention to settle. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened Proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such Proceeding and does not include an admission of fault or culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of such indemnified party.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to an indemnified party under subsections (a) and (b) of this Section 9 or insufficient to hold an indemnified party harmless in respect of any losses, damages, expenses, liabilities or claims referred to therein, then each applicable indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, damages, expenses, liabilities or claims (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, damages, expenses, liabilities or claims, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative
 
benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total proceeds from the offering (net of underwriting discounts and commissions but before deducting expenses) received by the Company, and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, bear to the aggregate public offering price of the Securities. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, damages, expenses, liabilities and claims referred to in this subsection shall be deemed to include any reasonable legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating, preparing to defend or defending any Proceeding.
(e) The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 9 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in subsection (d) above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 9, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by such Underwriter and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damage which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 9 are several in proportion to their respective underwriting commitments and not joint.
(f) The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Section 9 and the covenants, warranties and representations of the Company contained in this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, its partners, directors or officers or any person (including each partner, officer or director of such person) who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, or by or on behalf of the Company, its directors or officers or any person who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and shall survive any termination of this Agreement or the issuance and delivery of the Securities. The Company and the Underwriter agree promptly to notify each other of the commencement of any Proceeding against it and, in the case of the Company against any of the Company's officers or directors in connection with the issuance and sale of the Securities, or in connection with the Registration Statement, any Base Prospectus, any Pre-Pricing Prospectus, the Prospectus or any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus.
10. . The statements regarding the Underwriters on the front and back covers of the Prospectus and the statements set forth in the fifth paragraph under the caption "Underwriting" in the Prospectus Supplement, only insofar as such statements relate to over-allotment and stabilization activities that may be undertaken by the Underwriters, constitute the only information furnished by or on behalf of the Underwriters, as such information is referred to in Sections 3 and 9 hereof.

Replacement Notes
If a mutilated Note is surrendered to the Trustee or if the Holder presents evidence to the satisfaction of the Issuer and the Trustee that the Note has been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, the Issuer shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate a replacement Note.

If on a Redemption Date or the Maturity Date, the Paying Agent holds U.S. legal tender sufficient to pay all of the principal and interest due on the Notes payable on that date and is not prohibited from paying such money to the Holders thereof pursuant to the terms of this Indenture, then on and after that date such Notes cease to be outstanding and interest on them ceases to accrue.

Subject to Section 2.07 hereof, the Issuer
 
may not issue new Notes to replace Notes that it has paid or delivered to the Trustee for cancellation. If the Issuer shall acquire any of the Notes, such acquisition shall not operate as a redemption or satisfaction of the Indebtedness represented by such Notes unless and until the same are surrendered to the Trustee for cancellation pursuant to this Section 2.11. In no event shall the Trustee be required to destroy cancelled Notes.
Section 2.12. .
Defaulted Interest

However, without the consent of each Holder affected, an amendment, supplement or waiver, including a waiver pursuant to Section 6.04 hereof, may not:
(1) reduce, or change the maturity of, the principal of any Note (it being understood that any amendment or waiver of Section 4.12 requiring the application of Net Available Proceeds to make a Net Proceeds Offer shall not constitute a change of the maturity of the principal of any Note under this clause (1));
(2) reduce the rate of or extend the time for payment of interest on any Note;
(3) reduce any premium payable upon redemption of the Notes or change the date on which any Notes are subject to redemption (other than provisions relating to the purchase of Notes described under Sections 4.12 and 4.15, except that if a Change of Control has occurred, no amendment or other modification of the obligation of the Issuer to make a Change of Control Offer relating to such Change of Control shall be made without the consent of each Holder of the Notes affected);

(10) make any change in these amendment and waiver provisions.
The consent of the Holders of the Notes is not necessary under this Indenture to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment or waiver. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment or waiver.
After an amendment under this Indenture becomes effective, the Issuer is required to mail to Holders of the Notes a notice briefly describing such amendment. However, the failure to give such notice to all Holders of the Notes, or any defect therein, will not impair or affect the validity of the amendment.

Revocation and Effect of Consents
Until an amendment, waiver or supplement becomes effective, a consent to it by a Holder is a continuing consent by the Holder and every subsequent Holder of a Note or portion of a Note that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder's Note, even if notation of the consent is not made on any Note. Subject to the following paragraph, any such Holder or subsequent Holder may revoke the consent as to such Holder's Note or portion of such Note by notice to the Trustee or the Issuer received before the date on which the Trustee receives an Officers' Certificate certifying that the Holders of the requisite principal amount of Notes have consented (and not theretofore revoked such consent) to the amendment, supplement or waiver.
The Issuer may, but shall not be obligated to, fix a record date for the purpose of determining the Holders entitled to consent to any amendment, supplement or waiver. If a record date is fixed, then notwithstanding the last sentence of the immediately preceding paragraph, those Persons who were Holders at such record date (or their duly designated proxies), and only those Persons, shall be entitled to revoke any consent previously given, whether or not such Persons continue to be Holders after such record date. No such consent shall be valid or effective for more than 90 days after such record date.
After an amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective, it shall bind every Holder, unless it makes a change described in any of clauses (1) through (10) of Section 8.02 hereof, in which
 
case, the amendment, supplement or waiver shall bind only each Holder who has consented to it and every subsequent Holder of a Note or portion of a Note that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder's Note; that any such waiver shall not impair or affect the right of any Holder to receive payment of principal of and interest on a Note, on or after the respective due dates expressed in such Note, or to bring suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates without the consent of such Holder.
provided
Section 8.05. .
Notation on or Exchange of Notes
If an amendment, supplement, or waiver changes the terms of a Note, the Trustee may request the Holder to deliver it to the Trustee.

Alternatively, if the Issuer or the Trustee so determine, in exchange for the Note the Issuer shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate a new Note that reflects the changed terms.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
Amendment to Indenture for 6.10% Senior Notes due 2028
On April 6, 2006, American Greetings Corporation announced that it commenced a cash tender offer for all of its $300 million of outstanding 6.10% senior notes due August 1, 2028 (the "6.10% Notes") and a consent solicitation to amend the related note indenture (the "Indenture"). The consent solicitation sought consents from holders of the 6.10% Notes to eliminate certain restrictive covenants and events of default from the Indenture as described below.
On April 20, 2006, we announced that in connection with our tender offer and consent solicitation we received sufficient consents from holders of the 6.10% Notes to amend the Indenture. The consent payment deadline was at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on April 19, 2006.
On May 25, 2006, we announced that we had successfully completed our tender offer and consent solicitation for the 6.10% Notes. The tender offer expired at 5:00 p.m., New York City time on Wednesday, May 24, 2006. An aggregate of approximately $277.3 million of the 6.10% Notes were tendered pursuant to the offer and accepted by us for payment. In connection with the completion of the tender offer and consent solicitation, effective as of May 25, 2006, the Indenture was amended to eliminate certain restrictive covenants and events of default thereunder, including eliminating Sections 1008, 1009 and 1010 of the Indenture in their entirety. Section 1008 of the Indenture limited our ability to incur or guarantee any debt secured by a mortgage on any of our assets without making effective provisions for securing the 6.10% Notes equally and ratably with or prior to such secured debt. Section 1009 of the Indenture limited our ability to enter into any arrangement with any lender or investor providing for the leasing to us of our real property which has been or is to be sold or transferred by us more than 120 days after the date of acquisition thereof to such lender or investor on the security of such real property. Section 1010 of the Indenture limited our ability to incur or guarantee any unsecured funded debt, which generally includes (i) all indebtedness which matures, or which is renewable or extendible at the option of the obligor to a time, more than 12 months after the time of computation and all guarantees thereof, and (ii) all preferred stock of any of our subsidiaries.
In addition, we amended the Indenture to delete clause (3) of Section 801 of the Indenture in its entirety. By deleting this provision, we are permitted to consolidate with or merge into any other person, or convey, transfer or lease our properties and assets substantially as an entirety to any person, or permit any person to consolidate with or merge into us or convey, transfer or lease its properties and assets substantially as an entirety to us, subject to the satisfaction of the other remaining conditions that will remain in Section 801, without needing to satisfy the condition that if as a result of such transaction, our properties or assets would become subject to a mortgage, pledge, lien, security interest or other encumbrance that would not be permitted by the Indenture, American Greetings or such successor person secure the 6.10% Notes equally and ratably with (or prior to) all indebtedness secured thereby. We also amended Section 501 of the Indenture to delete references in the events of default to the Sections specified above and eliminate the events of default provided under Section 501(5) of the Indenture relating to cross defaults with respect to certain of our other indebtedness.
The foregoing description of the First Supplemental Indenture is qualified in its entirety by reference to the copy of the amendment attached hereto as Exhibit 4.1, and incorporated herein by reference.
Consummation of the Exchange Offer
On May 26, 2006, American Greetings Corporation entered into an indenture (the "New Notes Indenture") with U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee, in connection with American Greetings' offer to exchange (the "Exchange Offer") new 7.00% Convertible Subordinated Notes due July 15, 2006 (the "New Notes") for all of its outstanding 7.00% Convertible Subordinated Notes due July 15, 2006 (the "Old Notes").
As of May 26, 2006, the New Notes were issued pursuant to the New Notes Indenture to all holders of Old Notes who had properly tendered Old Notes in the Exchange Offer. A description of the material terms of the New Notes is incorporated herein by reference to the information under the headings "Summary Description of the Notes" and "Description of the New Notes" in the American Greetings' offering memorandum (the "Offering Memorandum") dated April 6, 2006, which was filed as Exhibit 99(a)(1)(i) to the American Greetings Schedule TO dated April 6, 2006, as amended and supplemented by Amendment No. 1 filed on April 26, 2006, Amendment No. 2 filed on May 10, 2006, Amendment No. 3 filed on May 12, 2006, Amendment No. 4 filed on May 15, 2006, Amendment No. 5 filed on May 22, 2006, and Amendment No. 6 filed
 
on May 26, 2006 (as amended and supplemented, the "Schedule TO"). The New Notes Indenture was qualified pursuant to our Form T-3 Application for Qualification of Trust Indenture (SEC File No. 022-28806). The New Notes Indenture is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.2.
Item 2.03. Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
The information included in Item 1.01 of this report under the heading "Consummation of the Exchange Offer" is incorporated by reference into this Item 2.03.
Item 3.02. Unregistered Sales Of Equity Securities.
The Exchange Offer expired at 12:00 midnight on May 25, 2006. Pursuant to the Exchange Offer, approximately $159.1 million aggregate principal amount, representing approximately 91.0% of the outstanding principal amount of the Old Notes, were exchanged for New Notes. We accepted all validly tendered Old Notes and, in exchange, issued a like principal amount of the New Notes and paid a cash exchange fee of $5.00 for each $1,000 principal amount of the Old Notes exchanged. We did not receive any proceeds from the issuance of the New Notes. The New Notes are convertible into a combination of cash and shares of our common stock. A description of the material terms of the conversion rights of the New Notes is incorporated herein by reference to the information under the headings "Summary Description of the Notes" and "Conversion Rights" in the Offering Memorandum, which was filed as Exhibit 99(a)(1)(i) to the Schedule TO.
The New Notes were issued solely to existing security holders of American Greetings. The New Notes were issued, and to the extent any shares of our common stock are issued upon conversion of the New Notes, such shares will be issued pursuant to the exemption from registration under Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. We did not pay or give, directly or indirectly, any commission or other remuneration, including underwriting discounts, to any broker, dealer, salesman or other person for soliciting tenders of the Old Notes in connection with the Exchange Offer, and we did not retain any dealer, manager or other agent to solicit tenders with respect to the Exchange Offer.

Promptly and in any case not later than ten days after setting a record date, the Company shall notify the Trustee and the Holders of such record date.

Promptly after such receipt by the Trustee of any such declaration or direction referred to in clause (ii) or (iii), and promptly after setting any record date with respect to clause (i), and as soon as practicable thereafter, the Trustee shall notify the Company and the Holders of any such record date so fixed. The Holders on such record date (or their duly appointed agents or proxies), and only such Persons, shall be entitled to join in such notice, declaration or direction, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date; provided that, unless such notice, declaration or direction shall have become effective by virtue of Holders of the requisite principal amount of Notes on such record date (or their duly appointed agents or proxies) having joined therein on or prior to the 90th day after such record date, such notice, declaration or direction shall automatically and without any action by any Person be cancelled and of no further effect. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prevent a Holder (or a duly appointed agent or proxy thereof) from giving, before or after the expiration of such 90-day period, a notice, declaration or direction contrary to or different from, or, after the expiration of such period, identical to, the notice, declaration or direction to which such record date relates, in which event a new record date in respect thereof shall be set pursuant to this paragraph. In addition, nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to render ineffective any notice, declaration or direction of the type referred to in this paragraph given at any time to the Trustee and the Company by Holders (or their duly appointed agents or proxies) of the requisite principal amount of Notes on the date such notice, declaration or direction is so given.

In case by reason of the suspension of regular mail service or by reason of any other cause it shall be impracticable to give such notice by mail, then such notification to Holders of Notes as shall be made with the approval of the Trustee, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, shall constitute a sufficient notification to such Holders for every purpose hereunder.
Such notice shall be deemed to have been given when such notice is mailed.
Where this Indenture provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by the Person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by Holders of Notes shall be filed with the Trustee, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver.

This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company designated as its "7.00% Convertible Subordinated Notes due July 15, 2006" (herein called the "Notes"), limited in aggregate principal amount to U.S. $159,122,000, issued and to be issued under an Indenture, dated as of May 26, 2006 (herein called the "Indenture"), between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee, the holders of Senior Indebtedness and the Holders of the Notes and of the terms upon which the Notes are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Notes are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of any authorized denominations as requested by the Holder surrendering the same upon surrender of the Note or Notes to be exchanged, at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee. The Trustee upon such surrender by the Holder will issue the new Notes in the requested denominations.
No sinking fund is provided for the Notes. The Company may not optionally redeem the Notes at any time.
In any case where the due date for the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any Note or the last day on which a Holder of a Note has a right to convert his Note shall be, at any Place of Payment or Place of Conversion as the case may be, a day on which banking institutions at such Place of Payment or Place of Conversion are authorized or obligated by law or executive order to close, then payment of principal, premium, if any, interest, or delivery for conversion of such Note need not be made on or by such date at such place but may be made on or by the next succeeding day at such place which is not a day on which banking institutions are authorized or obligated by law or executive order to close, with the same force and effect as if made on the date for such payment or the date fixed for repurchase, or by such last day for conversion, and no interest shall accrue on the amount so payable for the period after such date.
Subject to and upon compliance with the provisions of the Indenture, the Holder of this Note is entitled, at his option, at any time on or before the close of business on July 15, 2006, unless the Notes have been previously repurchased, to convert this Note (or any portion of the principal amount hereof that is an integral multiple of U.S. $1,000, provided that the unconverted portion of such principal amount is U.S. $1,000 or any integral multiple of U.S. $1,000 in excess thereof) into the right to receive (x) the Principal Return, (y) the Net Shares, if any, and (z) Additional Cash, if any, based on an initial Conversion Rate of 71.9466 shares of Common Stock for each U.S. $1,000 principal amount of Notes (or at the current adjusted Conversion Rate if an adjustment has been made as provided in the Indenture) by surrender of this Note, duly endorsed or assigned to the Company or in blank and, in case such surrender shall be made during the period from the close of business on the Regular Record Date to the opening of business on the Interest Payment Date (except if this Note is repurchasable on a Repurchase Date occurring during such period and is surrendered for such conversion during such period (including any Notes or portions thereof submitted for repurchase on a Repurchase Date that is the Regular Record Date or the Interest Payment Date, as the case may be)), also accompanied
 
by payment in New York Clearing House or other funds acceptable to the Company of an amount equal to the interest payable on such Interest Payment Date on the principal amount of this Note then being converted, and also the conversion notice hereon duly executed, to the Company at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, or at such other office or agency of the Company, subject to any laws or regulations applicable thereto and subject to the right of the Company to terminate the appointment of any Conversion Agent (as defined below) as may be designated by it for such purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, or at such other offices or agencies as the Company may designate (each a "Conversion Agent"), ,, that if this Note or portion hereof is repurchasable on a Repurchase Date occurring, in either case, during the period from the close of business on the Regular Record Date to the opening of business on the Interest Payment Date (including any Notes or portions thereof submitted for repurchase on a Repurchase Date that is the Regular Record Date or the Interest Payment Date, as the case may be) and is surrendered for conversion during such period (or on the last Business Day prior to the Regular Record Date or Interest Payment Date in case of any Note (or portion thereof) submitted for repurchase on a Repurchase Date on the Regular Record Date or Interest Payment Date, as the case may be), then the Holder of this Note on such Regular Record Date will be entitled to receive the interest accruing hereon from January 15, 2006 to the Interest Payment Date and the Holder of this Note who converts this Note or a portion hereof during such period shall not be required to pay such interest upon surrender of this Note for conversion. Subject to the provisions of the preceding sentence and, in the case of a conversion after the close of business on the Regular Record Date and on or before the close of business on the Interest Payment Date, to the right of the Holder of this Note (or any Predecessor Note of record as of such Regular Record Date) to receive the related installment of interest to the extent and under the circumstances provided in the Indenture, no cash payment or adjustment is to be made on conversion for interest accrued hereon from January 15, 2006, or for dividends on the Common Stock issued on conversion hereof. The Company shall thereafter deliver to the Holder the Principal Return, the Net Shares, if any, and Additional Cash, if any, (together with any cash adjustment, as provided in the Indenture) into which this Note is convertible and such delivery will be deemed to satisfy the Company's obligation to pay the principal amount of this Note. No fractions of shares or scrip representing fractions of shares will be issued on conversion, but instead of any fractional interest (calculated to the nearest l/100th of a share) the Company shall pay the Additional Cash as provided in the Indenture. The Conversion Rate is subject to adjustment as provided in the Indenture. In addition, the Indenture provides that in case of certain consolidations or mergers to which the Company is a party (other than a consolidation or merger that does not result in any reclassification, conversion, exchange or cancellation of the Common Stock) or the conveyance, transfer, sale or lease of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Company, the Indenture shall be amended, without the consent of any Holders of Notes, so that this Note, if then Outstanding, will be convertible thereafter, during the period this Note shall be convertible as specified above, only into the kind and amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such consolidation, merger, conveyance, transfer, sale or lease by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock of the Company into which this Note could have been converted immediately prior to such consolidation, merger, conveyance, transfer, sale or lease (assuming such holder of Common Stock is not a Constituent Person or an Affiliate of a Constituent Person, failed to exercise any rights of election and received per share the kind and amount received per share by
provided
further
 
a plurality of Non-electing Shares). No adjustment in the Conversion Rate will be made until such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least one percent of such rate, provided that any adjustment that would otherwise be made will be carried forward and taken into account in the computation of any subsequent adjustment.
If a Change in Control occurs, the Holder of this Note, at the Holder's option, shall have the right, in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, to require the Company to repurchase this Note (or any portion of the principal amount hereof that is at least $1,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof, provided that the portion of the principal amount of this Note to be Outstanding after such repurchase is at least equal to U.S. $1,000) for cash at a Repurchase Price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus interest accrued to the Repurchase Date. At the option of the Company, the Repurchase Price may be paid in cash or, subject to the conditions provided in the Indenture, by delivery of shares of Common Stock having a fair market value equal to the Repurchase Price. For purposes of this paragraph, the fair market value of shares of Common Stock shall be determined by the Company and shall be equal to 95% of the average of the Closing Prices Per Share for the five consecutive Trading Days immediately preceding and including the third Trading Day prior to the Repurchase Date. Whenever in this Note there is a reference, in any context, to the principal of any Note as of any time, such reference shall be deemed to include reference to the Repurchase Price payable in respect of such Note to the extent that such Repurchase Price is, was or would be so payable at such time, and express mention of the Repurchase Price in any provision of this Note shall not be construed as excluding the Repurchase Price so payable in those provisions of this Note when such express mention is not made; provided, however, that, for the purposes of the second succeeding paragraph, such reference shall be deemed to include reference to the Repurchase Price only to the extent the Repurchase Price is payable in cash.
[The following paragraph shall appear in each Global Note:
In the event of a deposit or withdrawal of an interest in this Note, including an exchange, transfer, repurchase or conversion of this Note in part only, the Trustee, as custodian of the Depositary, shall make an adjustment on its records to reflect such deposit or withdrawal in accordance with the Applicable Procedures.]
[The following paragraph shall appear in each Note that is not a Global Note:
In the event of repurchase or conversion of this Note in part only, a new Note or Notes for the unrepurchased or unconverted portion hereof will be issued in the name of the Holder hereof.]
The indebtedness evidenced by this Note is, to the extent and in the manner provided in the Indenture, subordinate and subject in right of payment to the prior payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness of the Company, and this Note is issued subject to such provisions of the Indenture with respect thereto. Each Holder of this Note, by accepting the same, (a) agrees to and shall be bound by such provisions, (b) authorizes and directs the Trustee on his behalf to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the subordination so provided and (c) appoints the Trustee his attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes.
 
If an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, the principal of all the Notes, together with accrued interest to the date of declaration, may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. Upon payment (i) of the amount of principal so declared due and payable, together with accrued interest to the date of declaration, and (ii) of interest on any overdue principal and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, overdue interest, all of the Company's obligations in respect of the payment of the principal of and interest on the Notes shall terminate.

The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Notes at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all the Notes, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note or such other Note.
As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the Holder of this Note shall not have the right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee or for any other remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have previously given the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default, the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Notes shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default as Trustee and offered the Trustee reasonable indemnity and the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes Outstanding a direction inconsistent with such request, and shall have failed to institute any such proceeding, for 60 days after receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity. The foregoing shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Holder of this Note for the enforcement of any payment of principal hereof, premiums if any, or interest hereon on or after the respective due dates expressed herein or for the enforcement of the right to convert this Note as provided in the Indenture.

No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to recover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

At the option of the Holder, and subject to the other provisions of this Section 3.5, Notes may be exchanged for other Notes of any authorized denomination and of a like aggregate principal amount, upon surrender of the Notes to be exchanged at any such office or agency. Whenever any Notes are so surrendered for exchange, and subject to the other provisions of this Section 3.5, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Notes which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive. Every Note presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange shall (if so required by the Company or the Note Registrar) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company, the Trustee and the Note Registrar duly executed, by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing.
All Notes issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Notes shall be the valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same debt and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as the Notes surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange.
No service charge shall be made to a Holder for any registration of transfer or exchange of Notes except as provided in Section 3.6, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Notes, other than exchanges pursuant to Section 3.4, 8.5, 11.2 or 13.3 (other than where any shares of Common Stock are to be issued or delivered in a name other than that of the Holder of the Note) not involving any transfer and other than any stamp and other duties, if any, which may be imposed in connection with any such transfer or exchange by the United States or any political subdivision thereof or therein, which shall be paid by the Company.
(2) . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture or the Notes, transfers and exchanges of Notes and beneficial interests in a Global Note of the kinds specified in this Section 3.5(2) shall be made only in accordance with this Section 3.5(2).
Certain Transfers and Exchanges
 
(i) . In the event that non-Global Notes are to be issued pursuant to Section 3.4(1)(ii) in connection with any transfer of Notes, such transfer may be effected only in accordance with the provisions of this Clause (2)(i) and subject to the Applicable Procedures. Upon receipt by the Trustee, as Note Registrar, of a Company Order from the Company directing the Trustee, as Note Registrar, to (x) authenticate and deliver one or more Notes of the same aggregate principal amount as the beneficial interest in the Global Note to be transferred, such instructions to contain the name or names of the designated transferee or transferees, the authorized denomination or denominations of the Notes to be so issued and appropriate delivery instructions and (y) decrease the beneficial interest of a specified Agent Member's account in a Global Note by a specified principal amount not greater than the principal amount of such Global Note, then the Trustee, as Note Registrar, shall decrease the principal amount of the Global Note by the specified amount and authenticate and deliver Notes in accordance with such instructions from the Company as provided in Section 3.4(1)(iii).
Global Note to Non-Global Note
(ii) . If the Holder of a Note (other than a Global Note) wishes at any time to transfer all or any portion of such Note to a Person who wishes to take delivery thereof in the form of a beneficial interest in the Global Note, such transfer may be effected only in accordance with the provisions of this Clause (2)(ii) and subject to the Applicable Procedures. Upon receipt by the Trustee, as Note Registrar, of such Note as provided in Section 3.5(1) and instructions from the Company directing that a beneficial interest in the Global Note in a specified principal amount not greater than the principal amount of such Note be credited to a specified Agent Member's account, then the Trustee, as Note Registrar, shall cancel such Note (and issue a new Note in respect of any untransferred portion thereof) as provided in Section 3.5(1) and increase the principal amount of the Global Note by the specified principal amount as provided in Section 3.4(1)(iii).
Non-Global Note to Global Note
(iii) . A beneficial interest in a Global Note may be exchanged for a Note that is not a Global Note only as provided in Section 3.4 or only if such exchange occurs in connection with a transfer effected in accordance with Clause 2(i) above. A Note that is not a Global Note may be exchanged for a beneficial interest in a Global Note only if such exchange occurs in connection with a transfer effected in accordance with Clause (2)(ii) above.
Exchanges between Global Note and Non-Global Note
(3) Neither the Trustee, the Paying Agent nor any of their agents shall (i) have any duty to monitor compliance with or with respect to any federal or state or other securities or tax laws or (ii) have any duty to obtain documentation on any transfers or exchanges other than as specifically required hereunder.
SECTION 3.6 .
Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Notes
If any mutilated Note is surrendered to the Trustee, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a new Note of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
If there be delivered to the Company and to the Trustee:
(1) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Note, and
 
(2) such security or indemnity as may be satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee to save each of them and any agent of either of them harmless, then, in the absence of actual notice to the Company or the Trustee that such Note has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Note, a new Note of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Note has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion, but subject to any conversion rights, may, instead of issuing a new Note, pay such Note, upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the preceding paragraph.
Upon the issuance of any new Note under this Section 3.6, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto (other than any stamp and other duties, if any, which may be imposed in connection therewith by the United States or any political subdivision thereof or therein, which shall be paid by the Company) and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith.
Every new Note issued pursuant to this Section 3.6 in lieu of any mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Note shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Note shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and such new Note shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Notes duly issued hereunder.
The provisions of this Section 3.6 are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies of any Holder with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes.
SECTION 3.7
Payment of Interest; Interest Rights Preserved.
Interest on any Note which is payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on the Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the Person in whose name that Note (or one or more Predecessor Notes) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest.
Any interest on any Note which is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly provided for, on the Interest Payment Date (herein called "Defaulted Interest") shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder, and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company, at its election in each case, as provided in Clause (1) or (2) below:
 
(1) The Company may elect to make payment of any Defaulted Interest to the Persons in whose names the Notes (or their respective Predecessor Notes) are registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed in the following manner. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each Note, the date of the proposed payment and the Special Record Date, and at the same time the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this Clause provided. The Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest shall be not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. The Trustee, in the name and at the expense of the Company, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder at such Holder's address as it appears in the Note Register, not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date. Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor having been so mailed, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names the Notes (or their respective Predecessor Notes) are registered at the close of business on such Special Record Date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the following Clause (2).
(2) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Notes may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this Clause, such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee.
Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section and Section 3.5, each Note delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Note shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Note.
Interest on any Note which is converted in accordance with Section 11.2 during a Record Date Period shall be payable in accordance with the provisions of Section 11.2.
SECTION 3.8 .
Persons Deemed Owners
Prior to due presentment of a Note for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee, any Paying Agent and any agent of the Company, the Trustee or any Paying Agent may treat the Person in whose name such Note is registered as the owner of such Note for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of, premium, if any, and (subject to Section 3.7) interest on such Note and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Note be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee, any Paying Agent nor any agent of the Company, the Trustee or any Paying Agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
 
SECTION 3.9 .
Cancellation
All Notes surrendered for payment, repurchase, registration of transfer or exchange or conversion shall, if surrendered to any Person other than the Trustee, be delivered to the Trustee. All Notes so delivered to the Trustee shall be cancelled promptly by the Trustee (or its agent). No Notes shall be authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any Notes cancelled as provided in this Section 3.9. All cancelled Notes held by the Trustee shall be disposed of as directed by a Company Order.
SECTION 3.10 .
Computation of Interest
Interest on the Notes shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.
SECTION 3.11 .
CUSIP Numbers
The Company in issuing Notes may use "CUSIP" numbers (if then generally in use) in addition to serial numbers; if so, the Trustee shall use such CUSIP numbers in addition to serial numbers in notices to repurchase as a convenience to Holders; provided that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such CUSIP numbers either as printed on the Notes or as contained in any notice to repurchase and that reliance may be placed only on the serial or other identification numbers printed on the Notes, and any such repurchase shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such CUSIP numbers.
SECTION 4.1 .
Satisfaction and Discharge of Indenture
This Indenture shall upon Company Request cease to be of further effect (except as to any surviving rights of conversion, or registration of transfer or exchange, or replacement of Notes herein expressly provided for and the Company's obligations to the Trustee pursuant to Section 6.7), and the Trustee, at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments in form and substance satisfactory to the Trustee acknowledging satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, when

SECTION 4.2 .

SECTION 5.2 .
Acceleration of Maturity; Rescission and Annulment
If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default specified in Section 5.1(6) or 5.1 (7)) occurs and is continuing, then in every such case the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Notes may, subject to the provisions of Article XII, declare the principal of all the Notes to be due and payable immediately, by a notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by the Holders), and upon any such declaration such principal and all accrued interest thereon shall become immediately due and payable. If an Event of Default specified in Section 5.1(6) or 5.1(7) occurs, the principal of, and accrued interest on, all the Notes shall, subject to the provisions of Article XII, ipso facto become immediately due and payable without any declaration or other Act of the Holders or any act on the part of the Trustee.
At any time after such declaration of acceleration has been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee as
 
hereinafter in this Article V provided, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Notes, by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may, on behalf of all Holders, rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if
(1) the Company has paid or deposited with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay:
(i) all overdue interest on all Notes,
(ii) the principal of and premium, if any, on any Notes which have become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and any interest thereon at the rate borne by the Notes,
(iii) to the extent permitted by applicable law, interest upon overdue interest at a rate of 7.00% per annum, and
(iv) all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee hereunder and the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel;
(2) all Events of Default, other than the nonpayment of the principal of and any premium and interest on, Notes which have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in Section 5.13; and
(3) such rescission and annulment would not conflict with any judgment or decree issued in appropriate judicial proceedings regarding the payment by the Trustee to the Holders of the amounts referred to in 5.2(1).
No rescission or annulment referred to above shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.
SECTION 5.3 .
Collection of Indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement by Trustee
The Company covenants that if:
(1) default is made in the payment of any interest on any Note when it becomes due and payable and such default continues for a period of 30 days, or
(2) default is made in the payment of the principal of or premium, if any, on any Note at the Maturity thereof, the Company will, upon demand of the Trustee but subject to the provisions of Article XII pay to it, for the benefit of the Holders of such Notes the whole amount then due and payable on such Notes for principal and interest and interest on any overdue principal and premium, if any, and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, on any overdue interest, at a rate of 7.00% per annum, and in addition thereto, such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the reasonable costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel.
 
If the Company fails to pay such amounts forthwith upon such demand, the Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, may institute a judicial proceeding for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, may prosecute such proceeding to judgment or final decree and may enforce the same against the Company or any other obligor upon the Notes and collect the moneys adjudged or decreed to be payable in the manner provided by law out of the property of the Company or any other obligor upon the Notes, wherever situated.
If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the Holders of Notes by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy.
SECTION 5.4 .
Trustee May File Proofs of Claim
In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial proceeding relative to the Company or any other obligor upon the Notes or the property of the Company or of such other obligor or the creditors of either, the Trustee (irrespective of whether the principal of, and any interest on, the Notes shall then be due and payable as therein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Trustee shall have made any demand on the Company for the payment of overdue principal or interest) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise, to take any and all actions authorized under the Trust Indenture Act in order to have the claims of the Holders and the Trustee allowed in any proceeding,
(1) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of principal, premium, if any, and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Notes and take such other actions, including participating as a member, voting or otherwise, of any official committee of creditors appointed in such matter, and to file such other papers or documents, in each of the foregoing cases, as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel) and of the Holders of Notes allowed in such judicial proceeding, and
(2) to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claim and to distribute the same;
and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder of Notes to make such payments to the Trustee and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders of Notes to pay to the Trustee any amount due to it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 6.7.
 
Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder of a Note any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Notes or the rights of any Holder thereof or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder of a Note in any such proceeding; provided, however, that the Trustee may, on behalf of such Holders, vote for the election of a trustee in bankruptcy or similar official and be a member of the Creditor's Committee.
SECTION 5.5 .
Trustee May Enforce Claims Without Possession of Notes
All rights of action and claims under this Indenture or the Notes may be prosecuted and enforced by the Trustee without the possession of any of the Notes or the production thereof in any proceeding relating thereto, and any such proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its own name as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment shall, after provision for the payment of the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, be for the ratable benefit of the Holders of the Notes in respect of which judgment has been recovered.
SECTION 5.6 .
Application of Money Collected
Subject to Article XII, any money collected by the Trustee pursuant to this Article V shall be applied in the following order, at the date or dates fixed by the Trustee and, in case of the distribution of such money on account of principal, premium, if any, or interest, upon presentation of the Notes and the notation thereon of the payment if only partially paid and upon surrender thereof if fully paid:
FIRST: To the payment of all amounts due the Trustee under Section 6.7;
SECOND: To the payment of the amounts then due and unpaid for principal of, premium, if any, or interest on, the Notes in respect of which or for the benefit of which such money has been collected, ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on such Notes for principal, premium, if any, and interest, respectively;
THIRD: To such other Person or Persons, if any, to the extent entitled thereto; and
FOURTH: Any remaining amounts shall be repaid to the Company.

(4) the Trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity (or if requested, receipt of indemnity) has failed to institute any such proceeding; and
(5) no direction inconsistent with such written request has been given to the Trustee during such 60 day period by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Notes, it being understood and intended that no one or more of such Holders shall have any right in any manner whatever by virtue of, or by availing of, any provision of this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any other of such Holders, or to obtain or seek to obtain priority or preference over any other of such Holders or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in the manner herein provided and for the equal and ratable benefit of all such Holders.
SECTION 5.8 .
Unconditional Right of Holders to Receive Principal, Premium and Interest and to Convert
Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, but subject to the provisions of Article XII, the Holder of any Note shall have the right, which is absolute and unconditional, to receive payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and (subject to Section 3.7) interest on such Note on the respective Stated Maturities expressed in such Note (or, in the case of repurchase, on the Repurchase Date), and to convert such Note in accordance with Article XI, and to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment and right to convert, and such rights shall not be impaired without the consent of such Holder.
SECTION 5.9 .
Restoration of Rights and Remedies
If the Trustee or any Holder of a Note has instituted any proceeding to enforce any right or remedy under this Indenture and such proceeding has been discontinued or abandoned for any reason, or has been determined adversely to the Trustee or to such Holder, then and in every such case, subject to any determination in such proceeding, the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of Notes shall be restored severally and respectively to their former positions hereunder and thereafter all rights and remedies of the Trustee and such Holders shall continue as though no such proceeding had been instituted.

The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy.
SECTION 5.11 .
Delay or Omission Not Waiver
No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Holder of any Note to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any Event of Default shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such Event of Default or any acquiescence therein. Every right and remedy given by this Article V or by law to the Trustee or to the Holders of Notes may be exercised from time to time, and as often as may be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or (subject to the limitations contained in this Indenture) by the Holders of Notes as the case may be.

If the Company shall act as its own Paying Agent, it will, on or before each due date of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any of the Notes, segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto a sum sufficient to pay the principal, premium, if any, or interest so becoming due until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein provided and the Company will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to act.
Whenever the Company shall have one or more Paying Agents, it will, no later than the opening of business on each due date of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any Notes, deposit with the Trustee a sum in funds immediately payable on the payment date sufficient to pay the principal, premium, if any, or interest so becoming due, such sum to be held for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such principal, premium, if any, or interest, and (unless such Paying Agent is the Trustee) the Company will promptly notify the Trustee of any failure so to act.
 
The Company will cause each Paying Agent other than the Trustee to execute and deliver to the Trustee an instrument in which such Paying Agent shall agree with the Trustee, subject to the provisions of this Section, that such Paying Agent will:
(1) hold all sums held by it for the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on Notes for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein provided;
(2) give the Trustee notice of any default by the Company (or any other obligor upon the Notes) in the making of any payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest; and

Any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then held by the Company, in trust for the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any Note and remaining unclaimed for two years after such principal, premium, if any, or interest has become due and payable shall be paid to the Company on Company Request, or (if then held by the Company) shall be discharged from such trust; and the Holder of such Note shall thereafter, as an unsecured general creditor, look only to the Company for payment thereof, and all liability of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust money, and all liability of the Company as trustee thereof, shall thereupon cease.
SECTION 10.4 .

SECTION 10.7 .
Registration and Listing
The Company (i) will effect all registrations with, and obtain all approvals by, all governmental authorities that may be necessary under any United States Federal or state law (including the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and state securities and Blue Sky laws) before any shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of Notes are issued and delivered, and qualified or listed as contemplated by clause (ii) (it being understood that the Company shall not be required to register the Notes under the Securities Act), and (ii) will qualify any shares of Common Stock required to be issued and delivered upon conversion of Notes, prior to such issuance or delivery, for listing on the New York Stock Exchange or, if the Common Stock is not then listed on the New York Stock Exchange, list the Common Stock on each national securities exchange or quotation system on which outstanding Common Stock is listed or quoted at the time of such delivery.

The Company may omit in any particular instance to comply with any covenant or condition set forth in Sections 10.4 to 10.6, inclusive (other than a covenant or condition which under Article VIII cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Note affected), if before the time for such compliance the Holders shall, through the written consent of, or the adoption of a resolution at a meeting of Holders of the Outstanding Notes at which a quorum is present by, not less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Notes, either waive such compliance in such instance or generally waive compliance with such covenant or condition, but no such waiver shall extend to or affect such covenant or condition except to the extent so expressly waived, and, until such waiver shall become effective, the obligations of the Company and the duties of the Trustee or any Paying or Conversion Agent in respect of any such covenant or condition shall remain in full force and effect.
 
SECTION 11.1 .
Conversion Privilege and Conversion Rate
(1) Subject to and upon compliance with the provisions of this Article, at the option of the Holder thereof, any portion of the principal amount of any Note that is an integral multiple of $1,000 may be converted based on the Conversion Rate, determined as hereinafter provided, in effect at the time of conversion, into the right to receive a combination of cash and fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock. Such conversion right shall commence on the initial issuance date of the Notes and expire at the close of business on July 15, 2006, subject, in the case of conversion of any Global Note, to any Applicable Procedures. In case a Holder exercises his right to require the Company to repurchase the Note, such conversion right in respect of the Note, or portion thereof so called, shall expire at the close of business on the Repurchase Date, unless the Company defaults in making the payment due upon repurchase (in such case subject as aforesaid to any Applicable Procedures with respect to any Global Note).
(2) The rate at which shares of Common Stock shall be delivered upon conversion (herein called the "Conversion Rate") shall be initially 71.9466 shares of Common Stock for each U.S.$1,000 principal amount of Notes. The Conversion Rate shall be adjusted in certain instances as provided in this Article XI.
(3) Upon conversion, the Holder will receive an aggregate amount (the "Conversion Value") equal to the product of x, y and z, rounded to the nearest whole cent, where
(i) x is equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Notes being converted divided by 1,000;
(ii) y is equal to the then applicable Conversion Rate on the last day of the Determination Period; and,
(iii) z is equal to the arithmetic average, rounded to the nearest whole cent, (the "Ten Day Weighted Average Price") of the Daily Volume Weighted Average Price (adjusted, if appropriate, to take into account the occurrence during the Determination Period of any stock dividends, stock splits, stock combinations or other similar events) of the Common Stock for the ten consecutive Trading Days beginning on the second Trading Day immediately following the Conversion Date (including any date that a Conversion Date is deemed to have occurred under Section 1.12) (such Ten consecutive Trading Days, the "Determination Period").
The Conversion Value shall be paid as follows:
(a) the Company shall pay an amount in cash (the "Principal Return") equal to the lesser of (I) the Conversion Value and (II) the aggregate principal amount of the Notes being converted; and,
 
(b) if the Conversion Value exceeds the Principal Return (such excess, the "Net Share Amount"), the Company shall (A) deliver the number of shares of Common Stock determined as set forth in the following paragraph (the "Net Shares") and (B) pay Additional Cash determined as set forth in the following paragraph.
The number of Net Shares to be delivered will be the integer part of the number obtained by dividing the Net Share Amount by the Ten Day Weighted Average Price. "Additional Cash" will be a U.S. dollar amount, rounded to the nearest whole cent, equal to the difference between (I) the Net Share Amount and (II) the number of Net Shares to be delivered pursuant to the preceding sentence multiplied by the Ten Day Weighted Average Price. Holders of Notes will not receive fractional shares upon conversion of Notes. In lieu of fractional shares, Holders will receive the Additional Cash described in the second preceding sentence.
SECTION 11.2 .
Exercise of Conversion Privilege
In order to exercise the conversion privilege, the Holder of any Note to be converted shall deliver such Note, duly endorsed in blank, at any office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose pursuant to Section 10.2, accompanied by a duly signed and completed notice of conversion substantially in the form set forth in Section 2.4 stating that the Holder elects to convert such Note or, if less than the entire principal amount thereof is to be converted, the portion thereof to be converted. The conversion date will be the date on which the Note and the duly signed and completed notice of conversion are so delivered (the "Conversion Date"). Each Note surrendered for conversion (in whole or in part) during the Record Date Period shall (except in the case of any Note or portion thereof which is repurchasable on a Repurchase Date, occurring within such Record Date Period (including any Notes or portions thereof submitted for repurchase on a Repurchase Date that is a Regular Record Date or an Interest Payment Date, as the case may be)) be accompanied by payment in New York Clearing House funds or other funds acceptable to the Company of an amount equal to the interest payable on the Interest Payment Date on the principal amount of such Note (or part thereof, as the case may be) being surrendered for conversion. The interest so payable on the Interest Payment Date with respect to any Note (or portion thereof, if applicable) which is repurchasable on a Repurchase Date, occurring, during the Record Date Period (including any Notes or portions thereof submitted for repurchase on a Repurchase Date that is a Regular Record Date or Interest Payment Date, as the case may be), which Note (or portion thereof, if applicable) is surrendered for conversion during the Record Date Period (or on the last Business Day prior to the Regular Record Date or Interest Payment Date in the case of any Note (or portion thereof, as the case may be) submitted for repurchase on a Repurchase Date on such Regular Record Date or Interest Payment Date, as the case may be) shall be paid to the Holder of such Note as of such Regular Record Date in an amount equal to the interest that would have been payable on such Note if such Note had been converted as of the close of business on the Interest Payment Date. The interest so payable on the Interest Payment Date in respect of any Note (or portion thereof, as the case may be) which is not eligible for repurchase on a Repurchase Date, occurring during the Record Date Period, which Note (or portion thereof, as the case may be) is surrendered for conversion during the Record Date Period, shall be paid to the Holder of such Note as of such Regular Record Date in an amount equal to the interest that would have been payable on such
 
Note if such Note had been converted as of the close of business on the Interest Payment Date. Interest payable in respect of any Note surrendered for conversion on or after an Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the Holder of such Note as of the next preceding Regular Record Date, notwithstanding the exercise of the right of conversion. Except as provided in this paragraph and subject to the last paragraph of Section 3.7, no cash payment or adjustment shall be made upon any conversion on account of any interest accrued from the Interest Payment Date next preceding the Conversion Date, in respect of any Note (or part thereof, as the case may be) surrendered for conversion, or on account of any dividends on the Common Stock issued upon conversion. The Company's delivery to the Holder of the Principal Return, the Net Shares (if any) and the Additional Cash (if any) into which a Note is convertible will be deemed to satisfy the Company's obligation to pay the principal amount of the Note.
Notes shall be deemed to have been converted immediately prior to the close of business on the day of surrender of such Notes for conversion in accordance with the foregoing provisions, and at such time the rights of the Holders of such Notes as Holders shall cease, and the Person or Persons entitled to receive the Net Shares, if any, issuable upon conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such Net Shares at such time. As soon as practicable, the Company shall deliver to the Holder, through the Conversion Agent, (x) cash in an amount equal to the Principal Return, (y) a certificate (or credit the book-entry transfer of such shares of Common Stock) for the number of Net Shares, if any, issuable upon the conversion and (z) any Additional Cash payable to the Holder.
In the case of any Note which is converted in part only, upon such conversion the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder thereof, at the expense of the Company, a new Note or Notes of authorized denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the unconverted portion of the principal amount of such Note. A Note may be converted in part, but only if the principal amount of such Note to be converted is any integral multiple of U.S. $1,000 and the principal amount of such note to remain Outstanding after such conversion is equal to U.S. $1,000 or any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof.
SECTION 11.3 .
Fractions of Shares
No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon conversion of any Note or Notes. If more than one Note shall be surrendered for conversion at one time by the same Holder, the Principal Return and number of Net Shares, if any, which shall be delivered upon conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes (or specified portions thereof) so surrendered. Instead of any fractional share of Common Stock which would otherwise be issuable upon conversion of any Note or Notes (or specified portions thereof), the Company shall pay Additional Cash.
SECTION 11.4 .
Adjustment of Conversion Rate
The Conversion Rate shall be subject to adjustments from time to time as follows:
(1) In case the Company shall pay or make a dividend or other distribution on shares of any class of capital stock payable in shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Rate in
 
effect at the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution shall be increased by dividing such Conversion Rate by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination and the denominator shall be the sum of such number of shares and the total number of shares constituting such dividend or other distribution, such increase to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for such determination. If, after any such date fixed for determination, any dividend or distribution is not in fact paid, the Conversion Rate shall be immediately readjusted, effective as of the date the Board of Directors determines not to pay such dividend or distribution, to the Conversion Rate that would have been in effect if such determination date had not been fixed. For the purposes of this paragraph (1), the number of shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Company but shall include shares issuable in respect of scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock. The Company will not pay any dividend or make any distribution on shares of Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company.
(2) In case the Company shall issue rights, options or warrants to all holders of its Common Stock entitling them to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at a price per share less than the current market price per share (determined as provided in paragraph (8) of this Section 11.4) of the Common Stock on the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights, options or warrants (other than any rights, options or warrants that by their terms will also be issued to any Holder upon conversion of a Note into shares of Common Stock without any action required by the Company or any other Person), the Conversion Rate in effect at the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for such determination shall be increased by dividing such Conversion Rate by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination plus the number of shares of Common Stock which the aggregate of the offering price of the total number of shares of Common Stock so offered for subscription or purchase would purchase at such current market price and the denominator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination plus the number of shares of Common Stock so offered for subscription or purchase, such increase to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for such determination. If, after any such date fixed for determination, any such rights, options or warrants are not in fact issued, or are not exercised prior to the expiration thereof, the Conversion Rate shall be immediately readjusted, effective as of the date such rights, options or warrants expire, or the date the Board of Directors determines not to issue such rights, options or warrants, to the Conversion Rate that would have been in effect if the unexercised rights, options or warrants had never been granted or such determination date had not been fixed, as the case may be. For the purposes of this paragraph (2), the number of shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Company but shall include shares issuable in respect of scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock. The Company will not issue any rights, options or warrants in respect of shares of Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company.
 
(3) In case outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Rate in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision becomes effective shall be proportionately increased, and, conversely, in case outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be combined into a smaller number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Rate in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision or combination becomes effective shall be proportionately reduced, such increase or reduction, as the case may be, to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision or combination becomes effective.
(4) In case the Company shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all holders of its Common Stock evidences of its indebtedness, capital stock, cash or other assets (including securities, but excluding (i) any rights, options or warrants referred to in paragraph (2) of this Section, (ii) any dividend or distribution paid exclusively in cash, (iii) any dividend or distribution referred to in paragraph (1) of this Section and (iv) distributions upon mergers or consolidations to which Section 11.11 applies), the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted so that the same shall equal the rate determined by dividing the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the current market price per share (determined as provided in paragraph (8) of this Section 11.4) of the Common Stock on the date fixed for such determination less the then fair market value (as determined by the Board of directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and described in a Board Resolution filed with the Trustee) of the portion of the assets, shares or evidences of indebtedness so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock and the denominator shall be such current market price per share of the Common Stock, such adjustment to become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such distribution. If after any such date fixed for determination, any such distribution is not in fact made, the Conversion Rate shall be immediately readjusted, effective as of the date the Board of Directors determines not to make such distribution, to the Conversion Rate that would have been in effect if such determination date had not been fixed.
(5) In case the Company shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all holders of its Common Stock cash (excluding any cash that is distributed as part of a distribution referred to in paragraph (4) of this Section or cash distributed upon a merger or consolidation to which Section 11.11 applies) in an aggregate amount that, combined together with (I) the aggregate amount of any other cash distributions to all holders of its Common Stock made exclusively in cash within the 12 months preceding the date of payment of such distribution and in respect of which no adjustment pursuant to this paragraph (5) has been made and (II) the aggregate of any cash plus the fair market value (as determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and described in a Board Resolution) of consideration payable in respect of any tender offer by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for all or any portion of the Common Stock concluded within the 12 months preceding the date of payment of such distribution and in respect of which no adjustment pursuant to paragraph (6) of this Section 11.4 has been made (the "combined cash and tender amount") exceeds 10% of the product of the current market price per share (determined as provided in paragraph (8) of this Section 11.4) of
 
the Common Stock on the date for the determination of holders of shares of Common Stock entitled to receive such distribution times the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on such date (the "aggregate current market price"), then, and in each such case, immediately after the close of business on such date for determination, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted so that the same shall equal the rate determined by dividing the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the date fixed for determination of the stockholders entitled to receive such distribution by a fraction (i) the numerator of which shall be equal to the current market price per share (determined as provided in paragraph (8) of this Section) of the Common Stock on the date fixed for such determination less an amount equal to the quotient of (x) the excess of such combined cash and tender amount over such aggregate current market price divided by (y) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on such date for determination and (ii) the denominator of which shall be equal to the current market price per share (determined as provided in paragraph (8) of this Section 11.4) of the Common Stock on such date fixed for determination.
(6) In case a tender offer made by the Company or any Subsidiary for all or any portion of the Common Stock shall expire and such tender offer (as amended upon the expiration thereof) shall require the payment to stockholders (based on the acceptance (up to any maximum specified in the terms of the tender offer) of Purchased Shares (as defined below)) of an aggregate consideration having a fair market value (as determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and described in a Board Resolution) that combined together with (I) the aggregate of the cash plus the fair market value (as determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and described in a Board Resolution), as of the expiration of such tender offer, of consideration payable in respect of any other tender offer by the Company or any Subsidiary for all or any portion of the Common Stock expiring within the 12 months preceding the expiration of such tender offer and in respect of which no adjustment pursuant to this paragraph (6) has been made and (II) the aggregate amount of any cash distributions to all holders of the Common Stock within 12 months preceding the expiration of such tender offer and in respect of which no adjustment pursuant to paragraph (5) of this Section has been made (the "combined tender and cash amount") exceeds 10% of the product of the current market price per share of the Common Stock (determined as provided in paragraph (8) of this Section 11.4) as of the last time (the "Expiration Time") tenders could have been made pursuant to such tender offer (as it may be amended) times the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (including any tendered shares) as of the Expiration Time, then, and in each such case immediately prior to the opening of business on the day after the date of the Expiration Time, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted so that the same shall equal the rate determined by dividing the Conversion Rate immediately prior to close of business on the date of the Expiration Time by a fraction (i) the numerator of which shall be equal to (A) the product of (I) the current market price per share of the Common Stock (determined as provided in paragraph (8) of this Section 11.4) on the date of the Expiration Time multiplied by (II) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (including any tendered shares) on the Expiration Time less (B) the combined tender and cash amount, and (ii) the denominator of which shall be equal to the product of (A) the current market price per share of the Common Stock (determined as provided in paragraph (8) of this Section 11.4) as of the Expiration Time multiplied by (B) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (including any tendered shares) as of the Expiration Time
 
less the number of all shares validly tendered and not withdrawn as of the Expiration Time (the shares deemed so accepted up to any such maximum, being referred to as the "Purchased Shares").
(7) The reclassification of Common Stock into securities other than Common Stock (other than any reclassification upon a consolidation or merger to which Section 11.11 applies) shall be deemed to involve (a) a distribution of such securities other than Common Stock to all holders of Common Stock (and the effective date of such reclassification shall be deemed to be "the date fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such distribution" and "the date fixed for such determination" within the meaning of paragraph (4) of this Section), and (b) a subdivision or combination, as the case may be, of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such reclassification into the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately thereafter (and the effective date of such reclassification shall be deemed to be "the day upon which such subdivision becomes effective" or "the day upon which such combination becomes effective", as the case may be, and "the day upon which such subdivision or combination becomes effective" within the meaning of paragraph (3) of this Section 11.4).
(8) For the purpose of any computation under paragraphs (2), (4), (5) or (6) of this Section 11.4, the current market price per share of Common Stock on any date shall be calculated by the Company and be the average of the daily Closing Prices Per Share for the five consecutive Trading Days selected by the Company commencing not more than 10 Trading Days before, and ending not later than the earlier of the day in question and the day before the "ex" date with respect to the issuance or distribution requiring such computation. For purposes of this paragraph, the term "ex' date", when used with respect to any issuance or distribution, means the first date on which the Common Stock trades regular way in the applicable securities market or on the applicable securities exchange without the right to receive such issuance or distribution.
(9) No adjustment in the Conversion Rate shall be required unless such adjustment (plus any adjustments not previously made by reason of the paragraph (9)) would require an increase or decrease of at least one percent in such rate; provided, however, that any adjustments which by reason of this paragraph (9) are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. All calculations under this Article shall be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest one-hundredth of a share, as the case may be.
(10) The Company may make such increases in the Conversion Rate, for the remaining term of the Notes or any shorter term, in addition to those required by paragraphs (1), (2), (3), (4), (5) and (6) of this Section 11.4, as it considers to be advisable in order to avoid or diminish any income tax to any holders of shares of Common Stock resulting from any dividend or distribution of stock or issuance of rights or warrants to purchase or subscribe for stock. or from any event treated as such for income tax purposes. The Company shall have the power to resolve any ambiguity or correct any error in this paragraph (10) and its actions in so doing shall, absent manifest error, be final and conclusive.
 
(11) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section, no adjustment of the Conversion Rate shall be required to be made (a) upon the issuance of shares of Common Stock pursuant to any present or future plan for the reinvestment of dividends or (b) because of a tender or exchange offer of the character described in Rule 13e-4(h)(5) under the Exchange Act or any successor rule thereto.
(12) To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Company from time to time may increase the Conversion Rate by any amount for any period of time if the period is at least twenty (20) days, the increase is irrevocable during such period, and the Board of Directors shall have made a determination that such increase would be in the best interests of the Company, which determination shall be conclusive; provided, however, that no such increase shall be taken into account for purposes of determining whether the Closing Price Per Share of the Common Stock equals or exceeds 105% of the Conversion Price in connection with an event which would otherwise be a Change of Control pursuant to Section 13.4. Whenever the Conversion Rate is increased pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Company shall give notice of the increase to the Holders in the manner provided in Section 1.6 at least fifteen (15) days prior to the date the increased Conversion Rate takes effect, and such notice shall state the increased Conversion Rate and the period during which it will be in effect.
SECTION 11.5 .

Whenever the Conversion Rate is adjusted as herein provided:
(1) the Company shall compute the adjusted Conversion Rate in accordance with Section 11.4 and shall prepare a certificate signed by the Chief Financial Officer of the Company setting forth the adjusted Conversion Rate and showing in reasonable detail the facts upon which such adjustment is based, and such certificate shall promptly be filed with the Trustee and with each Conversion Agent; and
(2) upon each such adjustment, a notice stating that the Conversion Rate has been adjusted and setting forth the adjusted Conversion Rate shall be required, and as soon as practicable after it is required, such notice shall be provided by the Company to all Holders in accordance with Section 1.6.

SECTION 11.7 .
Company to Reserve Common Stock
The Company shall at all times reserve and keep available, free from preemptive rights, out of its authorized but unissued Common Stock, for the purpose of effecting the conversion of Notes, the full number of shares of Common Stock then issuable upon the conversion of all Outstanding Notes.

Except as provided in the next sentence, the Company will pay any and all taxes (other than taxes on income) and duties that may be payable in respect of the issue or delivery of Principal Return, Net Shares, if any, and Additional Cash, if any, on conversion of Notes pursuant hereto. The Company shall not, however, be required to pay any tax or duty which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issue and delivery of Principal Return, Net Shares, if any, and Additional Cash, if any, in a name other than that of the Holder of the Note or Notes to be converted, and no such issue or delivery shall be made unless and until the Person requesting such issue has paid to the Company the amount of any such tax or duty, or has established to the satisfaction of the Company that such tax or duty has been paid.
SECTION 11.9 .

SECTION 11.10 .

SECTION 11.11 .
Provision in Case of Consolidation, Merger or Sale of Assets
In case of any consolidation or merger of the Company with or into any other Person, any merger of another Person with or into the Company (other than a merger which does not result in any reclassification, conversion, exchange or cancellation of outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company) or in case of any sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, the Person formed by such consolidation or resulting from such merger or which acquires such assets, as the case may be, shall execute and deliver to the Trustee a supplemental indenture providing that the Holder of each Note then Outstanding shall have the right thereafter, during the period such Note shall be convertible as specified in Section 11.1, to convert such Note only into the value of the kind and amount of securities, cash and other property (the "Reference Property") receivable upon such consolidation, merger, conveyance, sale, transfer or lease by a holder of a number of shares of Common Stock equal to a fraction whose denominator is one thousand (1,000) and whose numerator is the product of the principal amount of such Note and the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to such consolidation, merger, conveyance, sale, transfer or lease; provided, however, that after the effective time of such consolidation, merger, conveyance, sale, transfer or lease, the Principal Return (calculated as set forth below for purposes of this Section 11.11) payable hereunder upon conversion of a Note shall continue to be payable in cash. For purposes of this Section 11.11, the Principal Return and any Net Share Amount shall be calculated based on a Conversion Value which has been calculated by substituting the fair value of the Reference Property payable with respect to
 
one share of Common Stock in connection with such consolidation, merger, conveyance, sale, transfer or lease as of the date of such event (adjusted, if appropriate, to take into account the occurrence during the period between the date of such consolidation, merger, conveyance, sale, transfer or lease and the applicable Conversion Date of any stock dividends, stock splits, stock combinations or other similar events, the "Reference Property Value") for the Ten Day Weighted Average Price and otherwise in accordance with Section 11.1. The Company's obligation to deliver the Net Shares, if any, in respect of the Net Share Amount in connection with such conversion, shall be satisfied by payment in the form of the Reference Property and based on the Reference Property Value.
The right of the Holder of a Note to receive the foregoing consideration upon conversion of a Note following such consolidation, merger, conveyance, sale, transfer or lease, assumes such holder of Common Stock of the Company (i) is not (A) a Person with which the Company consolidated or merged with or into or which merged into or with the Company or to which such conveyance, sale, transfer or lease was made, as the case may be (a "Constituent Person"), or (B) an Affiliate of a Constituent Person, and (ii) failed to exercise his rights of election, if any, as to the kind or amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such consolidation, merger, conveyance, sale, transfer or lease (provided that if the kind or amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such consolidation, merger, conveyance, sale, transfer, or lease is not the same for each share of Common Stock of the Company held immediately prior to such consolidation, merger, conveyance, sale, transfer or lease by others than a Constituent Person or an Affiliate thereof and in respect of which such rights of election shall not have been exercised ("Non-electing Share"), then for the purpose of this Section 11.11 the kind and amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such consolidation, merger, conveyance, sale, transfer or lease by the holders of each Non-electing Share shall be deemed to be the kind and amount so receivable per share by a plurality of the Non-electing Shares).
Such supplemental indenture shall provide for adjustments which, for events subsequent to the effective date of such supplemental indenture, shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Article. The above provisions of this Section 11.11 shall similarly apply to successive consolidations, mergers, conveyances, sales, transfers or leases. Notice of the execution of such a supplemental indenture shall be given by the Company to the Holder of each Note as provided in Section 1.6 promptly upon such execution.
Neither the Trustee nor any Conversion Agent shall be under any responsibility to determine the correctness of any provisions contained in any such supplemental indenture relating either to the kind or amount of shares of stock or other securities or property or cash receivable by Holders of Notes upon the conversion of their Notes after any such consolidation, merger, conveyance, transfer, sale or lease or to any such adjustment, but may accept as conclusive evidence of the correctness of any such provisions, and shall be protected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel with respect thereto, which the Company shall cause to be furnished to the Trustee upon request.
 
SECTION 11.12 .
Responsibility of Trustee for Conversion Provisions
The Trustee, subject to the provisions of Section 6.1, and any Conversion Agent shall not at any time be under any duty or responsibility to any Holder of Notes to determine whether any facts exist which may require any adjustment of the Conversion Rate, or with respect to the nature or extent of any such adjustment when made, or with respect to the method employed, or herein or in any supplemental indenture provided to be employed, in making the same, or whether a supplemental indenture need be entered into. Neither the Trustee, subject to the provisions of Section 6.1, nor any Conversion Agent shall be accountable with respect to the validity or value (or the kind or amount) of any Common Stock, or of any other securities or property or cash, which may at any time be issued or delivered upon the conversion of any Note; and it or they do not make any representation with respect thereto. Neither the Trustee, subject to the provisions of Section 6.1, nor any Conversion Agent shall be responsible for any failure of the Company to make or calculate any cash payment or to issue, transfer or deliver any shares of Common Stock or share certificates or other securities or property or cash upon the surrender of any Note for the purpose of conversion; and the Trustee, subject to the provisions of Section 6.1, and any Conversion Agent shall not be responsible for any failure of the Company to comply with any of the covenants of the Company contained in this Article.
SECTION 12.1 .
Notes Subordinate to Senior Indebtedness

SECTION 12.2
No Payment in Certain Circumstances, Payment Over of Proceeds Upon Dissolution, Etc.
No payment shall be made with respect to the principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on the Notes or any shares of Common Stock issued on conversion (including, but not limited to, the Repurchase Price with respect to Notes submitted for repurchase in accordance with Article XIII), except payments and distributions made by the Trustee as permitted by Section 12.9, if:
(i) a default in the payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest (including a default under any repurchase obligation) or other amounts with respect to any Senior Indebtedness occurs and is continuing (or, in the case of Senior Indebtedness for which there is a period of grace, in the event of such a default that continues beyond the period of grace, if any, specified in the instrument or lease evidencing such Senior Indebtedness) unless and until such default shall have been cured or waived or shall have ceased to exist; or
 
(ii) a default, other than a payment default, on any Designated Senior Indebtedness occurs and is continuing that then permits holders of such Designated Senior Indebtedness to accelerate its maturity and the Trustee receives a notice of the default (a "Payment Blockage Notice") from a Representative of Designated Senior Indebtedness or the Company.
If the Trustee receives any Payment Blockage Notice pursuant to clause (ii) above, no subsequent Payment Blockage Notice shall be effective for purposes of this Section unless and until (A) at least 365 days shall have elapsed since the initial effectiveness of the immediately prior Payment Blockage Notice, and (B) all scheduled payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes that have come due have been paid in full in cash. No nonpayment default that existed or was continuing on the date of delivery of any Payment Blockage Notice to the Trustee shall be, or be made, the basis for a subsequent Payment Blockage Notice.
The Company may and shall resume payments on and distributions in respect of the Notes upon the earlier of:
(1) the date upon which the default is cured or waived or ceases to exist, or
(2) in the case of a default referred to in clause (ii) above, 179 days pass after notice is received if the maturity of such Designated Senior Indebtedness has not been accelerated, unless this Article XII otherwise prohibits the payment or distribution at the time of such payment or distribution.
In the event of (a) any insolvency or bankruptcy case or proceeding, or any receivership, liquidation, reorganization or other similar case or proceeding in connection therewith, relative to the Company or to its creditors, as such, or to its assets, or (b) any liquidation, dissolution or other winding up of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary and whether or not involving insolvency or bankruptcy, or (c) any assignment for the benefit of creditors or any other marshaling of assets and liabilities of the Company, then and in any such event the holders of Senior Indebtedness shall be entitled to receive payment in full of all amounts due or to become due on or in respect of all Senior Indebtedness in cash before the Holders of the Notes are entitled to receive any payment on account of principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on the Notes or on account of the purchase or other acquisition of Notes, and to that end the holders of Senior Indebtedness shall be entitled to receive, for application to the payment thereof, any payment or distribution of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities, which may be payable or deliverable in respect of the Notes in any such case, proceeding, dissolution, liquidation or other winding up or event.
In the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section, the Trustee or the Holder of any Note shall have received any payment or distribution of assets of the Company of any kind or character, whether in cash, securities or other property, before all
 
Senior Indebtedness is paid in full, and if such fact shall, at or prior to the time of such payment or distribution, have been made known to the Trustee or, as the case may be, such Holder, then and in such event such payment or distribution shall be paid over or delivered forthwith to the trustee in bankruptcy, receiver, liquidating trustee, custodian, assignee, agent or other Person making payment or distribution of assets of the Company for application to the payment of all Senior Indebtedness remaining unpaid, to the extent necessary to pay all Senior Indebtedness in full, after giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution to or for the holders of Senior Indebtedness.
For purposes of this Article only, the words "cash, securities or other property" shall not be deemed to include shares of capital stock of the Company as reorganized or readjusted, or securities of the Company or any other corporation provided for by a plan of reorganization or readjustment, which shares of stock or securities are subordinated in right of payment to all then outstanding Senior Indebtedness to substantially the same extent as, or to a greater extent than, the Notes are so subordinated as provided in this Article. The consolidation of the Company with, or the merger of the Company into, another Person or the liquidation or dissolution of the Company following the conveyance or transfer of its properties and assets substantially as an entirety to another Person upon the terms and conditions set forth in Article VII shall not be deemed a dissolution, winding up, liquidation, reorganization, assignment for the benefit of creditors or marshaling of assets and liabilities of the Company for the purposes of this Section if the Person formed by such consolidation or into which the Company is merged or which acquires by conveyance or transfer such properties and assets substantially as an entirety, as the case may be, shall, as a part of such consolidation, merger, conveyance or transfer, comply with the conditions set forth in Article VII.
In the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall make any payment to the Trustee or the Holder of any Note prohibited by the foregoing provisions of this Section, and if such fact shall, at or prior to the time of such payment, have been made known to the Trustee or, as the case may be, such Holder, then and in such event such payment shall be paid over and delivered forthwith to the Company, in the case of the Trustee, or the Trustee, in the case of such Holder.
SECTION 12.3 .
Prior Payment to Senior Indebtedness Upon Acceleration of Notes

SECTION 12.4 .
Payment Permitted If No Default
Nothing contained in this Article or elsewhere in this Indenture or in any of the Notes shall prevent (a) the Company, at any time except during the pendency of any case, proceeding, dissolution, liquidation or other winding up, assignment for the benefit of creditors or other marshaling of assets and liabilities of the Company referred to in Section 12.2, or during the circumstances referred to in the first paragraph of Section 12.2, or under the conditions described in Section 12.3, from making payments at any time of principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on the Notes, or (b) the application by the Trustee of any money deposited with it hereunder to the payment of or on account of the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on the Notes or the retention of such payment by the Holders, if, at the time of such application by the Trustee, it did not have knowledge that such payment would have been prohibited by the provisions of this Article.
SECTION 12.5 .
Subrogation to Rights of Holders of Senior Indebtedness
Subject to the payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness, the Holders of the Notes shall be subrogated to the extent of the payments or distributions made to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness pursuant to the provisions of this Article to the rights of the holders of such Senior Indebtedness to receive payments and distributions of cash, property and securities applicable to the Senior Indebtedness until the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on the Notes shall be paid in full.

SECTION 12.6 .
Provisions Solely to Define Relative Rights
The provisions of this Article are intended solely for the purpose of defining the relative rights of the Holders of the Notes on the one hand and the holders of Senior Indebtedness on the other hand.

SECTION 12.7 .
Trustee to Effectuate Subordination
Each Holder of a Note by its acceptance thereof authorizes and directs the Trustee on its behalf to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the subordination provided in this Article and appoints the Trustee its attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes.
SECTION 12.8 .
No Waiver of Subordination Provisions
No right of any present or future holder of any Senior Indebtedness to enforce subordination as herein provided shall at any time in any way be prejudiced or impaired by any act or failure to act on the part of the Company or by any act or failure to act, in good faith, by any such holder of any Senior Indebtedness, or by any non-compliance by the Company with the terms, provisions and covenants of this Indenture, regardless of any knowledge thereof any such holder may have or be otherwise charged with.
Without in any way limiting the generality of the foregoing paragraph, the holders of Senior Indebtedness may, at any time and from time to time, without the consent of or notice to the Trustee or the Holders of the Notes, without incurring responsibility to the Holders of the Notes and without impairing or releasing the subordination provided in this Article or the obligations hereunder of the Holders of the Notes to the holders of Senior Indebtedness, do any one or more of the following: (i) change the manner, place or terms of payment or extend the time of payment of, or renew or alter, Senior Indebtedness, or otherwise amend or supplement in any manner Senior Indebtedness or any instrument evidencing the same or any agreement under which Senior Indebtedness is outstanding; (ii) sell, exchange, release or otherwise deal with any property pledged, mortgaged or otherwise securing Senior Indebtedness; (iii) release any Person liable in any manner for the collection of Senior Indebtedness; and (iv) exercise or refrain from exercising any rights against the Company and any other Person.

Notwithstanding anything in this Article XII to the contrary, nothing shall prevent any payment by the Trustee to the Holders of monies deposited with it pursuant to Section 4.1, and any such payment shall not be subject to the provisions of Section 12.2 or 12.3.
Subject to the provisions of Section 6.1, the Trustee shall be entitled to rely on the delivery to it of a written notice by a Person representing himself to be a Representative or a holder of Senior Indebtedness (including, without limitation, a holder of Designated Senior Indebtedness) to establish that such notice has been given by a Representative or a holder of Senior Indebtedness (including, without limitation, a holder of Designated Senior Indebtedness). In the event that the Trustee determines in good faith that further evidence is required with respect to the right of any Person as a holder of Senior Indebtedness to participate in any payment or distribution pursuant to this Article, the Trustee may request such Person to furnish evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of the Trustee as to the amount of Senior Indebtedness held by such Person, the extent to which such Person is entitled to participate in such payment or distribution and any other facts pertinent to the rights of such Person under this Article, and if such evidence is not furnished, the Trustee may defer any payment to such Person pending judicial determination as to the right of such Person to receive such payment.
SECTION 12.10 .
Reliance on Judicial Order or Certificate of Liquidating Agent
Upon any payment or distribution of assets of the Company referred to in this Article, the Trustee, subject to the provisions of Section 6.1, and the Holders of the Notes shall be entitled to rely upon any order or decree entered by any court of competent jurisdiction in which such insolvency, bankruptcy, receivership, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution, winding up or similar case or proceeding is pending, or a certificate of the trustee in bankruptcy, receiver, liquidating trustee, custodian, assignee for the benefit of creditors, agent or other Person making such payment or distribution, delivered to the Trustee or to the Holders of Notes, for the purpose of ascertaining the Persons entitled to participate in such payment or distribution, the holders of the Senior Indebtedness and other indebtedness of the Company, the amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to this Article.
SECTION 12.11 .
Trustee Not Fiduciary for Holders of Senior Indebtedness
The Trustee shall not be deemed to owe any fiduciary duty to the holders of Senior Indebtedness and shall not be liable to any such holders if it shall in good faith mistakenly pay over or distribute to Holders of Notes or to the Company or to any other Person cash, property or securities to which any holders of Senior Indebtedness shall be entitled by virtue of this Article or otherwise.
 
SECTION 12.12 .
Reliance by Holders of Senior Indebtedness on Subordination Provisions
Each Holder by accepting a Note acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing subordination provisions are, and are intended to be, an inducement and a consideration to each holder of any Senior Indebtedness, whether such Senior Indebtedness was created or acquired before or after the issuance of the Notes, to acquire and continue to hold, or to continue to hold, such Senior Indebtedness and such holder of Senior Indebtedness shall be deemed conclusively to have relied on such subordination provisions in acquiring and continuing to hold, or in continuing to hold, such Senior Indebtedness, and no amendment or modification of the provisions contained herein shall diminish the rights of such holders of Senior Indebtedness unless such holders shall have agreed in writing thereto.
SECTION 12.13 .
Rights of Trustee as Holder of Senior Indebtedness; Preservation of Trustee's Rights
The Trustee in its individual capacity shall be entitled to all the rights set forth in this Article with respect to any Senior Indebtedness which may at any time be held by it, to the same extent as any other holder of Senior Indebtedness, and nothing in this Indenture shall deprive the Trustee of any of its rights as such holder.
Nothing in this Article shall apply to claims of, or payments to, the Trustee under or pursuant to Section 6.7.
SECTION 12.14 .
Article Applicable to Paying Agents
In case at any time any Paying Agent other than the Trustee shall have been appointed by the Company and be then acting hereunder, the term "Trustee" as used in this Article shall in such case (unless the context otherwise requires) be construed as extending to and including such Paying Agent within its meaning as fully for all intents and purposes as if such Paying Agent were named in this Article in addition to or in place of the Trustee; provided, however, that Section 12.13 shall not apply to the Company or any Affiliate of the Company if it or such Affiliate acts as Paying Agent.
SECTION 12.15 .
Certain Conversions and Repurchases Deemed Payment
For the purposes of this Article only, (i) the issuance and delivery of junior notes upon conversion of Notes in accordance with Article XI or upon the repurchase of Notes in accordance with Article XIII shall not be deemed to constitute a payment or distribution on account of the principal of or premium or interest on Notes or on account of the purchase or other acquisition of Notes, and (ii) the payment, issuance or delivery of cash (except in satisfaction of fractional shares pursuant to Section 11.3), property or securities (other than junior securities) upon conversion of a Note shall be deemed to constitute payment on account of the principal of such Note. For the purposes of this Section, the term "junior securities" means (a) shares of any stock of any class of the Company and securities into which the Notes are convertible pursuant to Article XI and (b) securities of the Company which are subordinated in right of payment to all Senior Indebtedness which may be outstanding at the time of issuance or
 
delivery of such securities to substantially the same extent as, or to a greater extent than, the Notes are so subordinated as provided in this Article. Nothing contained in this Article or elsewhere in this Indenture or in the Notes is intended to or shall impair, as among the Company, its creditors other than holders of Senior Indebtedness and the Holders of the Notes, the right, which is absolute and unconditional, of the Holder of any Note to convert such Note in accordance with Article XI (subject to the limitations under this of the ability of the Company to pay the Principal Return) or to exchange such Note for Common Stock in accordance with Article XIII if the Company elects to satisfy the obligations under Article XIII by the delivery of Common Stock.
Article XII
SECTION 13.1 .
Right to Require Repurchase
In the event that a Change in Control (as hereinafter defined) shall occur, then each Holder shall have the right, at the Holder's option, but subject to the provisions of Section 13.2, to require the Company to repurchase, and upon the exercise of such right the Company shall repurchase, all of such Holder's Notes, or any portion of the principal amount thereof that is equal to U.S. $1,000 or any integral multiple of U.S. $1,000 in excess thereof (provided that no single Note may be repurchased in part unless the portion of the principal amount of such Note to be Outstanding after such repurchase is equal to U.S. $1,000 or integral multiples of U.S. $1,000 in excess thereof), on the date (the "Repurchase Date") that is 45 days after the date of the Company Notice (as defined in Section 13.3) at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased plus interest accrued to the Repurchase Date (the "Repurchase Price"); provided, however, that installments of interest on Notes whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to the Repurchase Date shall be payable to the Holders of such Notes, or one or more Predecessor Notes, registered as such on the relevant Record Date according to their terms and the provisions of Section 3.7. Such right to require the repurchase of the Notes shall not continue after a discharge of the Company from its obligations with respect to the Notes in accordance with Article IV, unless a Change in Control shall have occurred prior to such discharge. At the option of the Company, the Repurchase Price may be paid in cash or, subject to the fulfillment by the Company of the conditions set forth Section 13.2, by delivery of shares of Common Stock having a fair market value equal to the Repurchase Price. Whenever in this Indenture (including Sections 2.2, 3.1, 5.1(1) and 5.8) there is a reference, in any context, to the principal of any Note as of any time, such reference shall be deemed to include reference to the Repurchase Price payable in respect of such Note to the extent that such Repurchase Price is, was or would be so payable at such time, and express mention of the Repurchase Price in any provision of this Indenture shall not be construed as excluding the Repurchase Price in those provisions of this Indenture when such express mention is not made; provided, however, that for the purposes of Article XII such reference shall be deemed to include reference to the Repurchase Price only to the extent the Repurchase Price is payable in cash.
 
SECTION 13.2 .
Conditions to the Company's Election to Pay the Repurchase Price in Common Stock
The Company may elect to pay the Repurchase Price by delivery of shares of Common Stock pursuant to Section 13.1 if and only if the following conditions shall have been satisfied:
(1) The shares of Common Stock deliverable in payment of the Repurchase Price shall have a fair market value as of the Repurchase Date of not less than the Repurchase Price. For purposes of Section 13.1 and this Section 13.2, the fair market value of shares of Common Stock shall be determined by the Company and shall be equal to 95% of the average of the Closing Prices Per Share of the Common Stock for the five consecutive Trading Days immediately preceding and including the third Trading Day prior to the Repurchase Date;
(2) The Repurchase Price shall be paid only in cash in the event any shares of Common Stock to be issued upon repurchase of Notes hereunder (i) require registration under any federal securities law before such shares may be freely transferrable without being subject to any transfer restrictions under the Securities Act upon repurchase and if such registration is not completed or does not become effective prior to the Repurchase Date, and/or (ii) require registration with or approval of any governmental authority under any state law or any other federal law before such shares may be validly issued or delivered upon repurchase and if such registration is not completed or does not become effective or such approval is not obtained prior to the Repurchase Date;
(3) Payment of the Repurchase Price may not be made in Common Stock unless such stock is, or shall have been, approved for listing on the New York Stock Exchange or listed on a national securities exchange or quoted on the Nasdaq National Market, in each case, prior to the Repurchase Date; and
(4) All shares of Common Stock which may be issued upon repurchase of Notes will be issued out of the Company's authorized but unissued Common Stock and, will upon issue, be duly and validly issued and fully paid and non-assessable and free of any preemptive or similar rights.
If all of the conditions set forth in this Section 13.2 are not satisfied in accordance with the terms thereof, the Repurchase Price shall be paid by the Company only in cash.
SECTION 13.3 .
Notices; Method of Exercising Repurchase Right, Etc
(1) On or before the 30th day after the occurrence of a Change in Control, the Company or, at the request and expense of the Company on or before the 30th day after such occurrence, the Trustee, shall give to all Holders of Notes, in the manner provided in Section 1.6, notice (the "Company Notice") of the occurrence of the Change of Control and of the repurchase right set forth herein arising as a result thereof. The Company shall also deliver (i) a copy of such notice of a repurchase right to the Trustee and (ii) make a public announcement thereof by release made to Reuters Economic Services and Bloomberg Business News.
 
Each notice of a repurchase right shall state:
(i) the Repurchase Date,
(ii) the date by which the repurchase right must be exercised,
(iii) the Repurchase Price, and whether the Repurchase Price shall be paid by the Company in cash or by delivery of shares of Common Stock,
(iv) a description of the procedure which a Holder must follow to exercise a repurchase right, and the place or places where such Notes, are to be surrendered for payment of the Repurchase Price and accrued interest, if any,
(v) that on the Repurchase Date the Repurchase Price, and accrued interest, if any, will become due and payable upon each such Note designated by the Holder to be repurchased, and that interest thereon shall cease to accrue on and after said date,
(vi) the Conversion Rate then in effect, the date on which the right to convert the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased will terminate and the place or places where such Notes may be surrendered for conversion, and
(vii) the place or places that the Note certificate with the Election of Holder to Require Repurchase as specified in Section 2.2 shall be delivered.
No failure of the Company to give the foregoing notices or defect therein shall limit any Holder's right to exercise a repurchase right or affect the validity of the proceedings for the repurchase of Notes.
If any of the foregoing provisions or other provisions of this Article XIII are inconsistent with applicable law, such law shall govern.
(2) To exercise a repurchase right, a Holder shall deliver to the Trustee on or before the 30th day after the date of the Company Notice (i) written notice of the Holder's exercise of such right, which notice shall set forth the name of the Holder, the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased (and, if any Note is to repurchased in part, the serial number thereof, the portion of the principal amount thereof to be repurchased and the name of the Person in which the portion thereof to remain Outstanding after such repurchase is to be registered) and a statement that an election to exercise the repurchase right is being made thereby, and, in the event that the Repurchase Price shall be paid in shares of Common Stock, the name or names (with addresses) in which the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock shall be issued, and (ii) the Notes with respect to which the repurchase right is being exercised. Such written notice shall be irrevocable, except that the right of the Holder to convert the Notes with respect to which the repurchase right is being exercised shall continue until the close of business on the Repurchase Date.
 
(3) In the event a repurchase right shall be exercised in accordance with the terms hereof, the Company shall pay or cause to be paid to the Trustee the Repurchase Price in cash or shares of Common Stock, as provided above, for payment to the Holder on the Repurchase Date or, if shares of Common Stock are to be paid, as promptly after the Repurchase Date as practicable, together with accrued and unpaid interest to the Repurchase Date payable with respect to the Notes as to which the repurchase right has been exercised; provided, however, that installments of interest that mature on or prior to the Repurchase Date shall be payable in cash to the Holders of such Notes, or one or more Predecessor Notes, registered as such at the close of business on the relevant Regular Record Date.
(4) If any Note (or portion thereof) surrendered for repurchase shall not be so paid on the Repurchase Date, the principal amount of such Note (or portion thereof, as the case may be) shall, until paid, bear interest to the extent permitted by applicable law from the Repurchase Date at the rate of 7.00% per annum, and each Note shall remain convertible into the Principal Return, Net Shares, if any, and Additional Cash, if any, until the principal of such Note (or portion thereof, as the case may be) shall have been paid or duly provided for.
(5) Any Note which is to be repurchased only in part shall be surrendered to the Trustee (with, if the Company or the Trustee so requires, due endorsement by, or a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing), and the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery to the Holder of such Note without service charge, a new Note or Notes, containing identical terms and conditions, each in an authorized denomination in aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for the unrepurchased portion of the principal of the Note so surrendered.
(6) Any issuance of shares of Common Stock in respect of the Repurchase Price shall be deemed to have been effected immediately prior to the close of business on the Repurchase Date and the Person or Persons in whose name or names any certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock shall be issuable upon such repurchase shall be deemed to have become on the Repurchase Date the holder or holders of record of the shares represented thereby; provided, however, that any surrender for repurchase on a date when the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed shall constitute the Person or Persons in whose name or names the certificate or certificates for such shares are to be issued as the record holder or holders thereof for all purposes at the opening of business on the next succeeding day on which such stock transfer books are open. No payment or adjustment shall be made for dividends or distributions on any Common Stock issued upon repurchase of any Note declared prior to the Repurchase Date.
(7) No fractions of shares shall be issued upon repurchase of Notes. If more than one Note shall be repurchased from the same Holder and the Repurchase Price shall be payable in shares of Common Stock, the number of full shares which shall be issuable upon such repurchase shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes so repurchased. Instead of any fractional share of Common Stock which would otherwise be issuable on the repurchase of any Note or Notes, the Company will deliver to the applicable
 
Holder its check for the current market value of such fractional share. The current market value of a fraction of a share is determined by multiplying the current market price of a full share by the fraction, and rounding the result to the nearest cent. For purposes of this Section, the current market price of a share of Common Stock is the Closing Price Per Share of the Common Stock on the Trading Day immediately preceding the Repurchase Date.
(8) Any issuance and delivery of certificates for shares of Common Stock on repurchase of Notes shall be made without charge to the Holder of Notes being repurchased for such certificates or for any tax or duty in respect of the issuance or delivery of such certificates or the notes represented thereby; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to pay any tax or duty which may be payable in respect of (i) income of the Holder or (ii) any transfer involved in the issuance or delivery of certificates for shares of Common Stock in a name other than that of the Holder of the Notes being repurchased, and no such issuance or delivery shall be made unless and until the Person requesting such issuance or delivery has paid to the Company the amount of any such tax or duty or has established, to the satisfaction of the Company, that such tax or duty has been paid.
(9) All Notes delivered for repurchase shall be delivered to the Trustee to be cancelled at the direction of the Trustee, which shall dispose of the same as provided in Section 3.9.
SECTION 13.4 .

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On May 27, 2006, the Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Board of Directors approved the terms of the American Greetings Corporation ("American Greetings") Key Management Annual Incentive Plan (the "Annual Incentive Plan") effective for fiscal 2007. The terms of the Annual Incentive Plan are the same as the terms of the Key Management Annual Incentive Plan that were in effect for fiscal 2006. All officers, including the Chief Executive Officer and American Greetings' other five most highly compensated officers for its last completed fiscal year (the "Named Executive Officers"), and certain key employees of American Greetings are entitled to participate in the Annual Incentive Plan.
Under the terms of the Annual Incentive Plan, incentives are awarded to Named Executive Officers based on three components: (1) corporate performance (weighted at 30%), (2) business unit performance (weighted at 50%), and (3) individual performance (weighted at 20%):
 
 
 
The Annual Incentive Plan target bonus award levels, as a percentage of base salary, for executive officers of American Greetings were as follows:
 
Under the Annual Incentive Plan, a bonus equal to a multiple of the executive officer's target bonus percentage will be paid depending on the level of performance achieved with respect to the performance measures described above. For FY 2007, the maximum bonus opportunity for executive officers is 200% of their target incentive award if 125% of each of the corporate and business unit performance goals are met and the executive officer receives the highest individual performance rating. Where any of the performance levels falls below these maximum thresholds, the bonus payable will vary depending on the executive officer's performance under each performance measure. If 100% of each of the corporate and business unit performance goals are met, and the officer achieves a meets expectations performance level, 100% of the target incentive is earned. Where any of the performance levels falls below the 125% maximum thresholds, the amount payable will vary depending on the executive officer's performance under each performance measure; provided, however, if both corporate performance and the participant's business unit performance shortfall is more than 10% below goal, no incentive compensation is paid unless the executive officer's individual performance exceeds expectations, in which case notwithstanding the failure to meet corporate and business unit performance goals, one-half of the individual performance target shall be earned.
Except for incentive compensation earned by the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Operating Officer, incentive compensation earned by executive officers under the Annual Incentive Plan is paid entirely in cash. A portion of up to the target bonus award levels of the incentive compensation that may be earned by the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Operating Officer is paid in Class B common shares of American Greetings in accordance with their respective performance share award agreements, dated August 2, 2005.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereto duly authorized.

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On June 29, 2006, American Greetings issued a press release reporting its results for its first quarter ended May 26, 2006. A copy of this press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
The information in this Item 2.02 of this Current Report on Form 8-K (including the exhibit attached hereto) is being furnished under Item 2.02 and shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or otherwise subject to the liability of such section, or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
As reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended February 28, 2006 ("Fiscal 2006"), in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006, we modified our segment reporting to reflect changes in how our operations are managed, viewed and evaluated. Previously, we operated in four business segments: Social Expression Products, Retail Operations, AG Interactive and non-reportable operating segments. We now operate in the following five business segments: North American Social Expression Products, International Social Expression Products, Retail Operations, AG Interactive and non-reportable operating segments.
As was also reported in our Fiscal 2006 Annual Report on Form 10-K, our consolidated financial statements were presented to reflect our South African business unit as a discontinued operation for the periods presented.
For comparison purposes, prior year segment reporting has been reclassified to conform to the changes in segment reporting and the presentation of our South African business unit as a discontinued operation. A schedule reflecting these reclassifications for each quarter in Fiscal 2006 is being furnished with this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 99.2.
Our segment results are internally reported and evaluated at consistent exchange rates between years to eliminate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. An exchange rate adjustment is included in the reconciliation of the segment results to the consolidated results; this adjustment represents the impact on the segment results of the difference between the exchange rates used for segment reporting and evaluation and the actual exchange rates for the periods presented. The segment results presented in Exhibit 99.2 are presented at a consistent exchange rate used for Fiscal 2006. When the segment results for Fiscal 2006 are reported as the prior period results in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q to be filed during our fiscal year ending February 28, 2007 ("Fiscal 2007"), they will be presented at the consistent exchange rates used for such Fiscal 2007 filings to provide comparability between our Fiscal 2007 segment results and our Fiscal 2006 segment results.
The information in this Item 7.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K (including the exhibit attached hereto) is being furnished under Item 7.01 and shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Exchange Act, or otherwise subject to the liability of such section, or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
CLEVELAND (June 29, 2006)  American Greetings Corporation (NYSE: AM) today announced its first quarter results for the fiscal quarter ended May 26, 2006, and declared an 8 cent per share cash dividend.
First Quarter Results
For the first quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company reported net sales of $406.6 million, pre-tax income from continuing operations of $18.9 million and income from continuing operations of $16.0 million or 25 cents per share (all per-share amounts assume dilution). For the first quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company reported net sales of $439.5 million, pre-tax income from continuing operations of $43.6 million and income from continuing operations of $26.9 million or 36 cents per share.
Management Comments
Chief Executive Officer Zev Weiss said, "We started our 100
th
year with results of the first quarter that were generally in line with our internal expectations. One of the key initiatives of our 100
th
year is the enhancement of both our greeting card assortments and the merchandising of those cards. The rollout of this strategic card initiative has begun. While this initiative may put downward pressure on earnings, we are pleased with the execution of the first of many phases of that rollout."
Weiss added, "Our efforts to refinance our long-term debt were substantially completed this past quarter and they were concluded on time, within budget and with terms and conditions that will permit the simultaneous use of capital for our strategic card initiative as well as for repurchases of our own shares, as we believe both investments will grow long-term earnings per share."
Financing Activities
During the quarter, the Company completed most of its major activities related to the refinancing of its long-term debt. During the first fiscal quarter, the Company:
 
 
 
 
Share Repurchases and Dividend Declaration
During the first fiscal quarter, the Company purchased, under the share repurchase program initiated in February of 2006, 2.8 million shares of common stock for $59.4 million. Including the shares purchased under the same program at the end of the fourth fiscal quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company has repurchased approximately 4.9 million shares at an average cost of $21.06 per share for $102.1 million. As of the end of the first fiscal quarter, the Company has a balance of $97.9 million available under the current repurchase program.
The Company's Board of Directors authorized a cash dividend of 8 cents per share to be paid on July 24, 2006 to shareholders of record at the close of business on July 14, 2006.
Seasonality
Due to the seasonal nature of the Company's business, the second fiscal quarter has historically been the Company's weakest fiscal quarter. For the second quarter of fiscal years 2005 and 2006, the Company reported diluted earnings per share of 10 cents and 5 cents, respectively. Beyond the seasonality of the business, the Company anticipates expenses related to its strategic card and scan-based trading initiatives will continue to put downward pressure on operating earnings during the second fiscal quarter as well as for the remainder of fiscal 2007.

On July 7, 2006, Zev Weiss, our Chief Executive Officer, Jeffrey Weiss, our President and Chief Operating Officer, Gary Weiss, a non-executive officer of American Greetings, and Elie Weiss, who is not employed by us, each entered into a separate agreement for the purchase of membership interests in the Irving I. Stone Limited Liability Company (the "LLC"). The LLC holds 1,818,182 of our Class B Common Shares. Messrs. Zev, Jeffrey, Gary and Elie Weiss are brothers and are the sons of Morry Weiss, our Chairman. The LLC membership interests to be purchased have no voting rights. All of the voting interests in the LLC are controlled by the Irving I. Stone Oversight Trust, of which each of Messrs. Zev, Jeffrey, Gary and Elie Weiss are the sole trustees. The agreements (herein, the "Trading Plans") are designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and were entered into in connection with the settlement of the estate of Irving I. Stone, the founder of American Greetings Corporation and the grandfather of Messrs. Zev, Jeffrey, Gary and Elie Weiss. American Greetings is not a party to the Trading Plans.
Provided that if certain material conditions set forth in the Trading Plans, outside of the control of Messrs. Zev, Jeffrey, Gary and Elie Weiss, are satisfied, each of Messrs. Zev, Jeffrey, Gary and Elie Weiss shall purchase the membership interests in the LLC in accordance with their respective Trading Plans. Thereupon, each of Messrs. Zev, Jeffrey, Gary and Elie Weiss, in their individual capacities, will each own membership interests representing 24.5% of the equity in the LLC and, as a result, may each be deemed to beneficially own approximately 445,454 of the American Greetings Class B common shares that are owned by the LLC.

Item 3.02 Unregistered Sale of Equity Securities.
On May 26, 2006, American Greetings Corporation entered into an indenture (the "New Notes Indenture") with U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee, in connection with American Greetings' offer to exchange (the "Exchange Offer") new 7.00% Convertible Subordinated Notes due July 15, 2006 (the "New Notes") for all of its outstanding 7.00% Convertible Subordinated Notes due July 15, 2006 (the "Old Notes"). Pursuant to the Exchange Offer, as of May 26, 2006, approximately $159.1 million aggregate principal amount, representing approximately 91.0% of the outstanding principal amount of the Old Notes, were exchanged for New Notes.
In connection with the maturity of the New Notes, holders of all of the New Notes elected to convert their New Notes into American Greetings Class A common shares in accordance with the New Notes Indenture. As a result, on August 3, 2006, we issued 4,379,339 Class A common shares to holders of the New Notes and paid the approximately $159.1 million principal amount of the New Notes in cash. In accordance with the New Notes Indenture, the number of shares issued was calculated based on the ten day volume weighted average price ("VWAP") for our Class A common shares of $22.51. The VWAP was determined over the ten business day period ending July 31, 2006. The Class A common shares were issued in reliance upon the exemption from registration provided in Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. No commission or other remuneration was paid or given directly or indirectly for soliciting these transactions.
A description of the material terms of the conversion rights of the New Notes, including the calculation of the VWAP, is incorporated herein by reference to the information under the headings "Summary Description of the Notes" and "Conversion Rights" in the American Greetings' offering memorandum dated April 6, 2006, which was filed as Exhibit 99(a)(1)(i) to the American Greetings Schedule TO dated April 6, 2006, as amended and supplemented by Amendment No. 1 filed on April 26, 2006, Amendment No. 2 filed on May 10, 2006, Amendment No. 3 filed on May 12, 2006, Amendment No. 4 filed on May 15, 2006, Amendment No. 5 filed on May 22, 2006, and Amendment No. 6 filed on May 26, 2006.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
CLEVELAND (September 28, 2006)  American Greetings Corporation (NYSE: AM) today announced its results for the second fiscal quarter ended August 25, 2006, and declared an 8 cent per share cash dividend.
Second Quarter Results
For the second quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company reported net sales of $360.1 million, a pre-tax loss from continuing operations of $14.7 million and a loss from continuing operations of $13.2 million or 23 cents per share (all per-share amounts assume dilution). For the second quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company reported net sales of $385.0 million, pre-tax income from continuing operations of $8.9 million and income from continuing operations of $3.8 million or 6 cents per share.
Management Comments
Chief Executive Officer Zev Weiss said, "The combination of our normal seasonality as well as the planned rollout of both our strategic card and scan based trading initiatives put enough downward pressure on revenues and earnings to cause a loss from continuing operations for the quarter. Although we had anticipated a down quarter, our results were slightly below our plan by a few million dollars. However, because the second half of the fiscal year is stronger seasonally than the first half, at the mid-point of the fiscal year we still anticipate falling within our previously announced earnings per share range for the full year of $0.80 to $1.00."
In addition, Weiss stated, "We are incurring costs associated with the strategic card initiative, and we believe that the consumer is beginning to notice the changes we are making in our card products and merchandising and our objective is to turn that heightened consumer interest into revenues and earnings."
Weiss added, "During the quarter, we also completed our strategic refinancing effort. The last step of this process reduced the shares that would have been issued due to the conversion of our 7% notes by slightly more than 7 million. Over the course of the last 18 months, we have reduced our diluted share count by approximately 27%. Over the long term, we will be focusing more of our resources on growth opportunities, including our strategic card initiative, and less aggressively on share repurchases."
Financing Activities
During the quarter, with the settlement of its 7% convertible notes (both the original notes and the new notes issued in its exchange offer), the Company completed the last major step of its strategic refinancing effort. During the second fiscal quarter, the Company used $159.1 million of cash to settle the principal due under its new notes and issued shares to settle the balance of the conversion value of the new notes. As a result of completing this last major step, the Company did not have to issue approximately 7.1 million shares that it would have had to issue if all of the original convertible notes had remained outstanding and been converted.
Share Repurchases and Dividend Declaration
During the second fiscal quarter of 2007, the Company purchased, under the share repurchase program initiated in February of 2006, 2.1 million shares of common stock for $49.1 million. As of the end of the second quarter, the Company had a balance of approximately $48.8 million available under its repurchase program. During the past 18 months, over the course of two share repurchase programs, the Company has repurchased 15.2 million shares for $351.2 million at an average price of $23.14 per share.
The Company's Board of Directors authorized a cash dividend of 8 cents per share to be paid on October 23, 2006 to shareholders of record at the close of business on October 13, 2006.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
On October 24, 2006, American Greetings Corporation ("American Greetings") amended and restated its accounts receivable program, entering into an Amended and Restated Receivables Purchase Agreement, dated as of October 24, 2006 (the "Amended and Restated RPA"), among AGC Funding Corporation, a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned, consolidated subsidiary of American Greetings ("AGC Funding"), American Greetings, as Servicer, members of the various Purchaser Groups from time to time party thereto (collectively, the "Purchasers"), and PNC Bank, National Association, as Administrator and as LC Bank. The Amended and Restated RPA amends and restates the original Receivables Purchase Agreement, dated as of August 7, 2001, primarily to extend the expiration date of the term from August 1, 2007 to October 23, 2009 and to authorize letters of credit to be issued under the Amended and Restated RPA.
Under the accounts receivable program, American Greetings and certain of its subsidiaries (each an "Originator") sell accounts receivable to AGC Funding as part of a process that provides funding to AGC Funding similar to a revolving credit facility. The Amended and Restated RPA enables AGC Funding to finance its purchases of eligible accounts receivable (the "Pool") from the Originators, through the non-recourse sale of undivided interests in the Pool to the Purchasers, thereby providing American Greetings with additional sources of liquidity. The maximum amount invested by such third party Purchasers is limited to the aggregate amount of $150,000,000, subject to the terms and conditions of the Amended and Restated RPA. Funding under the Amended and Restated RPA may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes and the issuance of letters of credit. As of the date of this Current Report on Form 8-K, there were no amounts outstanding under the accounts receivable program.
AGC Funding sells the undivided interests in the Pool to the Purchasers at a discount that (other than following a default) is based on (i) commercial paper interest rates, (ii) LIBOR rates plus an applicable margin or (iii) a rate that is the higher of the prime rate as announced by the applicable Purchaser financial institution or the federal funds rate plus 0.50%. AGC Funding pays an annual commitment fee of 28 basis points on the unfunded portion of the accounts receivable facility, together with customary administrative fees on outstanding letters of credit that have been issued and on outstanding amounts funded under the facility.
The Amended and Restated RPA contains representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities customary for facilities of this type, including the obligation of American Greetings to maintain the same consolidated leverage ratio as it is required to maintain under its secured credit facility.
Certain of the institutions that are parties to the Amended and Restated RPA and their affiliates have provided, from time to time, and may continue to provide, commercial banking, financial and other services to American Greetings, including participating in American Greetings' revolving credit facility, issuing letters of credit and providing depository and account processing services, for which American Greetings has paid and will continue to pay customary fees.
The foregoing description of the Amended and Restated RPA is qualified in its entirety by reference to the copy of such document attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1.
Item 1.02 Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement
In connection with the resignation of Michael J. Merriman, Jr., described below, Mr. Merriman's employment agreement with American Greetings, dated August 16, 2005, will terminate effective upon his resignation on November 14, 2006.

CLEVELAND (October 26, 2006)  American Greetings Corporation (NYSE: AM) today announced the resignation of Chief Financial Officer, Michael J. Merriman, Jr., effective November 14, 2006. Mr. Merriman has accepted the role of Chief Executive Officer and President at Lamson & Sessions Co. (NYSE: LMS) effective November 15, 2006.

Management Comments
Chief Executive Officer Zev Weiss said, "Mike Merriman has been, and will continue to be, a trusted advisor. While I am sorry to see him move on to another company, I understand his desire to return to the role of CEO, and his experience and skill set will be a valuable addition to our board."
In addition, Weiss stated, "We have promoted Steve Smith to the role of CFO and are confident that with his demonstrated ability to manage complex financial issues and his skilled development of our shareholder base, Steve's transition from Treasurer to Chief Financial Officer will be seamless."
Weiss added, "We completed our second $200 million repurchase program in October. Over the course of the last 18 months, we have reduced our diluted share count by approximately 27%.

Over a period of slightly less than 9 months, the Company repurchased 9.0 million shares at an average repurchase price of $22.21 per share.

While there is no set expiration for
 
the program, depending on market conditions the Company anticipates the completion of the program during the first quarter of fiscal 2008. These repurchases will be made through a 10b5-1 program in open market or privately negotiated transactions in compliance with the SEC's Rule 10b-18, applicable legal requirements and other factors.

Exhibit 99.1
 
CLEVELAND (December 21, 2006)  American Greetings Corporation (NYSE: AM) today announced its third quarter results for the fiscal quarter ended November 24, 2006, and announced an 8 cent per share cash dividend.
Third Quarter Results
For the third quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company reported net sales of $512.2 million, pre-tax income from continuing operations of $67.7 million, and income from continuing operations of $46.6 million or 78 cents per share (all per-share amounts assume dilution). As a result of retailer consolidations and the effect the consolidations had on several long-term supply agreements between the Company and the affected retailers, the Company recognized a $20 million pre-tax gain in the quarter.
In the prior year's third fiscal quarter, the Company reported net sales of $552.0 million, pre-tax income from continuing operations of $23.4 million, and income from continuing operations of $8.8 million or 14 cents per share. Included in the 14 cents of earnings per share was a non-cash pre-tax goodwill impairment charge of $43.2 million (after-tax of approximately $33 million) as previously disclosed.
Management Comments
Chief Executive Officer Zev Weiss said, "I am pleased with the card investment strategy as both the investment and the results are in line with our expectations. Our strategic card initiative is gaining momentum and both retailers and consumers are delighted. Year-to-date, we are on track with our rollout of changing product displays and the inventory in those displays. We expect to continue to invest in this initiative this year and next."
Outlook
For the full fiscal year 2007, the Company continues to project earnings per share between $0.80 and $1.00. The Company has included in its estimate the completion of two small product line dispositions designed to improve the Company's return on capital as well as the completion of its $100 million share repurchase program. Depending on the timing of these dispositions, the Company may realize upside to earnings.
The Company is projecting cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures of approximately $200 million. This projection compares to the Company's earlier guidance of $100 to $130 million. This improved estimate includes anticipated cash receipts associated with the effects of contract terminations as well as lower than anticipated capital expenditures.
Financing Activities
The Company purchased 3.2 million shares of its common stock for $77.5 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2007. This included the purchase of 2.0 million shares under the $200 million share repurchase program announced in February and 1.2 million shares under the $100 million share repurchase program announced in October of this year.
The Company's Board of Directors authorized a cash dividend of 8 cents per share to be paid on January 16, 2007 to shareholders of record at the close of business on January 5, 2007.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
CLEVELAND (April 17, 2007)  American Greetings Corporation (NYSE: AM) today announced its results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended February 28, 2007, a $100 million share repurchase program, and a 25% increase to its quarterly cash dividend.
Fourth Quarter Results
For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company reported net sales of $472.8 million, pre-tax loss from continuing operations of $4.2 million, and a loss from continuing operations of $7.7 million or 14 cents per share (all per-share amounts assume dilution).
During the quarter, the Company took a series of actions to improve its long-term return on capital and to do so, incurred charges in both its continuing as well as its discontinued operations. Within the continuing operations, the Company sold its candle product lines, and as a result, recorded a pre-tax loss of $16 million or approximately 18 cents per share. In addition, during the quarter, the Company also incurred exit costs in connection with the closure of 60 of its retail stores resulting in a pre-tax loss of $6.5 million or approximately 7 cents per share.
In the prior year's fourth fiscal quarter, the Company reported net sales of $507.4 million, pre-tax income from continuing operations of $63.6 million, and income from continuing operations of $51.1 million or 70 cents per share.
Full Year Results
For the fiscal year ended February 28, 2007, the Company reported net sales of $1,744.6 million, pre-tax income from continuing operations of $69.4 million, and income from continuing operations of $43.3 million or 72 cents per share. Included in these results are a pre-tax loss on the sale of the Company's candle product lines of $16 million or approximately 16 cents per share, a pre-tax loss associated with the closure of 60 stores within the retail operations segment of $6.5 million or approximately 7 cents per share, and a pre-tax gain of $20 million or approximately 20 cents per share as a result of retailer consolidations and the effect the consolidations had on several long-term supply agreements between the Company and the affected retailers.
Management Comments and Outlook
Chief Executive Officer Zev Weiss said, "I am pleased that we continued to execute against our goal of improving the return on capital employed and generating strong cash flow. We generated cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures of $225 million, well above our initial estimates and even beyond our December guidance. For fiscal year 2008, we are projecting earnings per share between $1.35 and $1.55. I am looking forward to improved earnings as a large portion of the investments in our strategic card initiative is now behind us. In addition, we are able to continue returning capital to our shareholders by repurchasing shares and increasing the dividend."
Financing Activities
The Company purchased 3.0 million shares of its common stock for $71.3 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. During the fiscal year, the Company repurchased 11.1 million of its shares for $257.2 million and was not required to issue approximately 7.1 million shares as a result of the convertible notes exchange offer completed in the second quarter.
The Company's Board of Directors authorized a new $100 million share repurchase program as well as a 25% increase in its quarterly cash dividend from 8 cents per share to 10 cents per share. The share repurchases will be made through a 10b5-1 program in open market or privately negotiated transactions in compliance with the SEC's Rule 10b-18, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The increased dividend will be paid on May 14, 2007 to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 2, 2007.

Catherine M. Kilbane, Senior
Vice President, General Counsel and
Secretary
Date: June 22, 2007
 

Exhibit 10.1
In this Plan, except where the context otherwise indicates, the following definitions apply.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of Section 1.5(iii) and (iv) above, a "Change in Control" shall not be deemed to have occurred for purposes of this Plan (i) solely because (A) the Corporation; (B) a
 
Subsidiary; (C) any Corporationsponsored employee stock ownership plan or other employee benefit plan of the Corporation; or (D) any family member of Jacob Sapirstein (including lineal descendants, spouses of such descendants, the lineal descendants of any such spouse, the spouses of any such spouses' lineal descendants and trust (including voting trusts)) either files or becomes obligated to file a report or proxy statement under or in response to Schedule 13D, Schedule TO, Form 8-K or Schedule 14A (or any successor schedule, form or report or item therein) under the Exchange Act, disclosing beneficial ownership by it of shares, whether in excess of 20% of the Voting Power or otherwise, or because the Corporation reports that a Change in Control of the Corporation has or may have occurred or will or may occur in the future by reason of such beneficial ownership or (ii) solely because of a Change in Control of any Subsidiary.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if and to the extent that any provision of this Plan or an Award would cause a payment of deferred compensation that is subject to Section 409A(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code to be made upon the occurrence of a "Change in Control," then such payment shall not be made unless such "Change in Control" satisfies the requirements of Section 409A(2)(A)(v) of the Internal Revenue Code and applicable regulations and rulings thereunder.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Plan is intended to promote the success and enhance the value of the Corporation by linking the personal interests of Directors, officers and other key employees and consultants to those of the Corporation's shareholders and by providing flexibility to the Corporation in its ability to motivate, attract and retain the services of Directors, officers and other key employees and consultants upon whose judgment, interest and special effort the successful conduct of the Corporation's operations is largely dependent.
The Plan will be managed by the Committee. Administrative functions may include, without limitation, documenting and communicating Awards made hereunder, maintaining records concerning such Awards, and satisfying (or assisting Eligible Persons in satisfying) any applicable reporting, disclosure, tax filing or withholding, or other legal requirements concerning Awards. Each member of the Committee is entitled to, in good faith, rely or act upon any report or other information furnished to that member by any officer or other
 
employee of the Corporation or any Subsidiary, the Corporation's independent registered public accounting firm or other certified public accountants, or any executive compensation consultant or other professional retained to assist in the administration of the Plan. In addition to any other powers granted to the Committee, it will have the following management powers, subject to the express provisions of the Plan:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Any determinations or actions made or taken by the Committee pursuant to this Article will be binding and final.
Eligible Persons may be granted one or more Awards; provided, however, that Incentive Stock Options will not be granted to Directors.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
An Appreciation Right granted under clause (i) or (ii) of the preceding sentence is a Related Right. A Related Right may, in the Committee's discretion, apply to all or a portion of the Options subject to the Related Award.
 
 
 
 
 
The Committee may grant Performance Bonuses under the Plan in the form of cash or Shares to Eligible Persons that the Committee may from time to time select, in the amounts and pursuant to the terms and conditions that the Committee may determine, subject to the provisions below:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
An Award that is exercisable by the Grantee may, subject to the provisions of the Agreement under which it was granted, be exercised in whole or in part by the delivery to the Corporation of written notice of the exercise, in such form as the Committee may prescribe. The exercise, however, will not be effective until the Corporation has received the election notice and will be subject to receipt by the Corporation of payment of any applicable Option Price or other amount due in connection with such exercise, calculation by the Corporation of the applicable withholding taxes, and receipt by the Corporation of payment for any applicable withholding taxes.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The number and class of Shares subject to each outstanding Share Award, the Option Price, the base price for any Appreciation Right or other Award using such a price, the aggregate number and class of Shares for which grants of Share Awards thereafter may be made or in which Awards may be paid, and the limits provided for in Article 5 of this Plan, will be subject to such adjustment, if any, as the Committee in its sole discretion deems appropriate to reflect any corporate transaction or event, including, without limitation, dividends, Share splits, spin-offs, split-ups, recapitalizations, mergers, consolidations or reorganizations of or by the Corporation.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Unless sooner terminated by the Board or the Committee pursuant to Article 16 of this Plan, the Plan will terminate ten years after the date on which the Plan was first approved by the shareholders of the Corporation. The termination will not affect the validity of any Awards outstanding on the date of termination. Awards may be granted or awarded prior to shareholder approval of this Plan, but any Award requiring such shareholder approval will be subject to approval of the Plan by the shareholders. No Award granted subject to such shareholder approval, and any dividends payable thereon, are subject to forfeiture if such shareholder approval is not obtained.
In addition to such other rights of indemnification as they may have as directors or as members of the Committee, the members of the Committee will be indemnified by the Corporation against the reasonable expenses, including attorneys' fees, actually and reasonably incurred in connection with the defense of any action, suit or proceeding, or in connection with any appeal therein, to which they or any of them may be a party by reason of any action taken or failure to act under or in connection with the Plan or any Awards granted hereunder, and against all amounts reasonably paid by them in settlement thereof or paid by them in satisfaction of a judgment in any such action, suit or proceeding, if such members acted in good faith and in a manner which they believed to be in, and not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation.
To the extent the Committee determines that any Award granted under the Plan is subject to Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, the Agreement evidencing such Award will incorporate the terms and conditions required by Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. To the extent applicable, the Plan and Agreement will be interpreted in accordance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and Department of Treasury regulations and other interpretive guidance issued thereunder, including without limitation any such regulations or other guidance that may be issued after the Effective Date. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan, in the event that following the Effective Date the Committee determines that any Award may be subject to Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, the Committee may adopt such amendments to the Plan and/or the applicable Agreement or adopt policies and procedures or take any other action or actions, including an action or amendment with retroactive effect, that the Committee determines is necessary or appropriate to (i) exempt the Award from the application of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code or (ii) comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code.

Exhibit 99.1
CLEVELAND (September 20, 2007)  American Greetings Corporation (NYSE: AM) today announced its second quarter results for the fiscal quarter ended August 24, 2007.
For the second quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company reported total revenue of $377.4 million, pre-tax income from continuing operations of $12.9 million, and income from continuing operations of $8.7 million or 16 cents per share (all per-share amounts assume dilution). For the second quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company reported total revenue of $371.5 million, a pre-tax loss from continuing operations of $13.9 million, and a loss from continuing operations of $12.6 million or 22 cents per share.
Second Quarter Results
Chief Executive Officer Zev Weiss said, "I am pleased with the improvement in our financial performance this quarter as the team has been working hard on several initiatives. Specifically, our everyday and seasonal card performance improved nicely. The combination of the improved performance in our card business as well as careful management of our costs caused our results to be well above the prior period."
Management Comments and Outlook
Weiss affirmed the Corporation's previously announced estimate of earnings per share from continuing operations for fiscal 2008 to be between $1.35 to $1.55 per share. "While I am happy with our first half results, we have a lot of initiatives planned in the second half of the year. The team is working hard with our retail partners to accomplish our mutual goals. Given the strong start to the year, but also recognizing that the seasonality of our business causes the majority of our earnings to typically be earned during the second fiscal half, we remain comfortable with our earnings guidance for the full year," added Weiss.
Under the Company's $100 million share repurchase program, during the second quarter, the Company purchased approximately 300,000 shares of its common stock for about $7 million. The Company has reduced its diluted share count by about one-third over the past 28 months.
Financing Activities
The Company's Board of Directors authorized a cash dividend of 10 cents per share to be paid on October 15, 2007 to shareholders of record at the close of business on October 5, 2007.

American Greetings Corporation ("American Greetings") maintains a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the "SERP") under which it provides retirement benefits to all of its domestic executive officers, including each of its named executive officers. To, among other things, ensure the SERP complies with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code as added by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, effective October 31, 2007, the SERP was amended and restated to clarify and make more mechanical provisions governing when and to whom payments are to be made, including (1) mandating that payments to participants with a vested benefit must begin on the later of their attaining age 55 and separating from service (previously, participants were required to elect when payment would begin within 30 days of becoming a participant), (2) clarifying the eligible beneficiaries of a participant's plan benefit, and (3) requiring the lump sum payment of a participant's benefit if he or she dies before benefits have commenced. In addition, the SERP was amended to authorize American Greetings to make a one-time offer to each participant who is no longer employed by American Greetings but is either currently receiving payments under the SERP or has a deferred vested benefit under the SERP to receive a lump sum cash payment in 2008 in satisfaction of all future benefit payments under the SERP. Only retired officers are eligible to receive a lump sum cash payment; therefore, none of American Greetings' current executive officers are eligible to receive a payout under this offer. The amendment and restatement to the SERP also incorporated the terms of the First Amendment to the SERP that was adopted effective January 1, 2005.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99
CLEVELAND, OHIO and SEATTLE, WASHINGTON (November 28, 2007)  American Greetings Corporation (NYSE: AM) and PhotoWorks, Inc. (OTCBB: PHTW) today announced they have entered into an agreement whereby American Greetings, through a wholly owned subsidiary, will acquire PhotoWorks for approximately $26.5 million. Under the terms of the agreement, American Greetings will make a cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding common shares of PhotoWorks at a price of 59.5 cents per share. The tender offer will be followed by a merger in which the holders of the outstanding common shares of PhotoWorks not purchased in the tender offer will receive the same per share price paid in the tender offer, in cash, without interest. American Greetings is expected to launch the tender offer shortly, and the merger is expected to close in late January 2008.
The Board of Directors of PhotoWorks has unanimously recommended that shareholders of PhotoWorks accept the offer. Certain shareholders of PhotoWorks have already signed agreements by which they agreed to tender all of their shares in the tender offer. The shares held by such shareholders represent 44.5% of the total shares of PhotoWorks currently outstanding.
PhotoWorks is a leading online photo sharing and personal publishing company that allows consumers to use their digital images to create quality photo-personalized products like greeting cards, calendars, online photo albums and photo books. PhotoWorks offers consumers new, creative, and refreshing ways to connect and express themselves privately with friends and family, and publicly within communities of similar interest.
Zev Weiss, Chief Executive Officer of American Greetings said, "The acquisition of PhotoWorks positions us for a comprehensive photo strategy, bringing together both digital and physical products. We are taking advantage of the opportunity to establish a leadership position in this growing channel of the social expression industry."
Josef Mandelbaum, Chief Executive Officer of AG Interactive, one of American Greetings' segments, stated, "Our previous acquisition of Webshots provided a strong entre into the online photo sharing space, a significant number of unique visitors, and a scalable platform. Now, PhotoWorks provides a strong integrated supply chain platform to provide customers the ability to create unique, high quality physical products with their own photos. This further positions us to provide a full social expression photo solution to our consumers."
Andy Wood, President and Chief Executive Officer of PhotoWorks said, "PhotoWorks is thrilled to be a part of this important step forward for American Greetings. We are excited to build and provide a compelling online experience for consumers in cooperation with one of the world's leading greeting card and social expression companies. I am confident that combining these companies' content and relationships will result in a more appealing site with truly unique products for all of our consumers."
Weiss added, "At this time, the transaction is expected to have a minimal impact to fiscal 2008 earnings."

Exhibit 99.1
CLEVELAND (December 20, 2007)  American Greetings Corporation (NYSE: AM) today announced its third quarter results for the fiscal quarter ended November 23, 2007 and announced a 10 cent per share cash dividend.
For the third quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company reported total revenue of $485.7 million, pre-tax income from continuing operations of $44.5 million, and income from continuing operations of $29.5 million or 53 cents per share (all per-share amounts assume dilution).
Third Quarter Results
In the prior year's third fiscal quarter, the Company reported total revenue of $521.2 million, pre-tax income from continuing operations of $68.1 million, and income from continuing operations of $47.0 million or 79 cents per share. Included in the prior year's results is a $20 million pre-tax gain the Company recognized as a result of retailer consolidations and the effect the consolidations had on several long-term supply agreements between the Company and the affected retailers. The prior year's third quarter also included approximately $14 million of revenue associated with product lines that have since been divested.
Chief Executive Officer Zev Weiss said, "During the third quarter, we continued to see improved performance at retail as a result of our strategic card initiative. We continue to receive positive feedback from our retail partners regarding the improvements in cards and are pleased with the card initiative."
Management Comments and Outlook
During the third quarter, the Company also announced that it acquired Webshots and that it entered into an agreement to acquire PhotoWorks, two Internet based digital photo sharing businesses. Weiss said, "The acquisition of Webshots gives us the opportunity to expand our current product offerings of online social expressions into the adjacent area of online photo sharing, while PhotoWorks is expected to bring together both the digital and physical products that we believe consumers desire. These transactions provide the opportunity to establish a leadership position in this growing channel of the social expression industry."
Weiss affirmed the Company's previously announced estimate of earnings per share from continuing operations for fiscal 2008 to be between $1.35 to $1.55 per share. "While we believe that the earnings guidance provided in April of this year is still appropriate, considering the balance of risks and opportunities it is possible that we will perform around the higher end of the range," added Weiss.
The Company used $45.2 million of cash during the quarter to acquire Webshots.
Investing and Financing Activities
Under the Company's $100 million share repurchase program, during the third quarter, the Company purchased approximately 1.7 million shares of its Class A common stock for about
 
$41 million. The Company has reduced its diluted share count by about 35% over the past 30 months.
The Company's Board of Directors authorized a cash dividend of 10 cents per share to be paid on January 14, 2008 to shareholders of record at the close of business on January 4, 2008.
American Greetings will broadcast its conference call live on the Internet at 9:00 a.m. Eastern time today. The conference call will be accessible through the Investor Relations section of the American Greetings Web site at . A replay of the call will be available on the site.

Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure
On January 8, 2008, American Greetings issued a press release reporting that it has completed the $100 million share repurchase program that was announced April 17, 2007.

Exhibit 99.1
CLEVELAND (January 8, 2008)  American Greetings Corporation (NYSE: AM) today announced that it completed its most recent $100 million share repurchase program that was announced April 17, 2007. Under the program, the Company repurchased 4.2 million shares at an average repurchase price of $23.59 per share.
The Company also announced that its Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $100 million of Class A common shares. The share repurchases are currently expected to be made through 10b5-1 programs, open market purchases, or privately negotiated transactions as market conditions warrant, at prices the Company deems appropriate and subject to applicable legal requirements and other factors.
"We are pleased to have completed our latest $100 million share repurchase program. Including this most recently completed program, the Company has reduced its diluted share count by over 35% in less than three years," said Zev Weiss, Chief Executive Officer.
Management Comments
Weiss added, "As we discussed during our December 20, 2007 earnings conference call, we believed that the earnings guidance for this year, $1.35  $1.55 of diluted earnings per share, was appropriate and it was possible that we would perform around the higher end of the range. The preliminary sales results from the Christmas holiday are generally in line with our internal expectations. However, one of the large factors impacting this year's results will be the roll out of our card initiatives, a number of which are still expected to occur during the fourth quarter. If the roll out of these initiatives does not occur during this fiscal year as anticipated, we would then expect them to occur next fiscal year. If the roll out occurs next fiscal year, the Company is likely to report results around the high end of its earnings per share guidance for fiscal 2008."

In the prior period, the Company sold its candle product lines and recorded a pre-tax loss of $16 million or approximately 18 cents per share within continuing operations.

Management Comments and Outlook
Chief Executive Officer Zev Weiss said, "I am pleased that we were able to achieve earnings within our forecasted range and exceed our cash flow guidance. Our strong cash flow allowed us to make two acquisitions in the digital photo space, repurchase shares, and raise the dividend this past year." Weiss added, "While we are expecting a more challenging economy, in fiscal 2009 we are projecting earnings per share increasing to between $1.60 and $1.85, and cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures between $60 million and $80 million."
Financing Activities
The Company purchased 4.7 million shares of its common stock for $97.3 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. During the fiscal year, the Company repurchased a total of 6.7 million shares for a total of $149.1 million under two share repurchase programs.

Exhibit 99.1
CLEVELAND (June 25, 2008)  American Greetings Corporation (NYSE: AM) today announced its first quarter results for the fiscal quarter ended May 30, 2008.
First Quarter Results
For the first quarter of fiscal 2009, the Company reported total revenue of $428.3 million, pre-tax income from continuing operations of $19.2 million, and income from continuing operations of $13.3 million or 27 cents per share (all per-share amounts assume dilution). For the first quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company reported total revenue of $420.0 million, pre-tax income from continuing operations of $54.6 million, and income from continuing operations of $30.3 million or 54 cents per share.
Management Comments and Outlook
Chief Executive Officer Zev Weiss said, "I am pleased with our revenue performance, particularly given current economic conditions. Our point of sale performance is encouraging. One of the larger components that caused lower margins in the quarter compared to last year was the rollout of a new card line in Canada. As part of that process, we had additional activity and recognized incremental expenses. While the costs associated with the new Canadian card line are transitional in nature, we are focusing additional efforts on redesigning supply chain processes in an effort to become more efficient."
The Company reaffirmed its previously announced fiscal 2009 estimate of earnings per share from continuing operations to be between $1.60 to $1.85 per share and cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures to be between $60 million and $80 million.

Item 7.01. Regulation FD Disclosure
On June 20, 2008, American Greetings filed suit against DIC Entertainment to prevent DIC Entertainment from violating the terms of its license agreement by assigning its rights to Cookie Jar Entertainment through a merger of DIC Entertainment with a subsidiary of Cookie Jar Entertainment. American Greetings' case against DIC Entertainment has been removed to federal court from the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas. The case has been assigned to Judge Solomon Oliver, Jr. of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. American Greetings is pleased with the speed with which the courts have acted on this issue. American Greetings will continue to vigorously protect its popular Strawberry Shortcake brand and hopes to achieve an amicable resolution of this matter. To that end, American Greetings is considering a number of strategic options, including the possible reversion of intellectual property rights.

FOURTH
     (1) Each Class A Common Share shall be entitled to one vote upon all matters presented to shareholders. Any proposal to amend these Articles of Incorporation to increase the authorized number of Class A Common Shares or the authorized number of Class B Common Shares shall require for its adoption the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the then outstanding Class A Common Shares, voting as a class.
     (2) The holders of Class A Common Shares shall have no preemptive rights to purchase or have offered to them for purchase any stock of any class of the Corporation.
     (1) Each Class B Common Share shall be entitled to ten votes upon all matters presented to shareholders.

     (2) (a) Subject to and upon compliance with the provisions of this Article Fourth, the Class B Common Shares shall be convertible at the option of the holders thereof into Class A Common Shares on the basis of one Class A Common Share for each Class B Common Share so converted.

Page 2 of 7
 
Common Shares so to be purchased by the Corporation shall be made, against delivery of the Certificates therefor to the Corporation, not later than the fifth business day following receipt of such offer.
          (c) If the Class B Common Shares covered by an offer duly made and received pursuant to subparagraph (b) above are not so accepted for purchase by the Corporation, the holder thereof shall be free for a period of 30 days (such period to begin upon the earlier of: (i) receipt of a notice from the Corporation indicating that the Corporation has rejected such offer; or (ii) the lapse of the period during which the Corporation may give notice of its acceptance of such offer) to exercise the conversion privilege in respect thereof by delivering to any Transfer Agent of the Class B Common Shares (i) the certificate for the Class B Common Shares to be converted, (ii) written notice that the holder elects to convert such shares and stating the name or names (with address) in which the certificate for the Class A Common Shares is to be issued and (iii) either a copy of notice given by the Corporation to such holder rejecting such offer or an affidavit executed by such holder to the effect that such offer was duly made and that no response thereto has been received after the passage of 10 business days from the date such offer was made (or the passage of such shorter period of time as should have been reasonable in the circumstances (but in no event less than two business days) to ensure receipt by such holder or his designated representative of any simultaneous telephonic or other notice requested by such holder as contemplated by such subparagraph). Conversion shall be deemed to have been effected on the date when such delivery is made, and such date is referred to herein as the "conversion date." On the conversion date or as promptly thereafter as practicable the Corporation shall issue and deliver to the holder of the Class B Common Shares surrendered for conversion, or on his written order, a certificate for the number of full Class A Common Shares issuable upon the conversion of such Class B Common Shares.

The Corporation hereby reserves and shall at all times reserve and keep available, out of its authorized and unissued Class A Common Shares, for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the Class B Common Shares, such number of its duly authorized Class A Common Shares as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding Class B Common Shares. Class B Common Shares which are converted into Class A Common Shares as provided in this Article Fourth shall not be reissued.
     (3) (a) Class B Common Shares may be transferred, either by sale, assignment, gift, bequest, appointment or otherwise, only to the Corporation or to a Permitted Transferee of the holder of such Class B Common Shares (herein referred to as a "Class B Holder") or upon conversion into Class A Common Shares in accordance with paragraph (2) of this Division B, except that Class B Common Shares may be issued or transferred by the Corporation to any person.

     The Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, President or the Secretary shall give notice of the time, place and purposes of every meeting of the shareholders called in accordance with these Regulations, and the methods, if any, by which shareholders can be present and vote at the meeting through the use of communications equipment. Such notice shall be given either by personal delivery or by mail, overnight delivery service, or any other means of communication authorized by law, not more than sixty (60) nor less than seven (7) days before the date fixed for such meeting to each shareholder entitled to notice of or to vote at such meeting as set forth in Article I, Section 5. If such notice is mailed, it shall be directed, postage prepaid, to the shareholders at their respective addresses as they appear upon the records of the Corporation, and notice shall be deemed to have been given on the day so mailed. If sent by another means of communication authorized by law, the notice shall be sent to the address furnished by the shareholder for those transmissions and shall be deemed to have been given on the day so transmitted. Any shareholder may waive in writing notice of any meeting, either before or after the holding of such meeting, and, by attending any meeting without protesting the lack of proper notice, shall be deemed to have waived notice thereof. If any meeting is adjourned to another time or place, no notice as to such adjourned meeting need be given other than by announcement at the meeting at which such adjournment is taken. No business shall be transacted at any such adjourned meeting except as might have been lawfully transacted at the meeting at which such adjournment was taken.

If a record date shall not be fixed or the books of the Corporation shall not be closed against transfers of shares pursuant to statutory authority, the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of shareholders shall be the close of business on the day notice is given. Such record date shall continue to be the record date for all adjournments of such meeting, unless a new record date shall be fixed and notice thereof and of the date of the adjourned meeting be given to all shareholders entitled to notice in accordance with the new record date so fixed.
     Section 6. Inspectors of Election List of Shareholders

the meeting, may execute consents, waivers, and releases, and may exercise any of the person's other rights, by proxy or proxies appointed by a writing signed by the person or appointed by a verifiable communication authorized by the person.

A photographic, photostatic, facsimile transmission, or equivalent reproduction of a writing that is signed by a person described in this Article I, Section 7 and that appoints a proxy is a sufficient writing to appoint a proxy. A proxy shall be valid for no longer than eleven (11) months from the date it is made.
     Section 8. Quorum
     Unless otherwise required by law, the Articles or these Regulations, to constitute a quorum at any meeting of shareholders, there shall be present in person or by proxy or by the use of permissible communications equipment, if any, shareholders of record entitled to exercise not less than twenty-five percent (25%) of the voting power of the Corporation.

Cumulative voting in the election of Directors shall be permitted as provided by statute.

Nothing in this Article I, Section 12(C) will be deemed to affect any rights of shareholders to request inclusion of proposals in the Corporation's proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
     (D) At a special meeting of shareholders, only such business may be conducted or considered as is properly brought before the meeting. To be properly brought before a special meeting, business must be (i) specified in the notice of the meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer, the President or the Secretary (or in case of their failure to give any required notice, the other persons entitled to give notice) in accordance with Article I, Section 4 or (ii) otherwise brought before the meeting by the presiding officer or by or at the direction of a majority of the Board of Directors.
BOARD OF DIRECTORS
     Section 1. Number, Term of Office and Election
     The Board of Directors shall consist of no less than nine (9) and no more than fifteen (15) Directors as may be set by the Directors. The Board of Directors shall be divided into three (3) classes consisting of not less than three (3) Directors each.

In case of any increase in the number of Directors of any class, any additional Directors elected to such class shall hold office for a term which shall coincide with the term of such class. Each Director shall hold office until the expiration of the term of office for the Class to which such Director is elected, subject, however, to provisions of statute as to the creation of vacancies and removal. At any meeting of shareholders at which Directors are to be elected, only persons nominated as candidates pursuant to the procedures set forth in Article II, Section 7 below shall be eligible for election.
     The provisions of Article VI, Section 5. relative to amending these Regulations, notwithstanding, this Article II, Section 1. may only be amended by the affirmative vote or written consent of the shareholders of record entitled to exercise two-thirds of the voting power of the Corporation on such proposal.

     Section 2. Meetings
     Regular meetings of the Board of Directors shall be held immediately after the annual meeting of shareholders and at such other times and places within or without the state of Ohio as may be fixed by the Board of Directors, and such meetings may be held without further notice.

The act of a majority of the directors present at any meeting at which a quorum is present will be the act of the Board of Directors.
     Section 4. Participation in Meetings by Communications Equipment
     Meetings of the Board of Directors or of any committee of the Board of Directors may be held through any means of communications equipment if all persons participating can hear each other, and such participation will constitute presence in person at such meeting.

Page 6 of 11
 
at any meeting thereof and the act of a majority of the members present at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of such committee. Meetings of any such committee may be held through any communications equipment if all persons participating can hear each other and such participation shall constitute presence at such meeting. Any such committee may take action without a meeting by a writing signed by all its members. Any such committee shall prescribe its own rules for calling and holding meetings and its method of procedure, subject to any rules prescribed by the Board of Directors, and shall keep a written record of all action taken by it. A committee may create one or more subcommittees, each subcommittee to consist of one or more members of the committee, and may delegate to a subcommittee any or all of the powers and authority of the committee.
     Section 6. Vacancies
     Whenever any vacancy shall occur among the Directors (including newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the number of directors and any vacancies on the Board of Directors resulting from death, resignation, disqualification, removal pursuant to statute or other cause), the remaining Directors shall constitute the Directors of the Corporation until such vacancy is filled or until the number of Directors is changed pursuant to these Regulations.

The presiding officer of any annual meeting may, if the facts warrant, determine that a nomination was not made in accordance with this Article II, Section 7, and if he or she should so determine, he or she will so declare to the meeting, and the defective nomination will be disregarded. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Article II, Section 7, a shareholder must also comply with all applicable requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in this Article II, Section 7.

For the second quarter of fiscal 2009, the Company reported total revenue of $385.8 million, pre-tax income from continuing operations of $2.4 million, and income from continuing operations of $2.3 million or 5 cents per share (all per-share amounts assume dilution). For the second quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company reported total revenue of $377.5 million, pre-tax income from continuing operations of $12.6 million, and income from continuing operations of $8.4 million or 15 cents per share.
Management Comments and Outlook
Chief Executive Officer Zev Weiss said, "I am pleased with our revenue performance, particularly given current economic conditions. We believe the changes we have made to our products the last couple of years are showing up in our revenue growth. Increasing the quality of our product to achieve that revenue growth has come at a cost, especially in this time of inflation. We remain committed to mitigating the increasing cost structure while simultaneously continuing to delight the consumer."
The Company reaffirmed its previously announced fiscal 2009 estimate of earnings per share from continuing operations to be between $1.60 to $1.85 per share and cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures to be between $60 million and $80 million.
Weiss continued, "Due to the seasonality of our business, the majority of our earnings are typically earned in the second half of the fiscal year. During the second half, we are increasing our efforts on productivity improvement projects to help offset the margin pressure we experienced in the first half. The combination of both the challenging economic conditions and the risk inherent in a seasonal business could cause us to finish the year near the lower end of our earnings guidance."
Financing Activities
Under the Company's $100 million share repurchase program, during the second quarter, the Company purchased approximately 3.1 million shares of its common stock for $46.0 million. The Company has reduced its diluted share count by forty two percent over the past three and one half years.
The Company's Board of Directors authorized a cash dividend of 12 cents per share to be paid on October 27, 2008 to shareholders of record at the close of business on October 15, 2008.

On December 9, 2008, American Greetings Corporation issued a press release announcing the implementation of a cost reduction effort, the acceleration of its annual goodwill impairment testing to its third fiscal quarter ended November 28, 2008, and updated guidance for its fiscal year ending February 28, 2009. A copy of the December 9, 2008, press release discussing these matters is furnished with this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 99.1.
The information in this Item 2.02 of this Current Report on Form 8-K (including the exhibit attached hereto) is being furnished under Item 2.02 and shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or otherwise subject to the liability of such section, or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
CLEVELAND (December 9, 2008)  American Greetings Corporation (NYSE: AM) today announced the elimination of approximately 275 positions as part of a cost reduction effort. The positions being eliminated are located primarily at the Company's headquarters. The Company employs approximately 18,000 associates on a full-time equivalent basis with approximately 2,200 associates located at the Company's headquarters.
American Greetings also announced that as a result of the recent deterioration in the global economic environment, indicators arose during the third quarter requiring the Company to accelerate the process to review goodwill and other long-lived assets. Accounting rules require an annual impairment test of goodwill, which the Company completes during the fiscal fourth quarter. The Company has accelerated that process and therefore an estimate of any impairment charges will be included in the Company's fiscal third quarter financial results. The indicators point to a potential impairment in the Company's International Social Expression Products segment and the AG Interactive segment. The goodwill associated with these segments as of February 29, 2008 was $87 million and $150 million, respectively. An estimate of any goodwill or other asset impairments will be disclosed with the Company's third quarter earnings release on December 23, 2008.
As a result of the deterioration in the economy and the associated impact on our business, together with the anticipated severance charges and potential impairment charges, the Company does not expect to achieve its previously issued earnings guidance for fiscal year 2009. Additionally, given the rapid changes in the economy and the uncertainty of the goodwill impairment, the Company is currently unable to provide any definitive earnings guidance. The Company will provide additional information for fiscal year 2009 with the release of its third quarter earnings.
Management Comments
Chief Executive Officer Zev Weiss said, "The decision to eliminate positions has been very difficult, but is necessary to ensure we remain competitive given the current business environment. We are assisting those associates who have been impacted by these changes with severance and outplacement services."
Third Quarter Earnings Release
The Company will release its fiscal third quarter 2009 results on Tuesday, December 23, 2008 and will webcast its conference call at 9:00 a.m. ET that same day. Management will be available for questions as part of the conference call.

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On December 23, 2008, ("American Greetings" or the "Company") issued a press release reporting its results for the quarter ended November 28, 2008. A copy of this press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
The information in this Item 2.02 of this Current Report on Form 8-K (including the exhibit attached hereto) is being furnished under Item 2.02 and shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or otherwise subject to the liability of such section, or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
Item 2.06 Material Impairments.
In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142 ("SFAS 142"), "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," American Greetings is required to evaluate the carrying value of its goodwill for potential impairment on an annual basis or an interim basis if there are indicators of potential impairment.
Due to the recent deterioration in the global economic environment and resulting significant decrease in American Greetings' market capitalization, combined with significant decreases in reported market values of comparable, unrelated companies, indicators emerged within the AG Interactive segment and one reporting unit located in the United Kingdom within the International Social Expression Products segment (the "UK Reporting Unit") that led American Greetings to conclude that a SFAS 142 impairment test was required to be performed during the third quarter for goodwill in these reporting units. Within the AG Interactive segment, there were the following three primary indicators:
 
 
 
The following three primary indicators emerged within the UK Reporting Unit:
 
 
 
While these events individually may not indicate the need for impairment testing, in connection with the preparation of its financial statements for the third quarter, American Greetings concluded that considering the combination of these events, testing was required. Based on the foregoing, on December 19, 2008, American Greetings concluded that the goodwill and certain of the other intangible assets of the AG Interactive segment and the UK Reporting Unit were materially impaired and on December 23, 2008, announced that non-cash, pre-tax goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges of $242.9 million are expected. American Greetings estimates, based on its preliminary analysis, the goodwill impairment charge for its UK Reporting Unit will be $82.1 million, which represents the majority of the goodwill for this reporting unit. The goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges for its AG Interactive segment are estimated to be $160.8 million, which includes all of the goodwill for AG Interactive. The impairment charges, which do not result in current or future cash expenditures, were recorded in accordance with SFAS 142, with respect to goodwill, and SFAS No. 144 ("SFAS 144"), "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets," with respect to intangible assets, in American Greetings' third quarter financial results. The actual amount of the goodwill impairment charges will not be finalized until American Greetings has completed its impairment testing.
As a result of weak performance in certain Carlton retail stores, the Company also reviewed its long-lived assets within the Retail Operations segment. As a result of that review and reductions in future cash flow forecasts, the Company recorded a non-cash pre-tax long-lived asset impairment charge of $3.9 million. This impairment charge, which does not result in current or future cash expenditures, was recorded in accordance with SFAS 144 in American Greetings' third quarter financial results.

Exhibit 99.1
CLEVELAND (December 23, 2008)  American Greetings Corporation (NYSE: AM) today announced its third quarter results for the fiscal quarter ended November 28, 2008.
Third Quarter Results
For the third quarter of fiscal 2009, the Company reported total revenue of $454.1 million, a pre-tax loss from continuing operations of $228.7 million, and a loss from continuing operations of $193.3 million or $4.25 per share (all per-share amounts assume dilution). For the third quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company reported total revenue of $485.8 million, pre-tax income from continuing operations of $44.1 million, and income from continuing operations of $29.1 million or 52 cents per share.
On December 9, 2008, the Company announced that as a result of the recent deterioration in the global economic environment, indicators arose during the third quarter requiring the Company to accelerate the process of reviewing its goodwill and other long-lived assets for impairment. As a result of this accelerated review, the Company recorded, within the International Social Expression Products and AG Interactive segments, estimated non-cash pre-tax goodwill and other asset impairment charges of $242.9 million (after-tax of approximately $202.6 million) that reduced earnings per share by $4.46 during the quarter.
The Company also reviewed its long-lived assets within the Retail Operations segment. As a result of that review, the Company recorded a non-cash pre-tax long-lived asset impairment charge of $3.9 million (after-tax of approximately $2.7 million) that reduced earnings per share by 6 cents during the quarter.
The Company also announced on December 9, 2008, the elimination of approximately 275 positions as part of a cost reduction effort. As a result of those position eliminations, the Company recognized a pre-tax severance charge of $7.0 million (after-tax of approximately $4.7 million) that reduced earnings per share by 10 cents. Partially offsetting these charges was a reduction of variable compensation expense of $11.1 million (after-tax of approximately $7.5 million), which increased the Company's earnings per share by 17 cents.
Chief Executive Officer Zev Weiss said, "The rapidly deteriorating economy has significantly impacted our business in the third fiscal quarter. We are currently focused on taking additional steps to reduce our cost structure in order to position our business during this difficult economic period."
Outlook
As a result of the rapid changes in the economy and the uncertainty of the impact those changes will have on the business, the potential for additional retail store closures, and the finalization of the goodwill impairment tests, the Company is currently unable to provide definitive earnings guidance for the balance of this fiscal year.
Financing Activities
During the third quarter, the Company purchased approximately 300,000 shares of its common stock for $5.0 million completing the Company's $100 million share repurchase program announced in January 2008. The Company has reduced its diluted share count by approximately 45 percent over the past four years.

Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
On December 30, 2008, American Greetings Corporation ("American Greetings" or the "Company") and its subsidiary, Lakeshore Trading Company, entered into an Agreement (the "Agreement") with RPG Holdings, Inc. and Recycled Paper Greetings, Inc. ("Recycled Paper"), a subsidiary of RPG Holdings, Inc.
Recycled Paper is a Chicago-based creator and designer of humorous greeting cards. Recycled Paper's humor cards are distributed primarily through mass retail partners, drug stores and specialty retail stores. The Company currently holds $67.1 million in principal amount (or approximately 52%) of the first-lien debt of Recycled Paper.
Pursuant to the Agreement, RPG Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Debtors") filed a petition and prepackaged plan of reorganization (the "Plan") under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Pursuant to the Agreement and the Plan, the Company will acquire all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of RPG Holdings, Inc. in exchange for: (a) cash in an amount equal to $12.4 million plus up to $6.0 million of unpaid professional fees and other amounts owed by the Debtors; (b) the $67.1 million in principal amount of first lien debt held by the Company, which the Company purchased for $44.2 million; (c) $22.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the Company's 7.375% senior unsecured notes due June 1, 2016, to be issued under the Company's existing indenture dated May 24, 2006 between the Company and The Bank of Nova Scotia Trust Company of New York, as indenture trustee; and (d) $32.7 million in aggregate principal amount of the Company's 7.375% notes due June 1, 2016, which will be pari passu with, and otherwise substantially the same as, the currently outstanding 7.375% senior unsecured notes due June 1, 2016, except that they will be subordinated to the Company's secured credit facility. The consideration described in the preceding sentence will be delivered to the Debtors for distribution to the Debtors' secured creditors in accordance with the Plan.
The transactions contemplated by the Agreement and the Plan are subject to the satisfaction of certain closing conditions, such as the absence of a material adverse effect with respect to the Debtors and entry of a confirmation order with respect to the Plan. After the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Agreement, reorganized RPG Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries will be wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company and any funded indebtedness owed by the Debtors prior to consummation of the transactions will no longer remain outstanding.
In connection with the execution of the Agreement, the Company, Lakeshore Trading Company and the holders of the Debtors' first and second-lien debt entered into an Undertaking dated December 30, 2008, pursuant to which such debt holders have agreed to support and vote in favor of the Plan. Prior to the filing of the petition, all such creditors voted in favor of the Plan.
Also in connection with the execution of the Agreement, the Company has committed to provide the Debtors with debtor-in-possession financing pursuant to a Senior Secured Super-Priority Debtor-in-Possession Credit Agreement among the Debtors, Credit Suisse, Cayman Islands Branch, as administrative agent, collateral agent and arranger (the "DIP Agent"), and the Company (the "DIP Credit Agreement") and related security documents. The DIP Credit Agreement, which matures on May 31, 2009, provides for an aggregate commitment of up to $10 million and permits borrowings on a revolving basis. The DIP Credit Agreement is subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.

The Additional Senior Notes are effectively subordinated to all of American Greetings' secured indebtedness, including borrowings under its Credit Agreement (as defined below), to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. The New Notes are contractually subordinated to amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement, and are effectively subordinated to any other secured indebtedness that American Greetings may issue from time to time to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness.

Upon the occurrence of any "change of control" (as defined in the Indentures), each holder of Notes will have the right to require us to purchase all of that holder's Notes for a cash price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes to be purchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase.

The New Notes Indenture also provides that if American Greetings incurs more than an additional $10,000,000 of indebtedness (other than indebtedness under the Credit Agreement or certain other permitted indebtedness), such indebtedness must be (A) pari passu in right of payment to the New Notes and expressly subordinated in right of payment
 
to the Credit Agreement at least to the same extent as the New Notes, or (B) expressly subordinated in right of payment to the New Notes. Alternatively, American Greetings can redeem the New Notes in whole, but not in part, at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued but unpaid interest, if any, or have the subordination provisions removed from the New Notes.
The foregoing description of the Additional Senior Notes is qualified in its entirety by reference to the (i) Form of Trust Indenture between American Greetings and the Trustee previously filed by American Greetings as an exhibit to its Form 8-K filed on May 22, 2006, and (ii) Form of First Supplemental Indenture between American Greetings and the Trustee previously filed by American Greetings as an exhibit to its Form T-3 filed on December 30, 2008 (File No. 022-28883).

American Greetings is party to a credit agreement, dated April 4, 2006, as amended from time to time thereafter (the ""), among various lending institutions party thereto (the ""). In addition to a revolving credit facility, the Credit Agreement has a $100 million multiple draw term loan facility. On February 23, 2009, American Greetings drew down $100 million in principal amount under the term loan facility (the ""). The proceeds of the Term Loan will be used for general corporate purposes. Although American Greetings has no immediate needs for additional liquidity, the ability to draw down term loans expires on April 3, 2009. Accordingly, in light of current market conditions, American Greetings drew on the facility to provide it with greater financial flexibility and adequate liquidity for the long term.
Credit Agreement
Lenders
Term Loan
The Term Loan may bear interest at a rate per annum based on either the London Inter-Bank Offer Rate ("") plus 150 basis points or based on the alternate base rate plus 25 basis points. The alternate base rate ("") is the higher of National City Bank's prime rate or the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%. Currently, the Term Loan bears interest based on LIBOR. Once repaid, the Term Loan may not be reborrowed. The Term Loan amortizes in equal quarterly installments equal to .25% of the amount of such Term Loan, with the balance payable at maturity on April 4, 2013.
LIBOR
ABR
The obligations under the Credit Agreement, including the Term Loan, are guaranteed by American Greetings' material domestic subsidiaries (the "") and are secured by substantially all of the personal property of American Greetings and each of the Guarantors, including a pledge of all of the capital stock or other equity interests in substantially all of American Greetings' domestic subsidiaries and 65% of the capital stock or other equity interest in American Greetings' material first tier foreign subsidiaries. The proceeds of the borrowings under the Credit Agreement may be used (i) to refinance existing indebtedness, (ii) to make share repurchases from shareholders, (iii) to fund capital expenditures, (iv) to provide working capital, (v) to fund permitted acquisitions, and (vi) for other general corporate purposes.
Guarantors
The Credit Agreement contains certain restrictive covenants that are customary for similar credit arrangements, including covenants relating to financial reporting and notification, compliance with laws, preservation of existence, maintenance of books and records, use of proceeds, maintenance of properties and insurance, and limitations on liens, dispositions, issuance of debt, investments, payment of dividends, repurchases of capital stock, acquisitions, and transactions with affiliates. There are also financial covenants that require American Greetings to maintain a maximum leverage ratio (consolidated indebtedness minus unrestricted cash over consolidated EBITDA), and a minimum interest coverage ratio (consolidated EBITDA over consolidated interest expense). The Credit Agreement also requires American Greetings to make certain mandatory prepayments of outstanding indebtedness using the net cash proceeds received from certain dispositions, events of loss and additional indebtedness that American Greetings may incur from time to time.
 
The Credit Agreement provides for customary events of default with corresponding grace periods, including failure to pay any principal or interest when due, failure to perform or observe covenants, bankruptcy or insolvency events and change of control. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default, the global agent upon the request of the requisite number of Lenders is required to declare all amounts owing under the Credit Agreement to be immediately due and payable, terminate the Lenders' commitments to make loans under the Credit Agreement, and/or exercise any and all remedies and other rights under the Credit Agreement.
The foregoing description of the Term Loan is qualified in its entirety by reference to (1) the Credit Agreement, previously filed by American Greetings as an exhibit to its Form 8-K filed on April 6, 2006, (2) Amendments No. 1, 2 and 3 to the Credit Agreement previously filed by American Greetings as exhibits to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2007; (3) Amendment No. 4 to the Credit Agreement previously filed by American Greetings as an exhibit to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2008; and (4) Amendment No. 5 to the Credit Agreement previously filed by American Greetings as an exhibit to its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended August 29, 2008
 
American Greetings and the Morry Weiss and Judith S. Weiss 2001 Irrevocable Insurance Trust (the "") were parties to a split dollar life insurance agreement the subject of which was an insurance policy that provided total death benefits of $30 million upon the death of Mr. Morry Weiss, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of American Greetings, and his wife (whichever occurred later), the indirect beneficiaries of which were their children. Under the split dollar life insurance agreement, American Greetings paid a portion of the premium costs of the policy and had a collateral interest in the policy as security for reimbursement of an amount equal to the premiums paid by American Greetings. However, the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "") brought into question whether American Greetings could continue to pay premiums and increase the reimbursement amount with respect to the insurance policy. The Act prohibits new loans between American Greetings and certain individuals, and certain features of the continuing split dollar life insurance arrangement could be characterized as a loan prohibited by the Act. American Greetings has not made premium payments since the enactment of the Act and any additional amount paid with respect to the policy since enactment of the Act has not been subject to reimbursement by American Greetings. As a result of the potential limitations imposed by the Act on the continuation of the split dollar life insurance agreement, the split dollar life insurance agreement was terminated on February 16, 2009. In connection with its termination, the Trust paid American Greetings $1,190,913, representing the cash surrender value of the policy. In addition, to compensate Mr. Weiss for relinquishing his rights to the split dollar life insurance benefits and to otherwise release the obligations owed by American Greetings to Mr. Morry Weiss under the split dollar life insurance arrangement, on February 16, 2009, American Greetings paid Mr. Morry Weiss $2,324,155, and agreed to pay him $1,178,166.34 on April 15, 2009 and $1,178,080 on March 6, 2010. The payments are conditioned on American Greetings being in compliance with its financial covenants under the Credit Agreement. If American Greetings is not in compliance with these financial covenants on the April 2009 payment date, the amount to be paid on that date will be payable on the March 6, 2010 payment date. However, if American Greetings is not in compliance with these financial covenants on the March 6, 2010 payment date, any remaining amounts will be forfeited.

Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
On March 24, 2009, American Greetings Corporation ("American Greetings") entered into a binding term sheet (the "Term Sheet") with MoonScoop S.A.S. ("MoonScoop") providing for the sale to MoonScoop of the Strawberry Shortcake and Care Bears properties (the "Assets") owned by American Greetings and its affiliates, as well as all rights in those Assets owned by Cookie Jar Entertainment Inc. ("Cookie Jar") and its affiliates. Under the Term Sheet, MoonScoop will pay US$95.0 million (the "Purchase Price") at the closing for the Assets and will assume all contracts and related obligations attendant to the Assets. American Greetings and Cookie Jar will be entitled to receive US$76.0 million and US$19.0 million, respectively, as consideration for their rights to the Assets.
The Term Sheet provides that MoonScoop's acquisition of the Assets is subject to Cookie Jar's right, pursuant to the binding letter agreement dated July 20, 2008 between American Greetings and Cookie Jar, to match the terms of the transaction set forth in the Term Sheet and acquire the Assets. On March 30, 2009, Cookie Jar delivered a notice to American Greetings that it had elected to acquire the Assets pursuant to its matching right for aggregate consideration payable to American Greetings of US$76.0 million. Cookie Jar must close on the acquisition no later than April 30, 2009, unless American Greetings and Cookie Jar mutually agree on an extension. During the pendency of Cookie Jar's matching offer, the Term Sheet remains in effect, but MoonScoop's obligation to close the acquisition is tolled. If Cookie Jar fails to close, the acquisition of the Assets by MoonScoop is expected to close no later than June 7, 2009. If Cookie Jar acquires the Assets, MoonScoop will be entitled to a US$2.85 million break-up fee.
Both Cookie Jar and MoonScoop's obligations are subject to (i) the expiration or early termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, (ii) the acquiring party obtaining financing (including debt, equity or a combination of both) on terms that are commercially reasonable and reasonably acceptable to the acquirer and (iii) satisfaction or waiver of other customary closing conditions.
In connection with the acquisition of the Assets, both MoonScoop and Cookie Jar have agreed to grant American Greetings ten-year exclusive licensing agreements for the Assets for certain categories of social expression products that are developed, manufactured and sold in connection with American Greetings' core social expressions business.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

On April 17, 2009, American Greetings Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries (collectively, "American Greetings"), entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the "Agreement") with Schurman Fine Papers and one of its subsidiaries (collectively, "Schurman"). Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, on April 17, 2009 (the "Closing Date"), American Greetings sold all right, title and interest in the assets of its Retail Operations business segment to Schurman in exchange for approximately $6 million in cash and Schurman's assumption of certain liabilities related to the Retail Operations business segment. Under the terms of the transaction, American Greetings sold all 341 of its card and gift retail store assets to Schurman, which will operate stores under the American Greetings, Carlton Cards and Papyrus brands. Under the terms of the transaction, American Greetings anticipates remaining subject to certain of the Retail Operations store leases on a contingent basis by subleasing the stores to Schurman. For more information about American Greetings' Retail Operations business segment, please see footnote 15 "Business Segment Information" to the audited consolidated financial statements contained in American Greetings' Annual Report for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2008 and footnote 15 "Business Segment Information" to the unaudited consolidated financial statements contained in American Greetings' Quarterly Report for the quarterly period ended November 28, 2008.
On the Closing Date, pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, American Greetings also purchased from Schurman its Papyrus trademark and its wholesale business division, which supplies Papyrus brand greeting cards primarily to leading specialty, mass, grocery and drug store channels, in exchange for approximately $18 million in cash and American Greetings' assumption of certain liabilities related to Schurman's wholesale business. In addition, American Greetings agreed to provide Schurman limited credit support through the provision of a limited guarantee (the "Liquidity Guarantee") and a limited bridge guarantee (the "Bridge Guarantee") in favor of the lenders under Schurman's senior revolving credit facility (the "Senior Credit Facility"). American Greetings also purchased shares representing approximately 15% of the issued and outstanding equity interest in Schurman for approximately $2 million.
Pursuant to the terms of the Liquidity Guarantee, American Greetings has guaranteed the repayment of up to $12 million of Schurman's borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility to help ensure that Schurman has sufficient borrowing availability under this facility. The Liquidity Guarantee is required to be backed by a letter of credit for the term of the Liquidity Guarantee, which is currently anticipated to end in January 2014. Pursuant to the terms of the Bridge Guarantee, American Greetings has guaranteed the repayment of up to $12 million of Schurman's borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility until Schurman is able to include the inventory and other assets of the Retail Operations business in its borrowing base. The Bridge Guarantee is required to be backed by a letter of credit and generally will be reduced as Schurman is able to include such inventory and other assets in its borrowing base. American Greetings' obligations under the Liquidity Guarantee and the Bridge Guarantee generally will not be triggered unless Schurman's lenders under its Senior Credit Facility have substantially completed the liquidation of the collateral under Schurman's Senior Credit Facility, or 91 days after the liquidation is started, whichever is earlier, and will be limited to the deficiency, if any, between the amount owed and the amount collected in connection with the liquidation.
American Greetings and Schurman also entered into a loan agreement, dated as of the Closing Date (the "Loan Agreement"), pursuant to which American Greetings is providing Schurman with up to $10 million of subordinated financing (the "Subordinated Credit Facility") for an initial term of 19 months, subject to up to three automatic one-year renewal periods (or partial-year, in the case of the last renewal), unless either party provides the appropriate written notice prior to the expiration of the applicable term. Schurman can only borrow under the facility if it does not have other sources of financing available, and borrowings under the Loan Agreement may only be used for specified purposes. In addition, availability under the Subordinated Credit Facility will be limited as long as the Bridge Guarantee is in place to the difference between $10 million and the current maximum amount of the Bridge Guarantee. Borrowings under the Subordinated Credit Facility will be subordinate to borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility and will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the greater of (i) the base rate provided under American Greetings' revolving credit facility and (ii) the adjusted Eurodollar rate provided under American Greetings' revolving credit facility plus 1.0%, plus, in either case, 6.5%. The Loan Agreement provides affirmative and negative covenants and events of default customary for such financings.
In connection with the Agreement, American Greetings and Schurman have also entered into several other ancillary agreements, including an inventory supply agreement, a marketing services agreement, a transition services agreement and a trademark licensing agreement.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1
CLEVELAND (April 28, 2009)  American Greetings Corporation (NYSE: AM) today announced its fourth quarter results for the fiscal quarter ended February 28, 2009.
Fourth Quarter Results
For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, the Company reported total revenue of $422.5 million, a pre-tax loss from continuing operations of $67.9 million, and a loss from continuing operations of $50.1 million or $1.13 per share (all per-share amounts assume dilution). For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company reported total revenue of $493.2 million, pre-tax income from continuing operations of $12.7 million, and income from continuing operations of $15.6 million or 31 cents per share.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, the Company recognized non-cash pre-tax goodwill impairment charges of $47.3 million (after-tax of approximately $42.6 million) that reduced earnings per share by 97 cents during the quarter.
In addition, the Company recognized expenses in its licensing business primarily due to changes in market conditions that caused a change in ultimate revenues related to animated video productions of $16.4 million (after-tax of approximately $10.0 million) that reduced earnings per share by 23 cents during the quarter.
The Company recorded a non-cash pre-tax long-lived asset impairment charge within the Retail Operations segment of $1.5 million (after-tax of approximately $0.9 million) that reduced earnings per share by 2 cents during the quarter.
The Company also announced on December 9, 2008, the elimination of approximately 275 positions as part of a cost reduction effort. As a result of those and other position eliminations during the quarter, the Company recognized a pre-tax severance charge of $7.5 million (after-tax of approximately $4.6 million) that reduced earnings per share by 10 cents.
Management Comments and Outlook
Chief Executive Officer Zev Weiss said, "This fiscal year we faced a challenging retail environment as a result of the steep economic downturn. We will continue to be even more vigilant in managing our supply chain and becoming more cost efficient. Our focus on efficiency, we believe, will help us drive a substantial improvement in cash flow next year and we are projecting cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures to be at least $70 million. We are also excited about the recent acquisitions of Recycled Paper Greetings and the Papyrus brand, and satisfied that the sale of our Carlton Retail stores best positions our Company and those stores for success."
Financing Activities
Under the Company's $75 million share repurchase program, during the fourth quarter the Company purchased approximately 4.9 million shares of its common stock for $24.2 million.
Conference Call on the Web

Exhibit 99.1
CLEVELAND (June 24, 2009)  American Greetings Corporation (NYSE: AM) today announced its results for the first fiscal quarter ended May 29, 2009.
First Quarter Results
For the first quarter of fiscal 2010, the Company reported total revenue of $412.9 million, pre-tax income of $16.9 million, and net income of $10.0 million or 25 cents per share (all per-share amounts assume dilution).
As previously announced, during the first quarter of fiscal 2010, American Greetings sold its retail store operations to Schurman Fine Papers ("Schurman"), which operates card and gift retail stores under the name Papyrus. American Greetings recognized a preliminary non-cash loss on the disposition, recorded within the Retail Operations segment, of $28.3 million (after-tax of approximately $17.4 million) that reduced earnings per share by approximately 44 cents during the quarter. At the time of the sale of the retail stores, American Greetings also purchased the wholesale division of Schurman which supplies Papyrus brand greeting cards primarily to leading specialty, mass, grocery and drug store channels and purchased a fifteen percent equity interest in Schurman.
For the first quarter of fiscal 2009, the Company reported total revenue of $428.3 million, pre-tax income of $19.2 million, and net income of $13.3 million or 27 cents per share.
Management Comments and Outlook
Chief Executive Officer Zev Weiss said, "I am very pleased with our performance this quarter. Specifically, sales of greeting cards increased primarily as a result of the additions of Recycled Paper Greetings and Papyrus as well as strength in our overall North American business despite weak economic conditions. We also realized improved margins as a result of our cost reduction activities last year and we will continue to focus on efficiencies this year. We currently anticipate cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures to be greater than $70 million this fiscal year. We are diligently working through the integration planning processes for Recycled Paper Greetings, the acquired Papyrus wholesale business, and the transition of our former retail operations to Schurman Fine Papers."
Financing Activities
Under the Company's $75 million share repurchase program, during the first fiscal quarter the Company purchased approximately 1.1 million shares of its common stock for $4.3 million.
Conference Call on the Web
American Greetings will broadcast its conference call live on the Internet at 9:00 a.m. Eastern time today. The conference call will be accessible through the Investor Relations section of the American Greetings Web site at . A replay of the call will be available on the site.

The description of the Plan, as amended, as contained herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Plan, as amended, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
Date: June 26, 2009

Exhibit 10.1
 
 
In this Plan, except where the context otherwise indicates, the following definitions apply.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of Section 1.5(iii) and (iv) above, a "Change in Control" shall not be deemed to have occurred for purposes of this Plan (i) solely because (A) the Corporation; (B) a Subsidiary; (C) any Corporationsponsored employee stock ownership plan or other employee benefit plan of the Corporation; or (D) any family member of Jacob Sapirstein (including lineal descendants, spouses of such descendants, the lineal descendants of any such spouse, the spouses of any such spouses' lineal descendants and trust (including voting trusts)) either files or becomes obligated to file a report or proxy statement under or in response to Schedule 13D, Schedule TO, Form 8-K or Schedule 14A (or any successor schedule, form or report or item therein) under the Exchange Act, disclosing beneficial ownership by it of shares, whether in excess of 20% of the Voting Power or otherwise, or because the Corporation reports that a Change in Control of the Corporation has or may have occurred or will or may occur in the future by reason of such beneficial ownership or (ii) solely because of a Change in Control of any Subsidiary.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if and to the extent that any provision of this Plan or an Award would cause a payment of deferred compensation that is subject to Section 409A(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code to be made upon the occurrence of a "Change in Control," then such payment shall not be made unless such "Change in Control" satisfies the requirements of Section 409A(2)(A)(v) of the Internal Revenue Code and applicable regulations and rulings thereunder.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Plan is intended to promote the success and enhance the value of the Corporation by linking the personal interests of Directors, officers and other key employees and consultants to those of the Corporation's shareholders and by providing flexibility to the Corporation in its ability to motivate, attract and retain the services of Directors, officers and other key employees and consultants upon whose judgment, interest and special effort the successful conduct of the Corporation's operations is largely dependent.
 
The Plan will be managed by the Committee. Administrative functions may include, without limitation, documenting and communicating Awards made hereunder, maintaining records concerning such Awards, and satisfying (or assisting Eligible Persons in satisfying) any applicable reporting, disclosure, tax filing or withholding, or other legal requirements concerning Awards. Each member of the Committee is entitled to, in good faith, rely or act upon any report or other information furnished to that member by any officer or other employee of the Corporation or any Subsidiary, the Corporation's independent registered public accounting firm or other certified public accountants, or any executive compensation consultant or other professional retained to assist in the administration of the Plan. In addition to any other powers granted to the Committee, it will have the following management powers, subject to the express provisions of the Plan:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Any determinations or actions made or taken by the Committee pursuant to this Article will be binding and final.
Eligible Persons may be granted one or more Awards; provided, however, that Incentive Stock Options will not be granted to Directors.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
An Appreciation Right granted under clause (i) or (ii) of the preceding sentence is a Related Right. A Related Right may, in the Committee's discretion, apply to all or a portion of the Options subject to the Related Award.
 
 
 
 
 
The Committee may grant Performance Bonuses under the Plan in the form of cash or Shares to Eligible Persons that the Committee may from time to time select, in the amounts and pursuant to the terms and conditions that the Committee may determine, subject to the provisions below:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
An Award that is exercisable by the Grantee may, subject to the provisions of the Agreement under which it was granted, be exercised in whole or in part by the delivery to the Corporation of written notice of the exercise, in such form as the Committee may prescribe. The exercise, however, will not be effective until the Corporation has received the election notice and will be subject to receipt by the Corporation of payment of any applicable Option Price or other amount due in connection with such exercise, calculation by the Corporation of the applicable withholding taxes, and receipt by the Corporation of payment for any applicable withholding taxes.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The number and class of Shares subject to each outstanding Share Award, the Option Price, the base price for any Appreciation Right or other Award using such a price, the aggregate number and class of Shares for which grants of Share Awards thereafter may be made or in which Awards may be paid, and the limits provided for in Article 5 of this Plan, will be subject to such adjustment, if any, as the Committee in its sole discretion deems appropriate to reflect any corporate transaction or event, including, without limitation, dividends, Share splits, spin-offs, split-ups, recapitalizations, mergers, consolidations or reorganizations of or by the Corporation.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Unless sooner terminated by the Board or the Committee pursuant to Article 16 of this Plan, the Plan will terminate ten years after the date on which the Plan was first approved by the shareholders of the Corporation. The termination will not affect the validity of any Awards outstanding on the date of termination. Awards may be
 
granted or awarded prior to shareholder approval of this Plan, but any Award requiring such shareholder approval will be subject to approval of the Plan by the shareholders. No Award granted subject to such shareholder approval, and any dividends payable thereon, are subject to forfeiture if such shareholder approval is not obtained.
In addition to such other rights of indemnification as they may have as directors or as members of the Committee, the members of the Committee will be indemnified by the Corporation against the reasonable expenses, including attorneys' fees, actually and reasonably incurred in connection with the defense of any action, suit or proceeding, or in connection with any appeal therein, to which they or any of them may be a party by reason of any action taken or failure to act under or in connection with the Plan or any Awards granted hereunder, and against all amounts reasonably paid by them in settlement thereof or paid by them in satisfaction of a judgment in any such action, suit or proceeding, if such members acted in good faith and in a manner which they believed to be in, and not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation.
To the extent the Committee determines that any Award granted under the Plan is subject to Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, the Agreement evidencing such Award will incorporate the terms and conditions required by Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. To the extent applicable, the Plan and Agreement will be interpreted in accordance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and Department of Treasury regulations and other interpretive guidance issued thereunder, including without limitation any such regulations or other guidance that may be issued after the Effective Date. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan, in the event that following the Effective Date the Committee determines that any Award may be subject to Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, the Committee may adopt such amendments to the Plan and/or the applicable Agreement or adopt policies and procedures or take any other action or actions, including an action or amendment with retroactive effect, that the Committee determines is necessary or appropriate to (i) exempt the Award from the application of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code or (ii) comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code.

On July 30, 2009, Josef Mandelbaum, CEO-AG Intellectual Properties and, on August 5, 2009, Stephen J. Smith, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of American Greetings Corporation ("American Greetings"), each adopted a pre-arranged, non-discretionary stock trading plan with respect to the exercise of certain options to purchase American Greetings Class A common shares previously granted to each of them and the sale of Class A common shares acquired upon exercise. On August 5, 2009, Morry Weiss, Chairman of American Greetings, adopted a pre-arranged, non-discretionary stock trading plan with respect to certain Class B common shares of American Greetings currently owned by Mr. Weiss. Each of their trading plans was adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 ("Rule 10b5-1") under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and American Greetings' policies governing stock transactions by directors, executive officers and other employees. Rule 10b5-1 allows corporate insiders to establish prearranged stock trading plans when they are not in possession of material non-public information.
Commencing on August 3, 2009, and ending on August 2, 2011, Mr. Mandelbaum's Rule 10b5-1 trading plan provides for the periodic exercises of options to purchase up to 299,620 American Greetings Class A common shares and the subsequent sale of the acquired shares on the open market at prevailing market prices, in each case subject to minimum price thresholds. Commencing on August 5, 2009, and ending on August 3, 2012, Mr. Smith's Rule 10b5-1 trading plan provides for the periodic exercises of options to purchase up to 115,800 American Greetings Class A common shares and the subsequent sale of the acquired shares on the open market at prevailing market prices, in each case subject to minimum price thresholds. Commencing on August 7, 2009 and ending on August 7, 2012, Mr. Weiss's 10b5-1 trading plan provides for the offer to sell to American Greetings up to 200,000 American Greetings Class B Common Shares, subject to a minimum price threshold. Each of the Rule 10b5-1 trading plans is subject to specified limitations, including early termination or suspension upon the occurrence of certain events.
Transactions made under the Rule 10b5-1 trading plans will be reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission in accordance with applicable securities laws, rules and regulations. Except as may be required by law, American Greetings does not undertake to report stock trading plans by other American Greetings officers or directors, or to report modifications or termination of any publicly-announced plan, including the plans of each of Messrs. Mandelbaum, Smith and Weiss.

(a) On September 3, 2009, American Greetings Corporation (the "Company") made the determination to wind down and dissolve Carlton Mxico, S.A. de C.V. ("Carlton Mexico"), the Company's subsidiary that distributes and merchandises greeting cards, gift wrap and related products for retail customers throughout Mexico. Going forward, the Company will continue to make products available to its customers by selling to a third party distributor who will sell to and service Carlton Mexico's customers. The decision to dissolve Carlton Mexico and transition to a distributor model was the result of a comprehensive review of alternatives designed to reduce costs while continuing to serve Carlton Mexico's customers. The transition to a third party distributor model is expected to provide a more cost-effective method of servicing and merchandising product to retail customers in Mexico. The dissolution will result in the closure of Carlton Mexico's facility in Mexico City, Mexico, which is expected to occur during the remainder of the current fiscal year, and the elimination of approximately 170 positions.
(b) The Company estimates that it will incur approximately $1 million to $2 million in employee termination costs, $5 million to $6 million in asset impairment costs and $6 million to $8 million in other associated costs, primarily currency translation adjustments, with the dissolution of Carlton Mexico and the exit of this facility.
(c) The Company estimates that it will incur a total of approximately $12 million to $16 million in costs (as itemized above) in connection with the dissolution of Carlton Mexico and the exit of this facility. The Company expects to recognize all of these costs during the fiscal year ending February 28, 2010.
(d) The Company estimates that approximately $1 million to $2 million of the estimated total costs will result in future cash expenditures.

On September 23, 2009, American Greetings Corporation ("American Greetings") amended its Amended and Restated Receivables Purchase Agreement, dated as of October 24, 2006, among AGC Funding Corporation, a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned, consolidated subsidiary of American Greetings, American Greetings, as Servicer, members of the various Purchaser Groups from time to time party thereto (the "Purchasers"), and PNC Bank, National Association, as Administrator and LC Bank (the "Agreement"). The amendment decreases the amount of available financing under the Agreement from $90 million to $80 million and allows certain receivables to be excluded from the program in connection with the exercise of rights under insurance and other products that may be obtained from time to time by American Greetings or other originators that are designed to mitigate credit risks associated with the collection of accounts receivable. The amendment also extends the Agreement for an additional three years; provided, however, that in addition to customary termination provisions, the Agreement will terminate upon the termination of the liquidity commitments obtained by the Purchasers from third party liquidity providers. Such commitments may be made available to the Purchasers for 364-day periods only, and there can be no assurances that the third party liquidity providers will renew or extend their commitments to the Purchasers in which case the Agreement will terminate and American Greetings will not receive the benefit of the entire three year term of the Agreement.
The foregoing description of the amendment to the Amended and Restated Receivables Purchase Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the copy of the amendment attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1, and incorporated herein by reference.

Exhibit 99.1
CLEVELAND (September 24, 2009)  American Greetings Corporation (NYSE: AM) today announced its second quarter results for the quarter ended August 28, 2009.
Second Quarter Results
For the second quarter of fiscal 2010, the Company reported total revenue of $356.4 million, pre-tax income of $34.1 million, and net income of $23.1 million or 59 cents per share (all per-share amounts assume dilution). Included within these results was a pre-tax benefit from an insurance program of $7.9 million (after tax of approximately $7.6 million) or approximately 19 cents per share.
For the second quarter of fiscal 2009, the Company reported total revenue of $385.8 million, pre-tax income of $2.4 million, and net income of $2.3 million or 5 cents per share.
Management Comments and Outlook
Chief Executive Officer Zev Weiss said, "I am very pleased with our record earnings performance this quarter as well as our strong cash flow. I believe the changes we have made to our business over the last year are showing up in our results. We could not have achieved these results without the teamwork and coordination of all our associates."
Weiss continued, "We have devoted more time and effort to develop new products so that consumers can find unique and fresh offerings in the greeting card aisle. We have expanded our use of technology for both traditional greeting cards as well as on-line applications including Facebook and the iPhone. These examples of leadership in innovation are all in addition to the recent enhancements we have made to our portfolio, specifically the acquisitions of Recycled Paper Greetings and Papyrus, which complement our innovation with leadership in both humor and elegant design."
As a result of the strong cash flow performance during the first half of the fiscal year, the Company raised its previously announced fiscal 2010 cash flow estimate. Previously, the Company expected cash flow from operating activities of approximately $105 million to $115 million and capital expenditures of approximately $35 million to $45 million resulting in cash flow from operating activities minus capital expenditures of approximately $70 million. The Company now expects cash flow from operating activities of at least $160 million and capital expenditures of approximately $35 million resulting in cash flow from operating activities minus capital expenditures to be greater than $125 million.

On December 21, 2009, American Greetings Corporation ("American Greetings," "we," "our," or "us") entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement under which it sold certain assets, equipment and processes used in the manufacture and distribution of party goods to Amscan Holdings, Inc. ("Amscan") for a purchase price of $24,880,000 (the "Transaction"). Amscan is a leading designer, manufacturer and distributor of party goods, and owns or franchises party good stores throughout the United States. Amscan and certain of its subsidiaries currently purchase party goods, greeting cards and other social expression products from us. Under the terms of the Transaction, effective on or about March 1, 2010, we will no longer manufacture party goods, but will purchase party goods from Amscan. As a result of the Transaction, on December 22, 2009, American Greetings announced that it will wind down and close its party goods manufacturing and distribution facility in Kalamazoo, Michigan ("Kalamazoo Facility"). See Item 2.05 below for a description of the exit and disposal plan associated with the wind down and closure of the Kalamazoo Facility.
In connection with the Transaction, we entered into various other agreements with Amscan and or its affiliates, including a supply and distribution agreement and a licensing agreement. As a result of entering into the supply and distribution agreement and our agreeing that Amscan will no longer be required to purchase party goods from us, we also received a warrant to purchase approximately 2% of the Common Stock of AAH Holdings Corporation, Amscan's ultimate parent corporation. Following the Transaction, we will continue to distribute party goods to our retail customers in the mass merchant, grocery, drugstore and other specialty channels; however, effective March 1, 2010, American Greetings will no longer sell party goods to Amscan or other retailers in the party store channel as Amscan will have exclusive rights to distribute party goods into the party store channel as well as various other channels of distribution.
American Greetings issued a press release on December 22, 2009 announcing the Transaction, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
 
On December 23, 2009, American Greetings issued a press release reporting its results for the quarter ended November 27, 2009. A copy of this press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2.
The information in this Item 2.02 of this Current Report on Form 8-K (including Exhibit 99.2 attached hereto) is being furnished under Item 2.02 and shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or otherwise subject to the liability of such section, or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
 
(a) In connection with the Transaction, on December 21, 2009, we made the decision to wind down and close our Kalamazoo Facility. The decision to close the Kalamazoo Facility was the result of a comprehensive review of alternatives designed to improve the efficiency of our party goods business and enhance our product offering, while continuing to serve our customers. We believe that our strategic alliance with Amscan will help us accomplish this goal.
We expect that manufacturing at the Kalamazoo Facility will begin to phase out in early March 2010 and will be completed on or before the end of April 2010. The exact timing of when we will close our distribution activities at the Kalamazoo Facility is currently unknown, but we expect that our distribution operations at the Kalamazoo Facility will be closed by the end of the third quarter of the fiscal year ending February 28, 2011 ("Fiscal 2011").
(b) We estimate that we will incur approximately $1.5 million in employee termination costs associated with the separation of non-union employees as a result of the closing of the Kalamazoo Facility. We are unable at this time to estimate employee termination costs, if any, associated with the separation of the bargaining unit employees at the Kalamazoo Facility. We also estimate that we will incur approximately $10 million to $15 million in asset impairment costs, primarily relating to the impairment of the facility, in connection with closing the Kalamazoo Facility. The conclusion to impair assets was made as a result of the Transaction on December 21, 2009.
 
(c) We estimate that we will incur a total of approximately $11.5 million to $16.5 million in costs (as itemized above, but excluding employee termination costs, if any, associated with the separation of the bargaining unit employees at the Kalamazoo Facility, which we are unable to estimate at this time) in connection with closing the Kalamazoo Facility. We expect to incur the impairment costs and employee termination costs associated with the separation of the non-union employees during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ending February 28, 2010. Employee termination costs, if any, associated with the separation of the bargaining unit employees at the Kalamazoo Facility would likely be incurred by the end of the third quarter of Fiscal 2011.
(d) We estimate that approximately $1.5 million of the estimated total costs will result in future cash expenditures (excluding employee termination costs, if any, associated with the separation of the bargaining unit employees at the Kalamazoo Facility), none of which is expected to be the result of the asset impairment.

As part of this transaction, American Greetings will sell to Amscan inventory, equipment and processes used in the manufacture and distribution of party goods.

Exhibit 99.2
CLEVELAND (December 23, 2009)  American Greetings Corporation (NYSE: AM) today announced its third quarter results for the quarter ended November 27, 2009.
Third Quarter Results
For the third quarter of fiscal 2010, the Company reported total revenue of $440.2 million, pre-tax income of $38.1 million, and net income of $29.7 million or 75 cents per share (all per-share amounts assume dilution). The Company recorded, within the North American Social Expression Products segment, pre-tax employee termination and estimated asset impairment costs related to the previously announced wind down of the Mexican operations of $5.9 million (after-tax of approximately $5.7 million) that reduced earnings per share by approximately 14 cents during the quarter. The Company also recorded, due to better than expected performance, incremental variable compensation expense of approximately $12.1 million (after-tax of approximately $7.4 million) that reduced earnings per share by approximately 19 cents during the quarter.
For the third quarter of fiscal 2009, the Company reported total revenue of $454.1 million, a pre-tax loss of $228.7 million, and a net loss of $193.3 million or $4.25 per share. Included in the prior period's results are several charges recorded by the Company. Within the International Social Expression Products and AG Interactive segments, the Company recorded non-cash, pre-tax goodwill and other asset impairment charges of $242.9 million (after-tax of approximately $202.6 million) that reduced earnings per share by approximately $4.46 during the quarter. Within the Retail Operations segment, the Company recorded a non-cash pre-tax asset impairment charge of $3.9 million (after-tax of approximately $2.7 million) that reduced earnings per share by approximately 6 cents during the quarter. The Company also recorded a pre-tax severance charge of $7.0 million (after-tax of approximately $4.7 million) that reduced earnings per share by approximately 10 cents. Partially offsetting these charges was a reduction of variable compensation expense of $11.1 million (after-tax of approximately $7.5 million), which increased the Company's earnings per share by approximately 17 cents.
Management Comments and Outlook
Chief Executive Officer Zev Weiss said, "For the third consecutive quarter, I am very pleased with our earnings performance and strong cash flow. We continue to develop new products that consumers find unique and fresh. I believe the product content innovation over the last couple of years as well as the portfolio changes and operational improvements we have made this year are clearly contributing to the results of this quarter. In this challenging economic environment, we could not have achieved these results without the hard work of all our associates and I am grateful for their dedication."
As a result of the strong cash flow performance during the first nine months of the fiscal year, the Company raised its fiscal 2010 cash flow estimate. At the beginning of the fiscal year, the Company expected cash flow from operating activities of approximately $105 million to $115 million and capital expenditures of approximately $35 million to $45 million resulting in cash flow from operating activities minus capital expenditures of approximately $70 million. In September, the Company raised its expectation of cash flow from operating activities to at least $160 million
and capital expenditures of approximately $35 million resulting in cash flow from operating activities minus capital expenditures to be greater than $125 million. The Company now expects cash flow from operating activities of at least $195 million and capital expenditures of approximately $35 million resulting in cash flow from operating activities minus capital expenditures to be greater than $160 million.

Explanatory Note
On December 21, 2009, American Greetings Corporation ("American Greetings," "we," "our," or "us") filed a Current Report on Form 8-K (the "Original Form 8-K") reporting the sale of certain assets, equipment and processes used in the manufacturing and distribution of party goods (the "Transaction") to Amscan Holdings, Inc. ("Amscan"), which resulted in our decision to wind down and close our party goods operations at our manufacturing and distribution facility in Kalamazoo, Michigan (the "Kalamazoo Facility"). At the time the Original Form 8-K was filed, American Greetings estimated the amount of the employee termination costs associated with the separation of the non-union employees as a result of closing the Kalamazoo Facility; however at that time we were not able to estimate employee termination costs associated with the separation of the bargaining unit employees at the Kalamazoo Facility. American Greetings is filing this amendment on Form 8-K/A (this "Form 8-K/A") to amend the Original Form 8-K to provide updated information regarding the exit and disposal activities, including that we expect to incur approximately $1.5 million in additional employee termination costs associated with the separation of the bargaining unit employees at the Kalamazoo Facility. The disclosure contained in Item 2.05 of the Original Form 8-K is hereby replaced in its entirety by the disclosure contained in Item 2.05 of this Form 8-K/A.
 
(a) In connection with the Transaction, on December 21, 2009, we made the decision to wind down and close our Kalamazoo Facility. The decision to close the Kalamazoo Facility was the result of a comprehensive review of alternatives designed to improve the efficiency of our party goods business and enhance our product offering, while continuing to serve our customers. We believe that our strategic alliance with Amscan will help us accomplish this goal.
We expect that manufacturing at the Kalamazoo Facility will begin to phase out in early March 2010 and will be completed on or before the end of May 2010. The exact timing of when we will close our distribution activities at the Kalamazoo Facility is currently unknown, but we expect that our distribution operations at the Kalamazoo Facility will be closed by the end of the third quarter of the fiscal year ending February 28, 2011 ("Fiscal 2011").
(b) We estimate that we will incur approximately $3.0 million in employee termination costs associated with the separation of employees as a result of the closing of the Kalamazoo Facility. We also estimate that we will incur approximately $10 million to $15 million in asset impairment costs, primarily relating to the impairment of the facility, in connection with closing the Kalamazoo Facility. The conclusion to impair assets was made as a result of the Transaction on December 21, 2009.
(c) We estimate that we will incur a total of approximately $13 million to $18 million in costs (as itemized above), in connection with closing the Kalamazoo Facility. We expect to incur the impairment costs and employee termination costs of approximately $1.5 million associated with the separation of the non-union employees during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ending February 28, 2010 ("Fiscal 2010"). We expect to incur employee termination costs of approximately $1.5 million associated with the separation of the bargaining unit employees at the Kalamazoo Facility by the end of Fiscal 2011, some or all of which may be incurred as early as the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2010.
(d) We estimate that approximately $3 million of the estimated total costs will result in future cash expenditures, none of which is expected to be the result of the asset impairment.
This Form 8-K/A contains statements that may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal securities laws. These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historic or current facts. They use such words as "anticipate," "estimate," "expect," "project," "intend," "plan," "believe," and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. These forward-looking statements are based on currently available information, but are subject to a variety of uncertainties, unknown risks and other factors concerning our operations and business environment, which are difficult to predict and may be beyond our control. Further information concerning issues that could materially affect actual results and performance related to forward-looking statements can be found in our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the "Risk Factors" section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Exhibit 99.1
CLEVELAND (April 22, 2010)  American Greetings Corporation (NYSE: AM) today announced its financial results for both the fourth fiscal quarter and fiscal year ended February 28, 2010.
Fourth Quarter Results
For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, the Company reported total revenue of $426.4 million, pre-tax income of $31.8 million, and net income of $18.8 million or 46 cents per share (all per-share amounts assume dilution). The Company recorded pre-tax costs of $12.3 million (after-tax of approximately $8.6 million, reducing earnings per share by about 21 cents) related to the previously announced wind down of its operations in Mexico. Other pre-tax costs included $19.0 million for the settlement of a lawsuit (after-tax of about $11.6 million, reducing earnings per share by about 29 cents) and $5.9 million for severance (after-tax of about $3.6 million, reducing earnings per share by about 9 cents). These costs were partially offset by a $21.2 million pre-tax net benefit from the previously announced party goods transaction (after-tax of about $12.9 million, increasing earnings per share by about 33 cents). The $21.2 million net benefit included a $34.2 million gain and $13.0 million of impairments related to the exit of the party goods manufacturing facility. The Company also recognized a $3.3 million pre-tax gain related to the liquidation of a business in France (the after-tax amount was also about $3.3 million, increasing earnings per share by about 8 cents).
For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, the Company reported total revenue of $422.5 million, a pre-tax loss from continuing operations of $67.9 million, and a net loss of $50.1 million or $1.13 per share. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, the Company recognized pre-tax goodwill impairment charges of $47.3 million (after-tax of approximately $42.6 million that reduced earnings per share by 97 cents). In addition, the Company recognized atypical expenses in its licensing business of $16.4 million (after-tax of approximately $10.0 million reducing earnings per share by 23 cents). The Company also recognized a pre-tax severance charge of $7.5 million (after-tax of about $4.6 million, decreasing earnings per share by about 10 cents).
 
Full Year Results
For the full year fiscal 2010, the Company reported total revenue of $1,635.9 million, pre-tax income of $121.0 million, and net income of $81.6 million or $2.03 per share. The Company recorded costs of approximately $18.2 million (after-tax of approximately $6.5 million reducing earnings per share by approximately 16 cents) related to the previously announced wind down of its operations in Mexico. The Company also incurred a $24.0 million pre-tax charge for the settlement of a lawsuit (after-tax of about $14.7 million, reducing earnings per share by about 37 cents), pre-tax severance expense of $9.4 million (after-tax of about $5.8 million, reducing earnings per share about 14 cents) and a $28.3 million pre-tax charge related to the divestiture of our retail business earlier in the year (after-tax of about $17.3 million, reducing earnings per share approximately by 43 cents). These costs were partially offset by a $21.2 million pre-tax net benefit related to the party goods transaction (after-tax of about $12.9 million, increasing earnings per share by about 33 cents), a $3.3 million pre-tax gain related to the liquidation of a business in France (the after-tax amount was also about $3.3 million, increasing earnings per share by about 8 cents) and a $7.9 million pre-tax benefit associated with a legacy insurance program (after-tax of about $7.6 million, increasing earnings per share about 19 cents).
Management Comments and Outlook
Chief Executive Officer Zev Weiss said, "I am delighted with our fourth quarter performance as it was the culmination of a successful year. During the year, we made both strategic and operational changes that improved our business model. Our portfolio changes as well as our operational execution, including our innovation in product content, have been large factors driving improved cash flow. We were able to generate cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures of $171 million, which exceeded our expectations. We could not have achieved these results without the unrelenting effort of all our associates and I am grateful for their commitment."
For fiscal 2011, the Company expects revenue to decline approximately 1% to 2% compared to fiscal 2010. The decline is driven by the expectation of reduced sales of party goods products as a result of the transaction announced in December 2009. The Company expects cash flow from operating activities of about $165 million and capital expenditures of approximately $40 million resulting in cash flow from operating activities minus capital expenditures to be around $125 million.

("Cookie Jar") providing for the sale of the Strawberry Shortcake and Care Bears properties (the "Properties") to Cookie Jar for $195 million. As disclosed in American Greetings' Current Report on Form 8-K filed March 30, 2009, because Cookie Jar's acquisition of the Properties did not close by September 30, 2008, on March 24, 2009, American Greetings entered into a binding term sheet (the "MoonScoop Term Sheet") with MoonScoop S.A.S. ("MoonScoop") providing for the sale to MoonScoop of the Properties, as well as all rights in the Properties owned by Cookie Jar and its affiliates, under which American Greetings and Cookie Jar were to be paid $76 million and $19 million, respectively. MoonScoop failed to close the acquisition of the Properties, resulting in the MoonScoop Term Sheet expiring in accordance with its terms; however, the obligations of the parties under the Cookie Jar Agreement remained in effect.
The failure to close the transactions described above resulted in three separate legal proceedings involving American Greetings and its subsidiary, Those Characters From Cleveland, Inc. ("TCFC"), as well as Cookie Jar, Cookie Jar Entertainment (USA) Inc. (formerly known as DIC Entertainment Corporation), Cookie Jar Entertainment Holdings (USA) Inc. (formerly known as DIC Entertainment Holdings, Inc.), Mike Young Productions, LLC, and MoonScoop, involving the Properties. These legal proceedings are described in American Greetings' Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on April 29, 2010, which descriptions are incorporated herein by reference. On May 7, 2010, the legal proceedings involving American Greetings, TCFC, Cookie Jar, Cookie Jar Entertainment (USA) Inc. (formerly known as DIC Entertainment Corporation), and Cookie Jar Entertainment Holdings (USA) Inc. (formerly known as DIC Entertainment Holdings, Inc.) were settled. As part of the settlement, on May 7, 2010, the Cookie Jar Agreement was amended to, among other things, terminate American Greetings' obligation to sell to Cookie Jar, and Cookie Jar's obligation to purchase, the Properties. As part of the settlement, Cookie Jar Entertainment (USA) Inc. will continue to represent the Strawberry Shortcake property on behalf of American Greetings, and will become an international agent for the Care Bears property.
Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure
From May 4, 2010 to May 6, 2010, the following executive officers of American Greetings adopted pre-arranged, non-discretionary stock trading plans with respect to (1) the exercise of options to purchase common shares of American Greetings previously granted to them, and (2) the sale of the common shares acquired upon exercise of such options.
The trading plans, each of which terminates and supercedes any other trading plan that may then be in effect, were adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 ("Rule 10b5-1") under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and American Greetings' policies governing stock transactions by directors, executive officers and other employees. Rule 10b5-1 allows corporate insiders to establish prearranged stock trading plans when they are not in possession of material non-public information. Each of the trading plans provides for periodic exercises of options to purchase common shares and (a) in the case of Class A commons shares, the subsequent sale of the acquired shares on the open
 
market at prevailing market prices, and (b) in the case of Class B common shares, the subsequent offer to sell the acquired shares to American Greetings in accordance with American Greetings' Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, in each case subject to minimum price thresholds. Transactions made under the Rule 10b5-1 trading plans will be reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission in accordance with applicable securities laws, rules and regulations. Except as may be required by law, American Greetings does not undertake to report stock trading plans by other American Greetings officers or directors, or to report modifications or terminations of any publicly-announced plan, including the plans described herein.

American Greetings Corporation ("American Greetings") was party to a Credit Agreement (the "Existing Credit Agreement"), dated April 4, 2006, as amended, among various lending institutions party thereto (the "Lenders"), National City Bank, as the global agent, joint lead arranger, joint bookrunner, swing line lender, LC Issuer and collateral agent, UBS Securities LLC, as joint lead arranger, joint bookrunner and syndication agent, and KeyBank National Association, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., and LaSalle Bank National Association, as documentation agents. The Existing Credit Agreement included a $350 million revolving credit facility as well as a $100 million term loan facility. On June 11, 2010, American Greetings amended and restated its Existing Credit Agreement by entering into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the "Amended and Restated Credit Agreement") among various lending institutions party thereto (the "Lenders"), PNC Bank, National Association, as the Global Administrative Agent, as the Swing Line Lender, a LC Issuer and the Collateral Agent, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Bank of America, N.A., as Co-Syndication Agents, KeyBank National Association and The Bank of Nova Scotia as Co-documentation Agents, and PNC Capital Markets LLC, as the Lead Arranger and Sole Bookrunner.
Pursuant to the terms of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, American Greetings and certain additional foreign subsidiary borrowers that may become parties to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, may from time to time continue to borrow, repay and re-borrow up to $350 million under the revolving credit facility, with the ability to increase the size of the facility to up to $400 million, subject to customary conditions. The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement continues to include a $95 million Canadian subfacility and continues to allow American Greetings to borrow from time to time in Euros, Canadian dollars, British pounds, Australian dollars, New Zealand dollars or Yen. The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement also continues to provide for a $25 million sub-limit for the issuance of swing line loans, which are comparatively short-term loans used for working capital purposes, and a $100 million sub-limit for the issuance of letters of credit. Additionally, the entire amount of the Canadian subfacility can be used for Canadian letters of credit.
The obligations under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement continue to be guaranteed by American Greetings' material domestic subsidiaries (the "Guarantors") and continue to be secured by substantially all of the personal property of American Greetings and each of the Guarantors, including a pledge of all of the capital stock or other equity interests in substantially all of American Greetings' domestic subsidiaries and 65% of the capital stock or other equity interest in American Greetings' material first tier foreign subsidiaries. The revolving loans under the Existing Credit Facility were scheduled to mature on April 4, 2011 and the term loan was scheduled to mature on April 4, 2013. The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, including revolving loans thereunder, will mature on June 11, 2015. In connection with the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, the term loan was terminated and American Greetings repaid the full $99 million outstanding under the term loan using cash on hand. The proceeds of the borrowings under the Credit Agreement may be used to provide working capital and for other general corporate purposes.
Revolving loans that are denominated in U.S. dollars will bear interest at either the U.S. base rate or the London Inter-Bank Offer Rate ("LIBOR"), at American Greetings' election, plus a margin determined according to American Greetings' leverage ratio (as described below). Revolving loans that are denominated in Canadian dollars will bear interest at either the Canadian base rate or the Canadian Dollar Offer Rate ("CDOR"), at American Greetings' election, plus a margin determined according to American Greetings' leverage ratio. Revolving loans denominated in a designated foreign currency will bear interest at a rate to be based on LIBOR for such currency plus a margin determined according to American Greetings' leverage ratio. Swing line loans will bear interest at a quoted rate agreed upon by American Greetings and the swing line lender. At closing, the applicable margin for (a) LIBOR and CDOR rate loans was 2.50% per annum, with possible future spreads ranging from 2.25% to 3.50% per annum, and (b) U.S. and Canadian base rate loans was 1.50% per annum, with possible future spreads ranging from 1.25% to 2.50% per annum. In addition to interest, American Greetings is required to pay commitment fees on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility. The commitment fee rate is initially 0.50% per annum and, like the interest rate spreads, is subject to adjustment thereafter based on American Greetings' leverage ratio, with possible future spreads ranging from 0.375% to 0.500% per annum.
The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains certain restrictive covenants that are customary for similar credit arrangements, including covenants relating to financial reporting and notification, compliance with laws, preservation of existence, maintenance of books and records, use of proceeds, maintenance of properties and insurance, and limitations on liens, dispositions, issuance of debt, investments, payment of dividends, repurchases of capital stock, acquisitions, transactions with affiliates, and capital expenditures. There are also financial
 
covenants that require American Greetings to maintain a maximum leverage ratio (consolidated indebtedness minus unrestricted cash to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") of no greater than 3.00 to 1, and a minimum interest coverage ratio (consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense) of no less than 3.00 to 1. The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement also requires American Greetings to make certain mandatory prepayments of outstanding indebtedness using the net cash proceeds received from certain dispositions, events of loss and additional indebtedness that American Greetings incurs.
The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement provides for customary events of default with corresponding grace periods, including failure to pay any principal or interest when due, failure to perform or observe covenants, bankruptcy or insolvency events and change of control. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default, the Global Agent upon the request of the requisite number of Lenders is required to declare all amounts owing under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to be immediately due and payable, terminate the Lenders' commitments to make loans under the Credit Agreement, and/or exercise any and all remedies and other rights under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.
Certain of the Lenders and their affiliates have provided, from time to time, and may continue to provide, investment banking, commercial banking, financial and other services to American Greetings, including letters of credit, depository and account processing services, for which American Greetings has paid and intends to pay customary fees. Also, certain of the Lenders were a party to the Existing Credit Agreement.
The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement amends, restates and replaces the Existing Credit Agreement. As described in Item 1.01, which is incorporated by reference into this Item 1.02, the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement does not have a term loan facility. As described in Item 1.01 above, in connection with the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, the term loan under the Existing Credit Agreement was repaid in full and was terminated.
The information included in Item 1.01 of this report is incorporated by reference into this Item 2.03.
     On June 11, 2010, American Greetings held its 2010 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the "Annual Meeting"). At the Annual Meeting, the three nominees for Class III directors named in American Greetings' proxy statement were elected to serve on American Greetings' board of directors until the 2013 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, or until his successor is duly elected and qualified.
     The voting results are set forth below.

Exhibit 99.1
CLEVELAND (June 30, 2010)  American Greetings Corporation (NYSE: AM) today announced its results for the first fiscal quarter ended May 28, 2010.
First Quarter Results
For the first quarter of fiscal 2011, the Company reported total revenue of $396.3 million, pre-tax income of $51.0 million, and net income of $30.8 million or 75 cents per share (all per-share amounts assume dilution).
For the first quarter of fiscal 2010, the Company reported total revenue of $412.9 million, pre-tax income of $16.9 million, and net income of $10.0 million or 25 cents per share. During the first quarter of fiscal 2010, American Greetings sold its retail store operations. The Retail Operations segment reported revenue of $11.7 million and a segment loss of $34.8 million (after-tax of approximately $21.3 million), which reduced earnings per share by approximately 54 cents during the quarter.
Management Comments and Outlook
Chief Executive Officer Zev Weiss said, "I am pleased that our earnings per share of 75 cents were the highest we have ever achieved in a first quarter. Our first quarter EPS benefited from several factors including the solid performance in our core business units, the changes we made over the last eighteen months to our portfolio of businesses, and the shares we repurchased over the last several years. We believe our refined business portfolio, which focuses on our core greeting card business, along with the changes we have made to our capital structure over the last several years, position the Company well for the opportunities and challenges ahead."
"The refined portfolio is contributing to the solid EPS for the quarter. Eliminating the earnings drag of our retail operations has added meaningfully to our earnings swing quarter on quarter. In addition, we continue to believe that by the end of this fiscal year, the integration of both Recycled Paper Greetings and Papyrus will enhance our operating income by $15 to 20 million on an annual run rate," Weiss added.
For fiscal year 2011, the Company continues to anticipate cash flow from operating activities of about $165 million and capital expenditures of approximately $40 million resulting in cash flow from operating activities minus capital expenditures of approximately $125 million.

EXHIBIT 99.1
CLEVELAND (September 29, 2010)  American Greetings Corporation (NYSE: AM) today announced its results for the second fiscal quarter ended August 27, 2010.
Second Quarter Results
For the second quarter of fiscal 2011, the Company reported total revenue of $342.8 million, pre-tax income of $17.0 million, and net income of $8.5 million or 21 cents per share (all per-share amounts assume dilution). Compared to the prior year, revenue was down approximately $13.6 million. Approximately $10.2 million of the revenue decline was a result of the party goods transaction that occurred in December 2009. Holding aside the effect of the party goods transaction, revenue declined about $3.4 million or approximately one percent. Also during the quarter, the Company incurred pre-tax costs associated with the integrations of Papyrus and Recycled Paper Greetings of $5.2 million (after tax of approximately $3.2 million) or approximately 8 cents per share.
For the second quarter of fiscal 2010, the Company reported total revenue of $356.4 million, pre-tax income of $34.1 million, and net income of $23.1 million or 59 cents per share. Included within these results was a pre-tax benefit from an insurance program of $7.9 million (after tax of approximately $7.6 million) or approximately 19 cents per share.
Management Comments and Outlook
Chief Executive Officer Zev Weiss said, "I am pleased with our overall performance in the first half of this year. While we continue to see an erratic recovery in the economy and its effect on our top line, our team has executed well on cost containment and that execution has directly led to healthy cash flow. Our cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures of $74 million in the first half gets us more than halfway to our full year forecast of approximately $125 million."
For fiscal year 2011, the Company continues to anticipate cash flow from operating activities of about $165 million and capital expenditures of approximately $40 million resulting in cash flow from operating activities minus capital expenditures of approximately $125 million.

Exhibit 99.1
CLEVELAND (December 22, 2010)  American Greetings Corporation (NYSE: AM) today announced its results for the third fiscal quarter ended November 26, 2010.
Third Quarter Results
For the third quarter of fiscal 2011, the Company reported total revenue of $430.1 million, pre-tax income of $51.5 million, and net income of $32.2 million or 78 cents per share (all per-share amounts assume dilution). Compared to the prior year, revenue was down approximately $10.0 million. Approximately $8.6 million of the revenue decline was a result of the party goods transaction that occurred in December 2009. Holding aside the effect of the party goods transaction, revenue declined about $1.4 million.
For the third quarter of fiscal 2010, the Company reported total revenue of $440.2 million, pre-tax income of $38.1 million, and net income of $29.7 million or 75 cents per share. Included within these results were pre-tax costs related to the wind down of the Mexican operations of $5.9 million (after-tax of approximately $5.7 million) or approximately 14 cents per share as well as incremental variable compensation expense of approximately $12.1 million (after-tax of approximately $7.4 million) or approximately 19 cents during the quarter.
Management Comments and Outlook
Chief Executive Officer Zev Weiss said, "I am pleased with our overall performance in the third fiscal quarter. We have managed to continuously develop new and innovative products while tightly managing expenses, which has resulted in solid earnings for the quarter. During the fourth fiscal quarter, we will face the traditional risk of Christmas and Valentines Day holidays, and this year we face the additional uncertainty of the pace of the economic recovery, which makes consumer buying patterns more difficult to predict. However, we believe our refined business portfolio, along with the changes we have made to our capital structure over the last several years, position the Company well for the opportunities and challenges ahead. We expect to at least meet our projected cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures goal of $125 million with upside to this estimate based on further improvements to the balance sheet and lower than anticipated capital expenditures."
 
Previously, for fiscal year 2011, the Company projected cash flow from operating activities of about $165 million and capital expenditures of approximately $40 million resulting in cash flow from operating activities minus capital expenditures of approximately $125 million.

Non-GAAP Measures
Certain revenue, after-tax, earnings per share, and liquidity amounts included in this release may be considered non-GAAP measures under the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation G. The after-tax amounts were calculated based on the Company's statutory tax rate of approximately 38.9% for U.S. based items and the appropriate statutory rates for international jurisdictions. Management believes that providing adjusted revenue information is useful to investors as it explains the impact of the party goods transaction on the Company's total revenue. In addition, Management believes that providing after-tax and earnings per share information is useful to investors in analyzing the Company's results and that cash flow from operating activities minus capital expenditures provides a liquidity measure useful to investors in analyzing the cash generation of the Company.

Exhibit 99.1
CLEVELAND (April 28, 2011)  American Greetings Corporation (NYSE: AM) today announced its financial results for both the fiscal fourth quarter and year ended February 28, 2011.
Chief Executive Officer Zev Weiss said, "I am quite pleased with our overall performance this year. Our business is running well, our financial results exceeded our expectations, and the team had a great performance in an otherwise challenging year. We successfully completed the integrations of Papyrus and Recycled Paper Greetings and have established what we believe to be the industry-leading portfolio of products. Our earnings increased compared to the previous year, enabled by our refined portfolio, good expense management, and changed capital structure. Our cash flow from operating activities minus capital expenditures was $143 million and exceeded our original guidance by 14%. I want to thank our associates around the world for their continued commitment and teamwork."
Management Comments and Outlook
For fiscal 2012, the Company expects revenue to grow approximately 5% compared to fiscal 2011, driven equally by organic revenue growth and the acquisition of Watermark Publishing in the United Kingdom. The Company expects cash flow from operating activities to fall within the range of $125 million to $145 million and capital expenditures between $45 million and $50 million, resulting in cash flow from operating activities minus capital expenditures of $80 million to $100 million.
For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, the Company reported total revenue of $423.3 million, pre-tax income of $36.4 million, and net income of $15.5 million or 37 cents per share (all per-share amounts assume dilution). Several items impacted revenue and income during the quarter. Compared to the prior year, quarterly revenue was $5.0 million lower as a result of the party goods transaction that occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. Revenue was $7.1 million lower as a result of scan-based trading conversions that occurred during the quarter. The pre-tax income impact of the scan-based trading conversions was $5.5 million (after-tax $3.4 million, reducing earnings per share by about 8 cents). The Company also recorded severance costs of $4.0 million (after-tax $2.4 million, reducing earnings per share by about 6 cents) and costs associated with the integrations of Papyrus and Recycled Paper Greetings of $0.7 million (after-tax $0.4 million, reducing earnings per share by about 1 cent). These costs were partially offset by a $2.8 million gain associated with a building sale (after-tax $1.7 million, increasing earnings per share by about 4 cents) and $1.3 million of dividend income (after-tax $0.8 million, increasing earnings per share by about 2 cents). Both the building sale and the dividend were reported as other non-operating income. The Company also effectively settled ten years of domestic tax audits which increased income tax expense by $6.9 million (reducing earnings per share by about 17 cents).
Fourth Quarter Results
For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, the Company reported total revenue of $426.4 million, pre-tax income of $31.8 million, and net income of $18.8 million or 46 cents per share. The Company recorded costs of $12.3 million (after-tax $8.6 million, reducing earnings per share by
 
about 21 cents) related to the wind down of its operations in Mexico. Other costs included $19.0 million for the settlement of a lawsuit (after-tax $11.6 million, reducing earnings per share by about 29 cents) and $5.9 million for severance (after-tax $3.6 million, reducing earnings per share by about 9 cents). These costs were partially offset by a $21.2 million net benefit from the party goods transaction (after-tax $12.9 million, increasing earnings per share by about 33 cents). The Company also recognized a $3.3 million gain related to the liquidation of a business in France (the after-tax amount was also about $3.3 million, increasing earnings per share by about 8 cents).
For the full year fiscal 2011, the Company reported total revenue of $1,592.6 million, pre-tax income of $156.0 million, and net income of $87.0 million or $2.11 per share. Compared to the prior year, revenues were $11.7 million lower as a result of the sale of the retail store operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 and $31.2 million lower as a result of the party goods transaction that occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. Scan-based trading conversions during the year further reduced revenue by $7.2 million. The pre-tax income impact of the scan-based trading conversions was $5.7 million (after-tax $3.5 million, reducing earnings per share by about 9 cents). The Company also recorded $10.3 million of costs associated with the integrations of Papyrus and Recycled Paper Greetings (after-tax $6.3 million, reducing earnings per share by about 15 cents) and severance costs of $6.9 million (after-tax $4.2 million, reducing earnings per share by about 10 cents). These costs were partially offset by a $3.8 million gain associated with the sales of two buildings (after-tax $2.3 million, increasing earnings per share by about 5 cents) and $1.3 million of dividend income (after-tax $0.8 million, increasing earnings per share by about 2 cents). Both the buildings sales and the dividend were reported as other non-operating income. During fiscal 2011, the Company also effectively settled ten years of domestic tax audits which increased income tax expense by $6.9 million (reducing earnings per share by about 17 cents).
Full Year Results
For fiscal 2010, the Company reported total revenue of $1,635.9 million, pre-tax income of $121.0 million, and net income of $81.6 million or $2.03 per share. The Company recorded costs of approximately $18.2 million (after-tax $6.5 million, reducing earnings per share by about 16 cents) related to the wind down of its operations in Mexico. The Company also incurred a $24.0 million charge for the settlement of a lawsuit (after-tax $14.7 million, reducing earnings per share by about 37 cents), severance expense of $9.4 million (after-tax $5.8 million, reducing earnings per share by about 14 cents) and a $28.3 million charge related to the divestiture of our retail business early in the year (after-tax $17.3 million, reducing earnings per share by about 43 cents). These costs were partially offset by a $21.2 million net benefit related to the party goods transaction (after-tax $12.9 million, increasing earnings per share by about 33 cents), a $3.3 million gain related to the liquidation of a business in France (the after-tax amount was also about $3.3 million, increasing earnings per share by about 8 cents) and a $7.9 million benefit associated with a legacy insurance program (after-tax $7.6 million, increasing earnings per share by about 19 cents).

Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
The Company is organized and manages its business in three reportable segments: North American Social Expression Products, International Social Expression Products, and AG Interactive segments, and one non-reportable segment. During the first quarter ended May 27, 2011, certain items that were previously considered corporate expenses are now included in the calculation of segment earnings for the North American Social Expression Products segment. This change is the result of modifications to organizational structures, and is intended to better align the segment financial results with the responsibilities of segment management and the way management evaluates the Company's operations. In addition, beginning with the first quarter ended May 27, 2011, segment results are now reported using actual foreign exchange rates for the periods presented. Previously, segment results were reported at constant exchange rates to eliminate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. Attached as Exhibit 99.2 are the unaudited segment earnings (loss) for the quarterly periods in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 calculated consistently with the current methodology that is used in fiscal 2012.

Exhibit 99.1
CLEVELAND (June 29, 2011)American Greetings Corporation (NYSE: AM) today announced its results for the first fiscal quarter ended May 27, 2011.
First Quarter Results
For the first quarter of fiscal 2012, the Company reported total revenue of $402.3 million, pre-tax income of $50.8 million, and net income of $32.6 million or 78 cents per share (all per-share amounts assume dilution). Revenue was reduced by $1.9 million as a result of scan-based trading conversions that occurred during the quarter. The pre-tax income impact of the scan-based trading conversions was $2.3 million (after-tax $1.4 million, reducing earnings per share by about 3 cents).
For the first quarter of fiscal 2011, the Company reported total revenue of $396.3 million, pre-tax income of $51.0 million, and net income of $30.8 million or 75 cents per share. The Company incurred pre-tax costs associated with the integrations of Papyrus and Recycled Paper Greetings of $3.4 million (after-tax of $2.1 million, reducing earnings per share by about 5 cents).
Management Comments and Outlook
Chief Executive Officer Zev Weiss said, "Despite the continuing erratic economic environment, we achieved a record level of earnings per share in the first quarter driven by the combination of the changes we made to our portfolio of businesses in recent years, our growing market share in North America, and the continuation of good expense management."
For fiscal 2012, the Company expects revenue to grow approximately 5% compared to fiscal 2011. The Company expects cash flow from operating activities to fall within the range of $125 million to $145 million and capital expenditures between $45 million and $50 million, resulting in cash flow from operating activities minus capital expenditures of $80 million to $100 million. This cash flow estimate includes an aggregate use of cash of approximately $5 million to $15 million for the combination of working capital, deferred costs, and taxes.

The after-tax amounts were calculated based on the Company's statutory tax rate of approximately 38.9%. Management believes that after-tax information is useful in analyzing the Company's results and that cash flow from operating activities minus capital expenditures provides a liquidity measure useful to investors in analyzing the cash generation of the Company.

American Greetings Corporation ("American Greetings") today announced that it has received a commitment from the Cleveland International Fund ("CIF") to provide up to a $65 million loan facility to assist in the construction of its new world headquarters. If the loan facility closes, borrowings would remain outstanding for five years and bear interest at a fixed rate of 1.9% per year. The loan facility is scheduled to close on or before February 15, 2012.
Neither party has any obligation under the commitment until the parties have entered into a definitive agreement governing the loan facility. In addition, the CIF, which utilizes the U.S. government-sponsored economic development initiative known as the EB-5 Regional Center Program, expects to raise the funding for the loan facility from qualified foreign nationals. The EB-5 program was established to afford eligible foreign nationals the opportunity to become lawful, permanent residents while stimulating economic activity and creating jobs for U.S. workers through their investments in qualifying projects that create new jobs. As a result, any financing contemplated by the commitment is subject to approval of the world headquarters project by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Service as qualifying under the EB-5 Program as well as the CIF's ability to raise capital from qualified foreign nationals.
American Greetings previously announced its intention to invest in a new headquarters in northeast Ohio. The new, roughly 700,000 square foot facility, is expected to be developed in a style that is more reflective of its creative culture.
American Greetings had previously considered moving its headquarters outside the state of Ohio. As a result, the state of Ohio agreed to provide American Greetings with certain tax credits, loans, and other incentives totaling up to $93.5 million to assist American Greetings in the development of a new or renovated headquarters in Ohio. American Greetings is required to make certain investments and meet other criteria to receive these incentives over time.
American Greetings is currently in the early stages of the project and has not yet completed the architectural design for the new building. However, based on preliminary estimates, it is anticipated that the costs associated with a new world headquarters building will be between approximately $150 million and $200 million over the next three to four years, with the majority of the spending occurring after the current fiscal year.
Factors That May Affect Future Results
Certain statements in this report may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal securities laws.

They use such words as "anticipate," "estimate," "expect," "project," "intend," "plan," "believe," and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. These forward-looking statements are based on currently available information, but are subject to a variety of uncertainties, unknown risks and other factors concerning our operations and business environment, which are difficult to predict and may be beyond our control. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by these forward-looking statements, and that could adversely affect our future financial performance, include, but are not limited to, the ultimate design of, and building and other construction costs associated with, any new world headquarters building that we build; our ability to satisfy the requirements to receive government incentives together with the timing of our receipt of these incentives; and whether the loan facility with the CIF will close. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we believe to be immaterial also may adversely affect us. Should any known or unknown risks or uncertainties develop into actual events, or underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, these developments could have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For further information concerning the risks we face and issues that could materially affect our financial performance related to forward-looking statements, refer to our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the "Risk Factors" section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2011.

Exhibit 99.1
CLEVELAND (September 27, 2011)  American Greetings Corporation (NYSE: AM) today announced its results for the second fiscal quarter ended August 26, 2011.
Second Quarter Results
For the second quarter of fiscal 2012, the Company reported total revenue of $368.8 million, pre-tax income of $25.0 million, and net income of $14.5 million or 35 cents per share (all per-share amounts assume dilution). Compared to the prior year, revenue increased approximately $26 million. Included within these results was a pre-tax benefit from the sale of certain minor characters in our intellectual property portfolio of $4.5 million (after-tax of approximately $2.8 million) or approximately 7 cents per share.
For the second quarter of fiscal 2011, the Company reported total revenue of $342.8 million, pre-tax income of $17.0 million, and net income of $8.5 million or 21 cents per share. During the quarter, the Company incurred pre-tax costs associated with the integrations of Papyrus and Recycled Paper Greetings of $5.2 million (after-tax of approximately $3.2 million) or approximately 8 cents per share.
Management Comments and Outlook
Chief Executive Officer Zev Weiss said, "I am very pleased with our innovative new products and revenue growth this quarter, which resulted in market share gains both domestically and internationally. As we look at the balance of this year, we are certainly more cautious than we were at the beginning of the year about the global economy and the effect it is having on the consumer. However, while this could create earnings volatility during the second half of the year, we remain steadfast in our investments to continue our product leadership and remain focused on our longer term goals."
Financing Activities
Under the Company's $75 million share repurchase program, during the second fiscal quarter the Company purchased approximately 0.5 million shares of its common stock for about $11.1 million. The share repurchases this second fiscal quarter are a continuation of a multi-year effort where the Company has reduced its diluted share count by about 50 percent over the past six-and-a-half years.
Conference Call on the Web
American Greetings will broadcast its conference call live on the Internet at 9:00 a.m. Eastern time today. The conference call will be accessible through the Investors section of the American Greetings Web site at . A replay of the call will be available on the site.

Item 4.02 Non-Reliance on Previously Issued Financial Statements or a Related Audit Report or Completed Interim Review.
On November 7, 2011, management of American Greetings Corporation (the "Company") and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company concluded that the Company's financial statements must be restated as described below to reflect the impact of an understatement of a deferred tax asset that occurred in fiscal 2004. In addition, management of the Company has concluded that this error arose from a material weakness related to the internal control over the accounting for income taxes that was not identified in the Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting as of February 28, 2011 included in Item 9A of the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2011. As a result, the Company's financial statements for the three years ended February 28, 2011, and the Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting as of February 28, 2011, and the related auditor's reports thereon, previously filed in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2011, should no longer be relied upon. Management and the Audit Committee have discussed these matters with Ernst & Young LLP, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm.
The Company records a deferred tax asset or liability when the treatment of an item on the tax return differs from the treatment of that item for financial reporting purposes, thus creating a temporary timing difference in the amount of tax expense reported on the Company's tax return compared to the amount of tax expense reported for financial reporting purposes. The Company identified the deferred tax asset understatement in connection with a review of calculations used in determining the tax basis of its inventory. During this review, it was discovered that the deferred tax asset related to this matter as reflected on the Company's consolidated statement of financial position did not appropriately reflect the difference between the basis of the Company's inventory used for financial reporting purposes and the basis of its inventory used for tax purposes. The amount of the understatement of the deferred tax asset was $14.8 million. The Company determined that the difference occurred as a result of an adjustment to the deferred tax asset in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, which resulted in the understatement of net income, total assets and total shareholders' equity by $14.8 million for the year ended February 29, 2004.
To correct the understatement of the deferred tax asset described above, the Company intends to amend its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2011, and its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for each of the fiscal quarters ended May 27, 2011 and August 26, 2011, to include restated financial information to reflect the adjustment above. The restatement is expected to change the following line items in the Company's financial statements and/or the selected financial data included in the applicable reports:
 
 
The Company has determined that the understatement of its deferred tax asset, together with the associated restatements, resulted from a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting related to the processes, procedures and controls surrounding the Company's accounting for income taxes, specifically related to the tax basis of the Company's inventory. In addition, solely as a result of the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting described above, the Company believes that its disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of February 28, 2011, May 27, 2011, or August 26, 2011. As a result, management believes that the restatement discussed herein will require the Company to issue a new Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting as of February 28, 2011 and will require the Company to revise its conclusions regarding the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2011, and each of its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended May 27, 2011 and August 26, 2011, due to this material weakness. The Company intends to file its new Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting and its restated financial statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission as soon as practicable.
 
In order to remediate this material weakness and further strengthen the overall controls surrounding the Company's accounting for income taxes, the Company has taken or will take the following steps to improve the overall processes and controls in its tax function:
 
 
 
The Company intends that its remediation efforts relating to this material weakness will be completed by the end of its fiscal year ending February 29, 2012.
The Company expects all amendments and restatements to the affected financial statements to be non-cash in nature.

The obligations of the several Underwriters hereunder shall be subject to termination in the discretion of the Representative, if (1) since the time of execution of this Agreement or the earlier respective dates as of which information is given in the Disclosure Package (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto) there has been any change or any development involving a prospective change in the business, properties, management, financial condition or results of operations of the Company and the Subsidiaries taken as a whole, the effect of which change or development is, in the judgment of the Representative, so material and adverse as to make it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering, sale or the delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Disclosure Package or (2) since the time of execution of this Agreement, there shall have occurred: (A) a suspension or material limitation in trading in securities generally on the NYSE; (B) a suspension or material limitation in trading in the Company's securities on the NYSE; (C) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities declared by either federal or New York State authorities or a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States; (D) an outbreak or escalation of hostilities or acts of terrorism involving the United States or a declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war; or (E) any other calamity or crisis (economic, political, financial or otherwise), if the effect of any such event specified in clause (D) or (E), in the judgment of the Representative, is so

9. .
Indemnity and Contribution
(a) The Company agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Underwriter, its partners, directors and officers, and any person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, the officers and directors of any of the foregoing persons and the successors and assigns of all of the foregoing persons, from and against any loss, damage, expense, liability or claim (including the reasonable cost of investigation) which, jointly or severally, any such Underwriter or any such person may incur under the Act, the Exchange Act, the common law or otherwise, insofar as such loss, damage, expense, liability or claim arises out of or is based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or in the Registration Statement as amended by any post-effective amendment thereof by the Company) or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, not misleading, or (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or the Disclosure Package, or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in each case except insofar as any such loss, damage, expense, liability or claim arises out of or is based upon, any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing by or on behalf of such Underwriter through you to the Company expressly for use therein.
(b) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Company, its directors and officers who signed the Registration Statement and any person who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and the successors and assigns of all of the foregoing persons,
 
to the same extent as the indemnity set forth in subsection (a) of this Section 9, from and against any loss, damage, expense, liability or claim (including the reasonable cost of investigation) which the Company or any such person may incur under the Act, the Exchange Act, the common law or otherwise, insofar as such loss, damage, expense, liability or claim arises out of, or is based upon, any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing by or on behalf of such Underwriter through you to the Company expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or in the Registration Statement as amended by any post-effective amendment thereof by the Company), the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or the Disclosure Package.
(c) If any action, suit or proceeding (each, a "") is brought against a person (an "") in respect of which indemnity may be sought against the Company or an Underwriter (as applicable, the "") pursuant to subsection (a) or (b), respectively, of this Section 9, such indemnified party shall promptly notify such indemnifying party in writing of the institution of such Proceeding and such indemnifying party shall assume the defense of such Proceeding, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party and payment of all fees and expenses; , , that the omission to so notify such indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability which such indemnifying party may have to any indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) of this Section 9, except to the extent such indemnifying party has been materially prejudiced by such failure; , , that the omission to so notify such indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability which such indemnifying party may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under subsection (a) or (b) of this Section 9. The indemnified party or parties shall have the right to employ its or their own counsel in any such case, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party or parties unless the employment of such counsel shall have been authorized in writing by the indemnifying party in connection with the defense of such Proceeding or the indemnifying party shall not have, within a reasonable period of time in light of the circumstances, employed counsel reasonably acceptable to such indemnified party or parties to defend such Proceeding or such indemnified party or parties shall have reasonably concluded that there may be defenses available to it or them which are different from, additional to or in conflict with those available to such indemnifying party (in which case such indemnifying party shall not have the right to direct the defense of such Proceeding on behalf of the indemnified party or parties), in any of which events such fees and expenses shall be borne by such indemnifying party and paid as incurred (it being understood, however, that such indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (in addition to any local counsel) in any one Proceeding or series of related Proceedings in the same jurisdiction representing the indemnified parties who are parties to such Proceeding). The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any Proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff such indemnifying party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the indemnified party or parties from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement. Notwithstanding the
Proceeding
indemnified party
indemnifying party
provided
however
provided
further
 
foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the second sentence of this Section 9(c), then the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any Proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 60 business days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have fully reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement and (iii) such indemnified party shall have given the indemnifying party at least 30 days' prior written notice of its intention to settle, unless such failure to reimburse the indemnified party is based on a dispute with a good faith basis as to either the obligation of the indemnifying party arising under this Section 9 to indemnify the indemnified party or the amount of such obligation and the indemnifying party shall have paid and reimbursed the indemnified party for all amounts not the subject of such good faith dispute and notified the indemnified party of such good faith dispute prior to the date of such settlement. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened Proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such Proceeding and does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault or culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of such indemnified party.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to an indemnified party under subsections (a) and (b) of this Section 9 or insufficient to hold an indemnified party harmless in respect of any losses, damages, expenses, liabilities or claims referred to therein, then each applicable indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, damages, expenses, liabilities or claims (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, damages, expenses, liabilities or claims, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total proceeds from the offering (net of underwriting discounts and commissions but before deducting expenses) received by the Company, and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, bear to the aggregate public offering price of the Securities. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, damages, expenses, liabilities and claims referred to in this subsection shall
 
be deemed to include any reasonable legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating, preparing to defend or defending any Proceeding.
(e) The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 9 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in subsection (d) above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 9, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by such Underwriter and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damage which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 9 are several in proportion to their respective underwriting commitments and not joint.
(f) The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Section 9 and the covenants, warranties and representations of the Company contained in this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, its partners, directors or officers or any person (including each partner, officer or director of such person) who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, or by or on behalf of the Company, its directors or officers who signed the Registration Statement or any person who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and shall survive any termination of this Agreement or the issuance and delivery of the Securities. The Company and the Underwriter agree promptly to notify each other of the commencement of any Proceeding against it and, in the case of the Company against any of the Company's officers or directors in connection with the issuance and sale of the Securities, or in connection with the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or the Disclosure Package.
10. .
Defaulting Underwriter
(a) If, on the Closing Date, any Underwriter defaults on its obligation to purchase the Securities that it has agreed to purchase hereunder, the non-defaulting Underwriters may in their discretion arrange for the purchase of such Securities by other persons satisfactory to the Company on the terms contained in this Agreement. If, within 36 hours after any such default by any Underwriter, the non-defaulting Underwriters do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of 36 hours within which to procure other persons satisfactory to the non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase such Securities on such terms. If other persons become obligated or agree to purchase the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter, either the non-defaulting Underwriters or the Company may postpone the Closing Date for up to five full business days in order to effect any changes that in the opinion of counsel for the Company or counsel for the Underwriters may be necessary in the
 
Registration Statement and the Prospectus or in any other document or arrangement, and the Company agrees to promptly prepare any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus that effects any such changes. As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" includes, for all purposes of this Agreement unless the context otherwise requires, any person not listed in hereto that, pursuant to this Section 10, purchases Securities that a defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase.
Schedule A
(b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities that remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Securities that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder plus such Underwriter's share (based on the principal amount of Securities that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made.
pro rata
(c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities that remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in paragraph (b) above, then this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of the non-defaulting Underwriters. Any termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10 shall be without liability on the part of the Company, except that the Company will continue to be liable for the payment of expenses as set forth in Section 5(n) hereof and except that the provisions of Section 9 hereof shall not terminate and shall remain in effect.
Nothing contained herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter of any liability it may have to the Company or any non-defaulting Underwriter for damages caused by its default.
11. . The statements set forth in the tenth paragraph under the caption "Underwriting" in the Prospectus Supplement, only insofar as such statements relate to over-allotment and stabilization activities that may be undertaken by the Underwriters, constitute the only information furnished by or on behalf of the Underwriters, as such information is referred to in Sections 3 and 9 hereof.

However, without the consent of each Holder affected, an amendment, supplement or waiver, including a waiver pursuant to Section 6.04 hereof, may not:
(i) reduce, or change the maturity of, the principal of any Note (it being understood that any amendment or waiver of Section 4.12 hereof requiring the application of Net Available Proceeds to make a Net Proceeds Offer shall not constitute a change of the maturity of the principal of any Note under this clause (i));
 
(ii) reduce the rate of or extend the time for payment of interest on any Note;
(iii) reduce any premium payable upon redemption of the Notes or change the date on which any Notes are subject to redemption (other than provisions relating to the purchase of Notes described under Sections 4.12 and 4.15 hereof, except that if a Change of Control has occurred, no amendment or other modification of the obligation of the Issuer to make a Change of Control Offer relating to such Change of Control shall be made without the consent of each Holder of the Notes affected);

(x) make any change in these amendment and waiver provisions.
The consent of the Holders of the Notes is not necessary under this Supplemental Indenture to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment or waiver. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment or waiver.
After an amendment under this Supplemental Indenture becomes effective, the Issuer is required to deliver to Holders of the Notes a notice briefly describing such amendment. However, the failure to give such notice to all Holders of the Notes, or any defect therein, will not impair or affect the validity of the amendment.

Until an amendment, waiver or supplement becomes effective, a consent to it by a Holder is a continuing consent by the Holder and every subsequent Holder of a Note or portion of a Note that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder's Note, even if notation of the consent is not made on any Note. Subject to the following paragraph, any such Holder or subsequent Holder may revoke the consent as to such Holder's Note or portion of such Note by notice to the Trustee or the Issuer received before the date on which the Trustee receives an Officer's Certificate certifying that the Holders of the requisite principal amount of Notes have consented (and not theretofore revoked such consent) to the amendment, supplement or waiver.
The Issuer may, but shall not be obligated to, fix a record date for the purpose of determining the Holders entitled to consent to any amendment, supplement or waiver. If a record date is fixed, then notwithstanding the last sentence of the immediately preceding paragraph, those Persons who were Holders at such record date (or their duly designated proxies), and only those Persons, shall be entitled to revoke any consent previously given, whether or not such Persons continue to be Holders after such record date. No such consent shall be valid or effective for more than 90 days after such record date.
After an amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective, it shall bind every Holder, unless it makes a change described in any of clauses (i) through (x) of Section 8.02 hereof, in which case, the amendment, supplement or waiver shall bind only each Holder who has consented to it and every subsequent Holder of a Note or portion of a Note that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder's Note; that any such waiver shall not impair or affect the right of any Holder to receive payment of principal of and interest on a Note, on or after the respective due dates expressed in such Note, or to bring suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates without the consent of such Holder.

Notation on or Exchange of Notes
If an amendment, supplement, or waiver changes the terms of a Note, the Trustee may request the Holder to deliver it to the Trustee.

Alternatively, if the Issuer or the Trustee so determine, in exchange for the Note the Issuer shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate a new Note that reflects the changed terms.

On November 30, 2011, the Company also entered into a first supplemental indenture (the "2016 Notes Supplemental Indenture"), by and between the Company and the Trustee, to the indenture, dated as of February 24, 2009 (the "2016 Notes Indenture"), by and between the Company and the Trustee, under which the Company issued its 7.375% Notes due 2016 (the "2016 Notes" and, collectively with the 2016 Senior Notes, the "Notes" and each of the 2016 Senior Notes and the 2016 Notes a "Series" of Notes).

The amendments to the Indentures contained in the Supplemental Indentures were effective as of November 30, 2011. The amendments became operative when the Company accepted for purchase validly tendered 2016 Senior Notes and 2016 Notes representing a majority of the outstanding 2016 Senior Notes and 2016 Notes, respectively, pursuant to the Company's tender offers for all outstanding 2016 Senior Notes and 2016 Notes.

The foregoing description of the Supplemental Indentures does not purport to be complete, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of each of the 2016 Senior Notes Supplemental Indenture and the 2016 Notes Supplemental Indenture, copies of which are filed as Exhibits 4.1 and 4.2, respectively, to this current Report on Form 8-K and are incorporated herein by reference.

(e) Directors and executive officers of American Greetings Corporation (the "Corporation"), including the named executive officers, are eligible to defer eligible compensation into the American Greetings Corporation Outside Directors Deferred Compensation Plan and the American Greetings Corporation Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (collectively, the "Deferred Compensation Plans"), respectively. In an effort to eliminate compensation programs offered by the Corporation that are not widely utilized, yet are administratively burdensome to operate, on December 8, 2011, the Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Corporation's Board of Directors determined to freeze the Deferred Compensation Plans. Accordingly, effective immediately, participants will no longer be permitted to make new deferral elections under the Deferred Compensation Plans. Deferral elections made prior to December 8, 2011, however, will continue to be honored, and amounts previously deferred will remain deferred in accordance with existing deferral elections and may be re-deferred in accordance with the Deferred Compensation Plans. In addition, executive officers will continue to be eligible to receive amounts, if any, that are contributed by the Corporation as additional matching and profit sharing contributions under the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan's maximizer and restoration benefits based on the Corporation's performance in the fiscal year ended February 29, 2012, but not for future years.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1
CLEVELAND (December 22, 2011)  American Greetings Corporation (NYSE: AM) today announced its results for the third fiscal quarter ended November 25, 2011.
Third Quarter Results
For the third quarter of fiscal 2012, the Company reported total revenue of $463.6 million, pre-tax income of $29.7 million, and net income of $20.2 million or 50 cents per share (all per-share amounts assume dilution). Compared to the prior year, revenue increased approximately $33.5 million, or about eight percent.
Last year, for the third quarter of fiscal 2011, the Company reported total revenue of $430.1 million, pre-tax income of $51.5 million, and net income of $32.2 million or 78 cents per share.
Management Comments
Chief Executive Officer Zev Weiss said, "I am delighted with our revenue growth this quarter in both our domestic and international businesses. We believe that our commitment to our product leadership strategy continues to be successful, our investments are helping to drive revenue, and we feel good about our overall momentum in the marketplace. With our strong revenue growth this quarter, we feel more confident regarding our ability to hit or surpass the full year revenue growth target of three percent."
Outlook
Previously, for fiscal year 2012, the Company projected revenue to grow approximately 3 percent compared to fiscal year 2011. The Company projected cash flow from operating activities to fall within the range of $125 million to $145 million and capital expenditures between $45 million and $50 million, resulting in cash flow from operating activities minus capital expenditures of $80 million to $100 million.
As a result of the additional expenses and investments to support the Company's product leadership strategy and its expanded customer relationships, as well as the information systems refresh project, the Company now expects fiscal year 2012 cash flow from operating activities, less capital expenditures, to be lower than previously estimated. The Company estimates cash flow from operating activities to be around $90 million to $110 million and capital expenditures to be around $55 million to $70 million, resulting in cash flow from operating activities minus capital expenditures of roughly $35 million to $50 million. As part of that estimate, and in order to support revenue growth, the Company expects a meaningful use of cash for balance sheet items such as working capital.
Financing Activities
Under the Company's $75 million share repurchase program, during the third fiscal quarter the Company purchased approximately 2.0 million shares of its common stock for about $34.5 million. These repurchases complete the sixth share repurchase program announced in January, 2009. The
share repurchases this third fiscal quarter are a continuation of a multi-year effort under which the Company has reduced its diluted share count by about 50 percent over the past seven years.

Exhibit 99.1
CLEVELAND (April 26, 2012)  American Greetings Corporation (NYSE: AM) today announced its financial results for both the fiscal fourth quarter and year ended February 29, 2012.
Management Comments
Chief Executive Officer Zev Weiss said, "I am pleased with our overall performance. We achieved a 6% revenue increase for the year as we remained focused on our product leadership strategy and many of our customers performed better than our expectations."
Fourth Quarter Results
For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, the Company reported total revenue of $456.2 million, a pre-tax loss of $7.6 million, and a net loss of $10.1 million or 27 cents per share (all per-share amounts assume dilution). Compared to the prior year, revenue increased approximately $32 million, or about 7%. The increase includes approximately $18 million of organic growth, approximately $13 million of revenue resulting from the Watermark acquisition in the U.K., and a benefit from foreign exchange of about $1 million. During the quarter, the Company recognized non-cash pre-tax goodwill impairment charges, a portion of which were not tax deductible, of $27.2 million (after-tax $19.0 million, reducing earnings per share by about 50 cents). There were pre-tax goodwill impairment charges of $21.3 million recorded within the North American Social Expression Products segment and $5.9 million recorded within the International Social Expression Products segment. Also incurred within the quarter were costs associated with scan-based trading conversions of $2.7 million (after-tax $1.7 million, reducing earnings per share by about 4 cents), severance costs of $4.1 million (after-tax $2.5 million, reducing earnings per share by about 7 cents) and costs associated with the Company's debt refinancing of $30.8 million (after-tax $18.8 million, reducing earnings per share by about 50 cents).
For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, the Company reported total revenue of $424.6 million, pre-tax income of $36.4 million, and net income of $15.5 million or 37 cents per share. The Company recorded costs of $5.5 million (after-tax $3.4 million, reducing earnings per share by about 8 cents) as a result of scan-based trading conversions. The Company also recorded severance costs of $4.0 million (after-tax $2.4 million, reducing earnings per share by about 6 cents) and costs associated with the integrations of Papyrus and Recycled Paper Greetings of $0.7 million (after-tax $0.4 million, reducing earnings per share by about 1 cent). These costs were partially offset by a $2.8 million gain associated with a building sale (after-tax $1.7 million, increasing earnings per share by about 4 cents) and $1.3 million of dividend income (after-tax $0.8 million, increasing earnings per share by about 2 cents). Both the building sale and the dividend were reported as other non-operating income. The Company also effectively settled ten years of domestic tax audits which increased income tax expense by $6.9 million (reducing earnings per share by about 17 cents).
Full Year Results
For the full year fiscal 2012, the Company reported total revenue of $1,695.1 million, pre-tax income of $97.8 million, and net income of $57.2 million or $1.42 per share. Compared to the prior year, revenues were approximately $97 million higher, or about 6%. The increase includes approximately $43 million of revenue resulting from the Watermark acquisition, organic growth of approximately $32 million, and a benefit from foreign exchange of about $22 million. The Company recognized non-cash pre-tax goodwill impairment charges of $27.2 million (after-tax $19.0 million, reducing earnings per share by 47 cents). Scan-based trading conversions during the year had a pre-tax income impact of $5.8 million (after-tax $3.5 million, reducing earnings per share by about 9 cents). The Company incurred roll-out costs associated with expanded distribution of $12.3 million (after-tax $7.5 million, reducing earnings per share by about 19 cents).The Company also recorded severance costs of $5.2 million (after-tax $3.2 million, reducing earnings per share by about 8 cents) and costs associated with its debt refinancing of $30.8 million (after-tax $18.8 million, reducing earnings per share by about 47 cents). These costs were partially offset by a pre-tax benefit from the sale of certain minor characters in our intellectual property portfolio of $4.5 million (after-tax $2.8 million, increasing earnings per share by about 7 cents per share).
For the full year fiscal 2011, the Company reported total revenue of $1,597.9 million, pre-tax income of $156.0 million, and net income of $87.0 million or $2.11 per share. The Company recorded pre-tax costs of $5.7 million (after-tax $3.5 million, reducing earnings per share by about 9 cents) as a result of scan-based trading conversions. The Company also recorded $10.3 million of costs associated with the integrations of Papyrus and Recycled Paper Greetings (after-tax $6.3 million, reducing earnings per share by about 15 cents) and severance costs of $6.9 million (after-tax $4.2 million, reducing earnings per share by about 10 cents). These costs were partially offset by a $3.8 million gain associated with the sales of two buildings (after-tax $2.3 million, increasing earnings per share by about 5 cents) and $1.3 million of dividend income (after-tax $0.8 million, increasing earnings per share by about 2 cents). During fiscal 2011, the Company also effectively settled ten years of domestic tax audits which increased income tax expense by $6.9 million (reducing earnings per share by about 17 cents).
Financing Activities
Under the Company's previously authorized $75 million share repurchase program, the Company purchased approximately 1.9 million shares of its common stock for about $28.0 million during the fourth fiscal quarter.
Outlook
For fiscal 2013, the Company expects its revenues to be flat compared to fiscal 2012. The Company expects cash flow from operating activities of approximately $145 million to $165 million and capital expenditures between $85 million and $110 million, resulting in cash flow from operating activities minus capital expenditures of approximately $45 million to $65 million. The increased level of capital expenditures compared to prior year is expected to be driven primarily by incremental investments in our information technology systems refresh project as well as by some capital investments associated with the new world headquarters project. The cash flow estimate includes a modest benefit from the combination of working capital, deferred costs, and taxes.

Non-GAAP Measures
Certain after-tax and liquidity amounts included in the earnings release may be considered non-GAAP measures under the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation G. The after-tax amounts were calculated based on the Company's statutory tax rate of approximately 38.9% for U.S. based items and the appropriate rates for international jurisdictions.

    On May 9, 2012, American Greetings Corporation (the "Company") issued a press release announcing that it has acquired all of the outstanding senior secured debt of Clinton Cards PLC for approximately $56 million (approximately 35 million) through a UK subsidiary. The press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
    (d) Exhibits.
 
    Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
Date:    May 9, 2012
 

Exhibit 99.1
CLEVELAND (May 9, 2012)  American Greetings Corporation (NYSE: AM) today announced that it has acquired all of the outstanding senior secured debt of Clinton Cards PLC ("Clinton Cards") for approximately $56 million (approximately 35 million) through a subsidiary in the United Kingdom ("UK").
Clinton Cards, one of the largest specialty retailers of greetings cards in the UK, has approximately 750 stores and annual revenues of approximately $600 million (approximately 364 million excluding VAT) across its two primary retail brands, Clinton Cards and Birthdays. The legacy Clinton Cards business has been an important customer to American Greetings' international business for approximately forty years, and is one of American Greetings' largest customers.
Separate from the recently acquired senior secured debt, American Greetings has approximately $25 million of unsecured exposure to Clinton Cards, a majority of which is now in default. There have been repeated discussions with Clinton Cards since September 2011 concerning issues with our on-going supplies to it. Despite this, Clinton Cards has defaulted in respect of numerous payment obligations under our supply arrangements and we have recently stopped shipping product to Clinton Cards. In light of its financial distress, we believe that other suppliers have also recently stopped shipping product to Clinton Cards. As a result of its failure to pay amounts owed to us, together with the current state of its business, we expect that a portion of our unsecured exposure from Clinton Cards may be impaired.
After extensive discussions with Clinton Cards' management, board, and financial and legal advisors, on May 9, 2012, Clinton Cards invited American Greetings to place its business into administration, a procedure broadly similar to Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the United States, which gives the company (under the control of its administrators) an opportunity to restructure its business.
Chief Executive Officer Zev Weiss said, "We would like to see Clinton Cards continue as an important retailer in the specialty channel of distribution in the UK greeting card market. We expect that our recent investment will allow us to work closely with the administrators while they consider Clinton Card's restructuring options. As secured lender, we are better positioned to assist in identifying and obtaining the best possible solution for Clinton Cards, where we may ultimately participate in the ownership of the business or may continue as a supplier to any buyer of the business. We believe that properly managed, and with the appropriate capital structure, Clinton Cards could be both an important and profitable retailer in the specialty channel of distribution over the long term."

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On June 6, 2012, UK Greetings Limited ("UKG") and Lakeshore Lending Limited ("Lakeshore"), each of which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of American Greetings Corporation ("American Greetings"), entered into an Agreement (the "Agreement") with (a) Clinton Cards PLC and its subsidiaries, Birthdays Retail Limited, Clinton Cards (Essex) Limited, Papertree Limited, Selectacard Limited, Strand Cards Limited, and The Greetings Store Group Limited (collectively, the "Sellers"), and (b) Peter Mark Saville, Simon Vincent Freakley and Anne Clare O'Keefe, each of which is a partner of Zolfo Cooper LLP (collectively, the "Joint Administrators"), in their respective capacities as joint administrators of each of the Sellers (acting as agent of each of the Sellers), for the purchase by Lakeshore (the "Acquisition") of certain assets and the related business of the Sellers.
The Sellers, which operate a specialty greeting card retail chain in the United Kingdom, were placed into administration on May 9, 2012 after Lakeshore acquired all of the outstanding senior secured debt of Clinton Cards PLC for approximately 35 million. "Administration" is a procedure broadly similar to Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the United States, which gives a debtor (under the control of its administrators) an opportunity to restructure its business. The legacy business of the Sellers had been an important customer to American Greetings' international business for approximately forty years, and was one of American Greetings' largest customers.
Under the terms of the Agreement, it is expected that Lakeshore will acquire from the Sellers approximately 400 stores, together with related inventory and overhead, as well as the Clinton Cards and related brands. The final number of stores acquired will depend on negotiations with landlords at each respective location, who must generally consent to the assignment of the leases for such stores on terms that are acceptable to Lakeshore. If Lakeshore cannot negotiate leases assignments that are acceptable, or if the applicable landlord withholds consent to the assignment of its store lease, then Lakeshore may close the stores and the Sellers will be responsible for any further obligations under the store lease. The stores and assets not acquired by Lakeshore remain part of the administration process under the direction of the Joint Administrators. It is anticipated that the remaining assets will be liquidated and proceeds will be used to repay the Sellers' creditors, including Lakeshore. The Joint Administrators previously announced that they identified approximately 350 stores to be closed and were seeking concessions from certain creditors of the Sellers, particularly its landlords.
The Joint Administrators conducted an auction of the remaining assets of the business of the Sellers that they believed constituted a viable ongoing business. Lakeshore bid 23 million for certain of these remaining assets. The bid took the form of a "credit bid" that uses a portion of the outstanding senior secured debt owed to Lakeshore by Clinton Cards to pay the purchase price for the assets. Lakeshore will seek to recover the approximately 12 million remaining senior secured debt claim held by it through the liquidation process. However, it is possible that there may not be sufficient proceeds, net of administration costs, to cover the entire remaining investment. The liquidation process, and the negotiations with landlords for stores included in the Acquisition, is expected to take approximately six to twelve months.
The foregoing description of the Agreement does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the full text of the Agreement, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
Item 2.01. Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
The disclosure under Item 1.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K relating to the Acquisition is incorporated herein by reference.

1.2 The Business, comprising the Business Assets, shall be sold as a going concern with effect from Closing, on and subject to the terms of this Agreement and the Purchaser shall carry on and continue the Business as a going concern in succession to the Sellers.

4.3 The Purchaser expressly acknowledges and agrees that if it shall be found that the relevant Seller does not have title or unencumbered title to any or all of its Business Assets or its Business Contracts or if the relevant Seller is unable to transfer or pass the benefit of any Business Assets or Business Contracts, or if an asset is determined under clause 10.4 to be a Third Party Asset, then the relevant Seller or the Joint Administrators may withdraw it and treat it as an Excluded Asset and the Purchaser shall not be entitled to any damages nor shall it be a ground for rescinding, avoiding or varying any or all of the provisions of this Agreement or for the recovery of any or all of the Consideration paid by the Purchaser.
4.4 Save in respect of the transfer of the Business Properties (which shall be governed by the provisions of Schedule 9 ()), and any Business Contract transferred under this Agreement (which shall be governed by the provisions of Schedule 6 ()) the Purchaser accepts and agrees that it shall be its responsibility and at its expense to apply for and obtain all necessary or appropriate licences, consents, permits and rights to use or have the benefit of the Business Assets or Business Contracts and operate the Business, including any licences that may be required in relation to software that have terminated prior to the Business Closing Date and/or subsequent to the Sellers being placed into administration.

shall be exercisable by, any subsequent administrator, liquidator or other insolvency officeholder appointed from time to time in respect of any Seller (each a ) and so that, as regards any Subsequent Appointee, the relevant clause shall apply so that references to the Joint Administrators shall be treated as references to such Subsequent Appointee.
Subsequent Appointee
mutatis mutandis
5.3 The provisions of this clause 5 shall continue for the benefit of the Joint Administrators or any Subsequent Appointee, notwithstanding the fact that the Joint Administrators or any Subsequent Appointee may cease to act as officeholder in respect of a Seller.

the
Guarantee Termination Date.
6.3 On the Guarantee Termination Date, any and all future obligations of the Guarantor under this Agreement shall terminate with immediate effect (save that any and all accrued rights of the Sellers and the Joint Administrators under the Guarantee shall remain in full force and effect, provided always that the relevant Seller and/or the Joint Administrators have made a first written demand under clause 6.1 no later than one month after the Guarantee Termination Date).

6.6 The Guarantor acknowledges that, in entering into this Agreement and accepting the Guarantee, the Sellers and the Joint Administrators have relied on the Guarantor's representations that it has taken all necessary corporate action to authorise the execution, delivery and performance of the Guarantee.

such Business Contract shall remain an Excluded Contract. Subject to clause 8.3 and the provisions of Schedule 6 (), the benefit of each such Designated Business Contract shall become a Business Asset under this Agreement; provided, however, nothing herein shall operate to cause the Purchaser to assume any Liability under any such Business Contract arising or otherwise relating to any act or omission occurring prior to the date on which the Purchaser has provided notice to the Sellers of its election to assume such Business Contract.
Business Contracts
8.2 Nothing in this Agreement shall operate to transfer to the Purchaser or require the Purchaser to perform any Liability of a Seller unless that Liability transfers by operation of law (and then only to that extent) or has been expressly assumed or agreed to be performed by the Purchaser under this Agreement.

Business Contracts
Third Party Consent
8.4 The Purchaser hereby accepts the risk that some or all of the Designated Business Contracts may be, or may already have been, breached or terminated and any other contracting party may refuse to continue with the performance of its contractual obligations on the same terms or at all, or may refuse to continue such performance unless the Purchaser is willing to remedy such breach, and further that any such other contracting party may exercise or purport to exercise rights of termination or set-off or counterclaims against the Purchaser.
8.5 Save for the Retention of Title Assets, which are dealt with pursuant to clause 10 () below, if either a Seller or the Purchaser becomes aware that any Excluded Assets have been transferred to the Purchaser at Closing, by delivery or otherwise, such party shall notify the other party as soon as practicable and the relevant Seller and the Purchaser shall perform all acts and things and shall execute and deliver all such documents as may be reasonably necessary to transfer, for nil consideration, such Excluded Assets back to the relevant Seller as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter.
Third Party Assets and Retention of Title

Pre-Business Closing Period
Post-Business Closing Period
9.3 Any part of the Apportionable Liabilities which represents VAT shall be borne by the party for which such VAT is input tax (as that term is defined in section 24 VATA) or which would be input tax if that party were not a member of a group for the purposes of sections 43 to 43C VATA.
9.4 Following the Business Closing Date, the Sellers shall provide to the Purchaser their calculation of the apportionments of the Apportionable Liabilities setting out the amounts in respect of the Apportionable Liabilities attributable to the Pre-Business Closing Period and the Post-Business Closing Period, respectively.

If the Purchaser does not provide any such confirmation or notification within that five Business Days' period, the Sellers' calculation provided under clause 9.4 shall be deemed to be agreed.
9.6 If the Purchaser notifies the Sellers of any areas of disagreement pursuant to clause 9.5(b), the Purchaser and the Sellers shall use their reasonable endeavours to agree the calculation of the apportionment of the relevant Apportionable Liabilities as soon as possible and within ten Business Days following the date of such notification.
9.7 If the Sellers and the Purchaser are unable to agree the calculation of the apportionments of any Apportionable Liabilities within that ten Business Days' period, the apportionments of those Apportionable Liabilities shall be ascertained and certified by an independent firm of chartered accountants appointed by the Sellers and the Purchaser or, if the Sellers and the Purchaser have not agreed on the identity of the independent accountants within 5 Business Days of the proposal of such firm by the Sellers to the Purchaser (or vice versa) appointed on the first application of the Sellers or the Purchaser by the President of the Royal Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. The independent firm shall act as experts and not arbitrators and their decision shall be binding on the parties whether or not they have signed the terms of appointment. Costs of the experts shall be borne as to 50 per cent. by the Purchaser and 50 per cent. by the Sellers.
9.8 Within seven Business Days following agreement or determination of the apportionment of the Apportionable Liabilities in accordance with this clause 9, the net amount payable in respect of the Apportionable Liabilities shall be paid by the net debtor to the relevant other party.
9.9 One or more Sellers (acting by the Joint Administrators) has in the period from 9 May 2012 up to and including the Business Closing Date ordered goods to be sold in the usual trading of the Business. To the extent those goods have not been delivered to the relevant
 
Seller or if they have been delivered, are in the possession of the Seller as at Business Closing, the relevant Sellers shall notify the Purchaser within 5 Business Days after the Business Closing Date of the goods in question and their invoice value. The Purchaser may elect to allow any of the goods to be collected by or returned to the relevant supplier within 5 Business Days after receiving such notification (or after delivery, if later) and shall notify the relevant Sellers of the goods which are subject to its election. To the extent that goods are not (i) covered by the Purchaser's election or (ii) collected by or returned to the relevant supplier and such collection or return has been fully and finally accepted by the supplier within the time period specified above or within 5 Business Days after their delivery, if later, the Purchaser shall purchase the goods from the relevant Seller and the Seller shall deliver to the Purchaser a valid VAT invoice for the goods in question for an amount equal to the value of the relevant goods invoiced by the relevant supplier to the relevant Seller and the Purchaser shall pay the invoice to the relevant Seller within 5 Business Days (in each case including amounts in respect of VAT). The liability of the Purchaser under this clause 9.9 shall not exceed 2.1 million.
9.10 Within ten Business Days following the Business Closing Date, and within each subsequent ten Business Days period, the Purchaser shall provide to the Sellers its calculation of the amount of any receipts from the trading of the Business by the Purchaser, which the Sellers have received or retained and which are attributable to the Post-Business Closing Period. The provisions set out in clauses 9.5 to 9.7 shall apply to such calculation (with references to Apportionable Liabilities being read as references to such receipts, and references to the Sellers being read as references to the Purchaser (and vice versa), accordingly).
9.11 If any Seller becomes aware that it has retained a Business Asset it shall notify the Purchaser of that fact as soon as reasonably practicable and make that Business Asset available for collection by the Purchaser on reasonable notice and at all reasonable times.
9.12 Within seven Business Days following each such agreement or determination of the amount of receipts from the trading of the Business by the Purchaser, which are attributable to the Post-Business Closing Period, in accordance with this clause 9, the Sellers shall pay such receipts to the Purchaser.
9.13 The Purchaser shall indemnify and keep fully and effectively indemnified the Sellers and the Joint Administrators against any and all Costs, Losses and Liabilities of whatsoever nature and howsoever arising directly or indirectly as a result of any breach by the Purchaser of its obligations under clause 9.9.
10.1 The Purchaser acknowledges that the property which it takes possession of pursuant to the terms of this Agreement may include Third Party Assets. The Purchaser acknowledges that it has no title to or right of possession or use of any of the Third Party Assets at the Business Closing Date and that the sole risk of this is the Purchaser's and its alone, and the Purchaser acknowledges that the Consideration reflects this risk.
10.2 The Purchaser acknowledges that, unless otherwise agreed, at Business Closing the Sellers shall leave the Third Party Assets at the Business Properties on the Business Closing Date. The Purchaser shall, in respect of assets known by it to be Third Party Assets:
 
 
 
10.3 Any relevant Seller and the Purchaser shall notify the other in writing as soon as practicable after it receives written or electronic notification from a third party that the Purchaser has taken possession of Third Party Assets.
10.4 Where a third party asserts that any asset in respect of which the Purchaser took possession pursuant to the terms of this Agreement is owned by that third party:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
10.5 The Purchaser shall, for the six month period following the Business Closing Date (or such shorter period as the Sellers may agree in writing, or such longer period as the Purchaser or any Seller may reasonably request) on a weekly basis supply to the Sellers and the Joint Administrators information regarding the sale of Retention of Title Assets (and assets in respect of which retention of title is being asserted), describing on a supplier-by-supplier basis the total number of sales made in that period.
10.6 The Purchaser shall, where a Seller or the Purchaser is requested after the Business Closing Date by the owner(s) of any Third Party Assets to return such assets, make those Third Party Assets available for collection by the owner(s) of those Third Party Assets, or to the relevant Seller, as that Seller may decide, save to the extent agreed otherwise pursuant to any agreement or settlement reached with that owner in accordance with this clause 10.
10.7 The Purchaser shall indemnify and keep fully and effectively indemnified the Sellers and the Joint Administrators against any and all Costs (including any amount to be paid pursuant to any agreement or settlement contemplated by clause 10.4), Losses and Liabilities of whatsoever nature and howsoever arising directly or indirectly:
 
 
 
11.1 The provisions of Schedule 9 () shall apply in respect of the Business Properties.
Business Properties
11.2 For the avoidance of doubt, if the Purchaser does not obtain all necessary consents for any assignment or transfer (as applicable) of any Business Property or interest in it or agree the amendment of any terms in the manner sought by it or for any other reason does not acquire any Business Property, the Purchaser shall not be entitled to any reduction or repayment of the whole or any part of the Consideration nor to any claim for any Costs, Losses or Liabilities.
 
12.1 The Purchaser undertakes to notify forthwith the Office of the Information Commissioner (to the extent that any personal data is received from any Seller and the Purchaser has not already so notified or is covered by an earlier registration) and to ensure such notification complies with the necessary notification requirements relating to such personal data.
12.2 The Purchaser acknowledges its duty to process any personal data it receives from the Sellers in accordance with applicable data protection legislation.
12.3 The Purchaser shall indemnify and keep fully and effectively indemnified the Sellers and the Joint Administrators against any and all Costs, Losses and Liabilities of whatsoever nature and howsoever arising that any or all of the Sellers or the Joint Administrators may incur directly or indirectly as a result of a breach by the Purchaser of the Data Protection Act 1998 which causes the transfer of the Customer List to the Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement to be held to be unfair for the purposes of the first principle in Schedule 1 to the Data Protection Act 1998.
13.1 The parties acknowledge and agree that the sale of the Business Assets from the Sellers to the Purchaser is a "relevant transfer" within the meaning of the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006 () and that accordingly the contracts of employment of the Employees shall have effect on and following the Business Closing Date as if originally made by and between the Employees and the Purchaser.
TUPE
13.2 If, notwithstanding the provisions of TUPE, the contract of employment of any Employee is found or alleged not to have effect on and following the Business Closing Date as if originally made between that Employee and the Purchaser as a consequence of the sale of the Business Assets under this Agreement (other than by virtue of Regulation 4(7) of TUPE), the Purchaser agrees that:
 
 
13.3 Upon that offer being accepted or rejected (or, if earlier, after the expiry of 5 Business Days from the date the offer is made in accordance with clause 13.2 above, if no response is received from the Employee), the relevant Seller employer shall forthwith terminate the employment of the Employee concerned and the Purchaser shall indemnify and keep fully and effectively indemnified the relevant Seller employer and the Joint Administrators against any and all Costs, Losses and Liabilities of whatsoever nature and howsoever arising directly or indirectly out of any such termination.
 
13.4 The Purchaser agrees that it will offer those Employees working in Jersey a contract of employment to take effect with immediate effect on the Business Closing Date on the same terms and conditions of employment as he or she was employed on immediately prior to the Business Closing Date.
13.5 Upon that offer being accepted or rejected (or, if earlier, after the expiry of 5 Business Days from the date the offer is made in accordance with clause 13.4 above, if no response is received from the Employee), the relevant Seller employer shall forthwith terminate the employment of the Employee concerned and the Purchaser shall indemnify and keep fully and effectively indemnified the relevant Seller employer and the Joint Administrators against any and all Costs, Losses and Liabilities of whatsoever nature and howsoever arising directly or indirectly out of any such termination.
13.6 The Purchaser shall indemnify and keep fully and effectively indemnified the Sellers and the Joint Administrators against any and all Costs, Losses and Liabilities of whatsoever nature and howsoever arising directly or indirectly:
 
 
 
 
 
 
13.7 The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that in the circumstances it is not practicable for the Sellers to comply with their obligations under Regulation 11 of TUPE () (as applicable) and the Purchaser accordingly undertakes and agrees that it will not present a complaint pursuant to Regulation 12 of TUPE alleging non-compliance by the relevant Seller or the Joint Administrators of their obligations under Regulation 12 of TUPE. If the Purchaser presents such complaint in breach of its undertaking in this clause 13.7, the Purchaser shall indemnify and keep fully and effectively indemnified the Sellers and the Joint Administrators against any and all Costs, Losses and Liabilities of whatsoever nature and howsoever arising incurred by any Seller or the Joint Administrators.
Employee Liability Information
 
13.8 The Purchaser shall indemnify and keep fully and effectively indemnified the Sellers and the Joint Administrators against any and all Costs, Losses and Liabilities of whatsoever nature and howsoever arising directly or indirectly out of or in connection with any failure by any Seller or the Joint Administrators to inform and consult with the Employees or their employee representatives in breach of Regulation 13 of TUPE (Information and Consultation) or any matter connected with such obligation to inform and consult. The Purchaser shall further indemnify and keep fully and effectively indemnified the Sellers and the Joint Administrators against any and all Costs, Losses and Liabilities of whatsoever nature and howsoever arising directly or indirectly out of or in connection with any failure by the Purchaser to comply with its obligations under Regulation 13 of TUPE. Each Seller agrees to inform the Purchaser as soon as reasonably practicable after it becomes aware of any claim against it or against any Seller or the Joint Administrators for a failure to inform and consult and to permit the Purchaser to have conduct and control of the dispute, defence or compromise of any such claim.
14.1 The Sellers and the Purchaser intend that the sale and purchase of the Business and the Business Assets hereunder shall be treated, for VAT purposes, as neither a supply of goods nor a supply of services pursuant to the provisions of section 49 VATA and Article 5 () of the Value Added Tax (Special Provisions) Order 1995 (sc 1995/1268) and the parties agree to use reasonable endeavours to ensure that it is so treated.
Article 5
14.2 The Sellers and the Purchaser do not intend to make a joint election to HM Revenue & Customs under regulation 6(1)(d) of the Value Added Tax Regulations 1995 (SI 1995/2518) for the Purchaser to be registered for VAT under any Seller's VAT registration number.
14.3 The Purchaser warrants to the Sellers and the Joint Administrators:

14.5 In relation to the Business Properties, the Purchaser hereby notifies the Sellers that paragraph (2B) of Article 5 does not apply to the Purchaser, and the Purchaser undertakes promptly to notify the Sellers in writing if Paragraph (2B) of Article 5 becomes applicable to the Purchaser at any time on or before Business Closing.
14.6 If any relevant tax authority determines that VAT is chargeable in respect of the transfer of all or any part of the Business Assets pursuant to or as contemplated by this Agreement (which for the purposes of this clause includes VAT chargeable in respect of the transfer of any of the Business Assets pursuant to or as contemplated by this Agreement), the Purchaser shall, in addition to the Consideration, pay to the Sellers on Business Closing or, if later, two Business Days after receipt of notice from any Seller of that determination (and against delivery of one or more valid VAT invoices) the amount of any VAT which is chargeable in respect of the transfer of the Business Assets or the relevant part of them, and shall indemnify the Sellers and the Joint Administrators and keep the Sellers and Joint Administrators fully and effectively indemnified against any related interest or penalties assessed by the relevant tax authority on any Seller or the Joint Administrators.
14.7 If any Seller reasonably believes the Purchaser to be in breach of clause 14.3, 14.4 or 14.5, the Sellers shall be entitled to treat the transfer of the Business Assets for all purposes as if it did not fall within Article 5 and the Purchaser shall forthwith on receipt of an appropriate VAT invoice pay to the relevant Seller the amount of VAT shown thereon together with any interest and penalties for late payment of the same. Such VAT shall be refunded by the relevant Seller to the Purchaser if and to the extent that HM Revenue & Customs confirm that VAT is not chargeable PROVIDED THAT if the relevant Seller has already accounted for such VAT to HM Revenue & Customs, no amount shall be refunded under this clause 14.7 unless and except to the extent that the relevant Seller has received effective repayment or credit in respect of such VAT.
14.8 The Sellers shall not, and shall procure that their agents or employees shall not, seek a ruling from HM Revenue & Customs (whether formal or informal) as to whether the sale and purchase of the Business Assets under this Agreement falls within Article 5 unless such request for ruling is in writing and has first been submitted in draft to the Purchaser for comment. The Sellers shall incorporate any reasonable comments made by the Purchaser on such draft request for ruling within five Business Days of it being provided to the Purchaser under this clause 14.8 and shall thereafter keep the Purchaser informed of the progress of such request for ruling and on any further correspondence with HM Revenue & Customs in relation to such request for ruling.
14.9 If the Purchaser is required by the terms of this Agreement to reimburse any Seller for any Costs and Liabilities or any indemnified amount, the Purchaser shall also reimburse that Seller for any part of such Costs and Liabilities or indemnified amount that represents VAT, save to the extent that the relevant Seller is entitled to credit or repayment in respect of that VAT from the relevant tax authority.
14.10 Any reference in this clause 14 to any person shall, at any time when such person is treated as a member of a group for VAT purposes, include (where appropriate and unless the context otherwise requires) a reference to the representative member of such group at such time (the term "representative member" to have the same meaning as in the Value Added Tax Act 1994).
 
The Sellers and Purchaser shall, as soon as practicable after Business Closing, jointly elect by notice pursuant to section 198 of the Capital Allowances Act 2001, and in accordance with section 201 of the Capital Allowances Act 2001, with respect to any item which is a fixture (as defined in section 173(1) of the Capital Allowances Act 2001 for the purpose of section 198 Capital Allowances Act 2001) so as to fix the amount to be treated as expenditure by the Purchaser on the provision of such items in aggregate to such sum as may be agreed by the Sellers and the Purchaser within 30 days of Business Closing or failing such agreement to such amount as, on a just and reasonable basis, is attributable to them.
16.1 Other than the Commercial Records, all records of each Seller (including the Joint Administrators' Records and the VAT Records) shall remain the property of the relevant Seller.

Exhibit 99.1
 
CLEVELAND (June 28, 2012)  American Greetings Corporation (NYSE: AM) today announced its results for the first fiscal quarter ended May 25, 2012.
First Quarter Results
For the first quarter of fiscal 2013, the Company reported total revenue of $393.1 million, pre-tax income of $10.4 million and net income of $7.3 million or 20 cents per share (all per-share amounts assume dilution). Revenue was reduced by $1.4 million as a result of scan-based trading conversions that occurred during the quarter. The pre-tax income impact of the scan-based trading conversions was $1.0 million (after-tax $0.6 million, reducing earnings per share by about 2 cents). The Company also incurred pre-tax costs of $2.1 million (after-tax $1.3 million, reducing earnings per share by about 4 cents) associated with the termination of a contract within the Company's intellectual property licensing group.
Also during the first quarter, on May 9, 2012, the Company announced the acquisition for approximately $56.6 million of the senior secured debt of Clinton Cards PLC ("Clinton Cards"), one of the largest specialty retailers of greeting cards in the United Kingdom ("U.K."). Subsequently, Clinton Cards was placed into administration, a procedure similar to Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the United States, which gives the company, under the control of its administrators, an opportunity to restructure its business. These events triggered multiple charges that are reflected in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 (also see attached table). Revenue was reduced by $4.0 million as a result of the non-cash impairment of the supply agreement with the Birthdays subsidiary of Clinton Cards. The pre-tax income impact of the contract asset impairment was $4.0 million (after-tax $3.0 million, reducing earnings per share by about 8 cents). The Company incurred pre-tax costs of $17.2 million (after-tax $12.9 million, reducing earnings per share by about 35 cents) associated with a bad debt write-off related to Clinton Cards. The Company also incurred pre-tax costs of $2.0 million (after-tax $1.2 million, reducing earnings per share by about 3 cents) associated with transaction fees. Finally, the Company incurred pre-tax costs of $7.8 million (after-tax $4.8 million, reducing earnings per share by about 13 cents) associated with an impairment of the acquired Clinton Cards senior secured debt.
The Company subsequently announced, on June 7, 2012, the acquisition of assets of Clinton Cards, including approximately 400 stores and related overhead as well as the Clinton Cards and related brands. The impacts of this transaction will be reflected in the second quarter of fiscal 2013.
For the first quarter of fiscal 2012, the Company reported total revenue of $403.7 million, pre-tax income of $50.8 million, and net income of $32.6 million or 78 cents per share. Revenue was reduced by $1.9 million as a result of scan-based trading conversions that occurred during the quarter. The pre-tax income impact of the scan-based trading conversions was $2.3 million (after-tax $1.4 million, reducing earnings per share by about 3 cents).
Management Comments
Chief Executive Officer Zev Weiss said, "I am pleased with the overall performance of our core business in the first fiscal quarter, holding aside the impact of Clinton Cards. Our pipeline of product, breadth of brands and innovation continue to position us as the card company that sells more cards in more places than any other company in the world. Electronically, we are also taking a leadership role. Our justWink mobile application recently surpassed the one million downloads milestone, showing how we are setting the pace when it comes to connecting the digital and paper worlds for greeting cards."
Weiss continued, "This quarter, we also had our most successful customer acquisition campaign for Cardstore.com, driven by a heavy push for new customers tied to the Mother's Day holiday. Despite seeing competitors like Shutterfly and others trying to duplicate our formula for success for personalized greeting cards, our momentum fuels our confidence that we will lead in this area. We believe consumers will come to us for bulk cards and stay with us for more expressive, personal cards. We will compete aggressively on the bulk card business leveraging our scale and capacity, pricing it very competitively while offering a significantly better value than the current market. We will also maintain our focus on the more personalized cards, leveraging our intellectual property to deliver a best in class product. We are excited by the opportunities and encouraged by the consumer response we are seeing."
Financing Activities
Under the Company's previously authorized $75 million share repurchase program, the Company purchased approximately 2.8 million shares of its common stock for about $42.6 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2013.
Conference Call on the Web
American Greetings will broadcast its conference call live on the Internet at 9:00 a.m. Eastern time today. The conference call will be accessible through the Investors section of the American Greetings Web site at . A replay of the call will also be available on the site.

Non-GAAP Measures
Certain after-tax amounts included in the earnings release may be considered non-GAAP measures under the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation G. The after-tax amounts were calculated based on the Company's statutory tax rate of approximately 38.9% for U.S. based items and the appropriate rates for international jurisdictions. Management believes that after-tax information is useful in analyzing the Company's results.
Factors That May Affect Future Results
Certain statements in this release, including those under Management Comments, may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal securities laws. These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historic or current facts. They use such words as "anticipate," "estimate," "expect," "project," "intend," "plan," "believe," and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. These forward-looking statements are based on currently available information, but are subject to a variety of uncertainties, unknown risks and other factors concerning the Company's operations and business environment, which are difficult to predict and may be beyond the control of the Company. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by these forward-looking statements, and that could adversely affect the Company's future performance, include, but are not limited to, the following:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Risks pertaining specifically to AG Interactive include the viability of online advertising, subscriptions as revenue generators, and the ability to adapt to rapidly changing social media and the digital photo sharing space.
In addition, this release contains time-sensitive information that reflects management's best analysis as of the date of this release; however the risks and uncertainties identified above are not the only risks the Company faces. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that the Company believes to be immaterial also may adversely affect American Greetings. Should any known or unknown risks or uncertainties develop into actual events, or underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. American Greetings does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect future events, information or circumstances that arise after the date of this release. Further information concerning issues that could materially affect performance related to forward-looking statements can be found in the Company's periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the "Risk Factors" section of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
 
 
 
 
During the quarter ended May 25, 2012, the Corporation recorded certain charges associated with activities and transactions related to Clinton Cards PLC ("Clinton Cards") that do not have comparative amounts in the prior year period.

Forward Looking Statement Disclosure
The statements contained in this release that are not historical facts may be deemed to constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual future results might differ materially from those projected in such statements due to a number of factors. These factors include the uncertainties set forth in this press release regarding whether an acquisition of the Company will be consummated upon the terms proposed in the attached letter or at all. The forward looking statements contained herein are also subject to other risks and uncertainties that are described in the Company's reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including without limitation the risk factors described in the Company's most recent annual report on Form 10-K.
September 25, 2012
Board of Directors
Ladies and Gentlemen:
Since its founding over a century ago, the descendants of Jacob Sapirstein, and now the Weiss family, have guided American Greetings, including after it became a publicly traded company in 1958. After careful consideration, we have concluded that the best course of action is for American Greetings to return to its roots. Accordingly, on behalf of certain of the family-owned Series B shareholders, we propose to acquire American Greetings at $17.18 per share, net to the seller in cash.
We believe that $17.18 per share is a compelling price and that American Greetings public shareholders will find this proposal attractive. This proposed price represents a premium of approximately 20% over the price for the Class A common shares as of September 25
th
at approximately 2:30 pm. It also provides the public stockholders of the company with liquidity and certain value in a highly volatile period in the equity markets.
We presently expect that the various foundations and related entities and certain members of the family associated with the company would reinvest or rollover all or substantially all of their shares in the acquiring entity, and that we would obtain debt financing to fund the balance of the transaction. We anticipate maintaining intact American Greetings employee base, which we view as its most important asset, and current senior management. At this time, we have not secured binding commitments for the required financing. We are, however, confident that such financing can be arranged based on current market conditions. We are informing you of our thinking at this time so that all shareholders are aware of it as we seek to finalize these arrangements and you have ample time to consider it.
We recognize that the independent directors will need to separately review this proposal under such process as they determine to be appropriate. We will keep you apprised of material developments and cooperate with you in this regard. As you consider this proposal, you should know that the Series B shareholders on behalf of whom this proposal is made believe that their ownership in the company is a strategic investment and have no current intention to sell all or any significant portion of their shares.
This proposal is subject to the finalization of financing, including the entry into definitive agreements by the sponsoring shareholders and arranging and entering into definitive
debt financing documents, the determination by independent directors that the proposal is fair and the negotiation and execution of definitive transaction documents. As we trust you will appreciate, given among other things the volatility of the capital markets, we reserve the right to withdraw or modify this proposal.
Thank you in advance for your consideration of this matter.
Very truly yours,

Exhibit 99.1
CLEVELAND (September 28, 2012)  American Greetings Corporation (NYSE: AM) today announced its results for the second fiscal quarter ended August 24, 2012.
Second Quarter Results
For the second quarter of fiscal 2013, the Company reported total revenue of $393.8 million, a pre-tax loss of $6.1 million and a net loss of $4.3 million or 13 cents per share (all per-share amounts assume dilution).
The Company announced, on June 7, 2012, the acquisition of assets of Clinton Cards, including approximately 400 stores and related overhead as well as the Clinton Cards and related brands. As a result of the acquisition, the Company recognized during the second quarter of fiscal 2013 a revenue increase of approximately $39.9 million from the operations of the Clintons retail stores, reflected in the Company's new Retail Operations segment. This revenue increase was offset partially by the revenue reduction of approximately $13.5 million from inter-segment sales eliminations, reflected in the Company's International Segment, resulting in a net increase in consolidated revenue of approximately $26.3 million in the quarter. The sales being eliminated would have been third party sales in the prior year quarter.
Also as a result of the acquisition, the Company incurred, during the second quarter, pre-tax transaction costs and fees of approximately $3.9 million (after-tax of approximately $2.4 million or 7 cents per share) and pre-tax costs of approximately $2.3 million (after-tax of approximately $1.4 million or 4 cents per share) associated with impairment of the acquired Clinton Cards senior secured debt. The Company also recognized a reduction in pre-tax income of approximately $7.4 million (after-tax of approximately $5.6 million or 16 cents per share) as a result of inter-segment profit eliminations. The Company recognized a loss of $5.1 million (after-tax of approximately $3.1 million or 9 cents per share) from the operation of its retail stores. The total consolidated net reduction in pre-tax income associated with the acquisition and operation of the Clintons retail stores was approximately $18.7 million (after-tax of approximately $12.4 million or 37 cents per share).
In addition, revenue was reduced by $4.4 million as a result of scan-based trading conversions that occurred during the current-year's second quarter. The impact of scan-based trading conversions on pre-tax income was $3.6 million (after-tax of approximately $2.2 million or 7 cents per share). Also included within these results was a pre-tax benefit of $3.2 million (after-tax of approximately $1.9 million or 6 cents per share) from a gain on the sale of a portion of a legacy minority investment.
For the second quarter of the prior fiscal year 2012, the Company reported total revenue of approximately $370.2 million, pre-tax income of approximately $25.0 million, and net income of approximately $14.5 million or 35 cents per share. Revenue was reduced by approximately $0.6 million as a result of scan-based trading conversions that occurred during the quarter. The impact of scan-based trading conversions on pre-tax income was approximately $0.7 million (after-tax of approximately $0.4 million or 1 cent per share). Included within these results was a pre-tax benefit from the sale of certain minor characters in our intellectual property portfolio of approximately $4.5 million (after-tax of approximately $2.8 million or 7 cents per share).
Financing Activities
During the second quarter of fiscal 2013, under the Company's previously authorized $75 million share repurchase program announced January 2012, the Company purchased approximately 0.3 million shares of its common stock for approximately $4.4 million and completed that repurchase program. Under the Company's $75 million share repurchase program announced July 2012, the Company purchased approximately 1.2 million shares of its common stock for approximately $15.7 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2013. Total share repurchases during the second quarter of fiscal 2013 were 1.5 million shares for approximately $20.1 million.

Non-GAAP Measures
Certain after-tax amounts included in the earnings release may be considered non-GAAP measures under the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation G. The after-tax amounts were calculated based on the Company's statutory tax rate of approximately 38.9% for U.S. based items and the appropriate rates for international jurisdictions. Management believes that after-tax information is useful in analyzing the Company's results.
Factors That May Affect Future Results
Certain statements in this release may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal securities laws. These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historic or current facts. They use such words as "anticipate," "estimate," "expect," "project," "intend," "plan," "believe," and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. These forward-looking statements are based on currently available information, but are subject to a variety of uncertainties, unknown risks and other factors
 
concerning the Company's operations and business environment, which are difficult to predict and may be beyond the control of the Company. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by these forward-looking statements, and that could adversely affect the Company's future performance, include, but are not limited to, the following:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Risks pertaining specifically to AG Interactive include the viability of online advertising, subscriptions as revenue generators, and the ability to adapt to rapidly changing social media and the digital photo sharing space.
In addition, this release contains time-sensitive information that reflects management's best analysis as of the date of this release; however the risks and uncertainties identified above are not the only risks the Company faces. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that the
 
Company believes to be immaterial also may adversely affect American Greetings. Should any known or unknown risks or uncertainties develop into actual events, or underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. American Greetings does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect future events, information or circumstances that arise after the date of this release. Further information concerning issues that could materially affect performance related to forward-looking statements can be found in the Company's periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the "Risk Factors" section of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
During the six months ended August 24, 2012, the Corporation recorded certain charges associated with activities and transactions related to Clinton Cards PLC ("Clinton Cards") that do not have comparative amounts in the prior year period.

Exhibit 99.1
CLEVELAND (December 20, 2012)  American Greetings Corporation (NYSE: AM) today announced its results for the third fiscal quarter ended November 23, 2012.
Third Quarter Results
For the third quarter of fiscal 2013, the Company reported total revenue of $506.8 million, a pre-tax loss of $2.1 million, and a net loss of $0.8 million or 3 cents per share (all per-share amounts assume dilution).
The Company announced, on June 7, 2012, the acquisition of certain assets of United Kingdom-based Clinton Cards, including approximately 400 stores and related overhead as well as the Clinton Cards and related brands. As a result of the acquisition, the Company recognized during the third quarter of fiscal 2013 a revenue increase of approximately $67.6 million from the operations of the Clintons retail stores, reflected in the Company's new Retail Operations segment. This revenue increase was partially offset by the revenue reduction of approximately $25.5 million from inter-segment sales eliminations, reflected in the Company's International Social Expressions segment, resulting in a net increase in consolidated revenue of approximately $42.1 million in the quarter. The revenue being eliminated would have been third party sales in the prior year quarter.
The Company recognized a loss of $11.5 million (after-tax of approximately $7.0 million or 22 cents per share) from the operation of its Retail Operations segment. The Company also recognized a reduction in pre-tax income of approximately $4.1 million (after-tax of approximately $2.5 million or 8 cents per share) as a result of inter-segment items within the International Social Expressions segment. The total consolidated net reduction in pre-tax income associated with the operation of the Clintons retail stores during the third fiscal quarter was approximately $15.6 million (after-tax of approximately $9.5 million or 30 cents per share).
During the quarter, consolidated revenue was also reduced by $0.6 million as a result of scan-based trading conversions that occurred during the current year's third quarter while the impact of scan-based trading conversions on pre-tax income was $0.6 million (after-tax of approximately $0.4 million or 1 cent per share).
Also impacting the consolidated results was a pre-tax non-operating income benefit of $1.1 million (after-tax of approximately $0.7 million or 2 cents per share) from a gain on the sale of a portion of a legacy minority investment. A separate but related gain from this minority investment was previously recognized during our second fiscal quarter of 2013.
In the prior year's third quarter, the Company reported total revenue of $465.0 million, pre-tax income of $29.7 million, and net income of $20.2 million or 50 cents per share. Scan-based trading conversions reduced revenue by approximately $1.2 million during the quarter and reduced pre-tax income by approximately $1.1 million (after-tax of approximately $0.7 million or 2 cents per share).
Financing Activities
During the third quarter of fiscal 2013, under the Company's $75 million share repurchase program announced July 2012, the Company purchased approximately 1.1 million shares of its common stock for approximately $15.9 million. Purchases under this share repurchase program were suspended as of September 26, 2012.

Merger Agreement
On March 29, 2013, American Greetings Corporation (the "Company") entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"), by and among the Company, Century Intermediate Holding Company, a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), which upon the closing of the Merger (as defined below) will be indirectly owned by members of the Weiss family, including the Company's Chairman, Morry Weiss; Director and Chief Executive Officer, Zev Weiss; and Director and President and Chief Operating Officer, Jeffrey Weiss; and related persons and trusts (the "Family Shareholders"), and Century Merger Company, an Ohio corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"). The Family Shareholders have voting power with respect to, in the aggregate, 3,130 Class A common shares and 2,481,901 Class B common shares, representing approximately 43% of the Company's total outstanding voting power as of March 27, 2013.
At the effective time of the Merger, each issued and outstanding share of the Company (other than shares owned by the Company, Parent (which will include at the effective time all shares currently held by the Family Shareholders), Merger Sub and holders who have properly exercised dissenters' rights under Ohio law) will be converted into the right to receive $18.20 per share, in cash, without interest and subject to any withholding taxes (the "Merger Consideration"), and Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the Company surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (the "Merger").
The board of directors of the Company (other than directors who are Family Shareholders, who recused themselves from the vote of the board), acting upon the unanimous recommendation of a special committee consisting of disinterested and independent directors (the "Special Committee"), unanimously (i) determined that the Merger Agreement and the Merger were fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders (other than the Family Shareholders), (ii) approved the Merger Agreement and the Merger, and (iii) resolved to recommend that the Company's shareholders vote for the adoption of the Merger Agreement. The Special Committee's recommendation was based in part on a fairness opinion issued to it by its financial advisor, Peter J. Solomon Company, L.P.
Shareholders of the Company will be asked to vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement at a special shareholders meeting that will be held on a date to be announced. Under Ohio law and the Company's Articles of Incorporation, shares representing at least two-thirds of the Company's outstanding voting power must be voted for the adoption of the Merger Agreement (the "Company Shareholder Approval"). For purposes of the Company Shareholder Approval, holders of Class A common shares and Class B common shares will vote together as a single class, with each Class A common share entitled to one vote and each Class B common share entitled to ten votes. In addition, the closing of the Merger is subject to a condition that the Merger Agreement be adopted by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of all outstanding common shares not held by the Family Shareholders or by any director or executive officer of the Company or any of its subsidiaries (the "Majority of the Minority Shareholder Approval"). For purposes of the Majority of the Minority Shareholder Approval only, Class B common shares will be entitled to one vote per share.
Each party's obligation to consummate the Merger is also subject to certain other conditions, including (i) the absence of any legal restraint with respect to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, (ii) the expiration or earlier termination of the waiting period applicable to the Merger under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, (iii) the accuracy of the other party's representations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement (subject to certain qualifiers, as applicable) and (iv) the other party's compliance in all material respects with its covenants and agreements contained in the Merger Agreement. Parent's obligation to close is also conditioned on having received the financing contemplated by the commitments described below and there not having occurred a Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Merger Agreement) with respect to the Company.
The Company has made customary representations and warranties and covenants in the Merger Agreement.
The Company is subject to customary "no-shop" restrictions on its ability to solicit alternative acquisition proposals from third parties and to provide information to, and participate in discussions and engage in negotiations with, third parties regarding alternative acquisition proposals. Notwithstanding these restrictions, prior to the Company Shareholder Approval and the Majority of the Minority Shareholder Approval, the "no-shop" provision is
subject to a customary "fiduciary-out" provision that allows the Company, under certain circumstances and in compliance with certain procedures, to provide information to and participate in discussions and engage in negotiations with third parties with respect to an alternative acquisition proposal that the board of directors determines (acting through the Special Committee) is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement). The Special Committee may exercise a termination right in order to accept a Superior Proposal, subject to match rights for Parent and certain other conditions. In addition, prior to the Company Shareholder Approval and the Majority of the Minority Shareholder Approval, the board may change its recommendation with respect to the Merger in response to an Intervening Event (as defined in the Merger Agreement) if the Special Committee determines in good faith, after consultation with counsel, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the Board's fiduciary duties under applicable law.
The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for both the Company and Parent and further provides that upon the termination of the Agreement under certain circumstances, the Company will be required to reimburse Parent for transaction expenses up to a maximum of $7.3 million. Subject to certain limitations, either party may terminate the Merger Agreement if the Merger is not consummated by September 30, 2013.

Morry, Zev and Jeffrey Weiss have, jointly and severally, guaranteed to the Company the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub under the Merger Agreement, subject to a maximum aggregate liability of $7.3 million and (ii) the Family Shareholders have agreed to vote all of the common shares over which they have voting power (representing in the aggregate 43% of the Company's total outstanding voting power as of March 27,2013) for the adoption of the Merger Agreement, unless the Company's board of directors has changed its recommendation with respect thereto.

Stone Foundation) entered into a Rollover and Contribution Agreement, dated as of the date of the Merger Agreement, with Three-Twenty-Three Family Holdings, LLC ("Family LLC") and Parent (the "Rollover Agreement").

Exhibit 99.1
American Greetings Announces Definitive Acquisition Agreement
CLEVELAND, April 1, 2013  American Greetings Corporation (NYSE: AM) (the "Company" or "American Greetings") announced today that it has signed a definitive agreement under which a newly organized entity owned by the Weiss Family, including the Company's Chairman, Morry Weiss; Director and Chief Executive Officer, Zev Weiss; and Director, President and Chief Operating Officer, Jeffrey Weiss and related persons and entities, will acquire the Company.
Under the agreement, American Greetings Class A and Class B shareholders, excluding the Weiss Family and related entities, will receive $18.20 per share in cash, and, if declared by the Board of Directors, one regular quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share declared and payable in a manner consistent with the Company's past practice. If the transaction closed in July 2013, the targeted closing date, the total cash amount shareholders would receive would be $18.35 per share. The total value of the transaction is approximately $878 million, including the assumption of the Company's 7
 3
/
8
% notes due 2021, which will remain outstanding after the transaction, the repayment of borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facility and the settlement of stock options not held by the Weiss Family.
The $18.20 per share price represents a premium of 26.9% over the trading price for Class A shares on September 25, 2012, the date on which the Weiss Family initially proposed to acquire the Company, and a premium of 13.0% over the closing trading price on March 28, 2013.
The transaction will be financed through a combination of the contributions of the American Greetings shares owned by the Weiss Family, cash funded by a $240 million non-voting preferred stock investment committed by Koch AG Investment, LLC, a subsidiary of Koch Industries Inc., and $600 million in committed debt financing, consisting of a $400 million term loan and a $200 million revolving credit facility, and cash on hand. The senior lender group consists of Bank of America, N.A., Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch, KeyBank National Association, Macquarie Capital USA, Inc. and PNC Bank National Association (listed alphabetically).
The American Greetings Board of Directors formed a Special Committee of independent directors after the Weiss Family first expressed its interest in a possible transaction last September. The Special Committee was charged by the Board with conducting a process intended to examine the Weiss Family's proposal and explore alternatives, and ensure that the terms of any transaction were fair, if any agreement was reached. The Special Committee completed a review of the proposal, considered alternatives, negotiated the price and other transaction terms with the Weiss Family, and concluded unanimously that the transaction with the Weiss Family was fair and in the best interests of the Company's public shareholders (other than the Weiss Family shareholders). Based in part on the unanimous recommendation of the Special Committee, the
agreement was also approved unanimously by the other independent members of the Board. Members of the Weiss Family did not participate in the deliberations of the Special Committee and recused themselves from the vote of the Board of Directors.
Zev Weiss, the Company's CEO, said, "The family believes the transaction is a win for all concerned, including public shareholders. The negotiations with the Special Committee and its advisors were vigorous and arm's length, but we're pleased that we were able to come to an agreement that properly respects all parties' interests."
Jeffrey Weiss, the Company's President and Chief Operating Officer, said, "We are excited to be able to lead the Company into the next chapter of its history. The transaction returns the company to private ownership in a way that we believe enables the Company to continue to serve the interests of its customers, employees, suppliers and the communities in which it operates as it has for over a century."
Completion of the transaction is subject to certain closing conditions, including receipt of the financing pursuant to the commitments described above, shareholder approval and other customary conditions. In addition, the closing of the merger is subject to a condition that the holders of a majority of all outstanding shares not held by the Weiss Family or by any director or executive officer of the Company or any of its subsidiaries approve the merger.
Further information regarding the terms and conditions in the definitive agreement, will be contained in a Current Report on Form 8-K which will be filed promptly with the SEC.
