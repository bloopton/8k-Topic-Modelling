ITEM 9. Regulation FD Disclosure (Information provided under Item 12 - Results of Operations and Financial Condition).
The following information is disclosed pursuant to Item 12 - Results of Operations and Financial Condition. It is being furnished under Item 9 of this Form 8-K in accordance with interim guidance issued by the SEC in release No. 33-8216.
On April 15, 2003, C. R. Bard, Inc. issued a press release reporting earnings and other financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2003. A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.
The press release referenced above compares the company's consolidated net sales and the company's net sales outside the United States for the first quarter of 2003 and the first quarter of 2002 on both a reported basis and a constant currency basis. Because changes in foreign currency exchange rates have a non-operating impact on net sales, the company's management believes the exclusion of these effects results in an additional meaningful comparison of net sales between the two periods. The press release also compares net income and diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2003 and the first quarter of 2002 on a reported basis and excluding certain specifically identified items. Because of the unusual nature of these items, the company's management believes that excluding them provides investors with meaningful information about the comparability of the company's results of operations between the two periods.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

On a constant currency basis, first-quarter 2003 net sales increased 8 percent. First-quarter 2003 net sales in the U.S. were $242.8 million, up 9 percent over the prior-year period, and net sales outside the U.S. were $93.1 million, up 18 percent over the prior-year period.

Net Income for the first quarter 2003 was $46.9 million, and diluted earnings per share were 89 cents, up 35 percent and 37 percent, respectively, over the same period in the prior year. For the quarter ended March 31, 2002, Bard reported net income of $34.7 million and diluted earnings per share of 65 cents. Included in the first quarter 2002 results were items totaling $6.9 million after tax, or 13 cents per diluted share, related to the termination of the Tyco merger agreement, divisional and manufacturing consolidation projects and corporate severance related costs, offset by the reversal of certain legal accruals. Without the items above, net income and diluted earnings per share grew 13 percent and 14 percent, respectively, for the quarter.
William H. Longfield, chairman and chief executive officer, commented, "We are pleased with our results for the quarter, and the progress of our strategic initiatives.

ITEM 7. Exhibits.
The following exhibit is being furnished herewith:
ITEM 9. Regulation FD Disclosure (Information provided under Item 12 - Results of Operations and Financial Condition)
The following information is disclosed pursuant to Item 12 - Results of Operations and Financial Condition. It is being furnished under Item 9 of this Form 8-K in accordance with interim guidance issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") in Release No. 33-8216.
On April 15, 2003, C. R. Bard, Inc. (the "company") announced in a webcast supplemental disclosures related to the company's earnings and other financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2003. A copy of these supplemental disclosures is attached as Exhibit 99. These supplemental disclosures should be read in conjunction with the company's Form 8-K furnished to the SEC on April 15, 2003, including as an exhibit the company's press release announcing its earnings and other financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2003.
The attached supplemental disclosures compare the company's consolidated net sales and the company's net sales outside the United States for the first quarter of 2003 and the first quarter of 2002 on both a reported basis and a constant currency basis. Because changes in foreign currency exchange rates have a non-operating impact on net sales, the company's management believes the exclusion of these effects results in an additional meaningful comparison of net sales between the two periods. The supplemental disclosures also compare net income and diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2003 and the first quarter of 2002 on a reported basis and excluding certain specifically identified items. Because of the unusual nature of these items, the company's management believes that excluding them provides investors with meaningful information about the comparability of the company's results of operations between the two periods.

Exhibit 99
Speaker: William H. Longfield, Chairman and CEO
We continue to be extremely pleased with the day-to-day performance of the business.
Our markets seem to be very healthy and we continue to take share - particularly in our higher-market-share franchises. It's always been our belief that leadership positions are key to long term success in the med-tech markets. We certainly have been leveraging our leadership positions over the last several quarters.
Net sales of $335.9 million represents an 11 percent increase over the first quarter of 2002, and a 1% sequential improvement over a very strong fourth quarter 2002. Currency impact this quarter was favorable by 300 basis points. On a constant currency basis we grew 8%, in the 7-10% band for the 17th consecutive quarter; steady, healthy, improving.
Our net income was $46.9 million for the quarter, a 35% increase over the first quarter of 2002, although the prior year quarter included some restructuring and other charges and credits that Todd will take you through in a moment.
 
EPS was $0.89 for the quarter, modestly ahead of guidance.
We are at or ahead of plan relative to our savings programs and our investment redeployment.
We continue to be pleased with the short term results. More importantly, we have great optimism about the fuel we are providing for even better future results, which we'll explain in more detail today.
 
Speaker: Todd C. Schermerhorn, Senior Vice President and CFO
As Bill said, net income and EPS growth for the quarter were very strong. However, the first quarter of 2002 included certain items that diminish the comparability of the quarters. In Q1 2002, the company took net charges of $10.3 million including charges associated with the Tyco transaction, manufacturing and administrative restructuring and a credit for legal costs. The net after tax cost of these items was $6.9 million or $0.13 per share.
On a more comparable basis then:
Vascular Diagnosis and Intervention
Total net sales for the 1Q in this category were $67.6 million which represents a 6% increase over the prior-year quarter on a constant currency basis, 13% on a reported basis. Remember that this business is our most global, with international accounting for 47% of the business currently - so FX has a more significant impact here. The U.S. experienced 15% growth while our international business declined 3% on a constant currency basis, 10% on a reported basis. Here are the details.
The EP business declined by 1% globally on a constant currency basis, an increase of 7% on a reported basis. U.S. sales were up 6% over prior-year while international sales declined 6% on a constant currency basis, 8% on a reported basis. Europe continues to be a challenge for us. We've made management changes in EP this quarter and we've brought a former employee back to Bard to manage this business. We hope to see this ship turn around in the near future.
Graft product sales declined 2% in the quarter on a constant currency basis, an increase of 3% on a reported basis. We had a strong showing in the U.S., with 6% growth but weak performance internationally.
Radiology products, which account for approximately 47% of the vascular category, grew an impressive 16% on a constant currency basis, an increase of 24% on a reported basis, with strong performance from our PTA catheter business which grew almost 60% on a constant currency basis, 69% on a reported basis, and our self expanding stent line which grew 27% in the quarter on a constant currency basis, 37% on a reported basis.
We think the Interventional Radiology story will get even better as we progress through 2003 and add the new Vena Cava product to the mix.
So, in total, a few mix issues, but we achieved the guidance we had given for the vascular business and we think there's still a fair amount of upside.
Urological Diagnosis and Intervention
Total net sales for 1Q 2003 were $109.3 million, an increase of 8% over 1Q 2002 on a constant currency basis and 10% on a reported basis. Urology sales accounted for one third of the company's worldwide sales in the quarter.
Basic drainage sales increased 8% on a constant currency basis, 7% on a reported basis, fueled by strong growth in our IC product line. We have been slowly building momentum on IC conversions in Japan and that business is now at a large enough size to begin to move the needle in basic drainage.
The continence category grew nicely at 10% on a constant currency basis, 14% on a reported basis, accounting for 13% of total urology. Our surgical incontinence line continues to provide the highlights in this category, growing 45% on a constant currency and as reported basis for the quarter.
Urological specialties, which includes brachytherapy products and services, grew at a rate of 7% in Q1 on a constant currency basis, 16% on a reported basis. Our brachytherapy business posted 9% growth for the quarter on a constant currency basis, 10% on a reported basis. I'd suggest that 9% growth in Brachy is very solid versus what the rest of the market is doing. We were helped by a small transaction in Brachy this quarter. We purchased the assets of a seed distributor company called Prostate Services of America. We bought what amounts to customer lists from them.
Oncological Diagnosis and Intervention
Total net sales in this category were $77.7 million, for an increase of 8% over the 1st quarter 2002 on a constant currency basis, 10% on an as reported basis. As you can see here, this category is made up of two businesses going in different directions.
Specialty Access, which represents 73% of total oncology sales this quarter, increased 16% in the quarter on a constant currency basis, 19% on an as reported basis. PICC's continue to drive the growth curve here with 36% growth in the quarter on a constant currency basis, 37% on an as reported basis. However, ports, dialysis catheters and our Dymax line were all up double digits in the quarter on both a constant currency and as reported basis. This is a business which is accumulating momentum.
Our GI business was weak this quarter, declining 11% globally on a constant currency basis, 9% on an as reported basis. We said we'd have some tough comps as we worked ourselves out of the Olympus arrangement and we were right.
Our Olympus-related business in Europe declined by $2.1 mm, accounting for the majority of the loss in the business.
Surgical Specialties
Surgical Specialties sales of $64.4 million represents an increase of 13% for the quarter on a constant currency basis, 15% on an as reported basis. Growth was evenly balanced between U.S. and international markets.
Soft tissue products accounted for 70% of the sales in this category in the 1st quarter and these sales continue to drive momentum with growth of 24% in the quarter on a constant currency basis, 27% on an as reported basis. To make the math easy, that's an annual run rate of $180 million. Ventral hernia grew faster this quarter than it did in the full year 2002, aided by some new products. Our outlook here remains very positive.
Our hemostasis business continues to decline, and Irrigation is showing modest growth.
In total, while our sales line is showing a bit of volatility the only real surprise to us here is the difficulty of the EP rebound.
Versus our annual revenue guidance, vascular and oncology were right on and urology and surgery were slightly ahead.
Moving to the income statement -
Gross profit was 56.5% this quarter, a 270 basis point improvement over the prior year. We certainly get some benefit from currency, but the lion's share of this improvement is coming from our operations function. We'll admit that we're conservative relative to our improvement when we gave guidance for the year, but there's a lot of moving parts here and we wanted to be certain we could deliver what we promise. We think this is a sustainable margin for '03. There may even be a bias towards a slight upside in the 2nd half of the year.
SG&A was higher than normal this quarter. There was about 130 bps of expense associated with executive severance for a couple of our senior managers. This is clearly not part of our run-rates, and we'd expect those SG&A funds to be re-deployed to R&D for the rest of the year.
Otherwise, in SG&A, we have initiated the process to study our sales coverage deployment and that cost us 20 to 30 basis points this quarter.
R&D is up nicely to 5.8 percent of sales, the highest amount in recent memory. Notable investments include the inception of a research and asset purchase agreement with a company called Futuremed Interventional, Inc. This is the company that developed the Conquest balloon catheter and we have initiated a phased agreement to further that technology and transfer it to Bard. Also noteworthy is further milestone payments relating to our Implantable Pump project as we begin to approach commercialization on those devices.
The tax rate at 27.5% is exactly as forecasted - and reflects our continued operational strategy of maximizing our manufacturing in low tax environments.
 
Turning to the balance sheet -
The first quarter is typically challenging from a cash flow perspective, but our results here are solid as well.
Cash balances increased by $26.4 million.
Accounts receivable and inventory were up 7% on a composite basis, but only 4% when you take currency into effect.
Debt remains constant and debt to total cap has dropped to just under 14%.
Our guidance for Q2 2003 should be very familiar to you at this point -
Revenue growth of 7-8% in constant currency, although reported results could again be 2-300 basis points stronger than this should the Euro remain strong relative to the dollar.
We think EPS will likely be at either $0.93 or $0.94 in Q2.
Looking past Q2, we'd expect Q3 to be flat with or maybe a penny better than Q2, and then a nice sequential quarter increase for Q4 - getting us to the 12% growth number for the year.
Our annual guidance is unchanged.
This is a very steady ship right now, which allows all of our transition work to be carried out deliberately and thoughtfully and without any distractions.

Todd Schermerhorn, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer will review the 3rd quarter income statement and balance sheet and expectations for the fourth quarter. After the financial review, I will provide a new product pipeline update. And, lastly, we will initiate Q&A. Presentation Overview of Third Quarter Results Timothy M. Ring - C. R. Bard, Inc. - Chairman and CEO Third quarter 2003 net sales totaled $361.8 million. This represents an increase of 12% over the third quarter of 2002. Currency impact this quarter was favorable by 290 basis points. On a constant currency basis, the third quarter net sales increase was 9%, making it our 19th consecutive quarter of constant currency sales growth in the range of 7 to 10%. In the U.S., third quarter net sales totaled $258.8 million, an increase of 10% over prior year. Outside of the U.S., net sales were $103.0 million, which is an increase of 17% and 6% on a reported and constant currency basis, respectively. Net income for the third quarter was $51.5 million and diluted earnings per share were 98 cents up 73 % and 72 % respectively over the same period in the prior year. For the third quarter 2002, we reported net income of $29.8 million and diluted earnings per share of 57 cents. Included in these 2002 results were items related to the realignment of certain divisional and manufacturing operations and a tax credit, totaling $14.8 million after tax or 28 cents per diluted share. Bard's management believes that excluding these items provides additional meaningful information about the comparability of our results of operations between periods. Excluding these items, which are reconciled in the investor relations section of our corporate web site, third quarter 2003 net income and diluted earnings per share both grew 15 % over the same period in the prior year. Our third quarter revenue growth at 9%, on a constant currency basis, was a bit ahead of the 7-8% growth we projected. Earnings per share were nicely ahead of the 94-95 cent range we had predicted last quarter. Before I go any further, let me explain what occurred so that no one comes to the conclusion that a strategy shift is occurring here in the first quarter under new management. First of all, the sales came in stronger than we had planned. We've been talking about the R&D investment thesis we have been developing here over the last couple of years. As we have given financial guidance over that time, we have indicated that our R&D investments could experience some unevenness - that we could see some quarterly swings in those investments. That is what occurred this quarter. Quite simply, we have an external R&D partner in the vascular area who missed a milestone, so a payment we had anticipated was not made. No change in strategy. No change in demeanor. Just the variable nature of R&D. From a geographical perspective, U.S. sales are up nicely at 10% while Europe growth was 17% as reported this quarter or 4% in constant currency. Japan sales were solid this quarter, increasing by
9%, driven mainly by soft tissue repair sales. Our other international markets grew at approximately 22% as reported and 11% on a constant currency basis. From a product perspective, surgery and vascular sales continue to be strong. Our oncology business improved in part due to accelerating growth in our Specialty Access product line and, our urology business was slightly below our historical guidance of 5-7%, on a constant currency basis, but healthy none-the-less, especially compared with market growth rates. Our growth initiative programs continue to progress nicely. We are especially pleased with our results in the manufacturing area, which continue to come in ahead of expectations. Our expansion of the U.S. sales force by roughly 10% is progressing on track. Since our conference call in July, we have had several notable events. We acquired a new vacuum-assisted biopsy device for minimally invasive breast biopsies, which complements our leadership position in core needle biopsies. That opens up another $150 million market we are currently not in. We received FDA concurrence to market our Fluency stent graft in the U.S. for tracheobronchial applications. You will remember that we received approval to market Fluency(TM) in Europe as a vascular device late in the second quarter. We also received FDA concurrence to market our new Recovery(R) vena cava filter, a removable device with no time limit on removal. We consider this ground breaking since those devices currently approved for removal, outside the US, must be done so within two weeks. We are especially excited about the Fluency(TM) and Recovery(R) products because they represent advances in technology that offer new solutions to clinicians in our markets. This has been a significant quarter for Bard, and I am very pleased with the financial results and the progress we are making on our growth initiatives. I don't think our management succession could have gone much smoother and, for that, I thank Bill Longfield and the Board of Directors for a great plan. I also thank John Weiland, Todd Schermerhorn, and Bard's entire management team for implementing it so well. The foundation has been laid for some great future opportunities, our job now is to execute and we are off to a great start. I will now turn the discussion over to John Weiland, who will review product line revenue. Product Line Review John H. Weiland - C. R. Bard, Inc. President and COO Good afternoon. Before I get started, let me explain how we look at our business in terms of revenue growth. We believe that, when discussing our product line results, eliminating the effect of changes in foreign currency provides the most accurate measure of the core health of our various franchises. So, as we walk through our sales results, please note that all percentage growth data will be given in constant currency, unless specifically noted otherwise. Vascular Diagnosis and Intervention Total net sales for the 3rd quarter in this category were $77.4 million, which represents an increase of 12% over the prior year quarter, 18% as reported. The U.S. experienced 18% growth in the quarter while our international business grew 5%, 18% as reported. Graft product sales this quarter were up 4%, a fairly strong result when viewed historically. In the U.S.
we are seeing steady growth in both our Distaflo(R) peripheral graft line and our Vectra(R) dialysis access grafts. We view this as another example of great sales execution as we grow share in a flat market. The EP business remained flat this quarter. U.S. sales were up 1% while Europe sales were down 2%. A couple of highlights in EP were the release of the new windows version of our lab systems software in the U.S. and the continued growth of our steerable diagnostic catheter line. We have solid technology in the steerable area, which serves as the foundation for our entry into pulmonary vein products. Our Interventional Radiology products, which are 49% of the vascular category, had another great quarter, growing 25%. PTA catheters were up 49%, again fueled by our new Conquest(TM) balloon, while our self-expanding stents continued their growth with a 19% increase. We are seeing a nice ramp-up in vena cava filter sales with growth of 35% this quarter, driven by the limited market release of our Recovery(R) filter, which Tim spoke about earlier. Our plan is to go to full market release in the first quarter of '04, once we have completed some rather extensive thought leader and sales force training on this new product. We are taking a very measured approach with our rollout of the Recovery(R) in order to position ourselves well for long-term success with this exciting new product. Also contributing to our growth was the Fluency(TM) stent graft that Tim noted, which is an innovative addition to our Peripheral Vascular sales bag. It was launched around the beginning of the quarter, with a tracheobroncial indication in the U.S. and a vascular indication in Europe, with sales getting off to a very nice start. Lastly, the Interventional Radiology category also includes our biopsy product line. As you know, we made a technology investment in this area this quarter with the BIP transaction allowing Bard to enter the vacuum assisted biopsy market, a transaction, by the way, which we would consider a tuck-in. Many of you are not aware of the size or health of our existing biopsy franchise. This business is currently $40 million annually in size, built largely around a core needle biopsy product, and grew 18% this quarter and 10% in 2002. The BIP product is only in limited release in a few European countries, so it did not contribute materially to the quarter, but you can understand we will be building on a reasonably sized and healthy foundation as we enter this new segment. Urological Diagnosis and Intervention Total net sales for the 3rd quarter 2003 were $113.3 million, an increase of 4% over 3rd quarter 2002, 6% as reported. The U.S. business, which is 75% of worldwide sales, grew at 6%, with International down 1% in constant currency but up 6% as reported. Our basic drainage business delivered another solid performance for the third quarter, growing by 5%. Sales increased 7% in the U.S. led by our Bardex(R) I.C., infection control catheter. Globally, Bardex(R) I.C. grew at 12%. Urological specialties, which are 24% of total urology, grew at a rate of 5% for the third quarter. Our brachytherapy franchise continues on its solid trend with 11% growth for the quarter. Although working from a much smaller base, we were pleased to see our European brachytherapy sales increase a little over 20% for the last two quarters. Overall, we continue to be pleased with the progress we are making on our long-term strategy for this business and our success in growing market share. Our continence business decreased 5% globally this quarter. The surgical continence line grew nicely with an increase of 30% but was offset largely by the continued decline of our Contigen(R) product line.
Oncological Diagnosis and Intervention Total net sales in this category were $86.3 million, representing an increase of 11% over the 3rd quarter of 2002, 13% as reported. Geographically, sales were up 11% in both the U.S. and international. As reported, international was up 22%. Our specialty access business, which is 74% of total oncology sales, had a great third quarter posting a global sales increase of 18%. Fueled by the introduction of our new Hemosplit(TM) catheter at the end of the second quarter, our dialysis catheter line was up 44% in Q3. PICCs and implanted ports continued their strong performance with growth of 31% and 10% respectively. We are very pleased with the success of the launch and the potential the Hemosplit(TM)represents for our Access business. Our G.I. business declined 5% this quarter. The Olympus impact for Q3 was down to roughly $500K. This remains a challenging market for us. Surgical Specialties Surgical Specialties global sales increased 19%, 21% as reported, over the prior year quarter to $68.5 million. Sales in the U.S., which are 81% of the total, were up 17% for the quarter while internationally we grew 26%, 36% as reported. Soft tissue repair products accounted for 68% of the surgical specialties sales in the 3rd quarter, and they continued their terrific performance with growth of 27% this quarter. As in the last few quarters, our ventral hernia repair products, led by our Ventralex(TM) and Composix(R) Kugel(R) products, are providing the majority of growth in total soft tissue repair. In addition, the International growth rate here continues to improve, coming in at 28% for Q3. We've talked a fair amount about investing for growth in the international markets and it's nice to see the results showing the impact of these investments. Performance irrigation was up 2% for the third quarter. Our hemostasis product line was up 17% this quarter, helping to push the surgical category to 19% growth overall. We've highlighted the uneven nature of the sales patterns in this business in the past. We've had a couple of positive quarters in a row here, but we're not predicting a trend. Although it's a little bit volatile, the good news is that the hemostasis franchise is on the smaller size for Bard, at about $20 million annually. This concludes the sales discussion for Q3, which as you can see was a solid quarter for Bard. I will now turn you over to Todd Schermerhorn.
Financial Review Todd C. Schermerhorn - C. R. Bard, Inc. Senior VP and CFO Let's take a look at the company's 3rd quarter consolidated statement of income starting with gross profit margins. Actual gross profit of $207.1 million was up 19% over the prior year's figure of $173.5 million. As a percentage of sales, 3rd quarter gross profit of 57.2% was 340 basis points ahead of prior year. We've asked you to think about our approach to gross margins as one of continuous improvement on a forward basis and that's pretty much what occurred this quarter with an improvement of 30 basis points sequentially. Our cost improvement program continues to be the primary driver of the year-over-year gains but, again, we experienced favorable impact from mix and currency. Price right now is effectively neutral. SG&A expenses were $112.3 million or 31.0% of sales, up 150 basis points as a percentage of sales, versus the prior year and even with Q2 of this year. Patent and litigation expenses continue to be higher than prior year, accounting for 90 basis points of that increase, which is slightly less than the 120 basis points of growth it represented in Q2. The other notable item here is one I talked about last quarter and that is our growing investment in our US sales force expansion program, which contributed a little over 30 basis points of new spending in SG&A this quarter. As we look toward Q4, our patent and legal situation could continue to improve. However, that impact will likely be offset by further investment in the sales force expansion program - probably taking us back toward 31% of sales range for SG&A in Q4. R&D expenditures of $21.6 million represents a 45% increase over the prior year's R&D expenditures of $14.9 million. As Tim mentioned, we had planned for higher levels of R&D spending, as high as the $23.5 million range for the quarter but were not able to reach the appropriate design specifications to assure product success with a particular R&D partner, so we held off. We continue to be convinced that R&D investment will be the primary driver of our future revenue acceleration. It's important to note, however, that as we push our way towards an annual R&D run rate of $100 million, you can be assured that, despite the rapid increase in investment, we approach every dollar of that spending with the same diligence and carefulness that we've exercised historically in all our spending. The same blocking and tackling mindset that we apply to manufacturing costs and working capital and so on, we apply here. Interest expense of $3.2 million for the 3rd quarter is consistent with $3.1 million in the 3rd quarter 2002. Our tax rate remains in the range of 27.5% and our guidance for the tax rate is unchanged at this time. Average diluted shares outstanding for the quarter was 52.6 million. The company repurchased 212,500 shares during the 3rd quarter. We continue to expect to be a buyer of our stock, from time-to-time, as cash positions, investment options, benefit plan dilution, and market conditions warrant. The balance sheet as of September 30, 2003 reflects cash and short-term investments of $392.0 million, down slightly from $403.1 million at the end of the second quarter. Net accounts receivable were $212.5 million, reflecting 52.9 Days, which is a reduction of 1.4 days from June 30 quarter end. Inventory net of reserves was $156.1 million as of September 30, representing 93.6 days, a decrease of
3.7 Days from the end of the second quarter. So, as you can see, our working capital is back going in the right direction. Capital expenditures totaled about $16 million this quarter, consistent with Q1 and Q2 and our 2003 guidance. On the liability side, debt decreased $3.9 million. Debt to total capital at the end of the quarter is just above 15%. Total shareholder investment was $1.011 billion at September 30, 2003. So, overall, our balance sheet remains very strong, and gives us the resources and flexibility to grow this business. Our guidance for Q4 is for earnings of 99 cents and revenue growth of 8% on a constant currency basis. If the Euro remains at its current level, currency could add in the area of 300 basis points to our revenue growth. In terms of 2004, we are planning our annual analyst meeting for December 16 in New York City. At that time, we will discuss our guidance for 2004 and update you on our products. We will have more details on the meeting over the next 30 days or so. As is customary, I refer you to Bard's June 30, 2003 Form 10-Q and specifically to our disclosure regarding forward-looking statements. I will now turn you back over to Tim Ring for an update on some of our research and development projects. New Product Update Timothy M. Ring - C. R. Bard, Inc. Chairman and CEO I would now like to update you on a few of the new product pipeline projects we presented at our April analysts meeting. First, let me summarize our success so far. Our Ventralex(TM) patch for the repair of umbilical hernias continues to significantly exceed our original expectations, finishing the third quarter on a $14MM annualized run rate. We are very pleased with that product. Our Conquest(TM) PTA balloon dilation catheter generated sales at an annual run rate of over $11 million for Q3. Our total PTA business is now running at a rate of $24 million, based on the third quarter results. We told you we would launch our Hemosplit(TM) dialysis catheter in the second quarter and we did. It is off to a great start, driving 44% growth in its product category. Its sales annualize to $10 million in its first full quarter. We talked about a mid-year launch for the introduction of our new innovative Fluency(TM) stent graft and we hit it exactly in the middle of the summer. The launch went very well, generating sales at about a $5 million annual run rate for the quarter and making a healthy contribution to the 25% growth of our Interventional Radiology business for Q3. We also hit the mid-year target for our Fluent(TM) constant flow pain pump. It was introduced in Europe in June, where it is receiving good clinical feedback. This is the first step in our pain pump strategy, which is really targeted at the U.S. programmable pump market, where 90% of the opportunity lies. We have already mentioned our Recovery(R) filter and how excited we are about the opportunity it represents to change the way vena cava filters are used. We had targeted its approval for the second half of this year and were very pleased to receive FDA concurrence in early August, thanks to some
great cooperative work with the agency. Looking ahead, we anticipate FDA concurrence for our Orbiter(R) PV diagnostic EP catheter before year-end. We launched this product in Europe at the end of Q1, and are awaiting FDA approval to do so in the U.S. There were a couple of questions from the FDA, so that process does extend the approval time and we now anticipate approval before year end. We plan on launching our Innerlace(TM) TVT surgical sling in the first quarter once our supplier is geared up to meet anticipated demand. For the Uryx(R)uretheral bulking agent project, the developer Genyx is completing the clinical trial follow-up and is targeting a PMA submission by year-end. Given this, we will not make the commercialization target, that we indicated in April, of the first half of 2004. We are not quite sure of the exact date, we will update you in December, when we will have a better handle on it at that point of time. Looking at longer-term projects. Our arteriovenous or AV stent graft, which is the second of a family of covered stents - its clinical trial is progressing nicely. We expect enrollment in our clinical trial to be complete in Q1. Our PV mesh ablation catheter project is moving forward on track. Our chronic animal study is in progress and we expect IDE approval for our first human use around year-end. For our anti-infection endotracheal tube project we have two small pilot studies and a large randomized study in progress. The first pilot study includes 58 patients and is in the data analysis phase while the second 30 patient pilot study should be done with enrollment around year-end. Relative to the larger 2,600 patient clinical trial, we received approval from the FDA to expand from 15 to 40 clinical sites this quarter and we are pleased with the progress being made there. That completes our update. We are very pleased with the successes we have had so far and the overall progress of our on-going projects. Question and Answer Session John Calcagnini - CIBC World Markets - Analyst Hi, guys. Congratulations on a good quarter. I wanted to first focus a little bit on the gross profit margin just to make sure we understand what - Todd maybe could explain for us again sort of what drove that gross profit margin expansion and what you expect it to be in the fourth quarter, because you mentioned 99 cents for the fourth quarter, that's only up a penny sequentially. And certainly that is what we had previously. But given this gross profit performance, you know, and the fact the fourth quarter is usually seasonally stronger, are we being a little to conservative there? But first could we talk about the gross profit drivers. Todd Schermerhorn - C. R. Bard, Inc. - Senior Vice President and CFO Let me tell you what our position is. For the third quarter the components of the improvement include price, which is neutral right now, so it does not impact us one way or the other. Mix is nicely favorable
somewhere between 50 and 70 basis points. Now, this is year-over-year so it's versus the Q3 of prior year. FX is nicely favorable as well in the 50 to 70 basis point range. And cost is between 200 and 250 basis points. These calculations are often very difficult to do so we give you a little bit of range and wiggle room but that is directionally what is occurring. We think that Q4 will likely be in the low 57's somewhere. John Calcagnini - CIBC World Markets - Analyst OK. So similar to where it was just now? Todd Schermerhorn - C. R. Bard, Inc. - Senior Vice President and CFO Yes. John Calcagnini - CIBC World Markets - Analyst The cost element, that's the big piece of it. I thought you just said FX was plus 50 to 70 basis points, did I hear that right. Todd Schermerhorn - C. R. Bard, Inc. - Senior Vice President and CFO Yes. John Calcagnini - CIBC World Markets - Analyst OK and then cost is 200 to 250, what - more specifically what is driving that? I mean what cost reduction program? Todd Schermerhorn - C. R. Bard, Inc. - Senior Vice President and CFO You know we had the major program with the three plants this year. In addition to that, over the last several years the centralization of management, the plant closings, the product moves that we did in the prior year are basically allowing us to manufacture that next increment of volume at marginal costs, which of course, lowers the overall cost position. And that is effectively what it is John, we just gotten very good at that process. John Calcagnini - CIBC World Markets - Analyst OK, what does that look like next year, do you think? I mean how much legs does this margin expansion have? Todd Schermerhorn - C. R. Bard, Inc. - Senior Vice President and CFO Yes, we - I thought you might ask that. We're going to talk about that more in December. But, you know I will tell you that we'd be surprised if it didn't continue to improve. John Calcagnini - CIBC World Markets - Analyst OK and I wanted to talk to John a bit about the specialty access business, if he could sort of rehash you know how big the Hemosplit(TM) opportunity is? I thought I heard you say a 44% growth there and that
business was running at an annualized rate of about $40 million or - you did $10 million in the quarter, did I hear that right? John Weiland - C. R. Bard, Inc. - President and COO Yes, I think just $10 million on that specific product annualized and 44% growth overall in dialysis. John Calcagnini - CIBC World Markets - Analyst OK, the $10 million - Hemosplit(TM) is 10 annualized? John Weiland - C. R. Bard, Inc. - President and COO That's right. John Calcagnini - CIBC World Markets - Analyst OK, and over-all dialysis was up 44% to what? John Weiland - C. R. Bard, Inc. - President and COO Dialysis business overall is about a $35 million business. John Calcagnini - CIBC World Markets - Analyst OK, and how big is that opportunity with Hemosplit(TM) and just maybe if you could walk through the drivers of that specialty access business, because obviously this is where we saw the biggest upside growth to our model in the quarter was with the oncology division and that of course was driven by specialty access. So, I wonder how much incremental opportunity you see there? Timothy Ring - C. R. Bard, Inc. - Chairman and CEO We identify the market at being $130 million worldwide. John Calcagnini - CIBC World Markets - Analyst $130 million for - Timothy Ring - C. R. Bard, Inc. - Chairman and CEO For total dialysis segment. John Calcagnini - CIBC World Markets - Analyst OK, and what about the other segment within specialty access business. Timothy Ring - C. R. Bard, Inc. - Chairman and CEO
Which business specifically John? John Calcagnini - CIBC World Markets - Analyst Well, you talked about the PICC catheters, right? John Weiland - C. R. Bard, Inc. - President and COO Well, we did talk about PICC's, that's roughly a little over a $100 million market globally. We are a high share player there. Port's also are about $130 million globally. John Calcagnini - CIBC World Markets - Analyst OK. John Weiland - C. R. Bard, Inc. - President and COO Again, we're a pretty high share player there, as well. John Calcagnini - CIBC World Markets - Analyst OK, and thanks a lot, guys. Robert Goldman - Buckingham Research Group, Inc. - Analyst Two questions on R&D. Tim, you mentioned on the esophageal catheter that you had one pilot study going on with 58 patients, which are in a data collection phase right now. Timothy Ring - C. R. Bard, Inc. - Chairman and CEO That is one of the two pilot studies that we have going on, yes. Robert Goldman - Buckingham Research Group, Inc. - Analyst On that study, the study was designed to show what? How will you disseminate that data and information? The second question on R&D is broader, which is to say that by design your R&D expenses are ramping up nicely. Just wonder if you could give us a sense of where the money is going? Speak maybe to new hires or partnerships with other companies, et cetera, just to give us some sense of how you are spending the money? Timothy Ring - C. R. Bard, Inc. - Chairman and CEO Let me deal with the second one first and I will turn the endotracheal tube question over to John. We go through a careful process here when we decide to go forward with an R&D project. Every division does it the same way. It's called the new product opportunity assessment. There are a number of components that are looked at as part of that, including things like technical difficulty, regulatory complexity, reimbursement, et cetera. And then that's reviewed at each division and also reviewed here - I think we mentioned several times that John, Todd and I, and several others, conduct two full days, one in the spring, one in the fall, of
R&D reviews at every technology center we have. So, it gets scrutinized pretty well and I will tell you we don't have one favorite. We go where the opportunities are and we try to play to the strengths in terms of where we think we can win and again winning is number one or number two. So, we don't have a favorite thing. We kind of look at the best opportunity in our judgment and the judgment of our divisions, where they think their best opportunity is, and we move forward from there. So, that's pretty much it in a nutshell, in terms of how we manage it. We don't have a preference for one area. Robert Goldman - Buckingham Research Group, Inc. - Analyst If I can, though, just to follow-up. Is the money resulting in additional people at Bard? Is it resulting in additional clinical trials? Is it resulting in some partnership money going somewhere else? Timothy Ring - C. R. Bard, Inc. - Chairman and CEO It's all of the above. It's an improvement in our processes; it's adding additional people. It's more projects, I mean, we have greatly increased the number of projects that we have active right from where it was two years ago. We did outside partnerships. So, it is more clinical trials. We believe very strongly in the importance of building clinical research into the R&D process a lot earlier than we would have done that several years ago. So, it's a little bit of all of the above, Bob. It's not - I can't point to one specific thing that would help you understand it a lot better. Robert Goldman - Buckingham Research Group, Inc. - Analyst Would you feel comfortable putting some numbers on it, in other words, the number of active projects today versus two years ago? Number of folks in R&D compared to two years ago? Timothy Ring - C. R. Bard, Inc. - Chairman and CEO Yes, it's over 200 projects today, it's 225 I think. In the spring, John had mentioned at that point that it was about 185 or 180, something like that. So, even from the spring it ramped up rather significantly and I would say that it's close to doubling from what it was a couple of years ago. Robert Goldman - Buckingham Research Group, Inc. - Analyst And people? Timothy Ring - C. R. Bard, Inc. - Chairman and CEO People, I don't have that number in front of me, you can follow-up with either Eric or Todd. Todd Schermerhorn - C. R. Bard, Inc. - Senior Vice President and CFO It hasn't been a large increase in people per-se, Bob. We have done a lot more with outside partners. We haven't put a lot of fixed cost into that pool. Robert Goldman - Buckingham Research Group, Inc. - Analyst
OK, thanks. And then the esophageal. Timothy Ring - C. R. Bard, Inc. - Chairman and CEO On the endotracheal tube project, the two small pilot studies are primarily safety-related studies for us. It was to give us some significant experience in patient enrollment. Informed consent is a large part of the U.S. trial. We wanted to really get our hands around that and do early trials before we started our large one. But then again, the most important issue is the safety side of things. As you can tell with that small number of patients, we're not powered into the studies to give us any indication on efficacy. That really won't happen until we get down stream in the 2600 clinical trial. Robert Goldman - Buckingham Research Group, Inc. - Analyst And the safety data, do you intend to release that some how? John Weiland - C. R. Bard, Inc. - President and COO There is really nothing to release of important consequence. As the FDA looks at these kinds of issues, basically they want to make sure the product we are using is safe for patients that are receiving it in clinical trials. And, I think this will give us that kind of data to help us feel comfortable with that. The real name of the game here is going to be efficacy and that will happen in the 2600 patient clinical trial. Robert Goldman - Buckingham Research Group, Inc. - Analyst I guess, John, if you are still talking about this project in three months then that would mean it's passed the safety hurdles in your mind? John Weiland - C. R. Bard, Inc. - President and COO I don't know if I can put a box around three months, but I would say that we have not seen any issues to date that cause us any concern from a safety standpoint on this project. Timothy Ring - C. R. Bard, Inc. - Chairman and CEO I think, Bob, the more we talk about it going in the future, I think you could draw that conclusion, yes. Robert Goldman - Buckingham Research Group, Inc. - Analyst OK, thanks a lot, guys. Matthew Dodds - SG Cowen Securities Corporation - Analyst Good afternoon, guys. On the vacuum assisted biopsy opportunity, I was wondering when you categorize the $150 million opportunity, does that mean there is already a sizable market there and someone else is there and you are going to move in or is this something you are going to be first in and then on top of that, just to put a framework around that opportunity, in 12 months, what sort of run rate can we expect for that product?
Timothy Ring - C. R. Bard, Inc. - Chairman and CEO There is another player in that market. It is Johnson & Johnson. They are the only player in the market. The device that we have is significantly different from the one that they have. Ours is a handheld portable battery powered unit, theirs is a piece of capital equipment that's stationery in a room, a patient has to be taken there. So, we like the technology, in terms of the opportunity, that's why we did the deal. Todd Schermerhorn - C. R. Bard, Inc. - Senior Vice President and CFO But it is an existing $150 million market. Timothy Ring - C. R. Bard, Inc. - Chairman and CEO Yes, and we will see how we do with that going forward. Matthew Dodds - SG Cowen Securities Corporation - Analyst And then, separate topic. On the vena cava filter you said earlier that existing competitive filters, you really have to pull them out within a couple of weeks. How long can you keep yours in before the tissue growth becomes an issue? Is there a timeline where you are indicated it has to come out? Timothy Ring - C. R. Bard, Inc. - Chairman and CEO I can tell you that, for clinical data we submitted to the FDA, at that point in time, the mean dwelling time, if you will was kind of in the low to mid-60 day range with a maximum out of 160 day plus and counting. So, you know, I think that made the agency comfortable enough with the data and more importantly with how the device removed after being in for such a long period of time. You typically would have seen tissue in-growth. So, obviously they were satisfied that the period of days and the data they have looked at, they were comfortable enough not putting a day claim on the removability. So, we think we've got some distinct advantages technically there which translates into great clinical results and you know, we like our opportunity there. Matthew Dodds - SG Cowen Securities Corporation - Analyst Thank you, Tim. Glenn Novarro - Banc of America Securities - Analyst Thanks, guys and good quarter. Oncology sales in the quarter up 13%, can you talk about whether or not that is sustainable and what we should expect in the fourth quarter? And then, urology sales you mentioned was a little bit below plan. Does that snap back to the more traditional 6 to 8% growth in the fourth quarter? And then, just lastly, share base continues to come down, what is a good number to use in our models for Q4?
Timothy Ring - C. R. Bard, Inc. - Chairman and CEO I will let Todd handle the share question and then I will turn the other two questions over to John. Todd Schermerhorn - C. R. Bard, Inc. - Senior Vice President and CFO I think 52.6 million is fine for the share base. Glenn Novarro - Banc of America Securities - Analyst OK. John Weiland - C. R. Bard, Inc. - President and COO Urology, I can handle that one along the way. We guided for the year at 5 to 7. We were just a little bit under that guidance. But, you know we still think roughly that those are pretty good numbers for that business. Glenn Novarro - Banc of America Securities - Analyst OK. Oncology. Are we seeing a new type of growth rate emerging here? John Weiland - C. R. Bard, Inc. - President and COO I think we've been comfortable with this growth rate. I don't think that we see a major deviation coming from that based on the product lines that we have launched. So, we are comfortable with that right now. Glenn Novarro - Banc of America Securities - Analyst I should dial in about 13% in my model for Q4? Todd Schermerhorn - C. R. Bard, Inc. - Senior Vice President and CFO Yes, I think another way to look at that, if you look at the specialty access piece of oncology, you know that for nine months is up about 16% and for the quarter was up almost 18. Now they did have that dialysis catheter launch in the quarter. But, that business has been on that range for several quarters now. Timothy Ring - C. R. Bard, Inc. - Chairman and CEO I think the good news is the growth is coming from three major segments I mean not just one. And I don't think we see that falling off in the short term. Glenn Novarro - Banc of America Securities - Analyst OK, Great. Helpful. Thank you. Graham Tanaka - Tanaka Capital Management - Analyst
Yes, good quarter, guys. I didn't quite catch towards the end of him talking about some of the products that were maybe slightly delayed at the FDA - I guess with the pulmonary vein catheter and the other product, I think it was the second product? And I was just wondering is there a significant -- does that adjust our expectations in the immediate term or what? Timothy Ring - C. R. Bard, Inc. - Chairman and CEO No, none of the products that we talked about - I don't think would cause any adjustment in even our expectations about what we expect our own performance to be. A couple of the projects have minor delays. I don't think there is cause for concern there. There were questions in the 510-K process for the Orbiter(R) PV diagnostic catheter and I think the other one, we are just waiting for outside suppliers to kind of gear up for some inventory for our new InnerLace(TM) surgical sling. Those are the only things we talked about. Graham Tanaka - Tanaka Capital Management - Analyst Great, thank you. Milton Hsu - Bear Stearns and Co. - Analyst Hi, it's Rick Wise and Milton Hsu. Couple of questions first can you flush out the issue on R&D with your external partner? Is there something that comes back and you are going to spend it in the fourth quarter and we should expect much higher R&D spending than normal in the fourth quarter or how will it work? Timothy Ring - C. R. Bard, Inc. - Chairman and CEO That particular one will probably go into 2004. Milton Hsu - Bear Stearns and Co. - Analyst So, in the fourth quarter in terms of percentage of sales or dollars much like the third quarter? Timothy Ring - C. R. Bard, Inc. - Chairman and CEO We will see higher R&D expense than the third quarter in the fourth quarter. We will continue to see that R&D number ramp. Milton Hsu - Bear Stearns and Co. - Analyst OK. And you talked about brachytherapy gaining share. Can you just give us a little perspective where you think your share is and who is losing or gaining there? Timothy Ring - C. R. Bard, Inc. - Chairman and CEO I will turn that over to John. John Weiland - C. R. Bard, Inc. - President and COO
Well, as we said we have grown at 11% for the quarter in brachytherapy. That is a trend that we mirrored pretty much every quarter throughout the entire year. I'd compare that to the other public companies that are involved in this market segment and I think it is hard for me to put my finger on anyone with any growth in that segment thus far through the year. So I think we like our ability to continue to grow share in that segment. Milton Hsu - Bear Stearns and Co. - Analyst And what is, can you help us appreciate the factors driving that share gain? John Weiland - C. R. Bard, Inc. - President and COO I think a number of areas. Number one I think would be our product portfolio. We have the widest offering of products and services in this entire segment. I think that certainly has been a very important item of our success. I think the expansion of our sales force in this category and the segmentation of our sales force led us to have significant focus on this category for us through this far in the year and we also have done a couple of tuck-ins in this category as the year went on. So I think those three things are the most important items, which are allowing us to grow. Milton Hsu - Bear Stearns and Co. - Analyst You talked about sales force expansion up 10% ahead of plan. It sounds like you are placing more people internationally. Should we think of it that way or any particular divisions or areas where you are particularly focused on? Timothy Ring - C. R. Bard, Inc. - Chairman and CEO That increase is just the U.S. increase. We just started to do a study to look at the same thing within Europe and that would not be finished for several months yet and the increases in the U.S. businesses are in the ones that are performing the strongest. Milton Hsu - Bear Stearns and Co. - Analyst OK. We should just assume that is what is taking place. How much further do we have to go there? Timothy Ring - C. R. Bard, Inc. - Chairman and CEO We should be fully staffed by the end of November, maybe the middle of December. We are pretty well what John, maybe three quarters of the way now or a little better than that? John Weiland - C. R. Bard, Inc. - President and COO Maybe more than that. Timothy Ring - C. R. Bard, Inc. - Chairman and CEO We have an operating meeting next week, we will go through our review but as of last month it was 70% or something like that. Milton Hsu - Bear Stearns and Co. - Analyst
So again as always you are not giving guidance on '04, is some operating leverage there, positive operating leverage there in '04? Timothy Ring - C. R. Bard, Inc. - Chairman and CEO I have not even gone through the budget yet. We will give you a little more update in December. Milton Hsu - Bear Stearns and Co. - Analyst Is that a logical conclusion, though? Todd Schermerhorn - C. R. Bard, Inc. - Senior Vice President and CFO It tends to take time for them to pay back, Rick. At least a year before they are accretive in terms of cost, I think. Milton Hsu - Bear Stearns and Co. - Analyst Last, remind me when you think you basically get the whatever you want to describe it, full benefit of manufacturing consolidation and cost-cutting program? I am sure there is something going on, the special initiative? Todd Schermerhorn - C. R. Bard, Inc. - Senior Vice President and CFO Based on charges from last year, the last plant will close at the end of this year. Brian Kim - Brown Brothers Harriman - Analyst Hello, good afternoon. Just a couple of questions, you guys for the first time just shared with us some of the revenue traction that we are seeing from new products, specifically Fluency(TM) and Hemosplit(TM), I assume BIP will be launched next year and the vena cava will get traction next year, as well. And so, the tough issues with this and Hemostasis anniversaries, I know you don't want to talk about '04 until December, but when I just quickly do some back of the envelope type of stuff and the currency is again a positive tailwind, is it conceivable we could see low double-digit top-line growth for you guys in '04? Specific to new product introductions, is there any investment period required with these or will they be accretive to EPS looking out to '04? Timothy Ring - C. R. Bard, Inc. - Chairman and CEO Brian, we prefer to wait until December for '04 guidance. Brian Kim - Brown Brothers Harriman - Analyst All right. Thanks. Timothy Ring - C. R. Bard, Inc. - Chairman and CEO
Thank you. I'd like to again thank everyone for taking the time to sit down and listen to third-quarter results. I think you can tell it is an exciting time at Bard. Our ability to reinvest back into the business remains strong. Our focus is accelerating to a higher level. As you can also tell, continuous improvement is the story in the other fundamental parts of the business. Thanks again, we look forward to seeing everybody in December at the analyst meeting.

ITEM 5. Other Events and Required FD Disclosure.
On December 19, 2003, in the action entitled in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, a jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs.  The action involves a dispute regarding whether the company breached agreements with the plaintiffs by failing to use appropriate efforts to promote the growth of a business that the company purchased from the plaintiffs, failed to pay consideration due under the agreement and induced the sale of the company by misrepresentation.  The jury awarded the plaintiffs $58 million.  The Company believes that the verdict is not supported by the evidence and that the amount of the award is grossly excessive.  The company will file post-trial motions to set aside the verdict or reduce the amount of the award and for a new trial.  The company expects these motions to be decided in the first quarter of 2004.  If unsuccessful in these motions, the compa ny will file an appeal.
Nelson N. Stone, M.D., et al. v. C. R. Bard, Inc., et al.
In connection with the jury's verdict, the company will take an unanticipated pre-tax charge of $58.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2003.  This payment would not have a material adverse effect on the company's liquidity. The company is comfortable with 2004 First Call consensus earnings estimates, and its sales, margin and operating guidance for 2004 remains unchanged.

Introduction
Timothy M. Ring -
C. R. Bard, Inc. - Chairman and CEO
Welcome to Bard's 3rd quarter 2004 earnings conference call. We appreciate all of you taking the time to listen-in today. We expect the presentation component of this call to last no longer than 20 minutes.
Our discussions today will go as follows.
I will begin with an overview of the 3rd quarter 2004.
John Weiland, our President and Chief Operating Officer, will review 3 quarter product-line revenue.
rd
Todd Schermerhorn, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer will review the 3rd quarter income statement and balance sheet as well as our expectations for the 4 quarter.
th
After the financial review, I will touch briefly on our new product pipeline.
And, lastly, we will initiate Q&A.
Presentation
Overview of Third Quarter Results
Timothy M. Ring - C. R. Bard, Inc. - Chairman and CEO
Third quarter 2004 net sales totaled $421.9 million. This represents an increase of 17% over the third quarter of 2003. Currency impact this quarter versus Q3, 03 was favorable by 190 basis points. On a constant currency basis, the third quarter net sales increase was 15%.
In the U.S., third quarter net sales totaled $298.6 million, an increase of 15% over prior year. Outside of the U.S., net sales were $123.3 million, which is an increase of 20% and 13% on a reported and constant currency basis, respectively.
Turning to the P&L, all our comments on this call, regarding earnings per share figures, will reflect the Company's 2-for-1 stock split that became effective after the close of the market on May 28 this year.
Net income for the 3rd quarter was $102.4 million and diluted earnings per share were 95 cents, up 99% and 94% respectively over the same period in the prior year. Included in these results were certain items that increased income by $33.8 million, after tax, or 31 cents per diluted share. The primary item was a gain of $44.9 million or $30.8 million, after tax, related to the previously announced sale of certain assets of our Endoscopic Technologies Division. Additionally, we had two small items that added together total $3.0MM after tax.
We believe that excluding these items provides additional meaningful information about the comparability of our results of operations between periods. Excluding these items, 3rd quarter 2004 net income and diluted earnings per share were $68.6 million and 64 cents, up 33% percent and 31% percent, respectively, over the same period in the prior year.
Again, we were pleased with the level of growth generated in all our geographies this quarter. U.S. sales are up 15% while Europe growth was 21% as reported or 12% percent in constant currency. Japan sales increased by 16% this quarter and in our other international markets we grew at approximately 20% as reported and 15% on a constant currency basis. So, overall, nice balance across our geographies.
very
From a product perspective, vascular and oncology sales continued to be quite strong again this quarter, while our urology and surgery businesses both grew a bit above our guidance for the year.
Last year's expansion of our U.S. sales force, along with increased stability resulting from lower levels of voluntary sales force turnover, are continuing to have a positive impact. We have now commenced a further expansion of roughly 100 sales reps globally, including about 60 in the U.S. versus total additions of roughly 50, in '03. We have used a process similar to the one we used in 2003 to determine where to deploy the new reps in terms of product lines and geographies. We are confident in the benefits of this approach. Aside from the obvious benefits of a larger sales force, we see specific strategic value in having more feet on the street to generate more rapid exposure for our new products.
 
We didn't close on any acquisitions in the 3 quarter although we have already completed a small deal in October. In our usual tuck-in fashion, we acquired substantially all of the assets related to a unique, proprietary, closed suction catheter system from Sorenson Medical, Inc. This product is used to clear secretions from endotracheal tubes and will complement our long-term strategy for infection control related to ventilator associated pneumonia.
rd
While I'm on the topic of business development, let me also talk about the divestiture we closed, as of September 30. I'm sure most of you saw the announcement that we sold certain assets associated with our endoscopic technologies business, which we report in the GI category. The related products generated revenue of roughly $54MM in 2003 and $46MM for the 9 months ended 9/30/04 and represents less than 4% of our total current revenue. The deal excluded our enteral feeding and endoscopic suturing product lines.
In the past, we have talked about periodically assessing our businesses and product lines to determine how they fit into our overall strategy and growth profile. This transaction was a result of that process.
We are clearly happy with our performance for the third quarter as we continue to execute our growth strategy. I am very pleased with the way our organization has risen to all its challenges while running our very dynamic business. Although we have now had 4 consecutive quarters of double-digit revenue growth, we are still in transition, establishing our new performance range and consistency.
As I said last quarter, I think that 15% constant currency revenue growth is on the high side of where we can perform going forward, at least for the foreseeable future. In the coming quarters we will be up against tougher comps as we start to measure against these past 4 quarters of acceleration and our increased R&D investments continue to work their way through the pipeline. So don't start thinking of us as a 15% revenue growth company, our objective continues to be a double-digit growth company and, remember, that starts at 10%.
We continue to believe that our operating leverage is a key strength of Bard and our P&L management. That was evidenced by our strong gross margin - which topped 60% for the first time in our history as a public company - and excellent controls in our core SG&A spending.
We will give you additional perspective at our annual analyst meeting in New York City at 4:00 on December 15 when we give our '05 guidance and discuss more about our new product pipeline. Todd will cover our guidance for the 4 quarter in a few minutes.
th
 
I will now turn the discussion over to John Weiland, who will review product line revenue.
Product Line Review
John H. Weiland - C. R. Bard, Inc. President and COO
Good afternoon. As usual before I start, I need to remind you about how we look at our business in terms of revenue growth. We believe that, when discussing our product line results, eliminating the effect of changes in foreign exchange, which has a non-operating impact, provides the most meaningful measure of the core health of our various franchises. So, as we walk through our sales results, please note that all percentage growth data will be given in constant currency, unless specifically noted otherwise.
Vascular Products
Total net sales for the 3rd quarter in this category were 99.4 million dollars , which represents an increase of 25% over the prior year quarter, (28% as reported.) The U.S. experienced 32% growth in the quarter while our international business grew 18%.
Graft product sales this quarter were up 8%. Our Distaflo peripheral graft and Venaflo dialysis graft continue to be the performance highlights in this category. Growth in graft products this quarter was again boosted by OEM sales, which can be highly cyclical and which had another strong quarter. Excluding the impact of OEM, the category grew 4%.
The EP business was up 5% for Q3 helped by a strong performance internationally.
Our Endovascular products, which are 57% of the vascular category, had another terrific quarter, growing at 44%. Sales in the U.S. were up 65% while sales OUS were up 23%. Peripheral PTA catheters were up 58% on the strong performance of our Conquest as well as our new Atlas balloon catheters. Launched in the second quarter, Atlas is our larger diameter version of the very successful high pressure Conquest. Our self-expanding stents grew 57% in the 3rd quarter on the continued strength of both our expanded Luminexx stent line and our PTFE-encapsulated Fluency stent graft. Vena cava filters grew 97%.
Finally, our biopsy product line grew at 20% for the quarter reflecting the impact of our new Vacora vacuum assisted biopsy device in combination with our new dedicated biopsy sales team.
Urology Products
Total net sales for the 3rd quarter 2004 were 124.7 million dollars, an increase of 8% over 3rd quarter 2003 (or, 10% as reported.) The U.S. business, which was 73% of worldwide sales, grew at 8%, with International up 9%.
Our basic drainage business, which is 63% of total urology, grew 7% for the 3rd quarter. Sales in the U.S., which are 72% of the global total, grew 7%. Sales outside the U.S. were up 7% over Q3 last year. Our Bardex I.C. infection control catheter continued its strong and steady performance with growth of 15% in the U.S.
Sales in Urological specialties were up 5% in Q3 versus the prior year. The majority of our revenue here comes from brachtherapy, which was also up 5% for the quarter. While seed pricing remains an issue, we are pleased to see case volume continue to grow. Of particular highlight here is the success of our new SourceLink delivery system. Strategically, we have been very focused on acquiring or developing unique and proprietary, valued added products to further differentiate us in this space, and the SourceLink system does just that. 25% of our Brachytherapy seed sales are in proprietary and custom products and that figure is growing every quarter.
Our continence business had a very strong quarter increasing 22% globally. This was driven by our innovative lineup of surgical continence products, which posted a great performance with 62% growth. Our new Pelvilace TVT sling and Pelvisoft biomesh product for pelvic floor repair, both introduced in the 1st quarter, again were strong contributors. This is a reflection of the strength of our core technology in these high potential markets for the treatment of female incontinence and vaginal prolapse. Growth in this category was offset to a lesser extent this quarter by continued weakness in the Contigen product line.
Oncology Products
Total net sales in this category were 101.8 million dollars, representing an increase of 16% over the 3rd quarter of 2003, (18% as reported. ) Geographically, sales were up 18% in the U.S. and 13% in the international markets.
Our specialty access business, which is about three quarters of total oncology sales, posted another strong performance in the 3 quarter with a global sales increase of 20%. Our dialysis line was up 22% in Q3, on the continuing strength of our Hemosplit catheter. Keep in mind that we launched Hemosplit in late June last year and it got off to a very strong start - so a tougher comp is reflected in the 22% growth this quarter vs. 42% in the 2 quarter and these comps will continue to get tougher. Implanted ports continued their solid performance with growth of 18%. Growth in our PICC line was 33% this quarter with a healthy contribution from our new Power PICC.
rd
nd
Our G.I. business grew 6% globally in the 3rd quarter with double digit international growth offset by low single digit growth in the U.S.
Surgical Specialties
Surgical Specialties global sales increased 13%, (14% as reported,) over the 3rd quarter last year to 78.1 million dollars. Sales in the U.S., which were 80% of the total, were up 14% for the quarter while internationally we grew 11%.
Soft tissue repair products grew 15% for the 3 quarter. Our proprietary Perfix Plug and Kugel patch continue to drive our solid sales in groin hernia products while our Ventralex and Composix Kugel products for ventral repairs continue to generate strong growth in this category. Our international business continues to contribute some nice growth, up 17%.
rd
Our Salute hernia repair fixation system, acquired last quarter is off to a terrific start selling in line with our expectations in the 1 quarter out of the gate - and we believe we were pretty aggressive in forecasting this opportunity. This device is a terrific clinical complement to our leadership position and strong call point presence in the hernia repair market - a great example of our tuck-in acquisition strategy at work.
st
 
This concludes the net sales discussion. I will now turn you over to Todd Schermerhorn.
Financial Review
Todd C. Schermerhorn - C. R. Bard, Inc. Senior VP and CFO
Let's take a look at the company's 3rd quarter consolidated statement of income starting with gross profit margins, which we define as net sales less cost of goods sold. Actual gross profit of $253.8 million was up 23% over the prior year's figure of $207.1 million. As a percent of sales, 3rd quarter gross profit of 60.2% was 300 basis points ahead of prior year and up 80 basis points sequentially from Q2. The components of the increase continue to be heavily weighted towards cost improvements and volume leverage. However, mix and currency have also impacted us positively this quarter.
SG&A expenses were $130.8 million this quarter, representing 31.0% of sales, in line with our annual guidance and up only $300,000 in absolute terms from last quarter. As Tim mentioned, we continue to do a good job controlling core spending. We'd expect any volatility in SG&A to be driven by our investment agenda which is, of course, highly discretionary.
Along these lines, we expect SG&A, as a percentage of sales, to increase in Q4 as we roll out the next phase of our sales force expansion. We plan on moving pretty quickly here with its implementation so we think SG&A will be in the low 32's as a percentage of sales in Q4 - very similar to the change we saw in Q4 last year. This is reflected in the EPS guidance I'll give you shortly.
R&D expenditures of $28.6 million represent a 32% increase over the prior year's R&D expenditures of $21.6 million. As a percentage of sales our investment has increased from Q3 last year by 80 basis points to 6.8%. There were no in-process R&D charges this quarter. In general, the spending levels this quarter are what we'd describe as "organic".
Interest expense of $3.4 million for the 3rd quarter is up slightly from $3.2 million in the 3rd quarter 2003.
In the third quarter, our reported tax rate was 27.7%, due to the impact of the certain items Tim discussed earlier. The remainder of our income was taxed at a rate of 26.5%, consistent with our guidance.
Weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the quarter was 107.4 million. The company repurchased 550,000 shares during the 3rd quarter. We continue to expect to be a buyer of our stock from time to time.
The balance sheet as of September 30, 2004, reflects cash and short-term investments of $496.2 million, versus $450.2 million at June 30 2004. Net accounts receivable were $269.6 million, reflecting 57.5 Days, which is up a couple of days from the end of Q2 Inventory net of reserves was $150.2 million as of September 30, 2004, representing 89.1 days Capital expenditures totaled about $21 million this quarter as we continue to track to spend right in the range of our 2004 guidance of $80MM for the year. On the liability side, debt decreased $60.9 million from June 30th reflecting the impact of the divestiture this quarter. Debt to total capital at the end of the 3rd quarter was about 11%. Total shareholder investment was $1.271 billion at September 30, 2004. We continue to be pleased with the overall health of our balance sheet.
Now let's turn to guidance for Q4 starting with net sales growth in constant FX. Despite the fact that we saw another 15% quarter in Q3, we will see slightly declining revenue growth in Q4, mainly as a result of the more difficult comps, so our guidance is in the 10- 13% range for net sales growth, on a constant currency basis, in the fourth quarter, excluding the endoscopic divestiture, of course - still comfortably in double digits, in line with our goal.
For EPS, we are guiding $0.61 for Q4. Again, largely driven by our investment agenda and most notably the sales force expansion.
 
As is customary, I refer you to Bard's June 30, 2004 Form 10-Q and specifically to our disclosure regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures. I will now turn you back over to Tim Ring for an update on some of our new products.
New Product Update
Timothy M. Ring - C. R. Bard, Inc. Chairman and CEO
I'm going to give you a brief update on some of the key new products and projects we have been tracking on this call.
Let me start with an update of the impact of the products we have been highlighting from a growth standpoint. Our Conquest PTA balloon catheter, Fluency stent graft, Hemosplit dialysis catheter, Ventralex hernia patch and Recovery vena cava filter together represent an annual run rate of $107MM in the 3rd quarter, up 136% over the 3 quarter of 2003. These products had shown growth of over 400 and 200 percent respectively in Q1 and Q2 of this year.
rd
Of the major ongoing projects we have been discussing, our 2600 patient anti-infection endotracheal tube trial continues to progress nicely. We are in the process of expanding the number of centers from 40 to 60.
Our RF mesh, A-Fib ablation catheter project continues to progress. We are awaiting approval of our U.S. IDE. We've completed site selection and are working to initiate our multi-center European clinical trial.
For our AV Access stent graft project, we have completed the follow-up to the clinical trial and are targeting a PMA submission in the first half of next year.
We are continuing with enrollment for our Luminexx stent iliac trial. The first interim analysis is complete and the second is anticipated to be done this quarter. Overall, this trial is progressing nicely.
For the Uryx urethral bulking agent project, the PMA is still under review so, at this point, we anticipate that commercialization could occur in the first half of 2005. This assumes, as we've noted in the past, that we exercise our option to purchase the technology.
 
That concludes our presentation, I will now turn the call back to our moderator to facilitate the Q&A session and then make some closing remarks before we end the call.
Question and Answer Session
Milton Hsu
- Bear, Stearns & Company - Analyst
Hi everyone. Two questions here. Tim, I know you mentioned in your remarks you'll be talking about new products at the analysts meeting. But just for now, can you give us a sense of in what divisions your new products will be in January, if you happen to launch them then? You launched about four, five, key new products this past year. What can we look forward to in vascular and maybe the surgery division?
Timothy Ring
- C.R. Bard, Inc. - Chairman, CEO
We'll get into a lot more detail, Milton, in December. I will tell you that they are pretty evenly distributed, obviously targeting the higher growth businesses. We kind of look at it from that end of the stick. And if you look at where we're focusing the majority of our investments, it is in those businesses and markets that are growing double digits. So we look at it more from a growth opportunity than any particular emphasis in one product area or another. We'll get into a lot more detail in December.
Milton Hsu
- Bear, Stearns & Company - Analyst
Okay. And then maybe a question for John with respect to the sales force expansion. Can you -- I don't know in any way you can, sort of quantify or just give some qualitative comments about how much the sales force expansion contributed to the third quarter growth year-over-year in maybe the vascular division and the surgery division.
John Weiland
- C.R. Bard, Inc. - President, COO
Milton, we really don't give those numbers out, although we do believe it is having obviously a positive effect on both of those businesses. Moving into next year, those businesses will be the recipients of a portion of the 60 number that Tim mentioned in the United States. And they will also be the recipient of some of the additions in Europe where we will increase our sales force in Europe by approximately 25 people.
Timothy Ring
- C.R. Bard, Inc. - Chairman, CEO
The only thing I'd add, Milton, it gets very difficult to -- like once you've made soup to pull the ingredients out and say this is how much was this. This is how much was that. When you look at all the new products that we've launched, it is difficult to say, well this percentage is due to the new products and this is due to the new territory. We know directionally they are both good. That's kind of how we look at it.
Milton Hsu
- Bear, Stearns & Company - Analyst
Okay, and just one last question for Todd. In your gross margin, can you just break down, you know, how many basis points were due to volume and mix?

Sure, Milton. mix was around 50 to 60 basis points -- this is over Q3 of the prior year. Price is around a negative10 to 20. Foreign exchange is between 30 and 50, we estimate. And then cost is the remainder, low 200s.
Milton Hsu
- Bear, Stearns & Company - Analyst
Great. Thanks a lot.
Todd Schermerhorn
- C.R. Bard, Inc. - Senior Vice President and CFO
Okay.
John Calcagnini
- CIBC World Markets - Analyst
Good afternoon, guys. You're getting closer. You only beat by 12% this time on the bottom line. But a good quarter. But I did want to ask you about the guidance, because it seems this is a consistent trend. And I wanted to talk to first Todd about your comment about 10 to 13 % constant currency growth. Is that off the 381.2 million in revenue reported for 4Q '04?
Todd Schermerhorn
- C.R. Bard, Inc. Senior Vice President and CFO
That would be after the adjusted number for the BET -- what we call the -- endoscopic divestiture.
John Calcagnini
- CIBC World Markets - Analyst
Okay. So what was endoscopic in the fourth quarter of '03?
Todd Schermerhorn
- C.R. Bard, Inc. - Senior Vice President and CFO
$14.5 million.
- CIBC World Markets - Analyst
John Calcagnini
Okay, and so we're, taking endoscopic out of both years.
Todd Schermerhorn
- C.R. Bard, Inc. - Senior Vice President and CFO
That's correct.
- CIBC World Markets - Analyst
John Calcagnini
And then what are you using for currency for the fourth quarter?
Todd Schermerhorn
- C.R. Bard, Inc. - Senior Vice President and CFO
It's a probably a point or so, John, maybe just a little more than that.
John Calcagnini
- CIBC World Markets - Analyst
Okay, so what can you give us as a hard number for sales for the fourth quarter, what you're expecting?
Todd Schermerhorn
- C.R. Bard, Inc. - Senior Vice President and CFO
No.
- CIBC World Markets - Analyst
John Calcagnini
Okay. It just seems that you're being a little bit conservative. Because I would assume sales are going to increase sequentially by quite a bit, perhaps 430 million or something like that.
Todd Schermerhorn
- C.R. Bard, Inc. - Senior Vice President and CFO
John, I would say, it is not a really big pullback here. We're just saying the growth rates will fall marginally in the fourth quarter. In fact, I would say the change is so small, it's a little difficult to even tease out of our internal data.
John Calcagnini
- CIBC World Markets - Analyst
I understand.
Todd Schermerhorn
- C.R. Bard, Inc. - Senior Vice President and CFO
Go ahead.
- CIBC World Markets - Analyst
John Calcagnini
What would you say the gross profit margin would be in the fourth quarter?
Todd Schermerhorn
- C.R. Bard, Inc. - Senior Vice President and CFO
I don't know exactly what it will be, John. But I do think we still believe it is going up. As you know, this was a great quarter from a gross margin standpoint. And we've been predicting improvements sequentially each quarter and we continue to get it. And we still think there is room there. So you should expect that WE will, I don't know exactly BY how much, but you should expect that will go north in Q4.
John Calcagnini
- CIBC World Markets - Analyst
I mean, is 61% reasonable? It is your biggest volume quarter of the year, right?
Todd Schermerhorn
- C.R. Bard, Inc. - Senior Vice President and CFO
Again, John, I wouldn't put a number on it necessarily at this point. We just know that -- there's a lot of calculations in our gross margin, viewing it forward, it is a little tough to put a fine line on. We just know that directionally it is going to move positively.
John Calcagnini
- CIBC World Markets - Analyst
Okay, thank you.
Matthew Dodds
- Smith Barney - Analyst
This is a question for John. On the peripheral side, there's a pretty new market developing for cutting balloons, cryo. Also there's another product out there for arthrectomy. And it looks like that market is doing like $100 million run rate. You're still doing really well in PTA, and self-expanding stents. So I'm just wondering what you think the market is growing for peripheral procedures. If the market is accelerating or do you think over time somebody's cutting devices might eat into the balloon and stent market.
John Weiland
- C.R. Bard, Inc. - President, COO
We believe that market is growing at about 11% today. We do believe that those cutting instruments, as you mentioned, could cause a slight decrease to that over time. Although we've seen some response from customers towards those devices, particularly arthrectomy devices, we've not seen a huge uptick in market moving towards them.
Matthew Dodds
- Smith Barney - Analyst
One final question on soft tissue repair, if you include the Salute, should we assume that that business is now about a 15% grower with Salute, or do you think this will actually bring it back up a little bit?
John Weiland
- C.R. Bard, Inc. - President, COO
No, I think as we've said consistently in terms of our hernia repair business, as we continue to grow the size of that business, that our growth rates could have a tendency to slide down. We think that the Onux acquisition is a good product to help us maintain our growth rate or at least prevent some of the slide from happening.
Todd Schermerhorn
- C.R. Bard, Inc. Senior Vice President and CFO
There is only one quarter left in the year, Matt. So we'll give you a little more granularity obviously in December with our '05 guidance.
Matthew Dodds
- Smith Barney - Analyst
All right. Thanks, Todd. Thanks, John.
Glenn Novarro
- Banc of America Securities - Analyst
Okay. Two questions. One R & D. I know it moves around from quarter to quarter and there's some variability based on acquisitions. How should we think about R & D spend in the fourth quarter? That's question number one. And Todd, maybe can you help us out a little bit on where we are in this gross margin expansion story? Are we kind of in the seventh or eighth inning? Or maybe in the fifth inning? Are we going to see another 300 basis point improvement next year? Maybe if you could put a little color around that. That'd be helpful.
Todd Schermerhorn
- C.R. Bard, Inc. - Senior Vice President and CFO
You know, we have said for quite a while, the plant consolidation we did a couple years back is mostly through. This improvement is coming from manufacturing leverage. And a little bit of mix in our gross profit, in terms of the products we're selling and the products that are growing the fastest. And we would view this, Glenn, as a continuous improvement story going forward. It is a little hard to quantify exactly from one period to the next what it is going to be. But we have learned a nice skill there in terms of leverage in our scale. And we view it as a positive, continuous, improvement story going forward.
Glenn Novarro
- Banc of America Securities - Analyst
Is there a target you would be willing to throw out?
Todd Schermerhorn
- C.R. Bard, Inc. - Senior Vice President and CFO
No, of course not. It is a gradual improvement process. I don't think there is any one number we're shooting for. We just want to get better and better every time we come back here. I think relative to R & D, our current plans have it increasing just a little bit in Q4.
Glenn Novarro
- Banc of America Securities - Analyst
Okay, great. Thank you.
Mimi Pham
- American Technologies - Analyst
Hi, can you talk about the PV mesh catheter, talk about how many cases you performed in Europe and then any preliminary comments on the ease of use or any data you've seen so far.
John Weiland
- C.R. Bard, Inc. - President, COO
It is too early to tell at this point in time, Mimi. The two primary thought leaders in Europe have both utilized the product, but it's not been rolled out to any large scale thus far. It will take us a few more quarters to really get that under our belt to give you a viewpoint for how we see that developing.
Mimi Pham
- American Technologies - Analyst
In terms of initiating the multicenter trial, does that still keep you on track for an '05 European launch?
John Weiland
- C.R. Bard, Inc. - President, COO
We're still, in our minds, on track for an '05 European launch, and we're focused on '06 for the United States.
Mimi Pham
- American Technologies - Analyst
Okay, then in terms of the '06, can you share details of the IDE, in terms of number of patients, trial design, follow-up period.
Timothy Ring
- C.R. Bard, Inc. - Chairman, CEO
We're still in discussions with the FDA. And we have not finalized that yet.
Mimi Pham
- American Technologies - Analyst
Okay. Thank you very much.
Robert Goldman
- Buckingham Research Group - Analyst
Yeah, I've got three questions. Let me just throw them out and basically get an answer. First to put the 100 additional salespeople in perspective. If you could just remind us of the number of sales folks you have right now. Second question, Tim, characterizing the endotracheal tube clinical trial as progressing nicely, is amore positive comment than I've heard on that in the past. In the past we heard enrollment of patients was really quite difficult and slow. I'm Just curious what you meant by that. What's improved. And finally, and more strategically, Tim, in R & D, as would be the case with any company, your expenses include money spent on work by Bard employees as well as milestone payments and such, outside the company. Could you give us some sense of what that breakdown is and how you benchmark that against other med tech companies.
Timothy Ring
- C.R. Bard, Inc. - Chairman, CEO
I'll let John answer the first two. And then I'll take the last one.
John Weiland
- C.R. Bard, Inc. - President, COO
In terms of the sales force, to date we have approximately 550 reps in the United States and approximately 250 reps in Europe. They will be the primary beneficiaries of the 100 sales rep increase that Tim talked about earlier. We do have planned a moderate expansion in China of approximately eight reps today. We also are considering some additional expansions into the Canadian markets, although we're not finished with that analysis yet and that is not included in the 100 rep increase. Regarding the endotracheal tube trial, I think our comments are really focused on the fact that we continue to enroll. And that we receivedd a positive indication from the FDA on expanding the number of sites from 40 to 60. I think the positive nature of our comments is that we see an opportunity with this expansionto enroll patients at an even faster rate. And we're hopeful that the clinical outcome of this trial will be extremely positive.
Timothy Ring
- C.R. Bard, Inc. - Chairman, CEO
Relative to the R & D strategic expense question, I would say -- I don't have the exact number. I would say 90% of our expense is internal. How that compares to other companies, in this space? I think the medical device field, as long as I've been in it, has always been almost a tinkering business between customers, physicians, or clinicians, big companies and small companies. And I see that continuing probably forever. So I don't think we're that different from any of the other companies that I'm familiar with. But we've never profiled it as such. We continue to work process extremely hard. We continue to do our twice a year R & D meetings, John, Todd and I participate in that, where we spend a full day with every division, technology center, going through their pipeline. You'll hear in December from John DeFord who joined us early this year as our vice president of science and technology. John's got 20+ years in the medical device field, is a Ph.D. biomedical engineer. And he will show how he' s refined the process even more than we have, so we work that very, very hard here. And continue to -- it's an execution issue for us at this point.
Robert Goldman
- Buckingham Research Group - Analyst
If I can just follow-up, Tim. And I think you started to answer this question. But Bard is is clearly moving from the world of 510Ks to the world of PMAs. I think all of the development projects you shared with us today are PMAs. What can you do to give us that sense of confidence that, basically in making that adjustment ,Bard isn't moving over its head, since it is new territory for the company.
Timothy Ring
- C.R. Bard, Inc. - Chairman, CEO
Well, it is not that new. When we had a cardiology business, which several of us were involved in managing, we had a lot of PMA projects. In terms of the team that is present here, especially on the quality/regulatory side, a lot of those same people are still here. Some have even come back. I feel very confident. It is one of the things we review when we do these R&D sessions. Do you have enough resources? Do you have enough regulatory support? And I can tell you some of the people that we've hired in that function over the last couple of years, in the businesses where they are doing more PMAs, those people are extremely experienced. They've come from companies where they've done only PMAs. So I feel extremely confident in our ability -- I mean we're not going to bat an eye switching over to PMA projects.
Robert Goldman
- Buckingham Research Group - Analyst
Okay. Thank you.
John Calcagnini
- CIBC World Markets - Analyst
Okay, guys, I wonder if you can comment on the enteral feeding business. What will be the run rate of that business on, let's say in 4Q? What should we expect to see there? And why did you retain the endocinch business and what is that doing in revenue going forward as well?
John Weiland
- C.R. Bard, Inc. - President, COO
Sure, let me talk about the enteral feeding business. We see that in the mid-single digit range today. And the reason that - -
John Calcagnini
- CIBC World Markets - Analyst
Meaning that it's a $5 million business, or?
John Weiland
- C.R. Bard, Inc. - President, COO
No, no, it's about a $25 million business that we kept in that area.
John Calcagnini
- CIBC World Markets - Analyst
Okay, I meant quarterly, but okay, 25.
John Weiland
- C.R. Bard, Inc. - President, COO
And we see the market growth rates at about the mid-single digit range. The reason that we kept that business is that we think that the technology and development cycle fits very nicely into the same technology space that we're in with our access systems business. You probably noted that our access systems business is one of our fastest growing. And that's because of their ability to really innovate from a new products standpoint. We think that putting those products, that have very applicable technologies, into Access will allow us to introduce more new products faster than we've been able to do historically. That's why we think it is a good opportunity. In terms of the EndoCinch product line, we don't expect to see any real movement in that product line until sometime in the year 2006 when reimbursement in that space gets straightened out somewhat. And as you probably know, those products aren't reimbursed to a very full degree today. We also think there are some additional technology spaces that we can take EndoCinch to - in the future from a new product development standpoint. And that is going to be part of our Davol division, our surgical business, which has also been a very innovative portion of Bard's overall R & D development pipeline.
John Calcagnini
- CIBC World Markets - Analyst
So you're moving EndoCinch to Surgical, or?
John Weiland
- C.R. Bard, Inc. - President, COO
To Surgical. That is correct.
John Calcagnini
- CIBC World Markets - Analyst
Okay, and that business is what, about a half million a quarter or something?
John Weiland
- C.R. Bard, Inc. - President, COO
That's about a million dollar business totally on a full year basis, it's not very much.
John Calcagnini
- CIBC World Markets - Analyst
Okay. And are there other businesses that you might acquire in the enteral feeding area? How should we think about building out that business going forward? And if you can comment on the other applications for EndoCinch, we'd love to hear that as well.
John Weiland
- C.R. Bard, Inc. - President, COO
I think first of all, we are very comfortable that our team out in Access can take the feeding business to the next level from an internal development standpoint. If the opportunity presents itself for a rollup, I think we'd certainly look at it. Although we've not seen that historically in that space. What was the second piece, John?
John Calcagnini
- CIBC World Markets - Analyst
I had a question on EndoCinch. Can you comment on some of the other applications for that technology.
John Weiland
- C.R. Bard, Inc. - President, COO
I would say that the area that we see some potential is in the whole gastric bypass area, but it is very early to tell yet.
John Calcagnini
- CIBC World Markets - Analyst
Okay. Thank you.
- C.R. Bard, Inc. - President, COO
John Weiland
You're welcome.
Tom Kouchoukos
- Stifel Nicolaus - Analyst
Hi. Thanks for taking my question.You guys put up a pretty big number in surgical incontinence products. I was wondering if that's just a result of the market growing or you guys taking share as you guys have rolled out PelviLace and PelviSoft?
John Weiland
- C.R. Bard, Inc. - President, COO
Sure, Tom, it's all a result of new products. Over the last three years we've really filled out the product lines that we've had both in the sling market and the pelvic floor market, and you are seeing a direct impact of new product sales.
Tom Kouchoukos
- Stifel Nicolaus - Analyst
Okay, and within that, is there an approach that's gaining more traction? Is there a transobturator approach or a top-down that you guys have noticed the most adoption with?
John Weiland
- C.R. Bard, Inc. - President, COO
We certainly think that the transobturator approach is a very positive space. And we participate in that. We're seeing growth in that. Although we're seeing growth across the spectrum - in slings and in pelvic floor, both.
Tom Kouchoukos
- Stifel Nicolaus - Analyst
And you mentioned pelvic floor. Will you guys be pursuing -- as some of your competitors will, the less invasive approaches, incorporating those incontinence tools into prolapse repair?
John Weiland
- C.R. Bard, Inc. - President, COO
We certainly have a number of areas in our product pipeline and R & D focus that are squarely looking at the least invasive approach toward that surgery.
Todd Schermerhorn
- C.R. Bard, Inc. - CFO, SVP
Tom, we're going to get into that in a lot more detail, I think, in this meeting in December.
Tom Kouchoukos
- Stifel Nicolaus - Analyst
Okay. Great. And I wanted to follow-up. One, on your PICC product line. I think a couple calls ago you guys had indicated that the launch would be kind of a staged launch that would finish internationally by mid-2005. Is it fully launched in the U.S. market and are you guys on schedule internationally in that product?
John Weiland
- C.R. Bard, Inc. - President, COO
We have launched it fully in the United States and the launch internationally will really happen on a market-by-market basis. We don't think the technology may be quite right for the economic scenarios in certain countries. But we're rolling that out on a country-by-country basis.
Tom Kouchoukos
- Stifel Nicolaus - Analyst
Okay. Great, thank you.
Glenn Novarro
- Banc of America Securities - Analyst
Just a couple of housekeeping questions. The other income line was higher than we were forecasting. Any color there? Any one-timers we should be aware of? Is a tax rate of 26.5 a good number for 4Q?
Todd Schermerhorn
- C.R. Bard, Inc. - Senior Vice President and CFO
Yes. It is mainly interest income. And foreign exchange. Well, actually of the 50.7, 48.4 is the certain items Tim talked about. The remainder of that, you do the math, is 2.3, and that is interest income and FX.
Glenn Novarro
- Banc of America Securities - Analyst
Okay. And then tax rate of 26.5 good for 4 Q?
Todd Schermerhorn
- C.R. Bard, Inc. - Senior Vice President and CFO
Yeah. We think so.
-
Glenn Novarro
Banc of America Securities - Analyst
Thanks, guys.
Closing Comments
Timothy Ring
- C.R. Bard, Inc. - Chairman, CEO
This was another terrific quarter for Bard. We continue to make great progress in the execution of our growth strategy and look forward to the impact it will have on long-term shareholder value.

"Net sales on a constant currency basis", "ongoing net sales" and "net income and diluted earnings per share excluding certain items" are non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP, please see the attached tables. The company analyzes net sales on a constant currency and ongoing basis to better measure the comparability of results between periods. Because changes in foreign currency exchange rates have a non-operating impact on net sales, the company believes that evaluating growth in net sales on a constant currency basis provides an additional and meaningful assessment of net sales. The company believes that comparing ongoing net sales between periods provides an additional and meaningful analysis of comparable operations. Net income and diluted EPS excluding certain items are used by the company to measure the comparability of results between periods. Because certain items such as divestiture activity and litigation outcomes may not reflect underlying operating results, the company believes the exclusion of these and similar items provides an additional and meaningful assessment of net income and diluted EPS. The limitation of these non-GAAP measures is that they may exclude items that impact actual GAAP results. All non-GAAP financial measures are intended to supplement the applicable GAAP disclosures and should not be viewed as a replacement for GAAP results.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
, in addition to interest income and exchange gains and losses, other (income) expense, net included the adjustment of a fourth quarter 2003 reserve recorded in connection with a legal verdict. This adjustment resulted in additional pretax income of $16.0 million ($9.8 million after-tax; $0.09 diluted earnings per share), partially offset by a charge for an unrelated legal settlement of $3.9 million pretax ($2.3 million after-tax; $0.02 diluted earnings per share). In addition the company recorded a $1.1 million tax credit in income tax provision related to the retroactive effective date of its Malaysian high-technology pioneer grant ($0.01 diluted earnings per share).
For the first quarter of 2004
 
, in addition to interest income and exchange gains and losses, other (income) expense, net included a charge for a legal settlement partially offset by an investment gain, which resulted in a net pretax charge of $4.3 million ($2.6 million after-tax; $0.02 diluted earnings per share).
For the second quarter of 2004
 
, in addition to interest income and exchange gains and losses, other (income) expense, net included a gain from the sale of certain assets of the company's Endoscopic Technologies division of $44.9 million pretax ($30.8 million after-tax; $0.29 diluted earnings per share).

MURRAY HILL, NJ
 
For the first quarter 2005, net sales in the U.S. were $300.4 million and net sales outside the U.S. were $128.2 million, both up 9 percent over the prior-year period. Excluding the impact of the 2004 divestiture and foreign exchange, first quarter 2005 ongoing net sales in the U.S. and outside the U.S. increased 14 percent and 7 percent, respectively, over the prior-year period.
 
For the first quarter 2005, net income was $81.3 million and diluted earnings per share were 75 cents, an increase of 13 percent and 12 percent, respectively, over the prior-year period.
 
The 2005 first quarter results included certain items that increased net income by $2.0 million (after-tax), or 2 cents per diluted share. Excluding certain items, first quarter 2005 net income was $79.3 million and diluted earnings per share were 73 cents. Net income and diluted earnings per share, excluding certain items, increased by 25 percent and 24 percent, respectively, for the first quarter 2005, as compared to the prior-year period.
 
"We are pleased to start 2005 with good momentum. Revenue growth for the first quarter was strong across all of our major product groups, reflecting the power of our broad portfolio and the importance of new technology," commented Timothy M. Ring, chairman and chief executive officer. "Our earnings performance benefited from healthy gross margin expansion and lower operating spending for the quarter. Going forward, we will leverage our operating efficiencies to provide us with the means to invest in our key franchises, deliver innovative clinical solutions and enhance shareholder value."

This press release may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are based on management's current expectations, the accuracy of which is necessarily subject to risks and uncertainties. These statements are not historical in nature and use words such as "anticipate", "estimate", "expect", "project", "intend", "forecast", "plan", "believe", and other words of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. Many factors may cause actual results to differ materially from anticipated results including product developments, sales efforts, expenses, the outcomes of contingencies such as legal proceedings, and other economic, business, competitive and regulatory factors. The company undertakes no obligation to update its forward-looking statements. Please refer to our December 31, 2004 10-K for more detailed information about these and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied.
 
The company sold certain assets of its Endoscopic Technologies division on September 30, 2004. Net sales excluding sales of the divested Endoscopic Technologies products are referred to as "ongoing net sales". The earnings per share figures reported in this press release reflect the company's two-for-one common stock split that became effective on May 28, 2004.
 
"Net sales, excluding foreign exchange", "ongoing net sales" and "net income and diluted earnings per share excluding certain items" are non-GAAP financial measures. The company analyzes net sales on a constant currency and ongoing basis to better measure the comparability of results between periods. Because changes in foreign currency exchange rates have a non-operating impact on net sales, the company believes that evaluating growth in net sales on a constant currency basis provides an additional and meaningful assessment of net sales. The company believes that comparing ongoing net sales between periods provides an additional and meaningful analysis of comparable operations. Net income and EPS excluding certain items are used by the company to measure the comparability of results between periods. Because certain items such as investment gains and litigation outcomes may not reflect underlying operating results, the company believes the exclusion of these and similar items provides an additional and meaningful assessment of net income and EPS. The limitation of these non-GAAP measures is that, by excluding certain items, they do not reflect results on a standardized reporting basis. All non-GAAP financial measures are intended to supplement the applicable GAAP disclosures and should not be viewed as a replacement for GAAP results.

ITEM 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On October 21, 2005, Bard Shannon Limited ("Bard Shannon"), an Irish corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of C. R. Bard, Inc., a New Jersey corporation (the "Company"), and the other parties thereto entered into a Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement"). The Credit Agreement provides for the extension of unsecured credit in the form of revolving loans during the three-year term of the Credit Agreement, in an aggregate principal amount outstanding not in excess of $250,000,000. The loans may be made in U.S. Dollars, Sterling or Euros.
 
The Credit Agreement is to be used for general corporate purposes, including in connection with the Company's plans to repatriate undistributed earnings to the U.S. in compliance with the American Jobs Creation Act. Bard Shannon anticipates that it will borrow under the Credit Agreement an aggregate amount of up to $200,000,000, in one or a series of borrowings, on or before December 31, 2005.
 
Interest under the Credit Agreement is based on, at Bard Shannon's option, (i) LIBOR plus a specified margin per annum or (ii) the higher of the prime rate of Bank of America, N.A. or 0.50% over the federal funds rate. Bard Shannon is also required to pay, on a quarterly basis, a facility fee on the daily unused amount of the commitments under the Credit Agreement.
 
Accrued interest on drawn prime rate loans is payable on a quarterly basis, and accrued interest on drawn LIBOR loans is payable on the date that is, at Bard Shannon's option, one, two, three or six months after the borrowing date. Any outstanding loans under the Credit Agreement are to be repaid on October 21, 2008.
 
Pursuant to covenants in the Credit Agreement, Bard Shannon must maintain a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum interest expense coverage ratio. In addition, the Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, as well as customary events of default. The Credit Agreement will expire on the earlier of (a) October 21, 2008 and (b) the date of termination in whole of the commitments upon an optional termination or reduction of the commitments by Bard Shannon or upon an event of default.

 (January 13, 2006)  C. R. Bard, Inc. (NYSE-BCR) today announced that it is voluntarily recalling its Bard Composix Kugel Mesh X-Large Patch intended for ventral hernia repair. This recall does not affect any of the company's other hernia repair products.
MURRAY HILL, NJ
 
The company is initiating this recall due to reports that the device's plastic coil ring, designed to aid in its deployment, may not withstand the increased stress associated with certain surgical placement techniques. The company has received 24 reports of broken rings out of approximately 32,000 units sold since 2002, a rate of approximately 0.08%.
 
The products affected by this recall were distributed to customers worldwide. Bard has notified affected customers and the appropriate regulatory agencies, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
 
The three product codes involved generated sales of approximately $11 million in 2005, before the effect of the recall.
 
The company expects to record a sales reduction and related charges associated with the recall in the 2005 fourth quarter and these adjustments will cause the company's results to be below previously stated guidance for the quarter. The company remains comfortable with its previously stated guidance for 2006 of constant currency net sales growth of between 9 percent and 10 percent and diluted earnings per share equivalent to a minimum of $3.42, excluding the effect of FAS123R.
 
C. R. Bard, Inc. (), headquartered in Murray Hill, N.J., is a leading multinational developer, manufacturer, and marketer of innovative, life-enhancing medical technologies in the fields of vascular, urology, oncology and surgical specialty products.

This press release may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are based on management's current expectations, the accuracy of which is necessarily subject to risks and uncertainties. These statements are not historical in nature and use words such as "anticipate", "estimate", "expect", "project", "intend", "forecast", "plan", "believe", and other words of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. Many factors may cause actual results to differ materially from anticipated results including product developments, sales efforts, income tax matters, the outcomes of contingencies such as legal proceedings, and other economic, business, competitive and regulatory factors.

Net sales, excluding foreign exchange, ongoing net sales and net income and diluted earnings per share (EPS) excluding certain items are non-GAAP financial measures. The company analyzes net sales on a constant currency and ongoing basis to better measure the comparability of results between periods. Because changes in foreign currency exchange rates have a non-operating impact on net sales, the company believes that evaluating growth in net sales on a constant currency basis provides an additional and meaningful assessment of net sales. The company believes that comparing ongoing net sales between periods provides an additional and meaningful analysis of comparable operations. Net income
and EPS excluding certain items are used by the company to measure the comparability of results between periods. Certain items such as investment gains and litigation outcomes may not reflect underlying operating results, and other items such as the FAS123R stock option expense may affect the comparability of results between periods. As a result, the company believes the exclusion of these and similar items provides an additional and meaningful assessment of net income and EPS. The limitation of these non-GAAP measures is that, by excluding certain items, they do not reflect results on a standardized reporting basis. All non-GAAP financial measures are intended to supplement the applicable GAAP disclosures and should not be viewed as a replacement for GAAP results. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures, please see the investor relations section of the company's web site, www.crbard.com.

Fourth quarter 2005 net sales were $452.0 million, an increase of 7 percent over the prior-year period on both a reported and constant currency basis. As previously announced, during the quarter the company initiated a voluntary product recall of its Composix Kugel Mesh X-Large Patch. The fourth quarter 2005 results include a reduction in net sales associated with the recall of $7.8 million, resulting in a 2 percentage point reduction in constant currency net sales growth.

For the fourth quarter 2005, net sales in the U.S. were $308.3 million and net sales outside the U.S. were $143.7 million, up 6 percent and 8 percent, respectively, over the prior-year period. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, fourth quarter 2005 net sales outside the U.S. increased 11 percent over the prior-year period. The recall reduced fourth quarter 2005 net sales in the U.S. by $7.4 million, resulting in a 2 percentage point reduction in net sales growth.
 
Net sales for the full year 2005 were $1,771.3 million, an increase of 7 percent over the prior year. Excluding the impact of a 2004 divestiture and foreign exchange, full year 2005 ongoing net sales increased 9 percent over the prior year. The recall resulted in a reduction of 1 percentage point in full year 2005 ongoing net sales growth in constant currency.
 
For the fourth quarter 2005, net income was $80.1 million and diluted earnings per share were 75 cents, both up 15 percent over the prior-year period. The 2005 fourth quarter results included certain items that increased net income by $2.1 million (after-tax), or 2 cents per diluted share. Excluding certain items, fourth quarter 2005 net income was $78.0 million and diluted earnings per share were 73 cents, both up 12 percent as compared to the prior-year period. Included in the 2005 fourth quarter results were a reduction in net sales and charges associated with the recall that reduced net income by $6.6 million (after-tax), or 6 cents per diluted share.
 
For the full year 2005, net income was $337.1 million and diluted earnings per share were $3.12, both up 11 percent over the prior-year period. The full year 2005 results included certain items that increased net income by $16.0 million (after-tax), or 15 cents per diluted share. For comparison, the full year 2004 results included certain items that increased net income by $40.1 million (after-tax), or 37 cents per diluted share. Excluding these items in both periods, net income and diluted earnings per share for the full year 2005 increased 22 percent and 21 percent, respectively, as compared to the prior-year period.
 
Timothy M. Ring, chairman and chief executive officer, commented, "We are pleased to report that 2005 was another solid year for Bard. Operationally, our portfolio of businesses and products is well positioned across a broad range of medical device markets. We continue to focus on expanding the definition of these markets and therefore the opportunity they represent. We have strong management teams driving our businesses forward, leveraging our new product pipeline and market leadership positions.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 (October 18, 2006)  C. R. Bard, Inc. (NYSE-BCR) today reported 2006 third quarter financial results. Third quarter 2006 net sales were $498.9 million, an increase of 13 percent over the prior-year period. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, third quarter 2006 net sales increased 12 percent over the prior-year period.
MURRAY HILL, NJ
For the third quarter 2006, net sales in the U.S. were $349.2 million and net sales outside the U.S. were $149.7 million, up 12 percent and 13 percent, respectively, over the prior-year period. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, third quarter 2006 net sales outside the U.S. increased 10 percent over the prior-year period.
For the third quarter 2006, net income was $87.6 million and diluted earnings per share were 82 cents. Net income and diluted earnings per share, as reported, were down 3 percent and 1 percent, respectively, as compared to third quarter 2005 results. Adjusting for certain items that affect comparability between periods, third quarter 2006 net income was $92.8 million and diluted earnings per share were 87 cents, up 11 percent and 13 percent, respectively, as compared to third quarter 2005 results on a comparable basis. Adjustments to the third quarter 2006 results reduced net income by $5.2 million (after-tax), or 5 cents per diluted share, and included a charge of $8.8 million (after-tax), or 8 cents per diluted share for share-based compensation under FAS 123R and other items listed in the table below. Adjustments to the third quarter 2005 results included items that increased net income by $6.8 million (after-tax), or 6 cents per diluted share.
Timothy M. Ring, chairman and chief executive officer, commented, "We are pleased to deliver another quarter of solid, double-digit revenue growth. Our ability to grow our top line above our goal of 10 percent in constant currency in today's market reflects the productivity of our strategic growth initiatives and the value our products bring to our customers and their patients.

This press release may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are based on management's current expectations, the accuracy of which is necessarily subject to risks and uncertainties. These statements are not historical in nature and use words such as "anticipate", "estimate", "expect", "project", "intend", "forecast", "plan", "believe", and other words of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. Many factors may cause actual results to differ materially from anticipated results including product developments, sales efforts, income tax matters, the outcomes of contingencies such as legal proceedings, and other economic, business, competitive and regulatory factors. The company undertakes no obligation to update its forward-looking statements. Please refer to our June 30, 2006 10-Q for more detailed information about these and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied.
Net sales excluding foreign exchange and net income and diluted earnings per share (EPS) excluding certain items that affect the comparability of results between periods are non-GAAP financial measures. The company analyzes net sales on a constant currency basis to better measure the comparability of results between periods. Because changes in foreign currency exchange rates have a non-operating impact on net sales, the company believes that evaluating growth in net sales on a constant currency basis provides an additional and meaningful assessment of net sales. Net income and EPS excluding certain items are used by the company to measure the comparability of results between periods. Certain items such as investment gains, acquisition-related charges and litigation outcomes may not reflect underlying operating results, and other items such as the FAS 123R stock option expense may affect the comparability of results between periods. As a result, the company believes the exclusion of these and similar items provides an additional and meaningful assessment of charges in net income and EPS. The limitation of these non-GAAP measures is that, by excluding certain items, they do not reflect results on a standardized reporting basis. All non-GAAP financial measures are intended to supplement the applicable GAAP disclosures and should not be viewed as a replacement for GAAP results. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures, please see the attached tables.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 (April 24, 2007)  C. R. Bard, Inc. (NYSE-BCR) today reported 2007 first quarter financial results. First quarter 2007 net sales were $528.2 million, an increase of 13 percent over the prior-year period. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, first quarter 2007 net sales increased 11 percent over the prior-year period.
MURRAY HILL, NJ
For the first quarter 2007, net sales in the U.S. were $373.9 million and net sales outside the U.S. were $154.3 million, up 14 percent and 12 percent, respectively, over the prior-year period. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, first quarter 2007 net sales outside the U.S. increased 6 percent over the prior-year period.
In the first quarter 2007, the company completed its previously disclosed plan to withdraw from the synthetic bulking market and discontinue the sale of the Tegress synthetic bulking product, which was formerly reported in the Urology product group. Consequently, the company will account for this withdrawal as a discontinued operation for all periods referred to in this release.
For the first quarter 2007, income from continuing operations was $101.6 million and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were 95 cents, both up 25 percent as compared to first quarter 2006 results. Adjusting for certain items that affect comparability between periods, first quarter 2007 income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were both up 16 percent as compared to first quarter 2006 results. Adjustments to the first quarter 2006 results included an item detailed in the tables below that decreased net income by $6.3 million (after-tax), or 6 cents per diluted share.
"We are pleased to begin Bard's centennial year with a quarter of healthy revenue and earnings growth. Recent new product introductions and increased demand for many of our existing technologies helped drive solid net sales growth in each of our four businesses," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Timothy M. Ring. "We continue to be pleased with the execution and productivity of our strategic growth initiatives. Looking ahead, we see ample opportunity to expand our investment in market-leading technologies."

These statements are not historical in nature and use words such as "anticipate", "estimate", "expect", "project", "intend", "forecast", "plan", "believe", and other words of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance.

This press release contains financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP measures in the tables above.
This press release includes net sales excluding the impact of foreign exchange. The company analyzes net sales on a constant currency basis to better measure the comparability of results between periods. Because changes in foreign currency exchange rates have a non-operating impact on net sales, the company believes that evaluating growth in net sales on a constant currency basis provides an additional and meaningful assessment of net sales to both management and the company's investors.
In addition, this press release includes the following non-GAAP measures: (1) research & development expense excluding payments for purchased research and development; (2) income tax provision excluding the tax effect of the item in (1) above; (3) income from continuing operations excluding the items set forth in (1) and (2) above; and (4) diluted earnings per share (EPS) excluding the items set forth in (1) and (2) above.
The company excluded the items described above because they may cause certain statement of income categories not to be indicative of ongoing operating results, and therefore affect the comparability of results between periods. The company therefore believes that these non-GAAP measures provide an additional and meaningful assessment of the company's ongoing operating performance. Because the company has historically reported these non-GAAP results to the investment community, management also believes that the inclusion of these non-GAAP measures provides consistency in its financial reporting and facilitates investors' understanding of the company's historic operating trends by providing an additional basis for comparisons to prior periods. Management uses these non-GAAP measures (1) to establish financial and operational goals, (2) to monitor the company's actual performance in relation to its business plan and operating budgets, (3) to evaluate the company's core operating performance and understand key trends within the business, and (4) as part of several components it considers in determining incentive compensation.
Management recognizes that the use of these non-GAAP measures has limitations, including the fact that they may not be comparable with similar non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and that management must exercise judgment in determining which types of charges or other items should be excluded from the non-GAAP financial information. Management compensates for these limitations by providing full disclosure of each non-GAAP financial measure and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. All non-GAAP financial measures are intended to supplement the applicable GAAP disclosures and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a replacement for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures, please see the tables above.

Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its offices at 270 Park Avenue, New York, New York, except payments pursuant to Sections 2.13, 2.14, 2.15 and 9.03, which shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto.

Pro Rata Treatment
 
(d) . If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Syndicated Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Syndicated Loans and accrued interest thereon then due than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Syndicated Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Syndicated Loans; that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.
Sharing of Payments by Lenders
provided
(e) . Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for account of the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Effective Rate.
Presumptions of Payment
(f) . If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.05(b) or 2.16(e), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.

Designation of a Different Lending Office
 
offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.13 or 2.15, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.
(b) . If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.13, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.15, or if any Lender defaults in its obligation to fund Loans hereunder, or if any Lender has failed to consent to any proposed amendment or waiver with respect to this Agreement that requires the consent of all the Lenders affected thereby and with respect to which the Required Lenders shall have granted their consent, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement (other than any outstanding Competitive Loans held by it) to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); that (i) the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans (other than Competitive Loans), accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts), (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.13 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.15, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments and (iv) in the case of any such assignment resulting from the failure of any Lender to consent to a waiver or amendment as provided above, the assignee shall have agreed to consent to such waiver or amendment. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.

Assignments by Lenders
(A) the Borrower, that no consent of the Borrower shall be required for an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or, if an Event of Default under clause (a) or (b) of Article VII (with respect to principal, interest or fees payable hereunder only) or an Event of Default with respect to the Borrower under clause (h) or (i) of Article VII has occurred and is continuing, any other assignee; and
provided
(B) the Administrative Agent.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 (July 24, 2007)  C. R. Bard, Inc. (NYSE-BCR) today reported 2007 second quarter financial results. Second quarter 2007 net sales were $545.7 million, an increase of 10 percent over the prior-year period. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, second quarter 2007 net sales increased 8 percent over the prior-year period.
MURRAY HILL, NJ
For the second quarter 2007, net sales in the U.S. were $374.8 million and net sales outside the U.S. were $170.9 million, up 8 percent and 13 percent, respectively, over the prior-year period. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, second quarter 2007 net sales outside the U.S. increased 7 percent over the prior-year period.
For the second quarter 2007, income from continuing operations was $97.5 million and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were 91 cents, both up 20 percent as compared to second quarter 2006 results. Adjusting for certain items that affect comparability between periods, second quarter 2007 income from continuing operations and related diluted earnings per share were up 14 percent and 15 percent, respectively, as compared to second quarter 2006 results. The adjustment to the second quarter 2007 results included an item detailed in the tables below that decreased income from continuing operations by $1.5 million (after-tax), or 2 cents per diluted share. Adjustments to the second quarter 2006 results included items that decreased income from continuing operations by $5.4 million (after-tax), or 5 cents per diluted share.
Timothy M. Ring, chairman and chief executive officer, commented, "Despite a challenging quarter in our Surgical Specialties category, we delivered earnings performance above our 14 percent EPS growth target. Customer demand for our products continues to be healthy. Our focus remains on execution, especially as it relates to the productivity of our R&D and business development pipelines."
C. R. Bard, Inc. (), headquartered in Murray Hill, N.J., is a leading multinational developer, manufacturer and marketer of innovative, life-enhancing medical technologies in the fields of vascular, urology, oncology and surgical specialty products.

This press release may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are based on management's current expectations, the accuracy of which is necessarily subject to risks and uncertainties. These statements are not historical in nature and use words such as "anticipate", "estimate", "expect", "project", "intend", "forecast", "plan", "believe", and other words of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. Many factors may cause actual results to differ materially from anticipated results including product developments, sales efforts, income tax matters, the outcomes of contingencies such as legal proceedings, and other economic, business, competitive and regulatory factors. The company undertakes no obligation to update its forward-looking statements. Please refer to our March 31, 2007 10Q for more detailed information about these and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the first quarter 2007, the company completed its previously disclosed plan to withdraw from the synthetic bulking market and discontinue the sale of the Tegress synthetic bulking product, which was formerly reported in the Urology product group. Consequently, the company accounts for this withdrawal as a discontinued operation for all periods referred to in this release.
This press release contains financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP measures in the above tables.
This press release includes net sales excluding the impact of foreign exchange. The company analyzes net sales on a constant currency basis to better measure the comparability of results between periods. Because changes in foreign currency exchange rates have a non-operating impact on net sales, the company believes that evaluating growth in net sales on a constant currency basis provides an additional and meaningful assessment of net sales to both management and the company's investors.
In addition, this press release includes the following non-GAAP measures: (1) research & development expense excluding payments for purchased research and development; (2) other (income) expense, net excluding investment gains, (3) income tax provision excluding the tax effect of the items set forth in (1) and (2) above; (4) income from continuing operations excluding the items set forth in (1) through (3) above; and (5) diluted earnings per share from continuing operations excluding the items set forth in (1) through (3) above.
The company excluded the items described above because they may cause certain statement of income categories not to be indicative of ongoing operating results, and therefore affect the comparability of results between periods. The company therefore believes that these non-GAAP measures provide an additional and meaningful assessment of the company's ongoing operating performance. Because the company has historically reported these non-GAAP results to the investment community, management also believes that the inclusion of these non-GAAP measures provides consistency in its financial reporting and facilitates investors' understanding of the company's historic operating trends by providing an additional basis for comparisons to prior periods. Management uses these non-GAAP measures (1) to establish financial and operational goals, (2) to monitor the company's actual performance in relation to its business plan and operating budgets, (3) to evaluate the company's core operating performance and understand key trends within the business, and (4) as part of several components it considers in determining incentive compensation.
Management recognizes that the use of these non-GAAP measures has limitations, including the fact that they may not be comparable with similar non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and that management must exercise judgment in determining which types of charges or other items should be excluded from the non-GAAP financial information. Management compensates for these limitations by providing full disclosure of each non-GAAP financial measure and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. All non-GAAP financial measures are intended to supplement the applicable GAAP disclosures and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a replacement for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures, please see the above tables.

This press release may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are based on management's current expectations, the accuracy of which is necessarily subject to risks and uncertainties. These statements are not historical in nature and use words such as "anticipate", "estimate", "expect", "project", "intend", "forecast", "plan", "believe", and other words of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. Many factors may cause actual results to differ materially from anticipated results including product developments, sales efforts, income tax matters, the outcomes of contingencies such as legal proceedings, and other economic, business, competitive and regulatory factors. The company undertakes no obligation to update its forward-looking statements. Please refer to the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information in our June 30, 2007 Form 10-Q for more detailed information about these and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the first quarter 2007, the company completed its previously disclosed plan to withdraw from the synthetic bulking market and discontinue the sale of the Tegress synthetic bulking product, which was formerly reported in the Urology product group category. Consequently, the company accounts for this withdrawal as a discontinued operation for all periods referred to in this release.
This press release contains financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP measures in the above tables.
This press release includes net sales excluding the impact of foreign exchange. The company analyzes net sales on a constant currency basis to better measure the comparability of results between periods. Because changes in foreign currency exchange rates have a non-operating impact on net sales, the company believes that evaluating growth in net sales on a constant currency basis provides an additional and meaningful assessment of net sales to both management and the company's investors.
In addition, this press release includes the following non-GAAP measures: (1) research & development expense excluding payments for purchased research and development; (2) other (income) expense, net excluding investment gains and a charge for the previously disclosed settlement of a legal matter; (3) income tax provision excluding reductions relating to expired statutes of limitations in the United States, reductions relating to changes in statutory tax rates and the tax effect of the items set forth in (1) and (2) above; (4) income from continuing operations excluding the items set forth in (1) through (3) above; and (5) diluted earnings per share from continuing operations excluding the items set forth in (1) through (3) above.
The company excluded the items described above because they may cause certain statements of income categories not to be indicative of ongoing operating results, and therefore affect the comparability of results between periods. The company therefore believes that these non-GAAP measures provide an additional and meaningful assessment of the company's ongoing operating performance. Because the company has historically reported these non-GAAP results to the investment community, management also believes that the inclusion of these non-GAAP measures provides consistency in its financial reporting and facilitates investors' understanding of the company's historic operating trends by providing an additional basis for comparisons to prior periods. Management uses these non-GAAP measures: (1) to establish financial and operational goals; (2) to monitor the company's actual performance in relation to its business plan and operating budgets; (3) to evaluate the company's core operating performance and understand key trends within the business; and (4) as part of several components it considers in determining incentive compensation.
 
Management recognizes that the use of these non-GAAP measures has limitations, including the fact that they may not be comparable with similar non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and that management must exercise judgment in determining which types of charges or other items should be excluded from the non-GAAP financial information. Management compensates for these limitations by providing full disclosure of each non-GAAP financial measure and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. All non-GAAP financial measures are intended to supplement the applicable GAAP disclosures and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a replacement for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures, please see the above tables.

C.R. Bard, Inc. announced that a U.S. District Court jury in Arizona found that certain of W.L. Gore & Associates Inc.'s ePTFE vascular grafts and stent-grafts infringe Bard patent number 6,436,135. The jury upheld the validity of the patent and awarded $185 million in past damages. The jury also found that Gore willfully infringed the patent. In a second phase of the trial, the court is currently assessing Gore's assertion that the patent is unenforceable due to inequitable conduct. Bard expects that Gore will file post-trial motions with the court with respect to the jury's decision. After a judgment is entered, the case may be appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.

Any such proxy or information statement shall also contain the recommendations of each of the members of the Board of Directors as to the advisability of the proposed Special Business Combination as well as the opinion of an investment banker selected by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors as to the fairness of the terms of the proposed Special Business Combination to the Corporation and its shareholders.

This press release may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are based on management's current expectations, the accuracy of which is necessarily subject to risks and uncertainties. These statements are not historical in nature and use words such as "anticipate", "estimate", "expect", "project", "intend", "forecast", "plan", "believe", and other words of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. Many factors may cause actual results to differ materially from anticipated results including product developments, sales efforts, income tax matters, the outcomes of contingencies such as legal proceedings, and other economic, business, competitive and regulatory factors. The company undertakes no obligation to update its forward-looking statements. Please refer to the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information in our March 31, 2008 Form 10-Q for more detailed information about these and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This press release contains financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP measures in the above tables.
This press release includes net sales excluding the impact of foreign exchange. The company analyzes net sales on a constant currency basis to better measure the comparability of results between periods. Because changes in foreign currency exchange rates have a non-operating impact on net sales, the company believes that evaluating growth in net sales on a constant currency basis provides an additional and meaningful assessment of net sales to both management and the company's investors.
In addition, this press release includes the following non-GAAP measures: (1) cost of goods sold excluding a charge for an asset disposition; (2) research & development expense excluding payments for purchased research and development; (3) other (income) expense, net excluding a charge for an asset disposition; (4) the tax effect of the items set forth in (1) through (3) above; (5) net income excluding the items set forth in (1) through (4) above; and (6) diluted earnings per share excluding the items set forth in (1) through (4) above.
The company excluded the items described above because they may cause certain statements of income categories not to be indicative of ongoing operating results, and therefore affect the comparability of results between periods. The company therefore believes that these non-GAAP measures provide an additional and meaningful assessment of the company's ongoing operating performance. Because the company has historically reported these non-GAAP results to the investment community, management also believes that the inclusion of these non-GAAP measures provides consistency in its financial reporting and facilitates investors' understanding of the company's historic operating trends by providing an additional basis for comparisons to prior periods. Management uses these non-GAAP measures: (1) to establish financial and operational goals; (2) to monitor the company's actual performance in relation to its business plan and operating budgets; (3) to evaluate the company's core operating performance and understand key trends within the business; and (4) as part of several components it considers in determining incentive compensation.
Management recognizes that the use of these non-GAAP measures has limitations, including the fact that they may not be comparable with similar non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and that management must exercise judgment in determining which types of charges or other items should be excluded from the non-GAAP financial information. Management compensates for these limitations by providing full disclosure of each non-GAAP financial measure and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. All non-GAAP financial measures are intended to supplement the applicable GAAP disclosures and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a replacement for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures, please see the above tables.

C. R. Bard, Inc. announced that a U.S. District Court in Arizona entered judgment in Bard's favor in its patent infringement suit against W.L. Gore & Associates. The Court ruled that Gore failed to prove that Bard's patent number 6,436,135 was unenforceable due to inequitable conduct. As previously announced, on December 11, 2007, a jury found that Gore willfully infringed Bard's patent through the sale of Gore's ePTFE vascular grafts and stent-grafts, and awarded Bard $185 million in past damages. Gore may file post-trial motions with the court and may appeal the judgment to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.

The company excluded the items described above because they may cause certain statements of income categories not to be indicative of ongoing operating results, and therefore affect the comparability of results between periods. The company therefore believes that these non-GAAP measures provide an additional and meaningful assessment of the company's ongoing operating performance. Because the company has historically reported these non-GAAP results to the investment community, management also believes that the inclusion of these non-GAAP measures provides consistency in its financial reporting and facilitates investors' understanding of the company's historic operating trends by providing an additional basis for comparisons to prior periods. Management uses these non-GAAP measures: (1) to establish financial and operational goals; (2) to monitor the company's actual performance in relation to its business plan and operating budgets; (3) to evaluate the company's core operating performance and understand key trends within the business; and (4) as part of several components it considers in determining incentive compensation.
Management recognizes that the use of these non-GAAP measures has limitations, including the fact that they may not be comparable with similar non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and that management must exercise judgment in determining which types of charges or other items should be excluded from the non-GAAP financial information. Management compensates for these limitations by providing full disclosure of each non-GAAP financial measure and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. All non-GAAP financial measures are intended to supplement the applicable GAAP disclosures and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a replacement for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures, please see the above tables.

C. R. Bard, Inc. today announced that the U.S. District Court in Arizona ruled on certain motions in Bard's patent infringement suit against W.L. Gore & Associates. In December 2007, a jury awarded Bard approximately $185 million and found that Gore willfully infringed Bard's patent number 6,436,135 by selling certain ePTFE vascular grafts and stent-grafts. United States patent law provides discretion to courts to increase damages in cases of willful infringement and on March 31, 2009, the Court doubled the jury award to approximately $371 million for damages through June 2007. The Court is still assessing damages for Gore's infringing sales from July 2007 to the present date and is also expected to set a royalty rate for future infringing sales. The Court also awarded Bard attorneys' fees of $19 million and prejudgment interest of approximately $20 million. In addition, the court denied Gore's remaining motions, including its motions for a new trial and to set aside the jury's verdict. After a final judgment is entered, Gore may appeal this matter to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.

On April 22, 2009, C. R. Bard, Inc. (the "Company") announced a plan to improve its overall cost structure and improve efficiency, which plan was approved by the Board of Directors of the Company on April 15, 2009. The plan includes the consolidation of certain businesses in the United States and the realignment of certain sales and marketing functions outside the United States. The Company expects this plan to result in the elimination of certain positions and other employee terminations worldwide.
In connection with this plan, the Company estimates that it will incur total pre-tax charges of $14 million to $16 million. Substantially all of this charge is expected to result in cash expenditures related to separation costs and other employee termination expenses. In the first quarter of 2009, the Company recorded a charge of $9.8 million ($6.5 million after tax) to other (income) expense, net, to reflect employee separation costs, which were determined under the Company's existing severance programs. The Company expects activities under the plan to be substantially complete in the second quarter of 2009.

This press release contains financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP measures in the above tables.
This press release includes net sales excluding the impact of foreign exchange. The company analyzes net sales on a constant currency basis to better measure the comparability of results between periods. Because changes in foreign currency exchange rates have a non-operating impact on net sales, the company believes that evaluating growth in net sales on a constant currency basis provides an additional and meaningful assessment of net sales to both management and the company's investors.
In addition, this press release includes the following non-GAAP measures: (1) cost of goods sold excluding charges for asset dispositions and acquisition related adjustments; (2) marketing, selling and administrative expenses excluding acquisition related adjustments (3) research & development expense excluding acquisition related adjustments; (4) other (income) expense, net, excluding charges for asset dispositions and restructuring; (5) income tax provision excluding the tax effect of the items set forth in (1) through (4) above; (6) net income attributable to common shareholders excluding the items set forth in (1) through (5) above; and (7) diluted earnings per share available to common shareholders excluding the items set forth in (1) through (5) above.
The company excluded the items described above because they may cause certain statements of income categories not to be indicative of ongoing operating results, and therefore affect the comparability of results between periods. The company therefore believes that these non-GAAP measures provide an additional and meaningful assessment of the company's ongoing operating performance. Because the company has historically reported these non-GAAP results to the investment community, management also believes that the inclusion of these non-GAAP measures provides consistency in its financial reporting and facilitates investors' understanding of the company's historic operating trends by providing an additional basis for comparisons to prior periods. Management uses these non-GAAP measures: (1) to establish financial and operational goals; (2) to monitor the company's actual performance in relation to its business plan and operating budgets; (3) to evaluate the company's core operating performance and understand key trends within the business; and (4) as part of several components it considers in determining incentive compensation.
Management recognizes that the use of these non-GAAP measures has limitations, including the fact that they may not be comparable with similar non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and that management must exercise judgment in determining which types of charges or other items should be excluded from the non-GAAP financial information. Management compensates for these limitations by providing full disclosure of each non-GAAP financial measure and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. All non-GAAP financial measures are intended to supplement the applicable GAAP disclosures and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a replacement for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures, please see the above tables.

C. R. Bard, Inc. (the "Company") offers a relocation assistance program for employees who relocate at our request and whose relocation meets certain mileage and other criteria. We believe this program offers sufficient assistance to encourage employees to accept the relocation and to remain focused on the new opportunity. The relocation program provides a relocating executive who is eligible for benefits under this program with financial assistance, both in selling his or her existing home and in purchasing a new residence. It also provides assistance with moving, temporary housing and cost of living adjustments. The program requires the employee to enter into a relocation agreement and provides that if an employee voluntarily terminates employment with the Company within 24 months of the effective date of relocation, the employee (i) forfeits any remaining payments that may be due under the relocation program, and (ii) will be required to repay in full all relocation expenses paid to the employee or incurred by the Company on the employee's behalf. In certain cases, the Company has increased this period to 36 months, including for executive officers, emphasizing the long-term commitment associated with the relocation.

This press release contains financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP measures in the above tables.
This press release includes net sales excluding the impact of foreign exchange. The company analyzes net sales on a constant currency basis to better measure the comparability of results between periods. Because changes in foreign currency exchange rates have a non-operating impact on net sales, the company believes that evaluating growth in net sales on a constant currency basis provides an additional and meaningful assessment of net sales to both management and the company's investors.
In addition, this press release includes the following non-GAAP measures: (1) cost of goods sold excluding acquisition related items; (2) marketing, selling and administrative expenses excluding acquisition related items; (3) other (income) expense, net, excluding a restructuring charge; (4) income tax provision excluding the tax effect of the items set forth in (1) through (3) above; (5) net income attributable to common shareholders excluding the items set forth in (1) through (4) above; and (6) diluted earnings per share available to common shareholders excluding the items set forth in (1) through (4) above.
The company excluded the items described above because they may cause certain statements of income categories not to be indicative of ongoing operating results, and therefore affect the comparability of results between periods. The company therefore believes that these non-GAAP measures provide an additional and meaningful assessment of the company's ongoing operating performance. Because the company has historically reported these non-GAAP results to the investment community, management also believes that the inclusion of these non-GAAP measures provides consistency in its financial reporting and facilitates investors' understanding of the company's historic operating trends by providing an additional basis for comparisons to prior periods.

Management recognizes that the use of these non-GAAP measures has limitations, including the fact that they may not be comparable with similar non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and that management must exercise judgment in determining which types of charges or other items should be excluded from the non-GAAP financial information. Management compensates for these limitations by providing full disclosure of each non-GAAP financial measure and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. All non-GAAP financial measures are intended to supplement the applicable GAAP disclosures and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a replacement for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures, please see the above tables.

This press release may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are based on management's current expectations, the accuracy of which is necessarily subject to risks and uncertainties. These statements are not historical in nature and use words such as "anticipate", "estimate", "expect", "project", "intend", "forecast", "plan", "believe", and other words of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. Many factors may cause actual results to differ materially from anticipated results including product developments, sales efforts, income tax matters, the outcomes of contingencies such as legal proceedings, and other economic, business, competitive and regulatory factors. The company undertakes no obligation to update its forward-looking statements. Please refer to the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information in our March 31, 2010 Form 10-Q for more detailed information about these and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This press release contains financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP measures in the above tables.
This press release includes net sales excluding the impact of foreign exchange. The company analyzes net sales on a constant currency basis to better measure the comparability of results between periods. Because changes in foreign currency exchange rates have a non-operating impact on net sales, the company believes that evaluating growth in net sales on a constant currency basis provides an additional and meaningful assessment of net sales to both management and the company's investors.
In addition, this press release includes the following non-GAAP measures: (1) cost of goods sold excluding charges for an asset disposition and acquisition related items; (2) marketing, selling and administrative expense excluding charges for acquisition related items and the write-down of public hospital receivables in Greece; (3) research and development expense excluding acquisition related items; (4) other (income) expense, net, excluding charges for an asset disposition, acquisition related items and restructuring; (5) income tax provision excluding the tax effect of the items set forth in (1) through (4) above; (6) net income attributable to common shareholders excluding the items set forth in (1) through (5) above; and (7) diluted earnings per share available to common shareholders excluding the items set forth in (1) through (5) above.
The company excluded the items described above because they may cause certain statements of income categories not to be indicative of ongoing operating results, and therefore affect the comparability of results between periods. The company therefore believes that these non-GAAP measures provide an additional and meaningful assessment of the company's ongoing operating performance. Because the company has historically reported these non-GAAP results to the investment community, management also believes that the inclusion of these non-GAAP measures provides consistency in its financial reporting and facilitates investors' understanding of the company's historic operating trends by providing an additional basis for comparisons to prior periods. Management uses these non-GAAP measures: (1) to establish financial and operational goals; (2) to monitor the company's actual performance in relation to its business plan and operating budgets; (3) to evaluate the company's core operating performance and understand key trends within the business; and (4) as part of several components it considers in determining incentive compensation.
Management recognizes that the use of these non-GAAP measures has limitations, including the fact that they may not be comparable with similar non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and that management must exercise judgment in determining which types of charges or other items should be excluded from the non-GAAP financial information. Management compensates for these limitations by providing full disclosure of each non-GAAP financial measure and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. All non-GAAP financial measures are intended to supplement the applicable GAAP disclosures and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a replacement for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures, please see the above tables.

On December 9, 2010, C. R. Bard, Inc. (the "Company") committed to a plan to improve its overall cost structure and enhance operational effectiveness. The plan includes the realignment of certain manufacturing, sales and marketing, and administrative functions. The Company expects this plan to result in the elimination of certain positions and other employee terminations worldwide.
In connection with this plan, the Company estimates that it will incur a pre-tax charge of approximately $20 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Substantially all of this charge is expected to result in cash expenditures related to separation costs and other employee termination expenses. The Company expects activities under the plan to be substantially complete by the end of 2011.
 
The Company intends, subject to market conditions, to publicly offer $750 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering to repurchase shares of its common stock, which may include an accelerated share repurchase program, or for other general corporate purposes.
This announcement is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy any securities, nor shall there be any sale of any such securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction.
This report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are based on management's current expectations, the accuracy of which is necessarily subject to risks and uncertainties.

Many factors may cause actual results to differ materially from anticipated results including, (i) with respect to the plan to improve its overall cost structure and enhance operational effectiveness, the Company's ability to implement the plan in the contemplated time frames, the ability of the Company to realize the anticipated benefits of the plan, and the estimated charges relating to the plan, and (ii) market conditions relating to corporate debt securities with respect to the proposed notes offering. The Company undertakes no obligation to update its forward-looking statements. Please refer to the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information in the Company's September 30, 2010 Form 10-Q for more detailed information about these and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied.

On December 15, 2010, C. R. Bard, Inc. (the "Company") entered into a master confirmation agreement and a supplemental confirmation agreement (collectively, the "Agreement") with Goldman, Sachs & Co. ("GS") to effect an accelerated repurchase of $750 million of shares of the Company's common stock (the "Share Repurchase Transaction"). The shares are being repurchased pursuant to a new board-approved share repurchase authorization. The Company intends to apply the net proceeds from its public offering of $750 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes (the "Debt Offering") and certain other funds to the Prepayment Amount (as defined below). The effectiveness of the Share Repurchase Transaction is conditioned on the closing of the Debt Offering.
Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company is scheduled to pay $750 million (the "Prepayment Amount") to GS on December 21, 2010 and will receive a certain number of shares upon initial settlement ("Initial Shares"). The total number of shares ultimately repurchased under the Agreement (the "Repurchased Shares") will be equal to the Prepayment Amount divided by the average of the volume-weighted average share price of the Company's common stock during a predetermined period of months, less a discount. If the Repurchased Shares exceed the Initial Shares, the Company will receive a number of additional shares from GS equal to the amount of such excess. If the Repurchased Shares are less than the Initial Shares, the Company will, at its option, either deliver to GS a number of shares equal to the difference or make a cash payment to GS equal to the value of the difference.
The Agreement is subject to terms customary for similar agreements of this type, including but not limited to providing for the effect of extraordinary corporate transactions and setting forth circumstances under which the Agreement may be accelerated or terminated.
In connection with the Agreement, GS may purchase shares of the Company's common stock in the open market. These purchases may include covering purchases to close out stock borrow positions taken on by GS to deliver the Initial Shares to the Company. In addition, on any given day, GS may be purchasing or selling, or both, and possibly taking on other positions in the Company's common stock in hedging transactions related to the Agreement. All of these market transactions in the Company's shares will be for GS's own account.
The foregoing description of the Agreement is a summary and is qualified in its entirety by the terms of the Agreement, a copy of which will be filed as an exhibit to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2010.
GS and its affiliates have provided certain commercial banking, financial advisory and investment banking services to the Company including serving as a Joint Bookrunner in connection with the Debt Offering.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

The Company hereby acknowledges that the only information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any Company Additional Written Communication, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) are the statements set forth in paragraph five (the first sentence only) and paragraph eight (third sentence only) in the section entitled "Underwriting; Conflicts of Interest" in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus. The indemnity obligation set forth in this Section 8(b) shall be in addition to any liabilities that each Underwriter may otherwise have.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under Section 8(a) or (b) of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party under Section 8(a) or (b), notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof, but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party for contribution or otherwise than under the indemnity agreement contained in Section 8(a) or (b) or to the extent it is not materially prejudiced as a proximate result of such failure. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party and such indemnified party seeks or intends to seek indemnity from an indemnifying party, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate in, and, to the extent that it shall elect, jointly with all other indemnifying parties similarly notified, by written notice delivered to the indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party; provided, however, such indemnified party shall have the right to employ its own counsel in any such action and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party, unless: (i) the
Notifications and Other Indemnification Procedures.
 
employment of such counsel has been specifically authorized in writing by the indemnifying party; (ii) the indemnifying party has failed promptly to assume the defense and employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party; or (iii) the named parties to any such action (including any impleaded parties) include both such indemnified party and the indemnifying party or any affiliate of the indemnifying party, and counsel to such indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that either (x) there may be one or more legal defenses available to it which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party or such affiliate of the indemnifying party or (y) a conflict may exist between such indemnified party and the indemnifying party or such affiliate of the indemnifying party (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any one such action or separate but substantially similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to a single firm of local counsel) for all such indemnified parties, which firm shall be designated in writing by the Representatives and that all such reasonable fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred). Upon receipt of notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of such indemnifying party's election so to assume the defense of such action and approval by the indemnified party of counsel, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under Section 8(a) or (b) for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof unless the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in accordance with the proviso to the next preceding sentence, in which case the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel shall be at the expense of the indemnifying party.
(d) The indemnifying party under this Section 8 shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by Section 8(c) hereof, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 60 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement, compromise or consent to the entry of judgment in any pending or threatened action, suit or proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity was or could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such action, suit or proceeding and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.

Contribution
 
indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount paid or payable by such indemnified party, as incurred, as a result of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, from the offering of the Notes pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Notes pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Notes pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company, and the total underwriting discount received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the front cover page of the Prospectus bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of the Notes as set forth on such cover. The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company, on the one hand, or the Underwriters, on the other hand, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.

Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 9, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the underwriting commissions received by such Underwriter in connection with the Notes underwritten by it and distributed to the public. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 9 are several, and not joint, in proportion to their respective underwriting commitments as set forth opposite their names in Schedule A. For purposes of this Section 9, each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company with the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company.

In any such case, either the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days in order that the required changes, if any, to the Registration Statement, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus or any other documents or arrangements may be effected.

In any case where notice to Holders is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular Holder shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders. Where this Indenture provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by the Person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by Holders shall be filed with the Trustee, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver.
In case by reason of the suspension of regular mail service or by reason of any other cause it shall be impracticable to give such notice by mail, then such notification as shall be made with the approval of the Trustee shall constitute a sufficient notification for every purpose hereunder.

In the case, however, of Securities of a series bearing interest at a floating rate based on the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR), if any Interest Payment Date (other than the Redemption Date or Stated Maturity) would otherwise be a date that is not a Business Day, then the Interest Payment Date shall be postponed to the following date which is a Business Day, unless that Business Day falls in the next succeeding calendar month, in which case the Interest Payment Date will be the immediately preceding Business Day.

The aggregate principal amount of Securities which may be authenticated and delivered under this Indenture is unlimited.
The Securities may be issued in one or more series. There shall be established in or pursuant to (a) a Board Resolution or pursuant to authority granted by a Board Resolution and, subject to Section 303, set forth, or determined in the manner provided, in an Officer's Certificate, or (b) one or more indentures supplemental hereto, prior to the issuance of Securities of any series:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
All Securities of any one series shall be substantially identical except as to denomination and except as may otherwise be provided in or pursuant to the Board Resolution referred to above or pursuant to authority granted by one or more Board Resolutions and, subject to Section 303, set forth, or determined in the manner provided, in the Officer's Certificate referred to above or in any such indenture supplemental hereto. All Securities of any one series need not be issued at one time and, unless otherwise provided in or pursuant to the Board Resolution referred to above and, subject to Section 303, set forth, or determined in the manner provided, in the Officer's Certificate referred to above or pursuant to authority granted by one or more Board Resolutions or in any such indenture supplemental hereto with respect to a series of Securities, additional Securities of a series may be issued, at the option of the Company, without the consent of any Holder, at any time and from time to time.
If any of the terms of the series are established by action taken pursuant to a Board Resolution, a copy of an appropriate record of such action shall be certified by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Company and delivered to the Trustee at or prior to the delivery of the Officer's Certificate setting forth the terms of the series.
 
The Securities of each series shall be issuable only in registered form without coupons and only in such denominations as shall be specified as contemplated by Section 301. In the absence of any such specified denomination with respect to the Securities of any series, the Securities of such series shall be issuable in denominations of $2,000 and any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof.
 
The Securities shall be executed on behalf of the Company by its Chairman of the Board, one of its Vice Chairmen, its Chief Executive Officer, its Chief Financial Officer, its Chief Accounting Officer, its Treasurer, one of its Corporate Vice Presidents or one of its Assistant Treasurers. The signature of any of these officers on the Securities may be manual or facsimile.
Securities bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of individuals who were at any time the proper officers of the Company shall bind the Company, notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them have ceased to hold such offices prior to the authentication and delivery of such Securities or did not hold such offices at the date of such Securities.
 
At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this Indenture, the Company may deliver Securities of any series executed by the Company to the Trustee for authentication, together with a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of such Securities, and the Trustee in accordance with the Company Order shall authenticate and deliver such Securities. If the form or terms of the Securities of the series have been established by or pursuant to one or more Board Resolutions or pursuant to authority granted by one or more Board Resolutions as permitted by Sections 201 and 301, in authenticating such Securities, and accepting the additional responsibilities under this Indenture in relation to such Securities, the Trustee shall receive, and, subject to Section 601, shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel stating,
 
 
 
If such form or terms have been so established, the Trustee shall not be required to authenticate such Securities if the issue of such Securities pursuant to this Indenture will materially adversely affect the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under the Securities and this Indenture or otherwise in a manner which is not reasonably acceptable to the Trustee.
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 301 and of the preceding paragraph of this Section 303, if all Securities of a series are not to be originally issued at one time, including in the event that the aggregate principal amount of a series of Outstanding Securities is increased as contemplated by Section 301, it shall not be necessary to deliver the Officer's Certificate otherwise required pursuant to Section 301 or the Company Order and Opinion of Counsel otherwise required pursuant to this Section 303 at or prior to the authentication of each Security of such series if such documents are delivered at or prior to the authentication upon original issuance of the first Security of such series to be issued.
Each Security shall be dated the date of its authentication.
 
No Security shall be entitled to any benefit under this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless there appears on such Security a certificate of authentication substantially in the form provided for herein executed by the Trustee by manual signature, and such certificate upon any Security shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Security has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Security shall have been authenticated and delivered hereunder but never issued and sold by the Company, and the Company shall deliver such Security to the Trustee for cancellation as provided in Section 309, for all purposes of this Indenture such Security shall be deemed never to have been authenticated and delivered hereunder and shall never be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture.
 
Pending the preparation of definitive Securities of any series, the Company may execute, and, upon Company Order, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, temporary Securities which are printed, lithographed, typewritten, mimeographed or otherwise produced, in any authorized denomination, substantially of the tenor of the definitive Securities of such series in lieu of which they are issued and with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as the officers executing such Securities may determine, as evidenced by their execution of such Securities.
If temporary Securities of any series are issued, the Company will cause definitive Securities of that series to be prepared without unreasonable delay. After the preparation of definitive Securities of such series, the temporary Securities of such series shall be exchangeable for definitive Securities of such series upon surrender of the temporary Securities of such series at the office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment for that series, without charge to the Holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Securities of any series, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor one or more definitive Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of like tenor and aggregate principal amount. Until so exchanged, the temporary Securities of any series shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities of such series and tenor.
 
The Company shall cause to be kept at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee a register (the register maintained in such office and in any other office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment being herein sometimes collectively referred to as the "") in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company shall provide for the registration of Securities and of transfers of Securities. The Trustee is hereby appointed "" for the purpose of registering Securities and transfers of Securities as herein provided.

Security Registrar
Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Security of a series at the office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment for that series, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of like tenor and principal amount.
 
At the option of the Holder, Securities of any series may be exchanged for other Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of like tenor and principal amount, upon surrender of the Securities to be exchanged at such office or agency. Whenever any Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.
All Securities issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities shall be the valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Securities surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange.
Every Security presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange shall (if so required by the Company or the Trustee) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed, by the Holder thereof or such Holder's attorney duly authorized in writing.
No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, other than exchanges pursuant to Section 304, 906 or 1107 not involving any transfer.
If the Securities of any series (or of any series and specified tenor) are to be redeemed in part, the Company shall not be required (A) to issue, register the transfer of or exchange any Securities of that series (or of that series and specified tenor, as the case may be) during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the day of the mailing of a notice of redemption of any such Securities selected for redemption under Section 1103 and ending at the close of business on the day of such mailing, or (B) to register the transfer of or exchange any Security so selected for redemption in whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of any Security being redeemed in part.
The provisions of clauses (1), (2), (3) and (4) of this paragraph shall apply only to Global Securities:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If any mutilated Security is surrendered to the Trustee, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a new Security of the same series and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
If there shall be delivered to the Company and the Trustee (1) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Security and (2) security or indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee and the Company to save each of them and any agent of either of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company or the Trustee that such Security has been acquired by a purchaser, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Security, a new Security of the same series and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
bona fide
In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security, pay such Security.
Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section 306, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of counsel to the Company and the fees and expenses of the Trustee and its counsel) connected therewith.
 
Every new Security of any series issued pursuant to this Section 306 in lieu of any mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities of that series duly issued hereunder.
The provisions of this Section 306 are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities.

The Trustee may destroy any list furnished to it as provided in Section 701 upon receipt of a new list so furnished.
The rights of Holders to communicate with other Holders with respect to their rights under this Indenture or under the Securities, and the corresponding rights and privileges of the Trustee, shall be as provided by the Trust Indenture Act.
Every Holder of Securities, by receiving and holding the same, agrees with the Company and the Trustee that neither the Company nor the Trustee nor any agent of either of them shall be held accountable by reason of any disclosure of information as to names and addresses of Holders made pursuant to the Trust Indenture Act.
 
 
The Trustee shall transmit to Holders such reports concerning the Trustee and its actions under this Indenture as may be required pursuant to the Trust Indenture Act at the times and in the manner provided pursuant thereto. The Trustee shall promptly deliver to the Company a copy of any report it delivers to Holders pursuant to this Section 703.
A copy of each such report shall, at the time of such transmission to Holders, be filed by the Trustee with each stock exchange and automated quotation system, if any, upon which any Securities are listed, with the Commission and with the Company. The Company will notify the Trustee when any Securities are listed on any stock exchange or automated quotation system or delisted therefrom.
 
The Company shall comply with all the applicable provisions of the Trust Indenture Act. Delivery of such reports, information and documents to the Trustee is for informational purposes only and shall not constitute a representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of the reports, information and documents. The Trustee's receipt of such shall not constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein or determinable from information contained therein, including the Company's compliance with any of its covenants hereunder (as to which the Trustee is entitled to rely exclusively on Officer's Certificates).
 
The Company shall not consolidate with or merge with or into, or sell, transfer, lease or convey all or substantially all of its properties and assets to, in one transaction or a series of related transactions, any other Person, unless:
 
 
 
 
 
The Successor shall succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the Company under the Indenture, with the same effect as if the Successor had been an original party to this Indenture, and the Company shall be released from all its liabilities and obligations under this Indenture and the Securities.
 
Without the consent of any Holders, the Company and the Trustee, at any time and from time to time, may enter into one or more indentures supplemental hereto, in form satisfactory to the Trustee, for any of the following purposes:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
With the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of each series affected by such supplemental indenture (including consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange for Securities), by Act of said Holders delivered to the Company and the Trustee, the Company and the Trustee may enter into an indenture or indentures supplemental hereto for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of this Indenture or of modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series under this Indenture; , , no such supplemental indenture shall, without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security of such series affected thereby:

A supplemental indenture which changes or eliminates any covenant or other provision of this Indenture which has expressly been included solely for the benefit of one or more particular series of Securities, or which modifies the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series with respect to such covenant or other provision, shall be deemed not to affect the rights under this Indenture of the Holders of Securities of any other series.
It shall not be necessary for any Act of Holders under this Section 902 to approve the particular form of any proposed supplemental indenture, but it shall be sufficient if such Act shall approve the substance thereof.
After a supplemental indenture under this Section 902 becomes effective, the Company shall mail to the Trustee a notice briefly describing such supplemental indenture or a copy of such supplemental indenture and the Trustee shall mail such notice or supplemental indenture to Holders affected thereby. Any failure of the Company to mail such notice, or any defect therein, or any failure of the Company to mail such supplemental indenture, shall not in any way impair or affect the validity of any such supplemental indenture.
 
 
In executing, or accepting the additional trusts created by, any supplemental indenture permitted by this Article IX or the modifications thereby of the trusts created by this Indenture, the Trustee shall receive, and, subject to Section 601, shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel stating that the execution of such supplemental indenture is authorized or permitted by this Indenture and that all conditions precedent in this Indenture to the execution of such supplemental indenture, if any, have been complied with and such supplemental indenture is the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms; provided, however, that no such Opinion of Counsel shall be required in the case of any supplemental indenture executed and delivered concurrently with the original execution and delivery of this Indenture. The Trustee may, but shall not be obligated to, enter into any such supplemental indenture which affects the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise.
 
Upon the execution of any supplemental indenture under this Article IX, this Indenture shall be modified in accordance therewith, and such supplemental indenture shall form a part of this Indenture for all purposes; and every Holder of Securities theretofore or thereafter authenticated and delivered hereunder shall be bound thereby.
 
Every supplemental indenture executed pursuant to this Article IX shall conform to the requirements of the Trust Indenture Act.
 
Securities of any series authenticated and delivered after the execution of any supplemental indenture pursuant to this Article IX may, and shall if required by the Trustee, bear a notation in form approved by the Trustee as to any matter provided for in such supplemental indenture. If the Company shall so determine, new Securities of any series so modified as to conform, in the opinion of the Trustee and the Company, to any such supplemental indenture may be prepared and executed by the Company and authenticated and delivered by the Trustee in exchange for Outstanding Securities of such series.
 
The Company covenants and agrees for the benefit of each series of Securities that it will duly and punctually pay the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on the Securities of that series in accordance with the terms of the Securities and this Indenture. Principal and interest shall be considered paid on the date due if, on or before 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on such date, the Trustee or the Paying Agent (or, if the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is the Paying Agent, the segregated account or separate trust fund maintained by the Company or such Subsidiary pursuant to Section 1003) holds in accordance with this Indenture money sufficient to pay all principal and interest then due.
 
The Company shall pay interest on overdue principal at the rate specified therefor in the Securities, and it shall pay interest on overdue installments of interest at the same rate to the extent lawful as provided in Section 307.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Indenture, the Company or the Paying Agent may, to the extent it is required to do so by law, deduct or withhold income or other similar taxes imposed by the United States of America or other domestic or foreign taxing authorities from principal or interest payments hereunder.
 
The Company will maintain in each Place of Payment for any series of Securities an office or agency where Securities of that series may be presented or surrendered for payment, where Securities of that series may be surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange, where Securities may be surrendered for conversion, and where notices and demands to or upon the Company in respect of the Securities of that series and this Indenture may be served. The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of the location, and any change in the location, of such office or agency. If at any time the Company shall fail to maintain any such required office or agency or shall fail to furnish the Trustee with the address thereof, such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands may be made or served at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee. The Company hereby appoints the Trustee as its agent to receive all such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands.
The Company may also from time to time designate one or more other offices or agencies where the Securities of one or more series may be presented or surrendered for any or all such purposes and may from time to time rescind such designations; , , that no such designation or rescission shall in any manner relieve the Company of its obligation to maintain an office or agency in each Place of Payment for Securities of any series for such purposes. The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any such designation or rescission and of any change in the location of any such other office or agency.

With respect to any Global Security, and except as otherwise may be specified for such Global Security as contemplated by Section 301, the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee shall be the Place of Payment where such Global Security may be presented or surrendered for payment or for registration of transfer or exchange, or where successor Securities may be delivered in exchange therefor; , , that any such payment, presentation, surrender or delivery effected pursuant to the Applicable Procedures of the Depositary for such Global Security shall be deemed to have been effected at the Place of Payment for such Global Security in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture.

Whether or not required by the Commission's rules and regulations, so long as Securities of any series are outstanding, the Company will furnish to the Holders or cause the Trustee to furnish to the Holders, within 15 days after the time periods (including any extensions thereof) specified in the Commission's rules and regulations:
(1) all quarterly and annual reports that would be required to be filed with the Commission on Forms 10-Q and 10-K if the Company were required to file such reports; and
 
(2) all current reports that would be required to be filed with the Commission on Form 8-K if the Company were required to file such reports.
To the extent such filings are made with the Commission or the reports are posted on the Company's website, the reports will be deemed to be furnished to the Trustee and Holders.
In addition, the Company agrees that, for so long as any Securities of any series remain outstanding, at any time the Company is not required to file the reports required by the preceding paragraphs (1) and (2) with the Commission, the Company will furnish to the Holders and to securities analysts and prospective investors, upon their written request, the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
 
If the Company shall at any time act as its own Paying Agent with respect to any series of Securities, it will, on or before each due date for the principal of or premium, if any, or interest on any of the Securities of that series, segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the Holders of such Securities a sum sufficient to pay the principal and premium, if any, and interest so becoming due until such sums shall be paid to such Holders or otherwise disposed of as herein provided and will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to act.
Whenever the Company shall have one or more Paying Agents for any series of Securities, it will, no later than 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on each due date for the principal of or premium, if any, or interest on any Securities of that series, deposit with a Paying Agent a sum sufficient to pay such amount, such sum to be held in trust for the Holders of such Securities entitled to the same, and (unless such Paying Agent is the Trustee) the Company will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to act.
The Company will cause each Paying Agent for any series of Securities other than the Trustee to execute and deliver to the Trustee an instrument in which such Paying Agent shall agree with the Trustee, subject to the provisions of this Section 1003, that such Paying Agent shall hold in trust for the benefit of Holders or the Trustee all money held by such Paying Agent for the payment of principal of or interest on the Securities and shall notify the Trustee in writing of any default by the Company in making any such payment.
The Company may at any time, for the purpose of obtaining the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture or for any other purpose, pay, or by Company Order direct any Paying Agent to pay, to the Trustee all sums held in trust by the Company or such Paying Agent, such sums to be held by the Trustee upon the same trusts as those upon which such sums were held by the Company or such Paying Agent; and, upon such payment by any Paying Agent to the Trustee, such Paying Agent shall be released from all further liability with respect to such money.
 
Subject to any applicable abandoned property law, any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then held by the Company, in trust for the payment of the principal of or premium, if any, or interest on any Security of any series and remaining unclaimed for two years after such principal, premium or interest has become due and payable shall be paid to the Company on Company Request, or (if then held by the Company) shall be discharged from such trust; and the Holder of such Security shall thereafter, as an unsecured general creditor, look only to the Company for payment thereof, and all liability of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust money, and all liability of the Company as trustee thereof, shall thereupon cease.
 
The Company shall deliver to the Trustee within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year of the Company ending after the date hereof an Officer's Certificate signed by its principal executive officer, principal financial officer or principal accounting officer, stating whether or not, to the best knowledge of such officer, the Company is in default in the performance and observance of any of the terms, provisions and conditions of this Indenture (without regard to any period of grace or requirement of notice provided hereunder) and, if the Company shall be in default, specifying all such defaults and the nature and status thereof of which they may have knowledge.
 
Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 for Securities of such series, the Company may, with respect to the Securities of any series, omit in any particular instance to comply with any term, provision or condition set forth in any covenant provided pursuant to Section 301(18), 901(1) or 901(7) for the benefit of the Holders of such series, if before the time for such compliance the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series shall, by Act of such Holders, either waive such compliance in such instance or generally waive compliance with such term, provision or condition, but no such waiver shall extend to or affect such term, provision or condition except to the extent so expressly waived, and, until such waiver shall become effective, the obligations of the Company and the duties of the Trustee in respect of any such term, provision or condition shall remain in full force and effect.
 
Securities of any series which are redeemable before their Stated Maturity shall be redeemable in accordance with their terms and (except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 for such Securities) in accordance with this Article XI.
 
The election of the Company to redeem any Securities shall be evidenced by a Board Resolution or an Officer's Certificate or in another manner specified as contemplated by Section
 
301 for such Securities. In case of any redemption at the election of the Company of the Securities of any series (including any such redemption affecting only a single Security), the Company shall, at least 60 days prior to the Redemption Date fixed by the Company (unless a shorter notice shall be satisfactory to the Trustee), notify the Trustee of such Redemption Date, of the principal amount of Securities of such series to be redeemed and, if applicable, of the tenor of the Securities to be redeemed. In the case of any redemption of Securities prior to the expiration of any restriction on such redemption provided in the terms of such Securities or elsewhere in this Indenture, the Company shall furnish the Trustee with an Officer's Certificate evidencing compliance with such restriction.
 
If less than all the Securities of any series are to be redeemed (unless all the Securities of such series and of a specified tenor are to be redeemed or unless such redemption affects only a single Security), the particular Securities to be redeemed shall be selected not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date by the Trustee, from the Outstanding Securities of such series not previously called for redemption, by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate and which may provide for the selection for redemption of a portion of the principal amount of any Security of such series; that the unredeemed portion of the principal amount of any Security shall be in an authorized denomination (which shall not be less than the minimum authorized denomination) for such Security. If less than all the Securities of such series and of a specified tenor are to be redeemed (unless such redemption affects only a single Security), the particular Securities to be redeemed shall be selected not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date by the Trustee, from the Outstanding Securities of such series and specified tenor not previously called for redemption in accordance with the preceding sentence.
provided
If any Security selected for partial redemption is converted in part before termination of the conversion right with respect to the portion of the Security so selected, the converted portion of such Security shall be deemed (so far as may be) to be the portion selected for redemption. Securities which have been converted during a selection of securities to be redeemed shall be treated by the Trustee as Outstanding for the purpose of such selection.
The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company in writing of the Securities selected for redemption as aforesaid and, in case of any Securities selected for partial redemption as aforesaid, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed.
The provisions of the two preceding paragraphs shall not apply with respect to any redemption affecting only a single Security, whether such Security is to be redeemed in whole or in part. In the case of any such redemption in part, the unredeemed portion of the principal amount of the Security shall be in an authorized denomination (which shall not be less than the minimum authorized denomination) for such Security.
For all purposes of this Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of Securities shall relate, in the case of any Securities redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the principal amount of such Securities which has been or is to be redeemed.
 
 
Notice of redemption shall be given by first-class mail, postage prepaid, mailed not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date, to each Holder of Securities to be redeemed, at such Holder's address appearing in the Security Register. If Trustee is to give such notice, the Company shall instruct the Trustee in writing no later than 10 business days (or a shorter time period as the Trustee may agree to) before the desired notice mailing date.
All notices of redemption shall state:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Notice of redemption of Securities to be redeemed at the election of the Company shall be given by the Company or, at the Company's request (which may be rescinded or revoked at any time prior to the time at which the Trustee shall have given such notice to the Holders), by the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Company. The notice, if mailed in the manner herein provided, shall be conclusively presumed to have been given, whether or not the Holder receives such notice. In any case, failure to give such notice by mail or any defect in the notice to the Holder of any Security designated for redemption as a whole or in part shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other Securities.
 
 
By no later than 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on any Redemption Date, the Company shall deposit with the Trustee or with a Paying Agent (or, if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 1003) an amount of money sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of, and (except if the Redemption Date shall be an Interest Payment Date or the Securities of the series provide otherwise) accrued interest on, all the Securities which are to be redeemed on that date, other than Securities or portions of Securities called for redemption which are owned by the Company or a Subsidiary and have been delivered by the Company or such Subsidiary to the Trustee for cancellation. All money, if any, earned on funds held by the Paying Agent shall be remitted to the Company. In addition, the Paying Agent shall promptly return to the Company any money deposited with the Paying Agent by the Company in excess of the amounts necessary to pay the Redemption Price of, and accrued interest, if any, on, all Securities to be redeemed.
If any Security called for redemption is converted, any money deposited with the Trustee or with any Paying Agent or so segregated and held in trust for the redemption of such Security shall (subject to any right of the Holder of such Security or any Predecessor Security to receive interest as provided in the last paragraph of Section 307 or in the terms of such Security) be paid to the Company upon Company Request or, if then held by the Company, shall be discharged from such trust.
 
Notice of redemption having been given as aforesaid, the Securities so to be redeemed shall, on the Redemption Date, become due and payable at the Redemption Price therein specified, and from and after such date (unless the Company shall default in the payment of the Redemption Price and accrued interest) such Securities shall cease to bear interest. Upon surrender of any such Security for redemption in accordance with said notice, such Security shall be paid by the Company at the Redemption Price, together, if applicable, with accrued interest to the Redemption Date; , , that, unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301, installments of interest whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to the Redemption Date will be payable to the Holders of such Securities, or one or more Predecessor Securities, registered as such at the close of business on the relevant Record Dates according to their terms and the provisions of Section 307; that, unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301, if the Redemption Date is after a Regular Record Date and on or prior to the Interest Payment Date, the accrued and unpaid interest shall be payable to the Holder of the redeemed Securities registered on the relevant Regular Record Date.

If any Security called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, the principal and premium, if any, shall, until paid, bear interest from the Redemption Date at the rate prescribed therefor in the Security.
 
Any Security which is to be redeemed only in part shall be surrendered at a Place of Payment therefor (with, if the Company or the Trustee so requires, due endorsement by, or a
 
written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder thereof or such Holder's attorney duly authorized in writing), and the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of such Security without service charge, a new Security or Securities of the same series and of like tenor, of any authorized denomination as requested by such Holder, in principal amount equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the principal of the Security so surrendered.
 
The provisions of this Article XII shall be applicable to any sinking fund for the retirement of Securities of any series except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 for such Securities.
The minimum amount of any sinking fund payment provided for by the terms of any series of Securities is herein referred to as a "mandatory sinking fund payment," and any payment in excess of such minimum amount provided for by the terms of such Securities is herein referred to as an "optional sinking fund payment." If provided for by the terms of any series of Securities, the cash amount of any sinking fund payment may be subject to reduction as provided in Section 1202. Each sinking fund payment shall be applied to the redemption of Securities of the series as provided for by the terms of such Securities.
 
The Company (1) may deliver Outstanding Securities of a series (other than any previously called for redemption) and (2) may apply as a credit Securities of a series which have been redeemed either at the election of the Company pursuant to the terms of such Securities or through the application of permitted optional sinking fund payments pursuant to the terms of such Securities, in each case in satisfaction of all or any part of any sinking fund payment with respect to any Securities of such series required to be made pursuant to the terms of such Securities as and to the extent provided for by the terms of such Securities; that the Securities to be so credited have not been previously so credited. The Securities to be so credited shall be received and credited for such purpose by the Trustee at the Redemption Price, as specified in the Securities so to be redeemed, for redemption through operation of the sinking fund and the amount of such sinking fund payment shall be reduced accordingly.
provided
 
Not less than 60 days (or such shorter period as shall be satisfactory to the Trustee) prior to each sinking fund payment date for any Securities, the Company will deliver to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate specifying the amount of the next ensuing sinking fund payment for such Securities pursuant to the terms of such Securities, the portion thereof, if any, which is to be satisfied by payment of cash and the portion thereof, if any, which is to be satisfied by delivering and crediting Securities pursuant to Section 1202 and will also deliver to the Trustee any Securities to be so delivered. Not less than 30 days prior to each such sinking fund payment date, the Trustee shall select the Securities to be redeemed upon such sinking fund payment date in the
 
manner specified in Section 1103 and cause notice of the redemption thereof to be given in the name of and at the expense of the Company in the manner provided in Section 1104. Such notice having been duly given, the redemption of such Securities shall be made upon the terms and in the manner stated in Sections 1106 and 1107.
 
Unless otherwise provided as contemplated by Section 301, Sections 1302 and 1303 shall apply to any Securities or any series of Securities, as the case may be, in either case, denominated in U.S. dollars and bearing interest at a fixed rate, in accordance with any applicable requirements provided pursuant to Section 301 and upon compliance with the conditions set forth below in this Article XIII; and the Company may elect, at its option at any time, to have Sections 1302 and 1303 applied to any Securities or any series of Securities, as the case may be, designated pursuant to Section 301 as being defeasible pursuant to such Section 1302 or 1303, in accordance with any applicable requirements provided pursuant to Section 301 and upon compliance with the conditions set forth below in this Article XIII. Any such election to have or not to have Sections 1302 and 1303 apply, as the case may be, shall be evidenced by a Board Resolution, Officer's Certificate or in another manner specified as contemplated by Section 301 for such Securities.
 
Upon the Company's exercise of its option, if any, to have this Section 1302 applied to any Securities or any series of Securities, as the case may be, or if this Section 1302 shall otherwise apply to any Securities or any series of Securities, as the case may be, the Company shall be deemed to have been discharged from its obligations with respect to such Securities as provided in this Section 1302 on and after the date the conditions set forth in Section 1304 are satisfied (hereinafter called ""). For this purpose, such Defeasance means that the Company shall be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire indebtedness represented by such Securities and to have satisfied all its other obligations under such Securities and this Indenture insofar as such Securities are concerned (and the Trustee, at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging the same), subject to the following which shall survive until otherwise terminated or discharged hereunder: (1) the rights of Holders of such Securities to receive, solely from the trust fund described in Section 1304 and as more fully set forth in such Section 1305, payments in respect of the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on such Securities when payments are due, (2) the Company's obligations with respect to such Securities under Sections 304, 305, 306, 1002 and 1003, (3) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee hereunder and (4) this Article XIII. Subject to compliance with this Article XIII, the Company may exercise its option, if any, to have this Section 1302 applied to the Securities of any series notwithstanding the prior exercise of its option, if any, to have Section 1303 applied to such Securities.
Defeasance
 
 
Upon the Company's exercise of its option, if any, to have this Section 1303 applied to any Securities or any series of Securities, as the case may be, or if this Section 1303 shall otherwise apply to any Securities or any series of Securities, as the case may be, (1) the Company shall be released from its obligations under any covenants provided pursuant to Section 301(18), 901(1) or 901(7) for the benefit of the Holders of such Securities and (2) the occurrence of any event specified in Sections 501(4) and Section 501(7) shall be deemed not to be or result in an Event of Default, in each case with respect to such Securities as provided in this Section 1303 on and after the date the conditions set forth in Section 1304 are satisfied (hereinafter called ""). For this purpose, such Covenant Defeasance means that, with respect to such Securities, the Company may omit to comply with and shall have no liability in respect of any term, condition or limitation set forth in any such specified Section, whether directly or indirectly by reason of any reference elsewhere herein to any such Section or by reason of any reference in any such Section to any other provision herein or in any other document, but the remainder of this Indenture and such Securities shall be unaffected thereby.
Covenant Defeasance
 
The following shall be the conditions to the application of Section 1302 or 1303 to any Securities or any series of Securities, as the case may be:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Before or after a deposit, the Company may make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the redemption of Securities at a future date in accordance with Article XI.
 
Subject to the provisions of the last paragraph of Section 1003, all money and U.S. Government Obligations (including the proceeds thereof) deposited with the Trustee or other qualifying trustee (solely for purposes of this Section 1305 and Section 1306, the Trustee and any such other trustee are referred to collectively as the "") pursuant to Section 1304 in respect of any Securities shall be held in trust and applied by the Trustee, in accordance with the provisions of such Securities and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any such Paying Agent (including the Company acting as its own Paying Agent) as the Trustee may determine, to the Holders of such Securities, of all sums due and to become due thereon in respect of principal and premium, if any, and interest, but money so held in trust need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law.
Trustee
The Company shall pay and indemnify the Trustee against any tax, fee or other charge imposed on or assessed against the U.S. Government Obligations deposited pursuant to Section 1304 or the principal and interest received in respect thereof other than any such tax, fee or other charge which by law is for the account of the Holders of Outstanding Securities; that the Trustee shall be entitled to charge any such tax, fee or other charge to such Holder's account.
provided
Anything in this Article XIII to the contrary notwithstanding, the Trustee shall deliver or pay to the Company from time to time upon Company Request any money or U.S. Government Obligations held by it as provided in Section 1304 with respect to any Securities which are in excess of the amount thereof which would then be required to be deposited to effect the Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance, as the case may be, with respect to such Securities.
 
If the Trustee or the Paying Agent is unable to apply any money in accordance with this Article XIII with respect to any Securities by reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, then the obligations under this Indenture and such Securities from which the Company has been discharged or released pursuant to Section 1302 or 1303 shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to this Article XIII with respect to such Securities, until such time as the Trustee or Paying Agent is permitted to apply all money held in trust pursuant to Section 1305 with respect to such Securities in accordance with this Article XIII; , , that (a) if the Company makes any payment of principal of or premium, if any, or interest on any such Security following such reinstatement of its obligations, the Company shall be subrogated to the rights, if any, of the Holders of such Securities to receive such payment from the money so held in trust and (b) unless otherwise required by any legal proceeding or any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority, the Trustee or Paying Agent shall
provided
however
 
return all such money and U.S. Government Obligations to the Company promptly after receiving a written request therefor at any time, if such reinstatement of the Company's obligations has occurred and continues to be in effect.
 
Repayment of Securities of any series before their Stated Maturity at the option of Holders thereof shall be made in accordance with the terms of such Securities and (except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 for Securities of any series) in accordance with this Article XIV.
 
Securities of any series subject to repayment in whole or in part at the option of the Holders thereof will, unless otherwise provided in the terms of such Securities, be repaid at a price equal to the principal amount thereof and premium, if any, thereon, together with interest thereon accrued to the Repayment Date specified in or pursuant to the terms of such Securities. The Company covenants that on or before the Repayment Date it will deposit with the Trustee or with a Paying Agent (or, if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 1003) an amount of money sufficient to pay the principal (or, if so provided by the terms of the Securities of any series, a percentage of the principal) of, the premium, if any, and (except if the Repayment Date shall be an Interest Payment Date) accrued interest on, all the Securities or portions thereof, as the case may be, to be repaid on such date.
 
Securities of any series subject to repayment at the option of the Holders thereof will contain an "Option to Elect Repayment" form on the reverse of such Securities. To be repaid at the option of the Holder, any Security so providing for such repayment, with the "Option to Elect Repayment" form on the reverse of such Security duly completed by the Holder (or by the Holder's attorney duly authorized in writing), must be received by the Company at the Place of Payment therefor specified in the terms of such Security (or at such other place or places of which the Company shall from time to time notify the Holders of such Securities) not earlier than 45 days nor later than 30 days prior to the Repayment Date. If less than the entire principal amount of such Security is to be repaid in accordance with the terms of such Security, the principal amount of such Security to be repaid, in increments of the minimum denomination for Securities of such series, and the denomination or denominations of the Security or Securities to be issued to the Holder for the portion of the principal amount of such Security surrendered that is not to be repaid, must be specified. The principal amount of any Security providing for repayment at the option of the Holder thereof may not be repaid in part if, following such repayment, the unpaid principal amount of such Security would be less than the minimum authorized denomination of Securities of the series of which such Security to be repaid is a part. Except as otherwise may be provided by the terms of any Security providing for repayment at the option of the Holder thereof, exercise of the repayment option by the Holder shall be irrevocable unless waived by the Company.
 
 
If Securities of any series providing for repayment at the option of the Holders thereof shall have been surrendered as provided in this Article XIV and as provided by or pursuant to the terms of such Securities, such Securities or the portions thereof, as the case may be, to be repaid shall become due and payable and shall be paid by the Company on the Repayment Date therein specified, and on and after such Repayment Date (unless the Company shall default in the payment of such Securities on such Repayment Date) such Securities shall, if the same were interest-bearing, cease to bear interest. Upon surrender of any such Security for repayment in accordance with such provisions, the principal amount of such Security so to be repaid shall be paid by the Company, together with accrued interest and/or premium, if any, to (but excluding) the Repayment Date; , , that, unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301, installments of interest, if any, whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to the Repayment Date shall be payable (but without interest thereon, unless the Company shall default in the payment thereof) to the Holders of such Securities, or one or more Predecessor Securities, registered as such at the close of business on the relevant Record Dates according to their terms and the provisions of Section 307.
provided
however
If the principal amount of any Security surrendered for repayment shall not be so repaid upon surrender thereof, such principal amount (together with interest, if any, thereon accrued to such Repayment Date) and any premium shall, until paid, bear interest from the Repayment Date at the rate of interest or yield to maturity (in the case of Original Issue Discount Securities) set forth in such Security.
 
Upon surrender of any Security which is to be repaid in part only, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of such Security, without service charge and at the expense of the Company, a new Security or Securities of the same series, of any authorized denomination specified by the Holder, in a principal amount equal to and in exchange for the portion of the principal of such Security so surrendered which is not to be repaid.
 
This instrument may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which so executed shall be deemed to be an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same instrument.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Indenture to be duly executed and attested, all as of the day and year first above written.

The Securities will be issued under an indenture (the "Base Indenture") between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, each dated as of December 20, 2010 (the "First Supplemental Indenture" and, together with the Base Indenture, the "Indenture").
We have examined the Registration Statement, the Base Indenture and First Supplemental Indenture, which are being filed with the Commission on the date hereof, duplicates of the global notes representing the Securities and the Underwriting Agreement. We also have examined the originals, or duplicates or certified or conformed copies, of such corporate and other records, agreements, documents and other instruments and have made such other investigations as we have deemed relevant and necessary in connection with the opinions hereinafter set forth.As to questions of fact material to this opinion, we have relied upon certificates or comparable documents of public officials and of officers and representatives of the Company.

We also have assumed that the Indenture is the valid and legally binding obligation of the Trustee.
Based upon the foregoing, and subject to the qualifications, assumptions and limitations stated herein, we are of the opinion that the Securities have been duly authorized, executed and issued by the Company and, assuming due authentication thereof by the Trustee, and upon payment and delivery in accordance with the Underwriting Agreement, the Securities will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms.
Our opinion set forth above is subject to (i) the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally, (ii) general equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and (iii) an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.

Bard, Inc., a New Jersey corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (the "Registration Statement") filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, relating to the issuance by the Company of $250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 2.875% notes due 2016 (the "2016 Notes") and $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 4.400% notes due 2021 (the "2021 Notes" and, together with the 2016 Notes, the "Securities") pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement dated December 15, 2010 between the Company and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Goldman, Sachs & Co., Wells Fargo Securities, LLC and the other several underwriters named in Schedule A thereto (the "Underwriting Agreement"). The Securities will be issued under an indenture (the "Base Indenture") between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, each dated as of December 20, 2010 (the "First Supplemental Indenture" and, together with the Base Indenture, the "Indenture").
We have examined the Registration Statement, the Base Indenture and First Supplemental Indenture, which are being filed with the Commission on the date hereof, duplicates of the global notes representing the Securities and the Underwriting Agreement. We also have examined the originals, or duplicates or certified or conformed copies, of such corporate and other records, agreements, documents and other instruments and have made such other investigations as we have deemed relevant and necessary in connection with the opinions hereinafter set forth. As to questions of fact material to this opinion, we have relied upon certificates or comparable documents of public officials and of officers and representatives of the Company.
In rendering the opinion set forth below, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as duplicates or certified or conformed copies and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents. We also have assumed that the Indenture is the valid and legally binding obligation of the Trustee.
Based upon the foregoing, and subject to the qualifications, assumptions and limitations stated herein, we are of the opinion that the issuance of the Securities in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture upon payment of the consideration therefor as provided in the applicable definitive underwriting agreement approved by the Board of Directors of the Company have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action and, to the extent governed by New Jersey law, have been duly authorized.
We do not express any opinion herein concerning any law other than the law of the State of New Jersey.
We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion letter as Exhibit 5.2 to the Company's Form 8-K filed on December 20, 2010 and to the use of our name under the caption "Validity of the Securities" in the prospectus included in the Registration Statement, as supplemented by the prospectus supplement dated December 15, 2010.

The company undertakes no obligation to update its forward-looking statements.

This press release contains financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP measures in the above tables.
This press release includes net sales excluding the impact of foreign exchange. The company analyzes net sales on a constant currency basis to better measure the comparability of results between periods. Because changes in foreign currency exchange rates have a non-operating impact on net sales, the company believes that evaluating growth in net sales on a constant currency basis provides an additional and meaningful assessment of net sales to both management and the company's investors.
In addition, this press release includes the following non-GAAP measures: (1) cost of goods sold excluding charges for an asset disposition and acquisition related items; (2) marketing, selling and administrative expense excluding charges for acquisition related items and the write-down of public hospital receivables in Greece; (3) research and development expense excluding acquisition related items; (4) other (income) expense, net, excluding charges for restructuring, acquisition related items, asset dispositions, an insurance settlement, and a gain related to an insurance recovery; (5) income tax provision excluding a decrease due to reductions of certain tax positions and excluding an increase resulting from a cash repatriation of certain foreign earnings, and the tax effect of the items set forth in (1) through (4) above; (6) net income attributable to common shareholders excluding the items set forth in (1) through (5) above; and (7) diluted earnings per share available to common shareholders excluding the items set forth in (1) through (5) above.
The company excluded the items described above because they may cause certain statements of income categories not to be indicative of ongoing operating results, and therefore affect the comparability of results between periods. The company therefore believes that these non-GAAP measures provide an additional and meaningful assessment of the company's ongoing operating performance. Because the company has historically reported these non-GAAP results to the investment community, management also believes that the inclusion of these non-GAAP measures provides consistency in its financial reporting and facilitates investors' understanding of the company's historic operating trends by providing an additional basis for comparisons to prior periods. Management uses these non-GAAP measures: (1) to establish financial and operational goals; (2) to monitor the company's actual performance in relation to its business plan and operating budgets; (3) to evaluate the company's core operating performance and understand key trends within the business; and (4) as part of several components it considers in determining incentive compensation.
Management recognizes that the use of these non-GAAP measures has limitations, including the fact that they may not be comparable with similar non-GAAP measures used by other companies and that management must exercise judgment in determining which types of charges or other items should be excluded from the non-GAAP information. Management compensates for these limitations by providing full disclosure of each non-GAAP measure and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. All non-GAAP measures are intended to supplement the applicable GAAP disclosures and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a replacement for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures, please see the above tables.

Timothy M.

This success demonstrates the effectiveness of our product leadership strategy and the ability of our organization to execute. Our R&D investments and business development activities continue to provide healthy returns to shareholders."

On June 30, 2011, C. R. Bard, Inc. (the "Company") announced that it has reached agreements in principle with various plaintiffs' law firms to settle the majority of its existing Hernia Product Claims (as described below). Based on these events, the Company expects to incur a charge of approximately $184 million ($181 million after tax) in the second quarter of 2011 which will recognize the estimated costs of settling all Hernia Product Claims, including asserted and unasserted claims, and costs to administer the settlements. This charge excludes any costs associated with pending putative class action lawsuits. The agreements with the various plaintiffs' law firms are subject to certain conditions, including requirements for participation in the proposed settlements by a certain minimum number of their respective clients.
"Hernia Product Claims" refers to individual lawsuits and non-litigated claims, as well as putative class actions filed or asserted against the Company, with respect to its Composix Kugel and certain other hernia repair implant products. The Hernia Product Claims generally seek damages for personal injury resulting from use of the products. The Company voluntarily recalled certain sizes and lots of the Composix Kugel products beginning in December 2005. See the Company's March 31, 2011 Form 10-Q for more detailed information about the Hernia Product Claims.

Many factors may cause actual results to differ materially from anticipated results including failure of plaintiffs' law firms to obtain participation from their clients, adverse verdicts in subsequent trials and/or new lawsuits and/or claims exceeding the Company's estimates. Actual costs may be higher or lower than the amount of the charge. The Company undertakes no obligation to update its forward-looking statements. Please refer to the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information in the Company's March 31, 2011 Form 10-Q for more detailed information about these and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied.

July 21, 2011

Exhibit 99.1
 
 (July 21, 2011)  C. R. Bard, Inc. (NYSE: BCR) today reported 2011 second quarter financial results. Second quarter 2011 net sales were $725.0 million, an increase of 8 percent over the prior-year period on a reported basis, 5 percent on a constant currency basis.

For the second quarter 2011, net loss attributable to common shareholders was ($47.8 million) and diluted loss per share available to common shareholders was ($0.55), reflecting the previously disclosed charge relating to hernia product litigation.

This press release may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are based on management's current expectations, the accuracy of which is necessarily subject to risks and uncertainties. These statements are not historical in nature and use words such as "anticipate", "estimate", "expect", "project", "intend", "forecast", "plan", "believe", and other words of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. Many factors may cause actual results to differ materially from anticipated results including product developments, sales efforts, income tax matters, the outcomes of contingencies such as legal proceedings, and other economic, business, competitive and regulatory factors. The company undertakes no obligation to update its forward-looking statements. Please refer to the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information in our March 31, 2011 Form 10-Q for more detailed information about these and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This press release contains financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP measures in the above tables.
This press release includes net sales excluding the impact of foreign exchange. The company analyzes net sales on a constant currency basis to better measure the comparability of results between periods. Because changes in foreign currency exchange rates have a non-operating impact on net sales, the company believes that evaluating growth in net sales on a constant currency basis provides an additional and meaningful assessment of net sales to both management and the company's investors.
In addition, this press release includes the following non-GAAP measures: (1) cost of goods sold excluding charges for acquisition related items; (2) marketing, selling and administrative expense excluding charges for acquisition related items and the write-down of public hospital receivables in Greece; (3) research and development expense excluding charges for acquisition related items; (4) other (income) expense, net, excluding charges for acquisition related items, legal settlements and commitments, and a reversal of restructuring costs; (5) income tax provision excluding the tax effect of the items set forth in (1) through (4) above; (6) net (loss) income attributable to common shareholders excluding the items set forth in (1) through (5) above; and (7) diluted (loss) earnings per share available to common shareholders excluding the items set forth in (1) through (5) above.
The company excluded the items described above because they may cause certain statements of operations categories not to be indicative of ongoing operating results, and therefore affect the comparability of results between periods. The company therefore believes that these non-GAAP measures provide an additional and meaningful assessment of the company's ongoing operating performance. Because the company has historically reported these non-GAAP results to the investment community, management also believes that the inclusion of these non-GAAP measures provides consistency in its financial reporting and facilitates investors' understanding of the company's historic operating trends by providing an additional basis for comparisons to prior periods. Management uses these non-GAAP measures: (1) to establish financial and operational goals; (2) to monitor the company's actual performance in relation to its business plan and operating budgets; (3) to evaluate the company's core operating performance and understand key trends within the business; and (4) as part of several components it considers in determining incentive compensation.
Management recognizes that the use of these non-GAAP measures has limitations, including the fact that they may not be comparable with similar non-GAAP measures used by other companies and that management must exercise judgment in determining which types of charges or other items should be excluded from the non-GAAP information. Management compensates for these limitations by providing full disclosure of each non-GAAP measure and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. All non-GAAP measures are intended to supplement the applicable GAAP disclosures and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a replacement for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures, please see the above tables.

For the third quarter 2011, net income attributable to common shareholders was $130.1 million and diluted earnings per share available to common shareholders were $1.46, an increase of 2 percent and 9 percent, respectively, as compared to the third quarter 2010 results.

This press release may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are based on management's current expectations, the accuracy of which is necessarily subject to risks and uncertainties. These statements are not historical in nature and use words such as "anticipate", "estimate", "expect", "project", "intend", "forecast", "plan", "believe", and other words of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. Many factors may cause actual results to differ materially from anticipated results including product developments, sales efforts, income tax matters, the outcomes of contingencies such as legal proceedings, and other economic, business, competitive and regulatory factors. The company undertakes no obligation to update its forward-looking statements. Please refer to the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information in our June 30, 2011 Form 10-Q for more detailed information about these and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This press release contains financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP measures in the above tables.
This press release includes net sales excluding the impact of foreign exchange. The company analyzes net sales on a constant currency basis to better measure the comparability of results between periods. Because changes in foreign currency exchange rates have a non-operating impact on net sales, the company believes that evaluating growth in net sales on a constant currency basis provides an additional and meaningful assessment of net sales to both management and the company's investors.
In addition, this press release includes the following non-GAAP measures: (1) cost of goods sold excluding charges for acquisition related items; (2) marketing, selling and administrative expense excluding charges for acquisition related items and the write-down of public hospital receivables in Greece; (3) research and development expense excluding charges for acquisition related items; (4) other (income) expense, net, excluding charges for acquisition related items, legal settlements and commitments, charges for restructuring, and the impairment of Greek bonds; (5) income tax provision excluding a decrease due to an audit settlement, an increase resulting from a cash repatriation of certain foreign earnings, a decrease due to a remeasurement of certain tax positions and the tax effect of the items set forth in (1) through (4) above; (6) net income attributable to common shareholders excluding the items set forth in (1) through (5) above; and (7) diluted earnings per share available to common shareholders excluding the items set forth in (1) through (5) above.
The company excluded the items described above because they may cause certain statements of operations categories not to be indicative of ongoing operating results, and therefore affect the comparability of results between periods. The company therefore believes that these non-GAAP measures provide an additional and meaningful assessment of the company's ongoing operating performance. Because the company has historically reported these non-GAAP results to the investment community, management also believes that the inclusion of these non-GAAP measures provides consistency in its financial reporting and facilitates investors' understanding of the company's historic operating trends by providing an additional basis for comparisons to prior periods. Management uses these non-GAAP measures: (1) to establish financial and operational goals; (2) to monitor the company's actual performance in relation to its business plan and operating budgets; (3) to evaluate the company's core operating performance and understand key trends within the business; and (4) as part of several components it considers in determining incentive compensation.
Management recognizes that the use of these non-GAAP measures has limitations, including the fact that they may not be comparable with similar non-GAAP measures used by other companies and that management must exercise judgment in determining which types of charges or other items should be excluded from the non-GAAP information. Management compensates for these limitations by providing full disclosure of each non-GAAP measure and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. All non-GAAP measures are intended to supplement the applicable GAAP disclosures and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a replacement for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures, please see the above tables.

The ultimate settlement of this matter is subject to the negotiation and execution of definitive agreements, which will likely include civil settlement and non-prosecution agreements, and a corporate integrity agreement with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General ("OIG").

See the company's September 30, 2011 Form 10-Q for additional information regarding this matter.

Adjusting for items that affect comparability between periods, full year 2011 net income attributable to common shareholders was $568.9 million and diluted earnings per share available to common shareholders were $6.40, an increase of 6 percent and 14 percent, respectively, as compared to full year 2010 results.
Timothy M. Ring, chairman and chief executive officer, commented, "Fourth quarter constant currency net sales growth of 5% was at the top end of our guidance and allowed us to exceed adjusted EPS guidance for the quarter and for the year. Our revenue growth is being driven by a combination of geographic investments, external acquisitions and internal research and development. By combining top-line growth with disciplined expense management and share-repurchase programs, we have been able to meet our short-term commitments to shareholders while positioning the company for healthy long-term growth."

This press release may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are based on management's current expectations, the accuracy of which is necessarily subject to risks and uncertainties. These statements are not historical in nature and use words such as "anticipate", "estimate", "expect", "project", "intend", "forecast", "plan", "believe", and other words of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. Many factors may cause actual results to differ materially from anticipated results including product developments, sales efforts, income tax matters, the outcomes of contingencies such as legal proceedings, and other economic, business, competitive and regulatory factors. The company undertakes no obligation to update its forward-looking statements. Please refer to the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information in our September 30, 2011 Form 10-Q for more detailed information about these and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This press release contains financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP measures in the above tables.
This press release includes net sales excluding the impact of foreign exchange. The company analyzes net sales on a constant currency basis to better measure the comparability of results between periods. Because changes in foreign currency exchange rates have a non-operating impact on net sales, the company believes that evaluating growth in net sales on a constant currency basis provides an additional and meaningful assessment of net sales to both management and the company's investors.
In addition, this press release includes the following non-GAAP measures: (1) cost of goods sold excluding charges for acquisition related items; (2) marketing, selling and administrative expense excluding charges for acquisition related items and the write-down of public hospital receivables in Greece; (3) research and development expense excluding charges for acquisition related items; (4) other (income) expense, net, excluding charges for acquisition related items, legal settlements and commitments, the impairment of Greek bonds; and charges for restructuring; (5) income tax provision excluding a decrease due to audit settlements and reductions of certain tax positions, an increase resulting from a cash repatriation of certain foreign earnings, and the tax effect of the items set forth in (1) through (4) above; (6) net income attributable to common shareholders excluding the items set forth in (1) through (5) above; and (7) diluted earnings per share available to common shareholders excluding the items set forth in (1) through (5) above.
The company excluded the items described above because they may cause certain statements of operations categories not to be indicative of ongoing operating results, and therefore affect the comparability of results between periods. The company therefore believes that these non-GAAP measures provide an additional and meaningful assessment of the company's ongoing operating performance. Because the company has historically reported these non-GAAP results to the investment community, management also believes that the inclusion of these non-GAAP measures provides consistency in its financial reporting and facilitates investors' understanding of the company's historic operating trends by providing an additional basis for comparisons to prior periods. Management uses these non-GAAP measures: (1) to establish financial and operational goals; (2) to monitor the company's actual performance in relation to its business plan and operating budgets; (3) to evaluate the company's core operating performance and understand key trends within the business; and (4) as part of several components it considers in determining incentive compensation.
Management recognizes that the use of these non-GAAP measures has limitations, including the fact that they may not be comparable with similar non-GAAP measures used by other companies and that management must exercise judgment in determining which types of charges or other items should be excluded from the non-GAAP information. Management compensates for these limitations by providing full disclosure of each non-GAAP measure and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. All non-GAAP measures are intended to supplement the applicable GAAP disclosures and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a replacement for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures, please see the above tables.

At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present or represented, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified.
Quorum.

Voting.
SECTION 9. Any stockholder of record entitled to vote may be represented at any annual or special meeting of the stockholders by a duly appointed proxy.

Proxies.
 
SECTION 10. (a)  Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, any action required or permitted to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation, subject to the provisions of subsections (b) and (c) of this Section 10, may be taken without a meeting upon the written consent (which shall set forth the action to be so taken) of less than all the stockholders entitled to cast at least the minimum number of votes which would be required to take such action at a meeting at which all stockholders entitled to vote thereon are present; that prompt notice of the taking of corporate action without a meeting and by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented in writing.

Upon receipt of such a request, the Secretary shall, as promptly as practicable, call a special meeting of the Board of Directors to be held as promptly as practicable. At such meeting, the Board of Directors shall fix a record date within the limitations provided in Section 14A:5-7 (or its successor provision) of the New Jersey Business Corporation Act. Notice of the record date shall be published in accordance with the rules and policies of any stock exchange on which securities of the Company are then listed. Should the Board of Directors fail to fix a record date as provided for in this paragraph (b), then the record date shall be the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice of the meeting is given or, if no notice is given, the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held.
Determination of Record Date for Action by Written Consent.
(c) In the event of the delivery to the Company of a written consent or consents purporting to represent the requisite voting power to authorize or take corporate action and/or related revocations, the Secretary of the Corporation shall provide for the safe-keeping of such consents and revocations and shall engage nationally recognized independent inspectors of elections for the purpose of promptly performing a ministerial review of the validity of the consents and revocations.

Procedures for Written Consent.
SECTION 1. The Board of Directors shall consist of no fewer than three and no more than 14 Directors. The exact number of Directors within the minimum and maximum limitations specified in the preceding sentence shall be fixed from time to time by the Board of Directors pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the whole Board of Directors.

Except as otherwise required by law, until the term of a Continuing Classified Director or any other Director expires or otherwise terminates as aforesaid, such Directors may be removed from office by the stockholders of the Corporation or the Board of Directors only for cause pursuant to the applicable provisions of the New Jersey Business Corporation Act. Directors need not be residents of the State of New Jersey nor stockholders of the Corporation.
SECTION 2.

All nominations by stockholders shall be made pursuant to timely notice in proper written form to the Secretary of the Corporation. To be timely, a stockholder's notice shall be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than 30 days before or more than 60 days after such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so received not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of the annual meeting is first made. To be in proper written form, such stockholder's notice shall set forth in writing (a) as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election or re-election as a Director, all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including, without limitation, such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a Director if elected; and (b) as to the stockholder giving the notice (i) the name and address, as they appear on the Corporation's books, of such stockholder and (ii) the class and number of shares of the Corporation which are beneficially owned by such stockholder. At the request of the Board of Directors, any person nominated by the Board of Directors for election as a Director shall furnish to the Secretary of the Corporation that information required to be set forth in a stockholder's notice of nomination which pertains to the nominee. In the event that a stockholder seeks to nominate one or more Directors, the Secretary shall appoint two inspectors, who shall not be affiliated with the Corporation, to determine whether a stockholder has complied

with this Section 3.

SECTION 4. The Board of Directors shall have the control and management of the affairs of the Corporation and shall exercise all such powers of the Corporation and do all such lawful acts and things necessary or expedient in the control and management thereof as are not by statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation or by theseBy-Laws directed or required to be exercised or done by the stockholders.

All questions coming before the Board shall be determined and decided by a majority vote of Directors present. Each Director shall be entitled to one (1) vote at all meetings of Directors.
SECTION 6. Directors, as such, shall not receive any stated salary for their services, but the Board may, from time to time, by resolution, fix the fees or compensation of the Directors for services as such to the Corporation, including attendance at meetings of the Board of Directors or any committee thereof. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to preclude any Director from serving the Corporation in any other capacity and receiving compensation therefor.

The Board of Directors shall appoint an Executive Committee from the Directors, consisting of not less than three (3) members, which Committee shall have and exercise all of the authority of the Board of Directors in the management of the Corporation, except to the extent that the exercise of such authority would violate any applicable law or regulation or applicable rule or listing standard of any stock exchange.

April 24, 2012

Exhibit 99.1
 
 (April 24, 2012)  C. R. Bard, Inc. (NYSE: BCR) today reported 2012 first quarter financial results. First quarter 2012 net sales were $730.0 million, an increase of 4 percent over the prior-year period on a reported basis. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, first quarter 2012 net sales increased 5 percent over the prior-year period.
MURRAY HILL, NJ
For the first quarter 2012, net sales in the U.S. were $496.2 million, an increase of 2 percent over the prior-year period. Net sales outside the U.S. were $233.8 million, an increase of 10 percent over the prior-year period on a reported basis. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, first quarter 2012 net sales outside the U.S. increased 11 percent over the prior-year period.
For the first quarter 2012, net income was $138.7 million and diluted earnings per share available to common shareholders were $1.60, an increase of 5 percent and 7 percent, respectively, as compared to first quarter 2011 results. Adjusting for items that affect comparability between periods as detailed in the tables below, first quarter 2012 net income was $139.5 million and diluted earnings per share available to common shareholders were $1.61, an increase of 4 percent and 7 percent, respectively, as compared to first quarter 2011 results.
Timothy M. Ring, chairman and chief executive officer, commented, "The results this quarter reflect a good start to the year. While we haven't seen much change in the U.S. environment, our increased focus and investments in international markets have provided rapid returns and strengthened our growth profile. We remain focused on daily execution of our product leadership strategy to take advantage of current opportunities while positioning ourselves for stronger growth in the future."

This press release may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are based on management's current expectations, the accuracy of which is necessarily subject to risks and uncertainties. These statements are not historical in nature and use words such as "anticipate", "estimate", "expect", "project", "intend", "forecast", "plan", "believe", and other words of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. Many factors may cause actual results to differ materially from anticipated results including product developments, sales efforts, income tax matters, the outcomes of contingencies such as legal proceedings, and other economic, business, competitive and regulatory factors. The company undertakes no obligation to update its forward-looking statements. Please refer to the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information in our December 31, 2011 Form 10-K for more detailed information about these and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied.
 
 
 
 
 
 
This press release contains financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP measures in the above tables.
This press release includes net sales excluding the impact of foreign exchange. The company analyzes net sales on a constant currency basis to better measure the comparability of results between periods. Because changes in foreign currency exchange rates have a non-operating impact on net sales, the company believes that evaluating growth in net sales on a constant currency basis provides an additional and meaningful assessment of net sales to both management and the company's investors.
In addition, this press release includes the following non-GAAP measures: (1) cost of goods sold excluding charges for acquisition-related items; (2) marketing, selling and administrative expense excluding charges for acquisition-related items; (3) research and development expense excluding charges for acquisition-related items; (4) other (income) expense, net, excluding charges for acquisition-related items; (5) income tax provision excluding the tax effect of the items set forth in (1) through (4) above; (6) net income excluding the items set forth in (1) through (5) above; and (7) diluted earnings per share available to commons shareholders excluding the items set forth in (1) through (5) above.
The company excluded the items described above because they may cause certain statements of operations categories not to be indicative of ongoing operating results, and therefore affect the comparability of results between periods. The company therefore believes that these non-GAAP measures provide an additional and meaningful assessment of the company's ongoing operating performance. Because the company has historically reported these non-GAAP results to the investment community, management also believes that the inclusion of these non-GAAP measures provides consistency in its financial reporting and facilitates investors' understanding of the company's historic operating trends by providing an additional basis for comparisons to prior periods. Management uses these non-GAAP measures: (1) to establish financial and operational goals; (2) to monitor the company's actual performance in relation to its business plan and operating budgets; (3) to evaluate the company's core operating performance and understand key trends within the business; and (4) as part of several components it considers in determining incentive compensation.
Management recognizes that the use of these non-GAAP measures has limitations, including the fact that they may not be comparable with similar non-GAAP measures used by other companies and that management must exercise judgment in determining which types of charges or other items should be excluded from the non-GAAP information. Management compensates for these limitations by providing full disclosure of each non-GAAP measure and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. All non-GAAP measures are intended to supplement the applicable GAAP disclosures and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a replacement for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures, please see the above tables.

C. R. Bard, Inc. today announced with respect to its patent infringement suit against W.L. Gore & Associates ("Gore") that the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ("Court of Appeals") reaffirmed its opinion issued on February 10, 2012, including the ongoing royalty rates as set by the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona (the "District Court"), but for the sole issue of willfulness, which was remanded to the District Court.
Through March 31, 2012, Gore has deposited or secured with the District Court damages of approximately $887 million. Of this amount, approximately $681 million was today affirmed by the Court of Appeals, as were ongoing royalties due for future infringing sales, regardless of any final determination of willfulness. Approximately $185 million in enhanced damages for willfulness and approximately $21 million in attorneys' fees and interest pertain to the issue remanded to the District Court.
The District Court in Bard's patent infringement suit against Gore had found, among other things, that Gore willfully infringed Bard's patent number 6,436,135 by selling certain ePTFE vascular grafts and stent-grafts. Gore may request a review of the decision by the U.S. Supreme Court.

TWELFTH: The provisions of this Article TWELFTH shall be applicable to any transaction to which Article ELEVENTH is applicable (each such transaction being referred to hereinafter in this Article TWELFTH as a "Special Business Combination"); provided, however, that the provisions of this Article TWELFTH shall not be applicable to any Special Business Combination which shall have been approved by a majority of those members of the Corporation's Board of Directors who were in office immediately prior to the time when any shareholder of the Corporation which is a party to such Special Business Combination became an Interested Shareholder (as such term is defined below). No Special Business Combination to which this Article TWELFTH is applicable shall be authorized or adopted unless the conditions specified in clauses (i) and (ii) below are satisfied:
(i) Minimum Price and Form of Consideration
(A) The holders of shares of each class or series of the outstanding shares of all classes of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon ("Voting Shares") are to receive in such Special Business Combination an aggregate amount of cash and fair value of consideration per share other than cash that either shall be solely in cash or shall be in the same form and of the same kind as the consideration paid by the Interested Shareholder and its "affiliates" and "associates" (as such terms are defined in Article ELEVENTH) in acquiring the majority of the outstanding Voting Shares beneficially owned by them at the time of such Special Business Combination; and
 
(B) The holders of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation are to receive in such Special Business Combination an aggregate amount of cash and fair value of consideration per share other than cash that shall be at least equal to the higher of the following:

(B) After such Interested Shareholder has become an Interested Shareholder, such Interested Shareholder shall not have received the benefit, directly or indirectly (except proportionately as a shareholder), of any loans, advances, guarantees, pledges or other financial assistance or any tax credits or other tax advantages provided by the Corporation.
(C) A proxy or information statement describing the proposed Special Business Combination and complying with the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder (or any subsequent provisions replacing such Act, rules or regulations) shall be mailed to public shareholders of the Corporation at least 30 days prior to the consummation of such Special Business Combination (whether or not such proxy or information - statement is required to be mailed pursuant to such Act or subsequent provisions). Any such proxy or information statement shall also contain the recommendations of each of the members of the Board of Directors as to the advisability of the proposed Special Business Combination as well as the opinion of an investment banker selected by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors as to the fairness of the terms of the proposed Special Business Combination to the Corporation and its shareholders.

(a) which such person or any of its affiliates or associates (as such term is defined in Article ELEVENTH) beneficially owns, directly or indirectly; or
 
(b) which such person or any of its affiliates or associates has (1) the right to acquire (whether such right is exercisable immediately or only after the passage of time), pursuant to any agreement, arrangement or understanding or upon the exercise of conversion rights, exchange rights, warrants or options, or otherwise, or (2) the right to vote pursuant to any agreement, arrangement or understanding; or
(c) which are beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by any other person with which such person or any of its affiliates or associates has any agreement, arrangement or understanding for the purpose of acquiring, holding, voting or disposing of any shares of Voting Stock.

 (July 25, 2012)  C. R. Bard, Inc. (NYSE: BCR) today reported 2012 second quarter financial results. Second quarter 2012 net sales were $742.6 million, an increase of 2 percent over the prior-year period on a reported basis. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, second quarter 2012 net sales increased 4 percent over the prior-year period.
MURRAY HILL, NJ
For the second quarter 2012, net sales in the U.S. were $490.0 million, an increase of 2 percent over the prior-year period. Net sales outside the U.S. were $252.6 million, an increase of 3 percent over the prior-year period on a reported basis. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, second quarter 2012 net sales outside the U.S. increased 8 percent over the prior-year period.
For the second quarter 2012, net income was $133.9 million and diluted earnings per share available to common shareholders were $1.54. Adjusting for items that affect comparability between periods as detailed in the tables below, second quarter 2012 net income was $140.5 million and diluted earnings per share available to common shareholders were $1.62, a decrease of 1 percent and an increase of 3 percent, respectively, as compared to second quarter 2011 results.
Timothy M. Ring, chairman and chief executive officer, commented, "The economic climate remains challenging, especially in the United States and Europe. Navigating the short term while positioning for the long term is how we have remained strong and successful for over a century. As we have said, we believe the medical device companies who thrive in the future will provide clinically effective products at a value that benefits the entire healthcare system. Our teams are well positioned to identify unmet needs and provide successful solutions for our customers, and we see significant long-term opportunity as we continue to execute on our strategy."

This press release may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are based on management's current expectations, the accuracy of which is necessarily subject to risks and uncertainties. These statements are not historical in nature and use words such as "anticipate", "estimate", "expect", "project", "intend", "forecast", "plan", "believe", and other words of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. Many factors may cause actual results to differ materially from anticipated results including product developments, sales efforts, income tax matters, the outcomes of contingencies such as legal proceedings, and other economic, business, competitive and regulatory factors. The company undertakes no obligation to update its forward-looking statements. Please refer to the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information in our March 31, 2012 Form 10-Q for more detailed information about these and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This press release contains financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP measures in the above tables.
This press release includes net sales excluding the impact of foreign exchange. The company analyzes net sales on a constant currency basis to better measure the comparability of results between periods. Because changes in foreign currency exchange rates have a non-operating impact on net sales, the company believes that evaluating growth in net sales on a constant currency basis provides an additional and meaningful assessment of net sales to both management and the company's investors.
In addition, this press release includes the following non-GAAP measures: (1) cost of goods sold excluding charges for acquisition related items; (2) marketing, selling and administrative expense excluding charges for acquisition related items; (3) research and development expense excluding charges for acquisition related items; (4) other (income) expense, net, excluding charges for acquisition related items, asset impairments and reversals of restructuring costs; (5) income tax provision excluding an increase due to the write-down of a tax receivable in a foreign jurisdiction, and the tax effect of the items set forth in (1) through (4) above; (6) net income (loss) excluding the items set forth in (1) through (5) above; and (7) diluted earnings (loss) per share available to common shareholders excluding the items set forth in (1) through (5) above.
The company excluded the items described above because they may cause certain statements of operations categories not to be indicative of ongoing operating results, and therefore affect the comparability of results between periods. The company therefore believes that these non-GAAP measures provide an additional and meaningful assessment of the company's ongoing operating performance. Because the company has historically reported these non-GAAP results to the investment community, management also believes that the inclusion of these non-GAAP measures provides consistency in its financial reporting and facilitates investors' understanding of the company's historic operating trends by providing an additional basis for comparisons to prior periods. Management uses these non-GAAP measures: (1) to establish financial and operational goals; (2) to monitor the company's actual performance in relation to its business plan and operating budgets; (3) to evaluate the company's core operating performance and understand key trends within the business; and (4) as part of several components it considers in determining incentive compensation.
Management recognizes that the use of these non-GAAP measures has limitations, including the fact that they may not be comparable with similar non-GAAP measures used by other companies and that management must exercise judgment in determining which types of charges or other items should be excluded from the non-GAAP information. Management compensates for these limitations by providing full disclosure of each non-GAAP measure and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. All non-GAAP measures are intended to supplement the applicable GAAP disclosures and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a replacement for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures, please see the above tables.

The company analyzes net sales on a constant currency basis to better measure the comparability of results between periods. Because changes in foreign currency exchange rates have a non-operating impact on net sales, the company believes that evaluating growth in net sales on a constant currency basis provides an additional and meaningful assessment of net sales to both management and the company's investors.
In addition, this press release includes the following non-GAAP measures: (1) cost of goods sold excluding charges for acquisition related items; (2) marketing, selling and administrative expense excluding charges for acquisition related items; (3) research and development expense excluding charges for acquisition related items; (4) other (income) expense, net, excluding charges for acquisition related items, asset impairments, legal settlements and commitments, and restructuring; (5) income tax provision excluding an increase due to the write-down of a tax receivable in a foreign jurisdiction, a decrease due to an audit settlement, and the tax effect of the items set forth in (1) through (4) above; (6) net income excluding the items set forth in (1) through (5) above; and (7) diluted earnings per share available to common shareholders excluding the items set forth in (1) through (5) above.
The company excluded the items described above because they may cause certain statements of operations categories not to be indicative of ongoing operating results, and therefore affect the comparability of results between periods. The company therefore believes that these non-GAAP measures provide an additional and meaningful assessment of the company's ongoing operating performance. Because the company has historically reported these non-GAAP results to the investment community, management also believes that the inclusion of these non-GAAP measures provides consistency in its financial reporting and facilitates investors' understanding of the company's historic operating trends by providing an additional basis for comparisons to prior periods. Management uses these non-GAAP measures: (1) to establish financial and operational goals; (2) to monitor the company's actual performance in relation to its business plan and operating budgets; (3) to evaluate the company's core operating performance and understand key trends within the business; and (4) as part of several components it considers in determining incentive compensation.
Management recognizes that the use of these non-GAAP measures has limitations, including the fact that they may not be comparable with similar non-GAAP measures used by other companies and that management must exercise judgment in determining which types of charges or other items should be excluded from the non-GAAP information. Management compensates for these limitations by providing full disclosure of each non-GAAP measure and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. All non-GAAP measures are intended to supplement the applicable GAAP disclosures and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a replacement for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures, please see the above tables.

In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party and such indemnified party seeks or intends to seek indemnity from an indemnifying party,
Notifications and Other Indemnification Procedures.
 
the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate in, and, to the extent that it shall elect, jointly with all other indemnifying parties similarly notified, by written notice delivered to the indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party; provided, however, such indemnified party shall have the right to employ its own counsel in any such action and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party, unless: (i) the employment of such counsel has been specifically authorized in writing by the indemnifying party; (ii) the indemnifying party has failed promptly to assume the defense and employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party; or (iii) the named parties to any such action (including any impleaded parties) include both such indemnified party and the indemnifying party or any affiliate of the indemnifying party, and counsel to such indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that either (x) there may be one or more legal defenses available to it which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party or such affiliate of the indemnifying party or (y) a conflict may exist between such indemnified party and the indemnifying party or such affiliate of the indemnifying party (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any one such action or separate but substantially similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to a single firm of local counsel) for all such indemnified parties, which firm shall be designated in writing by the Representatives and that all such reasonable fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred). Upon receipt of notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of such indemnifying party's election so to assume the defense of such action and approval by the indemnified party of counsel, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under Section 8(a) or (b) for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof unless the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in accordance with the proviso to the next preceding sentence, in which case the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel shall be at the expense of the indemnifying party.
(d) The indemnifying party under this Section 8 shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by Section 8(c) hereof, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 60 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement.

Settlements.
 
S 9. . If the indemnification provided for in Section 8 is for any reason held to be unavailable to or otherwise insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount paid or payable by such indemnified party, as incurred, as a result of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, from the offering of the Notes pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Notes pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Notes pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company, and the total underwriting discount received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the front cover page of the Prospectus bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of the Notes as set forth on such cover. The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company, on the one hand, or the Underwriters, on the other hand, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.

Contribution
The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 8(c), any reasonable legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim.
The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 9 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 9.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 9, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the underwriting commissions received by such Underwriter in connection with the Notes underwritten by it and distributed to the public. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 9 are several, and not joint, in proportion to their respective underwriting commitments as set forth opposite their names in
 
Schedule A. For purposes of this Section 9, each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company with the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company.

If, on the Closing Date, any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase such Notes and the aggregate principal amount of such Notes with respect to which such default occurs exceeds 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be purchased on such date, and arrangements satisfactory to the Representatives and the Company for the purchase of such Notes are not made within 48 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability of any party to any other party except that the provisions of Sections 4, 6, 8, 9 and 17 shall at all times be effective and shall survive such termination. In any such case, either the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days in order that the required changes, if any, to the Registration Statement, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus or any other documents or arrangements may be effected.

As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" shall be deemed to include any person substituted for a defaulting Underwriter under this Section 10.

(a) at the time of deposit of such funds or U.S. Government Obligations in trust, the funds or U.S. Government Obligations in trust must be sufficient, as evidenced by a certificate of a reputable firm of certified independent accountants, investment bank or appraisal firm, to pay and discharge the principal, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes on the Redemption Date with an assumed Redemption Price calculated as of the date of deposit of such funds or U.S. Government Obligations in trust; and
(b) the Company must irrevocably deposit or cause to be deposited additional funds or U.S. Government Obligations in trust, as necessary, on the Redemption Date, as required by Section 3.1 hereof, necessary to pay the Redemption Price as determined on such date.

This press release contains financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP measures in the above tables.
This press release includes net sales excluding the impact of foreign exchange. The company analyzes net sales on a constant currency basis to better measure the comparability of results between periods. Because changes in foreign currency exchange rates have a non-operating impact on net sales, the company believes that evaluating growth in net sales on a constant currency basis provides an additional and meaningful assessment of net sales to both management and the company's investors.
In addition, this press release includes the following non-GAAP measures: (1) cost of goods sold excluding charges for acquisition related items; (2) marketing, selling and administrative expense excluding charges for acquisition related items; (3) research and development expense excluding charges for acquisition related items; (4) other (income) expense, net, excluding charges for acquisition related items, asset impairments, legal settlements and commitments, restructuring and impairment of bonds; (5) income tax provision excluding an increase due to the write-down of a tax receivable in a foreign jurisdiction, a decrease due to audit settlements, and the tax effect of the items set forth in (1) through (4) above; (6) net income excluding the items set forth in (1) through (5) above; and (7) diluted earnings per share available to common shareholders excluding the items set forth in (1) through (5) above.
The company excluded the items described above because they may cause certain statements of operations categories not to be indicative of ongoing operating results, and therefore affect the comparability of results between periods. The company therefore believes that these non-GAAP measures provide an additional and meaningful assessment of the company's ongoing operating performance. Because the company has historically reported these non-GAAP results to the investment community, management also believes that the inclusion of these non-GAAP measures provides consistency in its financial reporting and facilitates investors' understanding of the company's historic operating trends by providing an additional basis for comparisons to prior periods. Management uses these non-GAAP measures: (1) to establish financial and operational goals; (2) to monitor the company's actual performance in relation to its business plan and operating budgets; (3) to evaluate the company's core operating performance and understand key trends within the business; and (4) as part of several components it considers in determining incentive compensation.
Management recognizes that the use of these non-GAAP measures has limitations, including the fact that they may not be comparable with similar non-GAAP measures used by other companies and that management must exercise judgment in determining which types of charges or other items should be excluded from the non-GAAP information. Management compensates for these limitations by providing full disclosure of each non-GAAP measure and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. All non-GAAP measures are intended to supplement the applicable GAAP disclosures and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a replacement for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures, please see the above tables.

C. R. Bard, Inc. (the "Company") today announced in connection with Bard's patent infringement suit against W.L. Gore & Associates, Inc. ("Gore") that the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona (the "District Court") scheduled oral argument for May 22, 2013 as to the three pending motions before the District Court. At this time, the Company's financial guidance for 2013 remains unchanged. As the Company has previously disclosed, the timing of final resolution of these motions could impact the amount of royalty revenue recognized in 2013.

C. R. Bard, Inc. ("Bard") today announced that, in connection with the reexamination of Bard's patent number 6,436,135 (the "'135 patent"), the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued an Office Action initially rejecting the reexamined claims of the '135 patent. It is common during the early stages of the reexamination process for claims to be initially rejected. During the reexamination process and until final determination, the patent and all claims, including the initially rejected claims, remain valid and enforceable. The company does not believe that this will materially impact the litigation proceedings. The '135 patent is the subject of Bard's patent infringement suit against W. L. Gore & Associates, Inc. ("Gore"), and Gore has been found liable for infringing the '135 patent.

Exhibit 10.34
Effective as of April 17, 2013, the 2012 Long Term Incentive Plan of C. R. Bard, Inc. is hereby amended and restated by C. R. Bard, Inc., a New Jersey corporation (the "Corporation"), as set forth herein (the "Plan"). The Plan was originally effective as of April 16, 2003.
SECTION 1.  Purpose of the Plan
The 2012 Long Term Incentive Plan of C. R. Bard, Inc. is designed to attract and retain the services of selected employees of the Corporation and its Subsidiaries and to motivate such employees to exert their best efforts on behalf of the Corporation and its Subsidiaries by providing incentives through the granting of Awards. The Corporation expects that it will benefit from the added interest that such employees will have in the welfare of the Corporation as a result of their proprietary interest in the Corporation's success. The Plan may be used to grant equity-based awards under various compensation programs of the Corporation, as determined in the discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation and in accordance with the terms hereof. The Committee shall have the full authority to establish the terms and conditions of any Award granted under the Plan, subject to the terms and limitations contained herein.

provided
(b) If and to the extent Options or Stock Appreciation Rights originating from the Total Share Pool terminate, expire or are canceled, forfeited, exchanged, or surrendered without having been exercised or if any Other Stock-Based Awards are forfeited, the Shares subject to such Awards shall again be available for Awards under the Total Share Pool, and shall increase the Total Share Pool by one (1) Share for each Option or Stock Appreciation Right and 2.87 for each Other Stock-Based Award issued in connection with such Award or by which the Award is valued by reference.

 Exercise.
SECTION 4.  Administration
The Plan shall be administered by the Committee, which may delegate its duties and powers in whole or in part to any subcommittee thereof; it is expected that such subcommittee shall consist solely of at least two individuals who are intended to qualify as "Non-Employee Directors" within the meaning of Rule 16b-3 under the
Act (or any successor rule thereto) and "outside directors" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code (or any successor section thereto); , that the failure of the subcommittee to be so constituted shall not impair the validity of any Award made by such subcommittee. Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Committee shall have exclusive power to select the Participants and to determine the amount of, or method of determining, the Awards to be made to Participants. All Awards granted to Participants under the Plan shall be evidenced by an Award agreement which specifies the type of Award granted pursuant to the Plan, the number of Shares underlying the Award and all terms governing the Award, including, without limitation, terms regarding vesting, exercisability and expiration of the Award. Awards may, in the discretion of the Committee, and to the extent permitted by Section 6(a), be made under the Plan to Participants in assumption of, or in substitution for, outstanding awards previously granted by the Corporation or its affiliates or an entity acquired by the Corporation or with which the Corporation combines. The number of Shares underlying such substitute awards shall be counted against the aggregate number of Shares available for Awards under the Plan. The Shares underlying such previously outstanding awards, if such awards were Awards under this Plan, shall be added back to the aggregate number of Shares available under the Plan. The Committee is authorized to interpret the Plan, to establish, amend or rescind any rules and regulations relating to the Plan and to make any other determinations that it deems necessary or desirable for the administration of the Plan. The Committee may correct any defect or supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency in the Plan in the manner and to the extent the Committee deems necessary or desirable. Any decision of the Committee in the interpretation and administration of the Plan, as described herein, shall lie within its sole and absolute discretion and shall be final, conclusive and binding on all parties concerned (including, but not limited to, Participants and their beneficiaries or successors). The Committee shall have the full power and authority, consistent with the provisions of the Plan, to establish the terms and conditions of any Award and to waive any such terms or conditions at any time (including, without limitation, accelerating or waiving any vesting conditions). The Committee shall require payment of any amount it may determine to be necessary to withhold for federal, state, local or other taxes as a result of the exercise, grant or vesting of an Award as a condition to such exercise, grant or vesting. Unless the Committee specifies otherwise, the Participant may elect to pay a portion or all of such withholding taxes by (a) delivery in Shares or (b) having Shares withheld by the Corporation from any Shares that would have otherwise been received by the Participant.
provided, however
SECTION 5.  Limitations
No Award may be granted under the Plan after the tenth anniversary of the Effective Date, but Awards theretofore granted may extend beyond that date.
SECTION 6.  Terms and Conditions of Options
Options granted under the Plan shall be, as determined by the Committee, non-qualified or incentive stock options for federal income tax purposes, as evidenced by the related Award agreements between the Corporation and the Option recipient, and shall be subject to the foregoing and the following terms and conditions and to such other terms and conditions, not inconsistent therewith, as the Committee shall determine:
(a) . The Option Price per Share shall be determined by the Committee, but shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of the Shares on the date an Option is granted. Notwithstanding any provision in this Plan to the contrary other than the last sentence of this Section 6(a), (i) no Option may be amended to reduce the per Share Option Price of the Shares subject to such Option below the Option Price determined as of the date the Option is granted; (ii) no Option may be granted in exchange or substitution for, or in connection with, the cancellation or surrender of an Option or other Award having a higher Option Price or exercise price; and (iii) no Option may be cancelled or surrendered in exchange for cash or any other Award. The restrictions set forth in this Section 6 shall not apply to the assumption of, substitution for, or adjustment of outstanding Options that are assumed, substituted, or adjusted in connection with a transaction described in Section 9, provided that the aggregate Option Price times the number of shares underlying the Option immediately before the transaction equals or exceeds the aggregate Option Price times the number of Shares underlying the Option (or substituted Option) immediately following the transaction.
Option Price
(b) . Options granted under the Plan shall be vested and exercisable at such times and upon such terms and conditions as may be determined by the Committee, but in no event shall an Option be exercisable more than ten years after the date it is granted.
Exercisability
(c) . Except as otherwise provided in the Plan or in an Award agreement, an Option may be exercised for all, or from time to time any part, of the Shares for which it is then vested and
Exercise of Options
exercisable. For purposes of Section 6 of the Plan, the exercise date of an Option shall be the later of the date a notice of exercise is received by the Corporation and, if applicable, the date payment is received by the Corporation pursuant to clauses (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) in the following sentence. The purchase price for the Shares as to which an Option is exercised shall be paid to the Corporation in full at the time of exercise at the election of the Participant (i) in cash or its equivalent (e.g., by check), (ii) to the extent permitted by the Committee, in Shares having a Fair Market Value equal to the aggregate Option Price for the Shares being purchased and satisfying such other requirements as may be imposed by the Committee; , that such Shares have been held by the Participant for no less than six months (or such other period as established from time to time by the Committee in order to avoid adverse accounting treatment applying generally accepted accounting principles), (iii) partly in cash and, to the extent permitted by the Committee, partly in such Shares or (iv) if there is a public market for the Shares at such time, subject to rules and limitations established by the Committee, through the delivery of irrevocable instructions to a broker to sell Shares obtained upon the exercise of the Option and to deliver promptly to the Corporation an amount out of the proceeds of such sale equal to the aggregate Option Price for the Shares being purchased. No Participant shall have any rights to dividends or other rights of a stockholder with respect to Shares subject to an Option until the Participant has given written notice of exercise of the Option, paid in full for such Shares, received such Shares from the Corporation and, if applicable, has satisfied any other conditions imposed by the Committee pursuant to the Plan.
provided
(d) . The Committee may grant Options under the Plan that are intended to be ISOs. Such ISOs shall comply with the requirements of Section 422 of the Code (or any successor section thereto). Except as otherwise permitted in Section 422 of the Code (or any successor section thereto), no ISO may be granted to any Participant who, at the time of such grant, owns more than ten percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Corporation or of any Subsidiary, unless (i) the Option Price for such ISO is at least 110% of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date the ISO is granted and (ii) the date on which such ISO terminates is a date not later than the day preceding the fifth anniversary of the date on which the ISO is granted. Any Participant who disposes of Shares acquired upon the exercise of an ISO either (i) within two years after the date of grant of such ISO or (ii) within one year after the transfer of such Shares to the Participant shall promptly notify the Corporation of such disposition and of the amount realized upon such disposition. All Options granted under the Plan are intended to be nonqualified stock options, unless the applicable Award agreement expressly states that the Option is intended to be an ISO. If an Option is intended to be an ISO, and if for any reason such Option (or portion thereof) shall not qualify as an ISO, then, to the extent of such failure to qualify, such Option (or portion thereof) shall be regarded as a nonqualified stock option granted under the Plan; , that such Option (or portion thereof) otherwise complies with the Plan's requirements relating to nonqualified stock options. In no event shall any member of the Committee, the Corporation or any of its Affiliates (or their respective employees, officers or directors) have any liability to any Participant (or any other Person) due to the failure of an Option to qualify for any reason as an ISO.
Incentive Stock Options
provided
(e) . Wherever in this Plan or any agreement evidencing an Award a Participant is permitted to pay the exercise price of an Option or taxes relating to the exercise of an Option by delivering Shares, the Participant may, subject to procedures satisfactory to the Committee, satisfy such delivery requirement by presenting proof that he or she is the beneficial owner (as such term is defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Act (or any successor rule thereto)) of such Shares, in which case the Corporation shall treat the Option as exercised without further payment and shall withhold such number of Shares from the Shares acquired by the exercise of the Option.
Attestation
SECTION 7.  Terms and Conditions of Stock Appreciation Rights
(a) . The Committee also may grant (i) a Stock Appreciation Right independent of an Option or (ii) a Stock Appreciation Right in connection with an Option, or a portion thereof. A Stock Appreciation Right granted pursuant to clause (ii) of the preceding sentence (A) may be granted at the time the related Option is granted or at any time prior to the exercise or cancellation of the related Option, (B) shall cover the same number of Shares covered by an Option (or such lesser number of Shares as the Committee may determine) and (C) shall be subject to the same terms and conditions as such Option except for such additional limitations as are contemplated by this Section 7 (or such additional limitations as may be included in an Award agreement).
Grants
(b) . The exercise price per Share of a Stock Appreciation Right shall be an amount determined by the Committee but in no event shall such amount be less than the greater of (i) the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date the Stock Appreciation Right is granted or, in the case of a Stock Appreciation Right granted in conjunction with an Option, or a portion thereof, the Option Price of the related Option and (ii) the minimum amount permitted by applicable laws, rules, by-laws or policies of regulatory authorities or stock exchanges. Notwithstanding any provision in this Plan to the contrary other than the next sentence of this Section 7(b), (i) no Stock Appreciation Right may be amended to reduce the exercise price per Share of the Shares subject to such Stock Appreciation Right below the exercise price determined as of the date the Stock Appreciation Right is granted; (ii) no Stock Appreciation Right may be granted in exchange or substitution for, or in connection with, the cancellation or surrender of a Stock Appreciation Right or other Award having a higher exercise price; and (iii) no Stock Appreciation Right may be cancelled or surrendered in exchange for cash or any other Award. The restrictions set forth in this Section 7(b) shall not apply to the assumption of, substitution for, or adjustment of outstanding Stock Appreciation Rights that are assumed, substituted, or adjusted in connection with a transaction described in Section 9, provided that the aggregate exercise price times the number of shares underlying the Stock Appreciation Right immediately before the transaction equals or exceeds the aggregate exercise price times the number of Shares underlying the Stock Appreciation Right (or substituted Stock Appreciation Right) immediately following the transaction. Each Stock Appreciation Right granted independent of an Option shall entitle a Participant upon exercise to an amount equal to (i) the excess of (A) the Fair Market Value on the exercise date of one Share over (B) the exercise price per Share, times (ii) the number of Shares covered by the Stock Appreciation Right and as to which the Stock Appreciation Right is exercised. Each Stock Appreciation Right granted in conjunction with an Option, or a portion thereof, shall entitle a Participant to surrender to the Corporation the unexercised Option, or any portion thereof, and to receive from the Corporation in exchange therefor an amount equal to (i) the excess of (A) the Fair Market Value on the exercise date of one Share over (B) the Option Price per Share, times (ii) the number of Shares covered by the Option, or portion thereof, which is surrendered. The date a notice of exercise is received by the Corporation shall be the exercise date. Payment shall be made in Shares or in cash, or partly in Shares and partly in cash (any such Shares valued at such Fair Market Value), all as shall be determined by the Committee. Stock Appreciation Rights may be exercised from time to time in whole or in part upon actual receipt by the Corporation of written notice of exercise stating the number of Shares with respect to which the Stock Appreciation Right is being exercised. No fractional Shares will be issued in payment for Stock Appreciation Rights, but instead cash will be paid for a fraction or, if the Committee should so determine, the number of Shares will be rounded downward to the next whole Share. In no event shall a Stock Appreciation Right be exercisable more than ten years after the date it is granted.
Terms
(c) . Subject to Section 12, the Committee may impose, in its discretion, such conditions upon the exercisability or transferability of Stock Appreciation Rights as it may deem fit.
Limitations
(d) . The Committee may grant LSARs that are exercisable upon the occurrence of specified contingent events (including, without limitation, a Change of Control). Such LSARs may provide for a different method of determining appreciation, may specify that payment will be made only in cash and may provide that any related Awards are not exercisable while such LSARs are exercisable. Pursuant to Section 4, the Committee is authorized to amend the terms of an LSAR held by any employee subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, as may be necessary so that the holding and exercise of such LSAR will be exempt under such Section 16. Unless the context otherwise requires, whenever the term "Stock Appreciation Right" is used in the Plan, such term shall include LSARs.
Limited Stock Appreciation Rights
SECTION 8.  Other Stock-Based Awards
(a) . The Committee, in its sole discretion, may grant or sell Awards of Shares, Awards of restricted Shares and Awards that are valued in whole or in part by reference to, or are otherwise based on the Fair Market Value of, Shares ("Other Stock-Based Awards"). Such Other Stock-Based Awards shall be in such form, and dependent on such conditions, as the Committee shall determine, including, without limitation, the right to receive, or vest with respect to, one or more Shares (or the equivalent cash value of such Shares) upon the completion of a specified period of service, the occurrence of an event and/or the attainment of performance objectives; , , that the Committee may grant Awards of unrestricted Shares only if the Committee has determined that such Award is made in lieu of salary or cash bonus. Other Stock-Based Awards may be granted alone or in addition to any other Awards granted under the Plan. Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Committee shall determine to whom and when Other Stock-Based Awards will be
Generally
provided
however
made, the number of Shares to be awarded under (or otherwise related to) such Other Stock-Based Awards; whether such Other Stock-Based Awards shall be settled in cash, Shares or a combination of cash and Shares; and all other terms and conditions of such Awards (including, without limitation, the vesting provisions thereof and provisions ensuring that all Shares so awarded and issued shall be fully paid and non-assessable); , , that the restricted period specified in respect of any Award of restricted Shares shall not be less than three years, except that the Committee may (i) provide for the restricted period to terminate at any time after one year upon the attainment of performance-based objectives and (ii) the Committee may grant Awards of up to 500,000 restricted Shares without regard to this limitation; and that dividends or dividend equivalents with respect to any Other Stock-Based Award that vests based on the achievement of performance-based objectives shall be accumulated until such Award is earned, and such dividends or dividend equivalents shall not be paid if such performance-based objectives are not satisfied.
provided
however
provided further
(b) . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, certain Other Stock-Based Awards granted under this Section 8 may be granted in a manner which is deductible by the Corporation under Section 162(m) of the Code (or any successor section thereto) ("Performance-Based Awards"). A Participant's Performance-Based Awards shall be determined based on the attainment of written performance goals approved by the Committee for a performance period established by the Committee (i) while the outcome for that performance period is substantially uncertain and (ii) no more than 90 days after the commencement of the performance period to which the performance goal relates or, if less, the number of days which is equal to 25 percent of the relevant performance period, or as otherwise permitted pursuant to Section 162(m) of the Code (or any successor section thereto). The performance goals, which must be objective, shall be based upon one or more of the following criteria: (i) consolidated earnings before or after taxes (including earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization); (ii) net income; (iii) operating income; (iv) earnings per Share; (v) return on shareholders' equity; (vi) attainment of strategic and operational initiatives; (vii) customer income; (viii) economic value-added models; (ix) maintenance or improvement of profit margins; (x) stock price (including total shareholder return), including, without limitation, as compared to one or more stock indices; (xi) market share; (xii) revenues, sales or net sales; (xiii) return on assets; (xiv) book value per Share; (xv) expense management; (xvi) improvements in capital structure; (xvii) costs and (xviii) cash flow. The foregoing criteria may relate to the Corporation, one or more of its Subsidiaries or one or more of its divisions or units, or any combination of the foregoing, and may be applied on an absolute basis and/or be relative to one or more peer group companies or indices, or any combination thereof, all as the Committee shall determine. In addition, to the degree consistent with the Code, the performance goals may be calculated without regard to extraordinary, unusual and/or non-recurring items. The Committee shall determine whether, with respect to a performance period, the applicable performance goals have been met with respect to a given Participant and, if they have, so certify and ascertain the amount of the applicable Performance-Based Award. No Performance-Based Awards will be paid for such performance period until such certification is made by the Committee. The amount of the Performance-Based Award actually paid to a given Participant may be less than the amount determined by the applicable performance goal formula, at the discretion of the Committee. The amount of the Performance-Based Award determined by the Committee for a performance period shall be paid to the Participant at such time as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion after the end of such performance period; , , that a Participant may, if and to the extent permitted by the Committee and consistent with the provisions of Section 162(m) of the Code, elect to defer payment of a Performance Based Award. To the extent Section 162(m) of the Code (or any successor section thereto) provides terms different from the requirements of this Section 8(b), this Section 8(b) shall be deemed amended thereby.

SECTION 9.  Adjustments Upon Certain Events
Notwithstanding any other provisions in the Plan to the contrary:
(a) . In the event after the Effective Date there is any Share dividend or split, reorganization, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, spin-off, combination, combination or transaction or exchange of Shares or other corporate exchange, or any distribution to shareholders of Shares or other property or securities (other than regular cash dividends) or any transaction similar to the foregoing or other transaction that results in a change to the Corporation's equity capitalization, the Committee shall make such substitution or adjustment, if any, as is equitable or appropriate, as to (i) the number or kind of Shares or other securities issued or reserved for issuance pursuant to the Plan or pursuant to outstanding Awards, (ii) the maximum number of Shares for which Options and Stock Appreciation Rights and Other Stock-Based Awards under
Generally
Section 8(b) may be granted during a calendar year to any Participant, (iii) the maximum number of Shares which may be granted as Awards of restricted Shares, unrestricted Shares and restricted Share units, (iv) the Option Price, exercise price of any Stock Appreciation Right or purchase price of any Award and/or (v) any other affected terms of an Award or the Plan.
(b) . In the event of a Change of Control after the Effective Date, except to the extent the Committee has determined otherwise with respect to any Award at or prior to the time of grant, (i) any outstanding Awards then held by Participants which are unexercisable or otherwise unvested or subject to lapse restrictions shall automatically be deemed exercisable or otherwise vested or no longer subject to lapse restrictions, as the case may be, as of immediately prior to the effectiveness of such Change of Control and (ii) the Committee may, but shall not be obligated to, (A) cancel such Awards for fair value (as determined in the sole discretion of the Committee) which, in the case of Options and Stock Appreciation Rights, may equal the excess, if any, of value of the consideration to be paid in the Change of Control transaction to holders of the same number of Shares subject to such Options or Stock Appreciation Rights (or, if no consideration is paid in any such transaction, the Fair Market Value of the Shares subject to such Options or Stock Appreciation Rights) over the aggregate exercise price of such Options or Stock Appreciation Rights or (B) provide for the issuance of substitute Awards that will substantially preserve the otherwise applicable terms of any affected Awards previously granted hereunder as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion.
Change of Control
SECTION 10.  No Right to Employment or Awards; Excluded Compensation Under Other Plans
The granting of an Award under the Plan shall impose no obligation on the Corporation or any Subsidiary to continue the employment of a Participant and shall not lessen or affect the Corporation's or Subsidiary's right to terminate the employment of such Participant. No Participant or other Person shall have any claim to be granted any Award, and there is no obligation for uniformity of treatment of Participants or holders or beneficiaries of Awards. The terms and conditions of Awards and the Committee's determinations and interpretations with respect thereto need not be the same with respect to each Participant (whether or not such Participants are similarly situated). No award under the Plan shall be taken into account in determining a Participant's compensation for purposes of any group life insurance or other employee benefit or pension plan of the Corporation.
SECTION 11.  Successors and Assigns
The Plan shall be binding on all successors and assigns of the Corporation and a Participant, including, without limitation, the estate of such Participant and the executor, administrator or trustee of such estate, or any receiver or trustee in bankruptcy or representative of the Participant's creditors.
SECTION 12.  Transferability of Awards
An Award shall not be transferable or assignable by the Participant for consideration. An Award may be transferred by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. An Award exercisable after the death of a Participant may be exercised by the legatees, personal representatives or distributees of the Participant. Upon the Disability of a Participant, an Award may be exercisable by his or her conservator or representative. At the Committee's discretion, an Award agreement may provide that a Participant may transfer certain Awards to family members, or one or more trusts or other entities for the benefit of or owned by family members, consistent with applicable securities laws, provided that the Participant receives no consideration for the transfer of the Award and the transferred Award shall continue to be subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable to the Award immediately before the transfer.
SECTION 13.  Share Issuance and Delivery in Compliance With Securities Laws
If in the opinion of counsel for the Corporation (who may be an employee of the Corporation or independent counsel employed by the Corporation), any issuance or delivery of Shares to a Participant will violate the requirements of any applicable federal or state laws, rules or regulations (including, without limitation, the provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Act), such issuance or delivery may be postponed until the Corporation is satisfied that the distribution will not violate such laws, rules or regulations. Certificates delivered to Participants pursuant to the Plan may bear such legends as the Corporation may deem advisable.
SECTION 14.  Amendments or Termination
The Board may amend the Plan at any time, provided that no amendment shall be made without the approval of the Shareholders of the Corporation that would (a) increase the maximum number of Shares which may be acquired under the Plan, (b) extend the term during which Options may be granted under the Plan, (c) permit the Option Price or exercise price per Share to be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of the Shares on the date an Option or Stock Appreciation Right is granted (other than as specifically provided in Sections 6(a) and 7(b)), (d) terminate restrictions applicable to Awards (except for Permitted Exceptions) or (e) provide for Awards not permitted pursuant to the terms of the Plan. The Board shall also have the right to terminate the Plan at any time. Without the consent of a Participant (except as otherwise provided in Section 9(a)), no amendment shall materially diminish any of the rights of such Participant under any Award theretofore granted to such Participant under the Plan; , that the Committee may amend the Plan in such manner as it deems necessary to permit the granting of Awards meeting the requirements of the Code or other applicable laws.
provided, however
SECTION 15.  International Participants
With respect to Participants who reside or work outside the United States of America and who are not (and who are not expected to be) "covered employees" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, amend the terms of the Plan or Awards with respect to such Participants in order to conform such terms with the provisions of local law and practice or otherwise as deemed necessary or desirable by the Committee.
SECTION 16.  Choice of Law
The Plan shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New Jersey without regard to conflicts of laws.
SECTION 17.  Effectiveness of the Plan
The Plan shall be effective as of the Effective Date.

Exhibit 99.1
The 2012 Long Term Incentive Plan of C. R. Bard, Inc., as amended and restated (the "Plan") is administered by the Compensation Committee or any subcommittee thereof, which is expected to consist of at least two individuals who are intended to qualify as "non-employee directors" within the meaning of Rule 16b-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and "outside directors" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. All awards granted to employees under the Plan are evidenced by an award agreement which specifies the type of award granted pursuant to the Plan, the number of shares of common stock underlying the award and all terms governing the award, including, without limitation, terms regarding vesting, exercisability and expiration of the award.
Administration.
Participants in the Plan are selected by the Compensation Committee from employees of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Compensation Committee may select participants and make awards at any time under the Plan. As of December 31, 2012, 12 executive officers and approximately 984 other officers and employees were eligible for participation in the Plan.
Eligibility.
Awards under the Plan may be in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, limited stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, unrestricted stock and other stock-based awards. Subject to adjustment as provided in the Plan, the total number of shares that may be issued under the Plan is 24,225,000. The maximum number of shares with respect to which options, stock appreciation rights and other stock-based awards may be granted during each calendar year to any individual may not exceed 900,000 shares of our common stock, subject to adjustment. The Plan provides that each option or stock appreciation right granted under the Plan shall reduce the number of total shares available under the Plan by one share, whereas an award of restricted stock, unrestricted stock, restricted stock units or other stock-based awards shall reduce the number of total shares available under the Plan by 2.87 shares, provided that awards that are valued by reference to shares but are required to be paid in cash pursuant to their terms shall not reduce the number of total shares available under the Plan. If any award shall for any reason expire, otherwise terminate, or be forfeited, in whole or in part, without having been exercised in full, the stock not acquired shall revert to and again become available for issuance under the Plan. In general, the reverted shares shall increase the number of total shares available under the Plan by one share for each reverted option or stock appreciation right, and 2.87 shares for each reverted award of restricted stock, unrestricted stock, restricted stock unit or other stock-based award.
Determination and Maximum Number of Awards.
The Compensation Committee has exclusive power and authority, consistent with the provisions of the Plan, to establish the terms and conditions of any award and to waive any such terms or conditions. Because the benefits conveyed under the Plan would be at the discretion of the Compensation Committee, we cannot determine what benefits participants will receive under the Plan.
The Compensation Committee may award to selected employees nonqualified or incentive stock options. Options granted under the Plan will be exercisable at such times and upon such terms and conditions as may be determined by the Compensation Committee, but in no event will an option be exercisable more than ten years after the date it is granted. The exercise price per share of common stock for any option awarded will not be less than 100% of the fair market value of a share of common stock on the day the option is granted. The exercise price of any stock option granted pursuant to the Plan may not be subsequently reduced by amendment or cancellation and substitution of that option or any other action of the Compensation Committee without shareholder approval, subject to the Compensation Committee's authority to adjust or substitute awards upon the occurrence of certain events to preserve the economic value of the award (described in "Adjustments Upon Certain Events" below).
Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights.
A participant may exercise an option by paying the exercise price in cash or its equivalent and/or, to the extent permitted by the Compensation Committee, common stock, a combination of cash and common stock or through the delivery of irrevocable instruments to a broker to sell the shares obtained upon the exercise of the option and to deliver to us an amount equal to the exercise price.
The Compensation Committee may grant stock appreciation rights independent of or in conjunction with an option. The exercise price of a stock appreciation right will be an amount determined by the Compensation Committee, but in no event will that amount be less than the greater of (i) the fair market value of the common stock on the date the stock appreciation right is granted or, in the case of a stock appreciation right granted in conjunction with an option, the exercise price of the related option, and (ii) the minimum amount permitted under applicable
laws, rules, by-laws or policies of applicable regulatory authorities or stock exchanges. The exercise price of any stock appreciation right granted pursuant to the Plan may not be subsequently reduced by amendment or cancellation and substitution of that stock appreciation right or any other action of the Compensation Committee without shareholder approval, subject to the Compensation Committee's authority to adjust or substitute awards upon the occurrence of certain events to preserve the economic value of the award (described in "Adjustments Upon Certain Events" below). Each stock appreciation right granted independently from an option will entitle an employee upon exercise to an amount equal to (i) the excess of (A) the fair market value on the exercise date of one share of common stock over (B) the exercise price, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of common stock covered by the stock appreciation right and as to which the stock appreciation right is exercised. Each stock appreciation right granted in conjunction with an option will entitle an employee to surrender the option and to receive an amount equal to (i) the excess of (A) the fair market value on the exercise date of one share of common stock over (B) the option price per share of common stock, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of common stock covered by the option that is surrendered. Payment will be made in common stock or in cash or partly in common stock and partly in cash, as determined by the Compensation Committee at the time of grant. In no event may a participant exercise a stock appreciation right more than ten years after the date it is granted.
The Compensation Committee may, in its discretion, grant limited stock appreciation rights that are exercisable upon the occurrence of specified contingent events, including, without limitation, a change of control of the Company.
The Compensation Committee, in its sole discretion, may grant restricted stock, restricted stock units, unrestricted stock and other awards that are valued in whole or in part by reference to, or are otherwise based on the fair market value of, our common stock. These other stock-based awards will be in such form, and dependent on such conditions, as the Compensation Committee determines, including, without limitation, the right to receive, or vest with respect to, one or more shares of common stock (or the equivalent cash value of those shares of common stock) upon the completion of a specified period of service, the occurrence of an event and/or the attainment of performance objectives. However, the Compensation Committee may grant awards of unrestricted shares only if the Compensation Committee has determined that those awards are made in lieu of salary or a cash bonus. The restricted period specified in respect of any award of restricted stock will not be less than three years, except that the Compensation Committee may (i) provide for a restricted period to terminate at any time after one year upon the attainment of established performance-based objectives, and (ii) grant up to 500,000 shares of restricted stock without regard to this limitation.
Other Stock-Based Awards.
Certain stock-based awards granted under the Plan may be granted in a manner that should be deductible by us under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. These awards, referred to as performance-based awards, will be determined based on the attainment of written performance goals approved by the Compensation Committee. The performance-based awards will be based upon one or more of the following objective criteria: (i) consolidated earnings before or after taxes (including earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization); (ii) net income; (iii) operating income; (iv) earnings per share; (v) return on shareholders' equity; (vi) attainment of strategic and operational initiatives; (vii) customer income; (viii) economic value-added models; (ix) maintenance or improvement of profit margins; (x) stock price (including total shareholder return), including, without limitation, as compared to one or more stock indices; (xi) market share; (xii) revenues, sales or net sales; (xiii) return on assets; (xiv) book value per share; (xv) expense management; (xvi) improvements in capital structure; (xvii) costs; and (xviii) cash flow. The foregoing criteria may relate to the Company, one or more of our subsidiaries or one or more of our divisions or units, or any combination of the foregoing, and may be applied on an absolute basis and/or be relative to one or more peer group companies or indices, or any combination thereof, all as determined by the Compensation Committee. In addition, to the degree consistent with the Internal Revenue Code, the performance criteria may be calculated without regard to extraordinary, unusual and/or non-recurring items. With respect to performance-based awards, (i) the Compensation Committee will establish the objective performance goals applicable to a given period of service no later than 90 days after the commencement of that period of service (but in no event after 25% of that period of service has elapsed) and (ii) no awards will be granted to any participant for a given period of service until the Compensation Committee certifies that the objective performance goals (and any other material terms) applicable to that period have been satisfied.
In the event of any stock dividend or split, reorganization, recapitalization, merger, share exchange or any distribution to shareholders of shares or other property or securities (other than regular cash dividends) or any other similar transaction that results in a change to our equity capitalization, the Compensation Committee will adjust, as it deems to be equitable or appropriate, (i) the number or kind of shares of
Adjustments Upon Certain Events.
common stock or other securities that may be issued or reserved for issuance pursuant to the Plan or pursuant to any outstanding awards, (ii) the annual and other limits on grants of awards and/or (iii) the exercise price of any stock options or stock appreciation rights or purchase price of any award and/or (iv) any other affected terms of the Plan or awards under the Plan. If a change of control of the Company occurs, unless otherwise specified by the Compensation Committee with respect to any award on or prior to the date of grant, (i) any outstanding awards that are unexercisable or unvested will automatically be deemed exercisable or vested and all restrictions on restricted stock and/or restricted stock units will expire and (ii) the Compensation Committee may (A) cancel such awards for fair value (as determined in the sole discretion of the Compensation Committee) or (B) provide for the issuance of substitute awards that will substantially preserve the terms of any awards previously granted under the Plan as determined by the Compensation Committee in its sole discretion. A change of control is defined in the Plan substantially in the same manner as in the agreements with our named executive officers, except that the Plan additionally provides that a change of control will not be deemed to have occurred upon a transaction in which our shareholders prior to the transaction retain a majority of the combined voting power of the voting securities of the resulting entity or its parent following the transaction in substantially the same proportion to each other that they were prior to the transaction.
. A participant in the Plan may not transfer or assign for consideration any awards received under the Plan. A participant may transfer an award by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. During a participant's lifetime, only the participant or his or her guardian or legal representative may exercise the participant's award under the Plan. The Compensation Committee may provide that a participant may transfer awards to family members or trusts that are owned by or for the benefit of family members as long as they are not transferred for consideration.
Transferability
The Board of Directors may amend or terminate the Plan at any time, provided that it may not, without shareholder approval, (i) increase the number of shares that may be acquired under the Plan, (ii) extend the term during which options may be granted under the Plan, (iii) permit the exercise price per share of an option or stock appreciation right to be less than the fair market value of the common stock on the date on which an option or stock appreciation right is granted, except as specifically provided upon the occurrence of certain events as described above, (iv) terminate restrictions on awards except for certain permitted exceptions or (v) provide for awards not permitted under the terms of the Plan. No amendment of the Plan may materially diminish any rights of a participant pursuant to a previously granted award without his or her consent, subject to the Compensation Committee's authority to adjust awards upon certain events (described in "Adjustments Upon Certain Events" above) and the Compensation Committee's ability to amend the Plan in such manner as it deems necessary to permit the granting of awards meeting the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code or other applicable laws. No awards may be made under the Plan after April 17, 2023.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 (April 23, 2013)  C. R. Bard, Inc. (NYSE: BCR) today reported 2013 first quarter financial results. First quarter 2013 net sales were $740.3 million, an increase of 1 percent over the prior-year period on a reported basis.

MURRAY HILL, NJ
For the first quarter 2013, net sales in the U.S. were $498.5 million, essentially flat to net sales of $496.2 million in the prior-year period. Net sales outside the U.S. were $241.8 million, an increase of 3 percent over the prior-year period on a reported basis. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, first quarter 2013 net sales outside the U.S. also increased 3 percent over the prior-year period.
For the first quarter 2013, net income was $90.7 million and diluted earnings per share were $1.08, a decrease of 35 percent and 33 percent, respectively, as compared to first quarter 2012 results.

This press release may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are based on management's current expectations, the accuracy of which is necessarily subject to risks and uncertainties. These statements are not historical in nature and use words such as "anticipate", "estimate", "expect", "project", "intend", "forecast", "plan", "believe", and other words of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. Many factors may cause actual results to differ materially from anticipated results including product developments, sales efforts, income tax matters, the outcomes of contingencies such as legal proceedings, and other economic, business, competitive and regulatory factors. The company undertakes no obligation to update its forward-looking statements. Please refer to the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information in our December 31, 2012 Form 10-K for more detailed information about these and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This press release contains financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP measures in the above tables.
This press release includes net sales excluding the impact of foreign exchange. The company analyzes net sales on a constant currency basis to better measure the comparability of results between periods. Because changes in foreign currency exchange rates have a non-operating impact on net sales, the company believes that evaluating growth in net sales on a constant currency basis provides an additional and meaningful assessment of net sales to both management and the company's investors.
In addition, this press release includes the following non-GAAP measures: (1) cost of goods sold excluding charges for acquisition-related items and an asset impairment; (2) marketing, selling and administrative expense excluding charges for acquisition-related items; (3) research and development expense excluding charges for acquisition-related items; (4) other (income) expense, net, excluding acquisition-related items, asset impairments and litigation charges; (5) income tax provision excluding the tax effect of the items set forth in (1) through (4) above; (6) net income excluding the items set forth in (1) through (5) above; and (7) diluted earnings per share available to common shareholders excluding the items set forth in (1) through (5) above.
The company excluded the items described above because they may cause certain statements of operations categories not to be indicative of ongoing operating results, and therefore affect the comparability of results between periods. The company therefore believes that these non-GAAP measures provide an additional and meaningful assessment of the company's ongoing operating performance. Because the company has historically reported these non-GAAP results to the investment community, management also believes that the inclusion of these non-GAAP measures provides consistency in its financial reporting and facilitates investors' understanding of the company's historic operating trends by providing an additional basis for comparisons to prior periods. Management uses these non-GAAP measures: (1) to establish financial and operational goals; (2) to monitor the company's actual performance in relation to its business plan and operating budgets; (3) to evaluate the company's core operating performance and understand key trends within the business; and (4) as part of several components it considers in determining incentive compensation.
Management recognizes that the use of these non-GAAP measures has limitations, including the fact that they may not be comparable with similar non-GAAP measures used by other companies and that management must exercise judgment in determining which types of charges or other items should be excluded from the non-GAAP information. Management compensates for these limitations by providing full disclosure of each non-GAAP measure and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. All non-GAAP measures are intended to supplement the applicable GAAP disclosures and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a replacement for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures, please see the above tables.
