Historically, the Company has used stock options for all equity incentive awards to its executive officers.  At the Company's 2004 annual meeting, shareholders approved the Company's 2004 Incentive Compensation Plan, providing for awards of restricted stock as well as grants of stock options.

Consistent with past practice, the stock options granted to these executives will vest over time, subject, in general, to the executive's remaining in the Company's employ on specified vesting dates.  Vesting of the restricted stock awarded to these executives will be dependent on (i) the Company's achievement of a performance-based test for the fiscal year of grant, and (ii) assuming achievement of the performance-based test, time vesting, subject, in general, to the executive remaining in the Company's employ on specified vesting dates.

Deferral Elections - General.
3.1

Such amounts deferred under the Plan shall not be made available to such Participant, except as provided in Article 6, and shall reduce such Participant's Compensation from the Employer in accordance with the provisions of the applicable Deferral Election; provided, however, that all such amounts shall be subject to the rights of the general creditors of the Employer as provided in Article 8.  The Deferral Election, in addition to the requirements set forth below, must designate: (i) the amount of Compensation to be deferred, (ii) the time of the distribution, and (iii) the form of the distribution.
 
Time of Election.
3.2
                    
 
A Deferral Election shall be void if it is not made in a timely manner as follows:
 
(a)           A Deferral Election with respect to any Compensation must be submitted to the Administrator before the beginning of the calendar year during which the amount to be deferred will be earned.
 
(b)           Notwithstanding the foregoing and in the discretion of the Employer, in a year in which an Employee is first eligible to participate, such Deferral Election shall be filed within thirty (30) days after the date on which an Employee is first eligible to participate, with
respect to Compensation to be earned during the remainder of the calendar year after such election is made.
 
Distribution Elections.
3.3
                    
 
At the time a Participant makes a Deferral Election, he or she must also elect the time of the distribution by establishing one or more In-Service Account(s) or Retirement Account(s) as provided in Section 5.1.
 
Additional Requirements.
3.4
                    
 
The Deferral Election, subject to the limitations set forth in Sections 3.1 and 3.2 hereof, shall comply with the following additional requirements:
 
(a)           Deferrals may be made in whole percentages or stated dollar amounts with such limitations as determined by the Administrator.

(a)           Subject to subsection (b) below, the Employer shall credit to the Account of each Participant who makes Deferrals a Matching Contribution in an amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of the Deferrals contributed by the Participant, up to a maximum Deferral of six percent (6%) of each Participant's eligible Compensation, offset dollar for dollar by any matching contribution that the Employer makes to the Employer's qualified 401(k) plan on behalf of the Participant. The Employer shall credit the Matching Contribution to the same Account or Accounts to which the Participant directs his or her Deferrals according to Section 3.3 above.
 
(b)           Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the combined maximum annual matching contribution that may be made on behalf of a Participant to this Plan and to the 401(k) qualified plan is fifty percent (50%) of the Deferrals contributed by the Participant up to a maximum Deferral of six percent (6%) of each Participant's eligible Compensation where Compensation is limited to the Code Section 401(a)(17) amount for the applicable Plan Year.  Thus, the maximum Matching Contribution between both plans cannot exceed three percent (3%) (50% of a maximum matched Deferral of 6%) of the Participant's eligible Compensation.
 
Employer Discretionary Contributions.
3.6

A Participant will be permitted to elect to change the form or timing of the distribution of his or her Account(s) to the extent permitted and in accordance with the requirements of Code Section 409A(a)(4)(C), including the requirement that (i) a redeferral election may not take effect until at least twelve (12) months after such election is filed with the Employer, (ii) an election to further defer a distribution (other than a distribution upon death, Disability or an unforeseeable emergency) must result in the first distribution subject to the election being made at least five (5) years after the previously elected date of distribution, and (iii) any redeferral election affecting a distribution at a fixed date must be filed with the Employer at least twelve (12) months before the first scheduled payment under the previous fixed date distribution election.

The term "Specified Employee" shall have the meaning that such term is given in Code Section 409A.
 
Minimum Distribution.
6.11
             
 
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, and subject to Section 6.10 above, if the balance of a Participant's Account at the time of a Separation from Service for any reason is $10,000 or less, then the Participant shall be paid his or her benefits as a single lump sum as soon as administratively feasible following said Separation from Service, subject to Section 6.10 above.

The term "unforeseeable emergency" shall have the meaning that such term is given in Code Section 409A. If an unforeseeable emergency is determined to exist, a distribution may not exceed the amounts necessary to satisfy such emergency plus amounts necessary to pay taxes reasonably anticipated as a result of the distribution, after taking into account the extent to which such hardship is or may be relieved through reimbursement or compensation by insurance or otherwise or by liquidation of the Participant's assets (to the extent the liquidation of such assets would not itself cause severe financial hardship).
Article 7 - Beneficiaries
 
Beneficiaries.
7.1
                    
 
Each Participant may from time to time designate one or more persons (who may be any one or more members of such person's family or other persons, administrators, trusts, foundations or other entities) as his or her beneficiary under the Plan.  Such designation shall be made on a form prescribed by the Administrator.  Each Participant may at any time and from time to time, change any previous beneficiary designation, without notice to or consent of any previously designated beneficiary, by amending his or her previous designation on a form prescribed by the Administrator.  If the beneficiary does not survive the Participant (or is otherwise unavailable to receive payment) or if no beneficiary is validly designated, then the amounts payable under this Plan shall be paid to the Participant's estate.  If more than one person is the beneficiary of a deceased Participant, each such person shall receive a pro rata share of any death benefit payable unless otherwise designated on the applicable form.  If a beneficiary who is receiving benefits dies, all benefits that were payable to such beneficiary shall then be payable to the estate of that beneficiary.
 
Lost Beneficiary.
7.2
                    
 
All Participants and beneficiaries shall have the obligation to keep the Administrator informed of their current address until such time as all benefits due have been paid.  If a Participant or beneficiary cannot be located by the Administrator exercising due diligence, then, in its sole discretion, the Administrator may presume that the Participant or beneficiary is deceased for purposes of the Plan and all unpaid amounts (net of due diligence expenses) owed to the Participant or beneficiary shall be paid accordingly or, if a beneficiary cannot be so located, then such amounts may be forfeited.  Any such presumption of death shall be final, conclusive and binding on all parties.
 
Article 8 - Funding
 
Prohibition Against Funding.
8.1
                    
 
Should any investment be acquired in connection with the liabilities assumed under this Plan, it is expressly understood and agreed that the Participants and beneficiaries shall not have any right with respect to, or claim against, such assets nor shall any such purchase be construed to create a trust of any kind or a fiduciary relationship between the Employer and the Participants, their beneficiaries or any other person.  Any such assets shall be and remain a part of the general, unpledged, unrestricted assets of the Employer, subject to the claims of its general creditors.  It is the express intention of the parties hereto that this arrangement shall be unfunded for tax purposes and for purposes of Title I of ERISA.  Each Participant and beneficiary shall be required to look to the provisions of this Plan and to the Employer itself for enforcement of any and all benefits due under this Plan, and to the extent any such person acquires a right to receive payment under this Plan, such right shall be no greater than the right of any unsecured general creditor of the Employer.  The Employer or the Trust shall be designated the owner and beneficiary of any investment acquired in connection with its obligation under this Plan.
 
Deposits in Trust.
8.2
                    
 
Notwithstanding Section 8.1, or any other provision of this Plan to the contrary, the Employer may deposit into the Trust any amounts it deems appropriate to pay the benefits under
this Plan.  The amounts so deposited may include all contributions made pursuant to a Deferral Election by a Participant, all Matching Contributions, and any Employer Discretionary Contributions.
 
Withholding of Employee Contributions.
8.3
                    
 
The Administrator is authorized to make any and all necessary arrangements with the Employer in order to withhold the Participant's Deferrals under Section 3.1 hereof from his or her Compensation.  The Administrator shall determine the amount and timing of such withholding.

Claims Procedure.

Upon receipt of any written claim for benefits, the Company's Vice President of Human Resources (the "Claim Officer") shall be notified and shall give due consideration to the claim presented.  If any Participant or beneficiary claims to be entitled to benefits under the Plan and the Claim Officer determines that the claim should be denied in whole or in part, the Claim Officer shall, in writing, notify such claimant within ninety (90) days of receipt of the claim that the claim has been denied.  The Claim Officer may extend the period of time for making a determination with respect to any claim for a period of up to ninety (90) days, provided that the Claim Officer determines that such an extension is necessary because of special circumstances and notifies the claimant, prior to the expiration of the initial ninety (90) day period, of the circumstances requiring the extension of time and the date by which the Plan expects to render a decision.  If the claim is denied to any extent by the Claim Officer, the Claim Officer shall furnish the claimant with a written notice setting forth:
 
(a)           the specific reason or reasons for denial of the claim;
 
(b)           a specific reference to the Plan provisions on which the denial is based;
 
(c)           a description of any additional material or information necessary for the claimant to perfect the claim and an explanation of why such material or information is necessary; and
 
(d)           an explanation of the provisions of this Article.
 
Right of Appeal.
9.3
                    
 
A claimant who has a claim denied wholly or partially under Section 9.2 may appeal to the Administrator for reconsideration of that claim.  A request for reconsideration under this
section must be filed by written notice within sixty (60) days after receipt by the claimant of the notice of denial under Section 9.2.
 
Review of Appeal.
9.4
                    
 
Upon receipt of an appeal the Administrator shall promptly take action to give due consideration to the appeal.  Such consideration may include a hearing of the parties involved, if the Administrator feels such a hearing is necessary.  In preparing for this appeal the claimant shall be given the right to review pertinent documents and the right to submit in writing a statement of issues and comments.  After consideration of the merits of the appeal the Administrator shall issue a written decision which shall be binding on all parties.  The decision shall specifically state its reasons and pertinent Plan provisions on which it relies.  The Administrator's decision shall be issued within sixty (60) days after the appeal is filed, except that the Administrator may extend the period of time for making a determination with respect to any claim for a period of up to sixty (60) days, provided that the Administrator determines that such an extension is necessary because of special circumstances and notifies the claimant, prior to the expiration of the initial sixty (60) day period, of the circumstances requiring the extension of time and the date by which the Plan expects to render a decision.
 
Designation.
9.5

Benefits or payments under this Plan shall not be subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, attachment, or garnishment by creditors of the Participant or the Participant's beneficiary, whether voluntary or involuntary, and any attempt to so anticipate, alienate, sell, transfer, assign, pledge, encumber, attach or garnish the same shall not be valid, nor shall any such benefit or payment be in any way liable for or subject to the debts, contracts, liabilities, engagement or torts of any Participant or beneficiary, or any other person entitled to such benefit or payment pursuant to the terms of this Plan, except to such extent as may be required by law.  If any Participant or beneficiary or any other person
entitled to a benefit or payment pursuant to the terms of this Plan becomes bankrupt or attempts to anticipate, alienate, sell, transfer, assign, pledge, encumber, attach or garnish any benefit or payment under this Plan, in whole or in part, or if any attempt is made to subject any such benefit or payment, in whole or in part, to the debts, contracts, liabilities, engagements or torts of the Participant or beneficiary or any other person entitled to any such benefit or payment pursuant to the terms of this Plan, then such benefit or payment, in the discretion of the Administrator, shall cease and terminate with respect to such Participant or beneficiary, or any other such person.
 
No Employment Rights.
10.3
             
 
Participation in this Plan shall not be construed to confer upon any Participant the legal right to be retained in the employ of the Employer, or give a Participant or beneficiary, or any other person, any right to any payment whatsoever, except to the extent of the benefits provided for hereunder.  Each Participant shall remain subject to discharge to the same extent as if this Plan had never been adopted.
 
Incompetence.
10.4
             
 
If the Administrator determines that any person to whom a benefit is payable under this Plan is incompetent by reason of physical or mental disability, the Administrator shall have the power to cause the payments becoming due to such person to be made to another for his or her benefit without responsibility of the Administrator or the Employer to see to the application of such payments.  Any payment made pursuant to such power shall, as to such payment, operate as a complete discharge of the Employer, the Administrator and the Trustee.
 
Identity.
10.5
             
 
If, at any time, any doubt exists as to the identity of any person entitled to any payment hereunder or the amount or time of such payment, the Administrator shall be entitled to hold such sum until such identity or amount or time is determined or until an order of a court of competent jurisdiction is obtained.  The Administrator shall also be entitled to pay such sum into court in accordance with the appropriate rules of law.  Any expenses incurred by the Employer, Administrator, and Trust incident to such proceeding or litigation shall be charged against the Account of the affected Participant.
 
Other Benefits.
10.6
             
 
The benefits of each Participant or beneficiary hereunder shall be in addition to any benefits paid or payable to or on account of the Participant or beneficiary under any other pension, disability, annuity or retirement plan or policy whatsoever.
 
Indemnity.
10.7
             
 
To the maximum extent permitted by applicable state law and to the extent not covered by insurance, the Employer shall indemnify and hold harmless the Claim Officer, the Administrator and each member thereof, the Board of Directors and each member thereof, and delegates of the Administrator who are employees of the Employer, against any and all expenses, liabilities and claims, including legal fees to defend against such liabilities and claims arising out of their discharge, in good faith, of responsibilities under or incident to the Plan, other than expenses and liabilities arising out of willful misconduct.  This indemnity shall not preclude such
further indemnities as may be available under insurance purchased by the Employer or provided by the Employer under any bylaw, agreement or otherwise, as such indemnities are permitted under state law.
 
Expenses.
10.8
             
 
All expenses incurred in the administration of the Plan, whether incurred by the Employer, the Administrator or the Plan, shall be paid by the Employer.
 
Insolvency.
10.9
             
 
Should the Employer be considered insolvent (as defined by the Trust), the Employer, through its Board and Chief Executive Officer, shall give immediate written notice of such fact to the Administrator and the Trustee.  Upon receipt of such notice, the Administrator or Trustee shall cease to make any payments to Participants who were Employees of the Employer or their beneficiaries and the Trustee shall hold any and all assets attributable to the Employer for the benefit of the general creditors of the Employer.
 
Amendment, Modification, Suspension or Termination.
10.10
      
 
The Employer may, at any time, in its sole discretion, amend, modify, suspend or terminate the Plan in whole or in part, except that no such amendment, modification, suspension or termination shall have any retroactive effect to reduce any amounts allocated to a Participant's Accounts.  In the event that this Plan is terminated, the distribution of the amounts credited to a Participant's Accounts shall not be accelerated but shall be paid at such time and in such manner as determined under the terms of the Plan immediately prior to termination as if the Plan had not been terminated.
 
10.11
      
Termination Due to Change-in-Control.
 
Upon a Change-in-Control and payout of all amounts as provided in Section 6.5 above, the Plan shall terminate.
               
 
Construction.
10.12
      
 
All questions of interpretation, construction or application arising under or concerning the terms of this Plan shall be decided by the Administrator, in its sole and final discretion, whose decision shall be final, binding and conclusive upon all persons.
 
Governing Law.
10.13
      
 
This Plan shall be governed by, construed and administered in accordance with the applicable provisions of ERISA, and any other applicable federal law, including Section 409A of the Code, and to the extent not preempted by federal law this Plan shall be governed by, construed and administered under the laws of the state of New Jersey, other than its laws respecting choice of law.
 
Severability.
10.14
      
 
If any provision of this Plan is held invalid or unenforceable, its invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision of this Plan and this Plan shall be construed and enforced as if such provision had not been included therein.  If the inclusion of any
Employee (or Employees) as a Participant under this Plan would cause the Plan to fail to comply with the requirements of sections 201(2), 301(a)(3) and 401(a)(1) of ERISA, or Code Section 409A, then the Plan shall be severed with respect to such Employee or Employees, who shall be considered to be participating in a separate arrangement.
 
Headings.
10.15
      
 
The Article headings contained herein are inserted only as a matter of convenience and for reference and in no way define, limit, enlarge or describe the scope or intent of this Plan nor in any way shall they affect this Plan or the construction of any provision thereof.
 
Terms.
10.16
      
 
Capitalized terms shall have meanings as defined herein.  Singular nouns shall be read as plural, masculine pronouns shall be read as feminine, and vice versa, as appropriate.
 
409A Compliance.
10.17
      
 
This Plan will, at all times, be operated in good faith compliance with Section 409A of the Code in accordance with Internal Revenue Service Notice 2005-1 and proposed regulations thereunder (and any subsequent IRS notices or guidance). In the event that any provision of this Plan is inconsistent with Code Section 409A or such guidance, then the applicable provisions of Code Section 409A shall supersede such provision.  Nothing herein shall be construed as an entitlement to our guarantee of any particular tax treatment to a Participant.

Exhibit 10.1
 
 
Corporate Office
650 Liberty Avenue
Union, New Jersey 07083
908/688-0888
 
January 11, 2006
 
Mr. Steven H. Temares Chief Executive Officer Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. 650 Liberty Avenue Union, New Jersey 07083
 
Dear Mr. Temares:
 
This letter agreement (the "Agreement") sets forth the terms and conditions of the supplemental retirement benefit which will be payable to you or on your behalf by Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (the "Company"):
 
If you remain employed by the Company on and through June 12, 2012 (, the twentieth anniversary of the date of your commencement of employment with the Company) or the earlier occurrence of a Change of Control of the Company (as such term is defined in Section 2(g) below) (the earliest of such dates being herein referred to as "Vesting Date"), you will be entitled to receive a supplemental retirement benefit upon your retirement or other separation from service from the Company thereafter (the "Retirement Benefit"), subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.  The Retirement Benefit shall be an annual amount equal to 50% of your annual base salary rate on the date of your retirement or other separation from service from the Company for a period of 10 years, which, except as provided in Section 2 below, shall be paid in accordance with the Company's normal payroll practices over the 10-year period commencing on the date of your retirement or other separation from service from the Company.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in your December 1, 1994 employment agreement with the Company, as amended May 28, 1999 and as further amended May 1, 2004 (the "Employment Agreement"), you may, at any time after the Vesting Date, upon 90 days' prior written notice given to the Company, elect to retire from the Company and commence receipt of the Retirement Benefit.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, any amount due prior to the date six months after your
1.
                                      
i.e.
 
retirement or other separation from service from the Company shall (except as provided in Section 2 below) be deferred and paid to you in a lump sum on the date six months from the date of such retirement or other separation from service from the Company in the amount that would have been paid during such six-month period.
 
(a)  If your employment with the Company is terminated (i) prior to the Vesting Date by reason of your voluntary termination of employment or (ii) prior to or on or after the Vesting Date by reason of your voluntary termination of employment where cause (as defined in your Employment Agreement ("Cause")) exists or by the Company for Cause, you will forfeit any right or entitlement to the Retirement Benefit.
2.
                                      
 
(b)  If your employment with the Company is terminated by the Company without Cause (whether prior to or on or after the Vesting Date), you will receive, on the date six months following such termination, a lump sum payment equal to the present value of the Retirement Benefit payable for 10 years from the date of termination, using as the discount rate the Applicable Federal Rate for short-term Treasury obligations as published by the Internal Revenue Service for the month in which the termination of employment occurs (the "Discount Rate").
 
(c)  If your employment with the Company is terminated as a result of your death or by the Company as a result of your Disability (whether prior to or on or after the Vesting Date, but prior to your retirement), you or your beneficiary(ies) designated pursuant to the beneficiary designation form provided to you by the Company or, if no beneficiary has been designated, your estate, will receive a lump sum payment equal to the present value of the annual Retirement Benefit payable for 10 years from the date of termination, calculated using the Discount Rate.  If such termination is as a result of your Disability, payment of the Retirement Benefit under this Section 2(c) shall be made on the date six months following such termination; if such termination is as a result of your death, payment of the Retirement Benefit under this Section 2(c) shall be made as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of death.  For purposes of this Agreement, "Disability" shall mean your inability substantially to perform your duties and responsibilities under the Employment Agreement for a period of 180 consecutive days as a result of physical or mental disability.
 
(d)  In the event of your death during the payment of the Retirement Benefit under Section 1 above, your beneficiary(ies) designated pursuant to the beneficiary designation form provided to you by the Company or, if no beneficiary has been designated, your estate, will receive, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of death, a lump sum payment equal to the present value of the portion of the annual Retirement Benefit due to be paid after the date of death, calculated using the Discount Rate.
 
(e)  Upon your retirement or other separation from service from the Company within 12 months after a Change of Control of the Company, in lieu of annual payment of the Retirement Benefit, you will receive six months after such retirement or other separation from service from the Company a lump sum payment equal to the present value of the annual Retirement Benefit for 10 years from the date of such retirement or other separation from service from the Company, calculated using the Discount Rate.
 
(f)  In the event of a Change of Control of the Company during the payment of the Retirement Benefit under Section 1 above, you will receive six months after such Change of
Control a lump sum payment equal to the present value of the portion of the annual Retirement Benefit due to be paid after the date of the Change of Control, calculated using the Discount Rate.
 
(g)  For purposes of this Agreement, a "Change of Control" shall mean the first to occur of the following:
 
(i)  any "person," as such term is used in sections 3(a)(9) and 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), becomes a "beneficial owner," as such term is used in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act, of 50% or more of the outstanding common stock of the Company, excluding a person that is an affiliate (as such term is used under the Exchange Act) of the Company on the date of this Agreement, or any affiliate of any such person;
 
(ii) the majority of the board of directors of the Company (the "Board") consists of individuals other than "Incumbent Directors," which term means the members of the Board on the date of this agreement; provided that any person becoming a director subsequent to such date whose election or nomination for election was supported by two-thirds of the directors who then comprised the Incumbent Directors shall be considered an Incumbent Director;
 
(iii)  the Company adopts any plan of liquidation providing for the distribution of all or substantially all its assets;
 
(iv)  all or substantially all the assets or business of the Company are disposed of pursuant to a merger, consolidation or other transaction (unless the shareholders of the Company immediately prior to such merger, consolidation or other transaction beneficially own, directly or indirectly, in substantially the same proportion as they own the common stock of the Company, all the common stock or other ownership interests of the entity or entities, if any, that succeed to the business of the Company); or
 
(v)  the Company combines with another company and is the surviving corporation, but, immediately after the combination, the shareholders of the Company immediately prior to the combination hold, directly or indirectly, 50% or less of the common stock or other ownership interests of the combined company (there being excluded from the number of shares held by such shareholders, but not from the common stock or other ownership interests of the combined company, any shares other ownership interests received by affiliates of such other company in exchange for stock of such other company).
 
Any taxes required to be paid by you as a result of payments under this Agreement shall be for your account and the Company may withhold such taxes from any amounts due to you hereunder.
3.
                                      
Payment of the Retirement Benefit pursuant to this Agreement is contingent upon your compliance with the restrictive covenant not to compete with the Company described in Section 4 of your Employment Agreement for the period therein, as well as for the period you are receiving payment of the Retirement Benefit under Section 1 hereof.  In the event that you breach the terms of the restrictive covenant of Section 4 of your Employment Agreement (or engage in activities during the period you are receiving payment of the Retirement Benefit under Section 1 hereof which would have been a breach of Section 4 of your Employment Agreement had they taken place during the period specified in Section 4), any future payments due under this Agreement shall immediately be forfeited, but no payments previously made (including without limitation any Retirement Benefit that has been previously paid in a lump sum) shall be returned or forfeited.  Nothing herein shall be deemed to require compliance by you with the restrictive covenants set forth in Section 4 of your Employment Agreement beyond the period specified therein; the only consequence of engaging in activities after the period specified in Section 4 which would have been a breach of Section 4 had they occurred during such period being the forfeiture of future payments of Retirement Benefits to the extent provided in Section 4 of this Agreement.
4.
                                      
 
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Retirement Benefit will not be paid or made available under the preceding provisions of this Agreement (excluding Retirement Benefits paid as a result of death or Disability) unless: (a) you first execute a release in a form reasonably prescribed by the Company, and (b) to the extent any portion of such release is subject to any revocation period prescribed by the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, as amended, or any other revocation period in effect on the date of your retirement under any federal or state law, such revocation period has expired without revocation of the release.
5.
                                      
 
This Agreement is an "unfunded" plan for purposes of providing retirement compensation.  With respect to any payments as to which you have a fixed and vested interest but that have not yet made to you by the Company, nothing contained herein shall give you any rights that are greater than those of a general unsecured creditor of the Company.
6.
                                      
 
Nothing contained in this Agreement shall limit your eligibility to participate in or receive benefits under any employee benefit plan sponsored or maintained by the Company; provided that the Retirement Benefit shall not be considered or included for purposes of calculating any benefit under any such employee benefit plan of the Company.
7.
                                      
 
This Agreement is not an agreement of employment.  This Agreement does not guarantee that the Company will employ or retain, or to continue to, employ or retain you during the entire, or any portion of the, term of this Agreement, nor does it modify in any respect any of your or the Company's rights under your Employment Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect and unchanged by this Agreement.
8.
                                      
 
No rights or obligations of the Company under this Agreement may be assigned or transferred by the Company, except pursuant to a merger or consolidation, or the sale or liquidation of all or substantially all the assets of the Company, provided that, in the case of
9.
                                      
such a sale or liquidation, the assignee or transferee assumes in writing the obligation to perform this Agreement (it being understood, however, that no such assignment or transfer shall relieve the Company of its liabilities or obligations under this agreement).
 
This Agreement is intended to comply with the applicable requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") and shall be limited, construed and interpreted in accordance with such intent.  Subject to the last sentence hereof, to the extent that the Retirement Benefit is subject to Section 409A of the Code, it shall be paid in a manner that will comply with Section 409A of the Code, including proposed, temporary or final regulations or any other guidance issued by the Secretary of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service with respect thereto.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any provision in this Agreement that is inconsistent with Section 409A of the Code shall be deemed to be amended to comply with Section 409A of the Code and to the extent such provision cannot be amended to comply therewith, such provision shall be null and void.  Such compliance shall be as mutually agreed between the Company and you, but the Company shall not be an indemnifier of compliance with Code Section 409A, which shall be your risk.
10.
                                
 
This Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), the Code and other applicable federal law.  To the extent not preempted by or inconsistent with federal law, the laws of the state of New York shall apply.  If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, the invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision of this Agreement and the Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if the provision had not been included.
11.
                                
 
This Agreement is intended to be a plan which is unfunded and maintained primarily for the purpose of providing deferred compensation for a select group of management or highly compensated employees within the meaning of Sections 201, 301 and 401 of ERISA, and therefore to be exempt from the provisions of Parts 2, 3 and 4 of Title I of ERISA.
12.
                                
 
For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Company" shall include any and all successors and assignees, whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise, to all or substantially all the business or assets of the Company, and such successors and assignees shall perform the Company's obligations under this Agreement, in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform if no such succession or assignment had taken place.
13.
                                
This Agreement sets forth all understandings with regard to your Retirement Benefit payable by the Company.  This Agreement has been presented to, and duly authorized by, the Compensation Committee of the Board.  It may not be amended or terminated without the written agreement of both parties hereto.
14.

Independent Review of Stock Option Grants and Procedures
On June 19, 2006, following the issuance of two analyst reports that included the Company on lists of companies whose shares had shown comparatively high increases in trading prices subsequent to stock option grant dates, the Board of Directors appointed a special committee of two independent members of the Board of Directors, with authority, among other things, to conduct an investigation with respect to the setting of exercise prices for employee stock options and related matters as the committee deemed appropriate.  On June 20, 2006, the special committee retained independent legal counsel, Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP, and on June 25, 2006, Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP engaged outside accounting advisors, Navigant Consulting, Inc.  The Company promptly informed its regular independent accountants of the analyst reports, and has kept its accountants informed as the review has progressed.
The special committee commenced its review in late June 2006, and during the period through October 2006, carried out an extensive review covering stock option grants and restricted stock awards made by the Company during the period from its initial public offering in 1992 through May 15, 2006.  During the course of this review, counsel to the special committee interviewed 31 officers, directors, employees, advisors and others involved in the award process, and undertook a broad document review.
On September 20, 2006, prior to the public announcement of the review, counsel to the special committee notified the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") of the review.  Following such self-reporting, the Staff indicated that it would commence an informal inquiry.  The Company intends to cooperate fully with the SEC.
The special committee's review has been completed, and on October 9, 2006, the special committee presented its report (the "Report") to the Company's Board of Directors.
The review identified various deficiencies in the process of granting and documenting stock options and restricted shares described below. As a result of the deficiencies, the special committee recommended, among other things, that the Company revise the measurement dates under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," for 16 annual option grant dates, 26 monthly grant dates and 2 special grant dates (revisions of  2 annual, 4 monthly and 1 special grant dates have no accounting impact because prices on the revised dates were lower than on the measurement dates previously recorded by the Company). As a result of these new measurement dates and the correction of various other errors relating to the accounting for equity-based compensation, the Company has determined that from fiscal year 1993 through the second quarter of fiscal 2006, it had certain unrecorded non-cash equity-based compensation charges associated with its equity-based compensation plans. The Company believes, however, that these charges are not material to its financial statements in any of the periods to which such charges would have related and therefore, has not recorded such charges and will not revise its historic financial statements.
The Company will, however, in accordance with the transition provisions of Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, "Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in the Current Year Financial Statements," ("SAB 108"), record a reclassification, within the equity section of the consolidated balance sheet to be included in its Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending March 3, 2007, of approximately $66 million, excluding any related tax effect.  This reclassification represents the effect of the adjustment resulting from the non-cash charges discussed above that relate to fiscal 2005 and prior years. The Company also expects to record a year-to-date non-cash selling, general and administrative expense charge in its consolidated statement of earnings of approximately $8 million in fiscal third quarter. This approximately $8 million pre-tax charge represents the total of the first and second quarter charges related to the impact of the revised measurement dates (and the correction of various other immaterial errors referred to above), and the applicable charge for the third quarter. This approximately $8 million charge was not included in the Company's planning assumptions and earnings guidance for its fiscal third quarter and fiscal 2006, which were provided in its conference call on September 20, 2006. The Company is reviewing any potential tax implications relating to the Company's stock option grants and restricted share awards, but believes that such matters will not have a material impact on the Company's financial position.
 
The Report is summarized as follows:
Background
From the Company's initial public offering to present, the Company has had a broad-based equity compensation program under which more than 19,000 individual grants have been made to employees ranging from assistant store managers to senior executives.  The general grant process was as follows:
Annual grants were consistently made in the first quarter in connection with annual reviews given to employees.  Grants were made to:
                                         
Senior level employees (referred to as "Senior Persons").  These grants were made by a committee of outside directors ("Committee B" from September 1993 to December 2002 and thereafter by the Compensation Committee).
                                         
All other eligible persons.  These grants were made by a committee of inside directors ("Committee A").
                                         
Monthly grants were made by Committee A, generally on the 15 of each month, to new hires, for promotions, and to a relatively small number of employees who were not on the regular annual review cycle.
                                         
th
Special grants were made by Committee B or the Compensation Committee in connection with promotions or employment agreements for the Company's current co-chairmen or chief executive officer.
                                         
The Report states that precision with respect to the findings for certain matters and grants was not possible due to the absence of definitive documentation, incomplete, and sometimes varying recollections with respect to events dating back to 1992, and similar matters.
The Report states that outside counsel has been actively involved in Board and committee matters, including with respect to stock options.
Selection of Annual Grant Dates
The Company has followed a consistent practice of seeking low grant prices for the purpose of attracting and retaining employees.
                                         
The Company's co-chairmen and chief executive officer were responsible for selecting the grant dates, though the responsibilities varied depending on the period, with the current chief executive officer having primary responsibility in later years.
                                         
From 1993 through approximately 1997, although grant date prices were generally favorable, they were not consistently the lowest grant price dates.
                                         
From 1998 through 2005:
                                         
Five annual grant dates were at the low price for the fiscal quarter (the special committee determined that there was conclusive or strong evidence that one of
                                         
2
these grant dates was selected on the actual date and the others no later than two, three, five and eight trading days after the grant date).
Two additional annual dates were at the low price of the +/- 20 trading days (the special committee determined that there was conclusive evidence that these dates were selected no later than three and four trading days after the grant date).
                                         
One annual grant date was the third lowest for the fiscal quarter (the special committee determined that there was strong evidence that this date was selected no later than two trading days after the grant date).
                                         
Based on its review, the special committee believes:
                                         
Some hindsight was used in selecting some annual grant dates.
                                         
Excluding grants only to Form 4 filers beginning in 2003, almost all annual grant dates in 1998-2004 likely were selected with some hindsight; conclusive or strong evidence establishes that the grant date was selected, in most cases, within a relatively short period after the recorded grant date (in most cases within a few trading days but sometimes with a meaningful stock price increase).
                                         
In some years, it is likely that the annual grant date was selected on the recorded grant date.
                                         
Process Deficient
The special committee determined that:
                                         
The option granting process had control and other deficiencies.
                                         
The Company failed to maintain adequate controls with respect to issuance of options in compliance with the Company's stock option policies; the Company's policies also were not sufficient to ensure compliance with all applicable accounting rules.
                                         
With respect to Committee A, lists of grantees and option amounts were not sufficiently final or determinable on the grant date.
                                         
Among the other process deficiencies found with respect to the Committee A option grants were the delegation to the Company's chief executive officer of the authority to select the annual grant date without explicit conditions or documentation; documentation which in various respects was not complete or timely; and a number of monthly grant dates which
                                         
3
had or appeared to have grant amounts or dates which were inconsistent with the Company's policies.
There were 31 off-cycle monthly grant dates (i.e., not made on the 15 of the month as required by the Company's policies), 12 of which were at notable low prices.  Interviews and the documentation reviewed do not explain the selection of these off-cycle dates.  The low prices were suggestive of the use of some hindsight in selecting the low price off-cycle grant dates.
                                         
th
Various 15 of the month grants were not in compliance with the Company's policies, based on a sample of testing of the monthly grants. These generally involved relatively small grants to non-executive employees. Based on the testing, the timing of the grants were generally not suggestive of intent to provide low grant prices  50% of these non-compliant grants were made at prices higher (and 50% were lower) than the prices on the correct dates.
                                         
th
Among the process deficiencies found by the special committee with respect to the Committee B grants were the delegation to the co-chairmen and the chief executive officer of the authority to select grant dates and to determine grant amounts without explicit conditions or documentation, although unanimous written consents were later signed with grant dates and amounts; not all grantees were approved prior to the grant date; absence of complete or contemporaneous documentation; and the delegation to the co-chairmen and chief executive officer of the authority to select the date for their own options, even though the grant date was the same as used for general employee grants or other Senior Person grants.
                                         
No Willful Misconduct
The special committee found no evidence that either the Company or any person involved in the grant process had engaged in willful misconduct.
                                         
The grant process was characterized by informality which lacked safeguards to ensure compliance with applicable accounting and disclosure rules.  For example, the process did not require any contemporaneous documentation or other action evidencing the selection of a grant date.
                                         
The special committee found no evidence demonstrating that those who were responsible for selecting option grant dates (the Company's co-chairmen and chief executive officer) appreciated the accounting or disclosure implications of the practices used for selecting those dates.
                                         
The special committee found no evidence demonstrating that those responsible for the accounting and disclosure functions were aware of the deficient practices used for selecting grant dates.  As a result, they did not consider the accounting or disclosure implications of those practices.  To the extent they were aware of any other processes now determined to have been deficient, the special committee has found no evidence demonstrating that they appreciated the accounting or disclosure implications of those deficiencies.
                                         
The Company and directors regularly sought advice from and relied on outside counsel.
                                         
The special committee found no evidence that the directors were aware of the practices used for the selection of grant dates (other than the co-chairmen and chief executive officer as discussed above) or other significant process deficiencies, and consequently, they did not believe that the accounting or disclosures were inaccurate.
                                         
4
The special committee found no evidence that outside counsel was aware of any facts which led them to believe that the accounting or disclosures were inaccurate.
                                         
The co-chairmen and chief executive officer (and others involved in the grant process) believed that, in granting options as described herein, they were acting in the best interests of the Company with the purpose of attracting and retaining employees.
                                         
No Intent to Mislead Auditors or Outside Counsel or Create False Documents
The special committee determined there was no intent to mislead auditors or outside counsel.
                                         
The special committee determined that there was no intent to create false or misleading documents; there was no evidence of "fictitious grants."
                                         
Grants to Senior Persons were documented prior to 2005 with unanimous written consents prepared by outside counsel.  The consents were dated "as of" the grant dates and did not purport to be signed on the actual grant dates.  There was a belief by counsel and those signing the consents that the process used was consistent with the grant of options at fair market value on the date of grant.
                                         
SEC Disclosure
With respect to prior SEC disclosure, the special committee determined that:
                                         
The Company made disclosure in various SEC filings that option grants were made at fair market value on the date of grant and that no compensation expense was recognized.
                                         
In light of the findings, the disclosures with respect to stock option practices and related accounting were not accurate in certain respects.
                                         
Committee Role
With respect to the role of committees handling stock option matters, the special committee determined that:
                                         
There was reliance on experienced outside counsel as to legal matters and the Company's finance department as to accounting matters.
                                         
The committees were not involved with all of the details of the grant process, including, in the case of Committee B and the Compensation Committee, selection of grant dates prior to 2005.

Recommendations for Improvements in the Stock Option/Restricted Share Process
The special committee determined that while some process improvements had been made in the Company's stock option and restricted share award processes since 2004, significant further improvements are needed.  Such improvements include:
The Company should develop and implement best practices with respect to option and restricted stock grants (including those described herein), and should continue to monitor industry and regulatory practices in this area and revise the Company's practices as developments occur.
                                         
The Company should designate a member of its in-house legal and accounting staffs to oversee documentation and accounting of all option and restricted share grants; they should be notified in writing on the date any option and restricted shares grant is made.
                                         
The Company should continue its current practice of consistently making annual grants in the first fiscal quarter in connection with annual reviews.
                                         
The Company should improve the Committee A annual grant process, including:
                                         
Committee A approvals should be made at duly convened meetings and documented at the time of the meeting.
                                         
Final lists with names of grantees, grant amounts, grant prices and other option terms should be complete at the time of the grant date.
                                         
The Company should improve the Compensation Committee annual grant process, including:
                                         
The Compensation Committee grant approvals should continue (as has been the recent practice) to be made at duly convened meetings and documented at the time of the meeting.
                                         
The Compensation Committee should continue (as has been the recent practice) to only have responsibility for approving grants required by applicable laws (e.g., Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code and Rule 16b-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) and such other grants as it intends to appropriately review and consider.
                                         
Final lists with names of grantees, grant amounts, grant prices and other option terms should be complete at the time of the grant date.
                                         
The annual grant date for Senior Persons should be the same as for all other employees (subject to applicable trading blackouts and other extenuating circumstances approved in advance by the Board of Directors).
                                         
The monthly grant process should be improved, including:
                                         
6
The Company should continue its existing practice of consistently awarding restricted shares for new employees, promotions and off cycle annual reviews on the 15 of the month following the triggering event.
                                         
th
The applicable committee should formally approve monthly grants on or prior to the 15 of each month either at a duly convened meeting or by a written consent dated the date of the consent.
                                         
th
All option grants should be made with an exercise price of not less than 100% of the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the date of the meeting at which the grant is approved (or, in the case of monthly grants, the 15 of the month); conversions of restricted share grants made in dollars into shares should be done on the same basis.
                                         
th
All grants should be communicated to employees within a relatively short period after the grant date as required by applicable accounting rules.
                                         
Grant responsibilities should not be delegated to individual committee members or non-members.
                                         
Disclosure in SEC filings should be enhanced regarding the option and restricted share grant process (including types of different grants and roles and composition of Committee A and the Compensation Committee with respect to grants).
                                         
The Company should increase automation of the option and restricted share request and grant process or otherwise improve compensating controls.
                                         
The Company should expand Sarbanes-Oxley testing procedures relating to option approval and its documentation process for annual and monthly grants, and should revise existing procedures to more accurately describe the approval and grant process.
                                         
Committee A and the Compensation Committee should document and approve enhanced option grant and restricted share award processes and procedures and the updated processes and procedures should be distributed to all involved personnel.
                                         
Improve training and education designed to ensure that all relevant personnel involved in the administration of stock option grants understand the terms of the stock option plans and the relevant accounting requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for stock options and other share-based payments.
                                         
Board Action
On October 9, 2006, the Board of Directors adopted the special committee's recommendations, with such additional improvements in the Company's stock option and restricted stock processes as the Board and special committee may approve. The Company intends to implement the recommendations as soon as possible.
Legal Proceedings
On July 24, 2006 and July 28, 2006, service was purportedly made on the Company of two shareholder derivative actions that were filed in the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Union County,against certain of the Company's officers and directors.  The actions,

titled and , were brought by persons identifying themselves as shareholders and purporting to act on behalf of the Company  The Company is named solely as a nominal defendant against which the plaintiffs seek no recovery.  No demand was served on the Company prior to the filing of either action.
Nicholas Weil v. Warren Eisenberg, et al.
Timothy Hill v. Warren Eisenberg, et al.
.
The two complaints, which are virtually identical, allege that certain of the Company's officers and directors breached their fiduciary duties to the Company and obtained unjust enrichment in connection with grants of stock options to certain officers of the Company in 1996-2003 that were allegedly backdated.  The complaints seek unspecified monetary damages and disgorgement from the defendants, as well as unspecified equitable relief.  The two actions have been consolidated, and the plaintiffs are expected to file a consolidated complaint in October 2006.

Exhibit 99.1
BED BATH & BEYOND INC. ANNOUNCES
FISCAL THIRD QUARTER 2006 RESULTS
                 
Quarterly Net Sales Increase by 11.8%
                 
Quarterly Net Earnings Increase to $.50 Per Diluted Share
                 
Quarterly Comparable Store Sales Increase by 4.6%
                 
Company to Commence $1 Billion Share Repurchase Program
                 
Fourth Quarter Charge Being Considered to Protect Employees Against
Internal Revenue Code Section 409A Adverse Tax Consequences
UNION, New Jersey, December 20, 2006  today reported net earnings of $.50 per diluted share ($142.4 million) in the fiscal third quarter ended November 25, 2006.  In the fiscal third quarter of 2005, the Company reported net earnings of $.45 per diluted share ($134.6 million).  Net sales for the fiscal third quarter of 2006 were approximately $1.619 billion, an increase of approximately 11.8% from net sales of approximately $1.449 billion reported in the fiscal third quarter of 2005.  Comparable store sales for the fiscal third quarter of 2006 grew by approximately 4.6%, compared with an increase of approximately 3.1% in last year's fiscal third quarter.
Bed Bath & Beyond Inc.
For the fiscal nine months ended November 25, 2006, the Company reported net earnings of $1.36 per diluted share ($388.4 million).  In the comparable nine months a year ago, the Company reported net earnings of $1.25 per diluted share ($374.9 million).  Net sales for the fiscal nine months of 2006 were approximately $4.622 billion, an increase of approximately 12.1% from net sales of approximately $4.124 billion reported in the corresponding period of the prior year.  Comparable store sales for the fiscal nine months increased by approximately 4.8% compared with an increase of approximately 4.0% in last year's fiscal nine months.
The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 123(R) at the beginning of the fiscal third quarter of 2005.  Results for the nine months of 2006 include non-comparable stock-based compensation expenses for the first half of fiscal 2006.
In addition, the Company's Board of Directors is reviewing a program intended to protect over 1,600 employees from certain potential adverse tax consequences. These adverse tax consequences arise pursuant to Internal Revenue Code Section 409A as a result of historical issues associated with some of the Company's stock option grants that were disclosed through the Company's stock option review. Although no final determination has been reached by the Board of Directors, the Company anticipates it will incur a non-recurring charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 related to this program. The Company anticipates the potential cash payments pursuant to the program to be approximately $40 million. While the Company is currently reviewing the accounting treatment related to the potential program, the Company anticipates the pre-tax income statement impact in the fourth quarter to be slightly more than the cash payments, with any difference between the cash payments and the associated pre-tax expense to be recorded as an adjustment to Additional Paid-In Capital in the Shareholders' Equity section of the Company's Balance Sheet.  The potential cash outlay primarily represents payments to employees in connection with increasing the exercise prices on certain stock option grants so as to protect them from certain potential adverse tax consequences.  The Company believes it is likely the Company would recoup a substantial portion of any such cash outlay over the next several years through higher proceeds from future stock option exercises, although this recovery would not flow through the income statement. The Company's two Co-Chairmen and CEO have informed the Board that they decline to be considered for payments.

Section 409A Remediation for Employee Stock Options
The information set forth under the heading "Section 409A Remediation for Employee Stock Options" in Item 8.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is hereby incorporated by reference into this Item 5.02.
Amendments to Employment Agreements
On December 26, 2006, Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (the "Company") entered into amendments to the employment agreements for each of Eugene Castagna, Matthew Fiorilli and Arthur Stark.  The amendments provide for certain changes which the Company believes are necessary and appropriate to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended ("Section 409A").  Specifically, the amendments eliminate the Company's discretion to pay severance amounts in either the form of installments or a lump sum and provide that severance amounts will only be paid in the form of installments.  The amendments also provide for a six month delay in payment of certain amounts payable upon termination of employment to the extent necessary to comply with the requirements of Section 409A.
Item 8.01               Other Events.
Section 409A Remediation for Employee Stock Options
As previously disclosed, a special committee of two independent members of the Company's Board of Directors, with the assistance of independent legal counsel and outside accounting advisors, conducted a review of the stock option grants and restricted share awards made by the Company during the period from its initial public offering in 1992 through May 15, 2006.  The review identified various deficiencies in the process of granting and documenting stock options and restricted shares.  As a result of these deficiencies, the special committee recommended, among other things, revised measurement dates for certain stock option grants.
For purposes of Section 409A, a stock option granted with an exercise price that has been deemed to be less than the fair market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant, to the extent that it was not vested as of January 1, 2005, will be subject to adverse tax consequences unless brought into compliance with Section 409A (such stock options are referred to herein as the "Affected Options").  Grants of the Affected Options were made to over 1,600 of the Company's employees.  In order to protect the employees holding Affected Options from such adverse tax consequences under Section 409A, the Company's Board of Directors (excluding the three directors who are officers of the Company) and the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors jointly approved the following actions on December 21, 2006:
2
 
With respect to all outstanding Affected Options held by Warren Eisenberg and Leonard Feinstein, the Co-Chairmen of the Company, and Steven Temares, the Chief Executive Officer of the Company, the exercise price of such options that were not vested as of January 1, 2005 will be increased prior to the end of calendar 2006 to the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the new measurement dates.  Each of Messrs. Eisenberg, Feinstein and Temares has informed the Board that they decline to be considered for payment of the difference between the original exercise price and the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the new measurement date for each Affected Option or any other payment or consideration in respect of such adjustment to the exercise price of the Affected Options held by him.
        
With respect to all outstanding Affected Options held by six senior officers of the Company (including Eugene Castagna, Matthew Fiorilli and Arthur Stark, each of whom is an "executive officer" as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), each such officer will be given the choice, with respect to each grant of Affected Options, to either (i) select a calendar year in which such Affected Options will be exercisable (with earlier limited exercise periods in the case of such officer's separation from service under pre-existing employment agreements, subject to the six month delay to the extent required by Section 409A), or (ii) elect to increase the exercise price of such Affected Options to the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the new measurement dates, in which case the officer agreed he will not receive the difference between the original exercise price and the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the new measurement date for each applicable Affected Option or any other payment or consideration in respect of such adjustment to the exercise price of the Affected Options held by such officer.
        
With respect to all outstanding Affected Options held by all other employees and/or former employees of the Company (other than three former employees who made the election described in clause (i) of the immediately preceding bullet point), the exercise price of such Affected Options that were not vested as of January 1, 2005 will be increased, effective as of the close of trading on December 29, 2006, to the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the new measurement date for each such Affected Option and such employees and former employees will receive a cash payment from the Company in early 2007 in an amount equal to the difference between the original exercise price and the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the new measurement dates for each Affected Option (less applicable payroll tax withholdings).  Employees terminated for "cause" prior to the payment date will not be entitled to the cash payment.  An employee who resigns prior to the payment date, will receive a cash payment applicable only to those Affected Options that are vested upon such employee's termination date.
        
With respect to Affected Options that were exercised during the 2006 calendar year, the Company will reimburse any holder for any tax liability (beyond typical income tax and other usual payroll deductions) resulting under Section 409A due to the exercise of such Affected Option.  No executive officer has exercised Affected Options during calendar 2006.
                 
While the Company is currently reviewing the accounting treatment related to the remediation for employee stock options as described above, the Company believes it is likely it will recoup a substantial portion of the cash payments described above over the next several years through higher proceeds from the exercise of the Affected Options at the higher exercise prices.  The Internal Revenue Service has not yet issued final guidance under Section 409A.  To the extent that such final guidance requires any changes to the approved actions, the Company will so notify affected option holders.
 
In order to update the Company's systems and commence processing the payments described above, the Company plans to designate a time period during which affected optionholders will be unable to exercise grants containing their Affected Options using the on-line broker-assisted cashless exercise system which assists the Company in the administration of its stock option plans.  This time period will begin after the close of the trading day on December 29, 2006 and will end as soon as the Company has completed all processing, which is currently expected by January 31, 2007.  Additionally, the Company anticipates that there will be a short time during this period when the on-line cashless exercise system will not be available to any users while system maintenance is being performed.  Although the on-line system may not be available during these time periods, employees may exercise any vested shares with broker assistance.

Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
On March 22, 2007, Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing the acquisition of Buy Buy Baby, Inc. ("Baby"). A copy of this press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
On March 22, 2007, the Company entered into a definitive agreement for and simultaneously closed on the purchase of Baby, a privately held retailer of infant and toddler merchandise, for approximately $67 million (net of cash acquired) and repayment of debt of approximately $19 million. Based in Garden City, New York, Baby operates a total of eight stores in New York, New Jersey, Maryland and Virginia. The stores range in size from 28,000 to 60,000 square feet and offer a broad assortment of premier infant and toddler merchandise in categories including furniture, car seats, strollers, feeding, bedding, bath, health and safety essentials, toys, learning and development products, clothing and a unique selection of seasonal and holiday products.
Baby was founded in 1996 by Richard and Jeffrey Feinstein, both of whom were previously employed by the Company and are the sons of Leonard Feinstein, one of the Company's Co-Chairmen.  They will remain with Baby and continue to run its operations.  The acquisition was approved by a special committee of independent members of the Board of Directors of the Company. The special committee retained Merrill Lynch & Co. to serve as its independent financial advisor and render a fairness opinion in connection with the transaction, as well as Chadbourne & Parke LLP to serve as independent legal counsel to oversee the acquisition negotiations.  The Company's Co-Chairmen, Leonard Feinstein and Warren Eisenberg, recused themselves from deliberations relating to the transaction.
Of the approximately $19 million of indebtedness repaid in connection with the transaction, approximately $16 million was held by Richard and Jeffrey Feinstein and approximately $3 million was held by Leonard Feinstein.  Richard and Jeffrey Feinstein, and Leonard Feinstein and his wife, have provided personal guaranties in respect of certain of Baby's leases.  In connection with this transaction, the sellers negotiated to have the Company, as sole and controlling owner of Baby, assume these obligations. Therefore, under the terms of the purchase agreement, the Company has agreed to offer the landlords under these leases substitute guaranties from the Company on substantively the same terms as the existing personal guaranties, and to indemnify such guarantors against liability under the guaranties if the substitute guaranties are not accepted by the landlords.  The landlord of one of the Baby stores is an entity owned by the families of Richard and Jeffrey Feinstein; in connection with the transaction, the lease for that store was amended to make its terms more consistent with the Company's standard lease terms.

UNION, New Jersey, January 3, 2008 --- today reported net earnings of $.52 per diluted share ($138.2 million) in the fiscal third quarter ended December 1, 2007, compared with net earnings of $.50 per diluted share ($142.4 million) in the same quarter a year ago.  Net earnings in this year's third quarter included a net $8.0 million benefit due to the favorable resolution of discrete tax items required to be recorded in the quarter.  Net sales for the fiscal third quarter of 2007 were approximately $1.795 billion, an increase of approximately 10.8% from net sales of approximately $1.619 billion reported in the fiscal third quarter of 2006.  Comparable store sales in the fiscal third quarter of 2007 grew by approximately 0.8%, compared with an increase of approximately 4.6% in last year's fiscal third quarter.
Bed Bath & Beyond Inc.
 
During the fiscal third quarter of 2007, the Company repurchased approximately 3.2 million shares of its common stock for an aggregate cost of approximately $103 million. Through December 1, 2007, including repurchases made during its fiscal third quarter, the Company repurchased approximately 24.5 million shares, for an aggregate cost of approximately $929 million, under the $1 billion share repurchase program authorized in December 2006.
 
For the fiscal nine months ended December 1, 2007, the Company reported net earnings of $1.44 per diluted share ($389.9 million), compared with net earnings of $1.36 per diluted share ($388.4 million) in the corresponding period a year ago.  Net sales for the fiscal nine months of 2007 were approximately $5.116 billion, an increase of approximately 10.7% from net sales of approximately $4.622 billion reported in the corresponding period a year ago.  Comparable store sales for the fiscal nine months increased by approximately 1.5%, compared with an increase of approximately 4.8% in last year's fiscal nine months.
 
For the fiscal fourth quarter of 2007, ending March 1, 2008, the Company estimates it will earn approximately $.64 to $.67 per diluted share based, in part, upon a projected flat comparable store sales percentage for the quarter.

Item 8.01               Other Events
 
Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (the "Company") is filing this Current Report on Form 8-K in connection with recent developments regarding the auction rate securities market. The Company currently has investments totaling approximately $326 million in auction rate securities. All of these investments carry triple-A credit ratings from one or more of the major credit rating agencies.  Approximately $283 million of these securities are invested in preferred shares of closed end municipal bond funds, which are required, pursuant to the Investment Company Act of 1940, to maintain minimum asset coverage ratios of 200%. The remaining approximate $43 million are invested in securities collateralized by student loans which are currently more than 100% collateralized and with approximately 90% of such collateral in the aggregate being guaranteed by the United States government. None of the auction rate securities held by the Company are mortgage-backed debt obligations. The Company, which also currently has approximately $250 million in U.S. Treasury money market funds and no bank debt, does not anticipate that any potential lack of liquidity in its auction rate securities, even for an extended period of time, will affect its ability to finance its operations, including its expansion program and planned capital expenditures.
 
The Company's auction rate securities carry interest rates that reset periodically, every 7, 28 or 35 days, through an auction process. Due to current market conditions, the auction process for the Company's auction rate securities has recently failed.  These failed auctions result in a lack of liquidity in the security but do not affect the value of the underlying collateral of the security.  Upon the auction failures of the securities held by the Company, the interest rates reset based on a predetermined maximum contractual rate, which is nominally higher than the interest rates earned prior to auction failures. The Company continues to earn and receive interest on these securities. The Company's auction rate securities will continue to be presented for auction every 7, 28 or 35 days until the auction succeeds, the issuer calls the security, or they mature, as in the case of securities collateralized by student loans.
 
The Company is in the process of determining the fair market value of these securities as of March 1, 2008, the end of its fiscal year, but currently believes that an impairment, if any, would be temporary and would not result in a charge to its fiscal 2007 earnings.  Further, based on the current lack of liquidity related to these investments, the Company may reclassify all or a portion of its auction rate securities from current assets to long-term assets in its consolidated balance sheet as of March 1, 2008.
 
This Form 8-K may contain forward-looking statements.  Many of these forward-looking statements can be identified by use of words such as may, will, expect, anticipate, estimate, assume, continue, project, plan, and similar words and phrases.  The Company's actual results and future financial condition may differ materially from those expressed in any such forward-looking statements as a result of many factors that may be outside the Company's control.  Such factors include, without limitation: changes in the retailing environment and consumer preferences and spending habits; demographics and other macroeconomic factors that may impact the level of spending for the types of merchandise sold by the Company; general economic conditions; unusual weather patterns; competition from existing and potential competitors; competition from other channels of distribution; pricing pressures; the cost of labor, merchandise and other costs and expenses; the ability to find suitable locations at acceptable occupancy costs to support the Company's expansion program; the impact of failed auctions for auction rate securities held by the Company; and matters arising out of or related to the Company's stock option grants and procedures and related matters, including the outcome of the informal inquiry commenced by the SEC, the possibility that the SEC may not agree with all of the special committee's findings and recommendations and may require additional or different remediation, any other proceedings which may be brought against the Company by the SEC or other governmental agencies, any tax implications relating to the Company's stock option grants, the outcome of the shareholder derivative actions filed against certain of the Company's officers and directors, and the possibility of other private litigation relating to such stock option grants and related matters. The Company does not undertake any obligation to update its forward-looking statements.

BED BATH & BEYOND INC. REPORTS RESULTS
FOR FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 1, 2008
 
                 
Earnings per Diluted Share of $.66 for Q4; $2.10 for Full Year
                 
Quarterly Comparable Store Sales Decrease by 0.4%
                 
Estimates Fiscal 2008 Earnings per Diluted Share Decline of Low Double Digit to Mid Teens Percentage from Fiscal 2007
                 
Estimates Fiscal First Quarter 2008 Earnings of Approximately $.26 to $.30 per Diluted Share
 
 
 
UNION, New Jersey, April 9, 2008 --- today reported net earnings of $.66 per diluted share ($172.9 million) in the fiscal fourth quarter (thirteen weeks) ended March 1, 2008.  Net earnings for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2006 (fourteen weeks) were $.72 per diluted share ($205.8 million), which included an additional week and reflected a non-recurring charge of approximately $.07 per diluted share.
Bed Bath & Beyond Inc.
 
Net sales for the fiscal fourth quarter (thirteen weeks) were approximately $1.933 billion, a decrease of approximately 3.1% from the fiscal fourth quarter (fourteen weeks) of 2006.  Sales for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2007 were impacted by there being one less week in the period and by the fact that the week after Thanksgiving fell in the fiscal third quarter compared to falling in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2006.  Comparable store sales for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2007 decreased by approximately 0.4% compared with an increase of approximately 5.2% in last year's fiscal fourth quarter. 
Comparable store sales percentages are calculated based on an equivalent number of weeks for each quarter.
 
Net earnings for the fiscal year (fifty-two weeks) ended March 1, 2008 were $2.10 per diluted share ($562.8 million), compared with net earnings per diluted share of $2.09 ($594.2 million) a year ago, which was a fifty-three week year and included the aforementioned non-recurring charge of approximately $.07 per diluted share.
 
Net sales for fiscal 2007 (fifty-two weeks), were approximately $7.049 billion, an increase of approximately 6.5% from the prior fiscal year (fifty-three weeks).  Comparable store sales for fiscal 2007 increased by approximately 1.0% compared with an increase of approximately 4.9% in fiscal 2006.  Comparable store sales percentages are calculated based on an equivalent number of weeks for each annual period.
 
During the fiscal fourth quarter of 2007, the Company repurchased approximately 3.6 million shares of its common stock for an aggregate cost of approximately $102 million. This included the completion of the $1 billion share repurchase program authorized in 2006.  As of March 1, 2008, the balance remaining of the share repurchase program authorized in September 2007 was approximately $967 million dollars.
 
Assuming no significant change in the macroeconomic environment, the Company estimates that its fiscal 2008 earnings per diluted share will decline from a low double digit percentage to a mid teens percentage from the $2.10 per diluted share reported for fiscal 2007. This estimate is based, in part, upon the assumption that the comparable store sales for all of fiscal 2008 will be relatively flat to slightly negative.  For the fiscal first quarter, the Company estimates earnings to be approximately $.26 to $.30 per diluted share.
 
 
 
 
As of March 1, 2008, the Company operated a total of 971 stores, including 881 stores (22 of which were opened during the fiscal fourth quarter, including the Company's first store in Canada), in 49 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Canada.  In addition, as of March 1, 2008 operated 41 stores, operated 9 stores, and 40 stores operated under the names of and .  Consolidated store space as of March 1, 2008 was approximately 30.2 million square feet.

Exhibit 99.1
 
BED BATH & BEYOND INC. PRESENTLY ESTIMATES NET EARNINGS OF
APPROXIMATELY $.31 TO $.35 PER DILUTED SHARE
FOR FISCAL THIRD QUARTER ENDED NOVEMBER 29, 2008
 
UNION, New Jersey, December 2, 2008  today announced that it is presently estimating net earnings for the fiscal third quarter ended November 29, 2008 of approximately $.31 to $.35 per diluted share.

The Company's comparable store sales for the quarter are estimated to have declined by approximately 5.6% as compared with previous guidance of a relatively flat to low single digit decline.
Bed Bath & Beyond Inc.
 
Steven H. Temares, Chief Executive Officer and Member of the Board of Directors of stated, "The overall macroeconomic climate remains challenging, which, combined with liquidation sales of a major competitor, negatively impacted our fiscal third quarter. We continue to focus on our customers and in doing so, seek to further distance ourselves from our competitors.  We also will continue to base our actions on what is prudent under current circumstances and what is in the best long-term interests of our Company, our customers and our shareholders."
Bed Bath & Beyond Inc.
 
The Company expects to report its actual results for the fiscal third quarter after the close of trading on Wednesday, January 7, 2009, and will update guidance for the fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2008 during its conference call scheduled for 5:00 PM (EST) on that date.  Due to the Thanksgiving holiday occurring one week later this year than last year, the fiscal third quarter sales comparisons had a slight adverse impact.  The fiscal fourth quarter sales comparisons are expected to have a slight benefit due to two additional pre-Christmas shopping days in the fiscal fourth quarter versus last year.  The Company does not undertake any obligation to update its forward-looking statements or make "pre-announcements" such as that contained in this press release.

Finally, on April 7, 2009, the Company appointed Susan E. Lattmann (41), Vice President-Finance, to serve as principal accounting officer for SEC reporting purposes, replacing

The information set forth under Item 8.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K relating to the Policy (as defined therein) is hereby incorporated in this Item 5.02 by reference.
 
Item 5.03
      
Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
 
The information relating to amendments to the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended By-laws set forth under Item 8.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is hereby incorporated in this Item 5.03 by reference.
 
Item 8.01       Other Events.
 
On April 7, 2009, the Board, upon the recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, took the following actions:
 
Majority Voting for the Election of Directors in Non-Contested Elections and Director Resignation Policy.
 
The Board adopted a resolution approving proposed amendments to the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the "Certificate of Incorporation") and Amended By-laws (the "By-laws") that would specify that director nominees in a non-contested election would be elected by a majority vote.  Under Article SEVENTH of the Certificate of Incorporation, as amended by the certificate of amendment of the Certificate of Incorporation (the "Certificate of Amendment") and Article III, Section 13 of the By-laws, each vote would be specifically counted "for" or "against" the director's election.  An affirmative majority of the total number of votes cast "for" a director nominee would be required for election.  Shareholders would also be entitled to abstain with respect to the election of a director.  In accordance with New York law, abstentions would have no effect in determining whether the required affirmative majority vote has been obtained.  Director nominees in contested elections would continue to be elected by plurality vote.  An election is considered contested if there are more nominees for election than positions on the Board to be filled.
 
The Board also approved and adopted as an amendment to the By-laws in Article III, Section 14 thereof a director resignation policy consistent with the majority vote standard, so that an incumbent director who did not receive the requisite affirmative majority of the votes cast for his or her re-election would be required to
 
immediately tender his or her resignation to the Board.  The Board then will decide, through a process managed by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and excluding the nominee in question, whether to accept the resignation.  In making its decision, the Board may consider any factors or information that it considers appropriate or relevant.  The Board's explanation of its decision would be promptly disclosed in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  The decision of the Board and such disclosure shall be completed within 90 days from the date of the certification of the election results.
 
The proposed amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation will be submitted to the Company's shareholders for approval at the 2009 Annual Meeting, with the Board's recommendation that it be approved.
 
If approved by the Company's shareholders at the 2009 Annual Meeting, the amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation will become effective upon the filing with the New York Department of State of the Certificate of Amendment.  The Company would make such a filing promptly after the 2009 Annual Meeting.  The corresponding amendments to the By-laws will be effective as of the date of the filing with the New York Department of State of the Certificate of Amendment.
 
The foregoing description of the Certificate of Amendment and By-laws is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Certificate of Amendment attached hereto as Exhibit 3.1 and an annotated version of the By-laws attached hereto as Exhibit 3.2, each of which is incorporated herein by reference.
 
Elimination of Supermajority Voting Provisions.
 
The Board adopted a resolution approving proposed amendments to the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws that would eliminate the supermajority vote requirements contained in Article SEVENTH of the Certificate of Incorporation and Article VII, Section 4 of the By-laws, which currently provide that shareholders may amend certain provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws related to the Board and meetings of shareholders by the vote of 80% of voting power of all the then outstanding shares of voting stock of the Company entitled to vote at an election of directors, voting together as a single class.
 
In addition, because the New York Business Corporation Law specifies that a vote of two-thirds of the outstanding shares entitled to vote thereon is required for certain matters unless a company's certificate of incorporation specifically provides that such matters shall be approved by the vote of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote thereon, the Certificate of Amendment would add a new Article to the Certificate of Incorporation providing that the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote thereon would be required to (i) adopt a plan of merger or consolidation, (ii) approve the sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, (iii) approve a share exchange, or (iv) dissolve the Company.
 
The proposed amendments to the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws will be submitted to the Company's shareholders for approval at the 2009 Annual Meeting, with the Board's recommendation that they be approved.
 
If approved by the shareholders at the 2009 Annual Meeting, the amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation will become effective upon the filing with the New York Department of State of the Certificate of Amendment.  The Company would make such a filing promptly after the 2009 Annual Meeting.  The corresponding amendments to the By-laws will be effective as of the date of the filing with the New York Department of State of the Certificate of Amendment.
 
The foregoing description of the Certificate of Amendment and By-laws is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Certificate of Amendment attached hereto as Exhibit 3.1 and an annotated version of the By-laws attached hereto as Exhibit 3.2, each of which is incorporated herein by reference.
 
Shareholder-Called Special Meetings.
 
The Board adopted and approved amendments to Article II, Section 3 of the By-laws to provide that, subject to certain requirements and limitations set forth therein, a special meeting of the Company's shareholders
 
may be called upon written request by the record holders of at least 50% of the voting power of the outstanding shares of the Company.
 
The foregoing amendment to the By-laws will be effective immediately after the date of the 2009 Annual Meeting.
 
The foregoing description of the By-laws is qualified in its entirety by reference to an annotated version of the By-laws attached hereto as Exhibit 3.2 and incorporated herein by reference.
 
Advance Notice By-law.
 
The Board adopted and approved amendments to Article II, Section 10 of the By-laws relating to the advance notice provisions for shareholder proposals and director nominations to ensure such provisions are clear and unambiguous in light of recent Delaware case law developments.  Specifically, among others, the By-laws include the following revisions: (i) clarify that the requirements set forth in Article II, Section 10 apply to all shareholder proposals and director nominations by shareholders and are the exclusive means for shareholders to submit such matters, other than proposals governed by Rule 14a-8 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (which provides certain procedural requirements); (ii) require shareholders to disclose all ownership interests in the Company, including, among other things, all ownership interests, short interests, economic incentives and rights to vote any shares of any security of the Company, in light of increased use by investors of derivative instruments that are not reflected in an investor's beneficial ownership of the Company's securities; and (iii) require shareholders nominating directors to disclose the same information about a proposed director nominee that would be required if the director nominee were submitting a proposal and any material relationships between the shareholder proponents and their affiliates, on the one hand, and the director nominees and their affiliates, on the other hand.
 
The foregoing amendments to the By-laws will be effective immediately after the date of the 2009 Annual Meeting.
 
The foregoing description of the By-laws is qualified in its entirety by reference to an annotated version of the By-laws attached hereto as Exhibit 3.2 and incorporated herein by reference.
 
Additional By-law Amendments.
 
In addition to the amendments to the By-laws described above, the amendments to the By-laws adopted and approved by the Board include certain changes to clarify language and make various technical corrections and non-substantive changes, including, among others, a correction to Article III, Section 17, which provides that newly created directorships resulting from an increase in the number of directors and vacancies occurring in the Board for any reason shall be filled by a majority of directors then in office.
 
The foregoing amendments to the By-laws will be effective immediately after the date of the 2009 Annual Meeting.
 
The foregoing description of the By-laws is qualified in its entirety by reference to an annotated version of the By-laws attached hereto as Exhibit 3.2 and incorporated herein by reference.
 
Adoption of Clawback Policy and Amendment of Corporate Governance Guidelines.
 
The Board adopted a clawback policy (the "Policy") applicable to the Company's Named Executive Officers (as defined under Item 402(a)(3) of SEC Regulation S-K, currently the Company's co-chairs, chief executive officer, president and chief financial officer).  The Policy provides that, the Company will, to the extent permitted by applicable law, seek reimbursement with respect to incentive compensation paid or awarded to a Named Executive Officer after February 28, 2009 where (i) the payment or award (or the vesting of such award) was predicated upon the achievement of financial results, which financial results were the product of fraudulent activity or that were subsequently the subject of a material negative restatement, (ii) in the Board's view such executive engaged in fraud or conduct known by the executive to be in violation of SEC rules and regulations or
 
Company policy that caused or that otherwise makes such executive personally responsible for the fraudulent activity or the need for the restatement, and (iii) a lower payment or award would have been made to such executive (or lesser or no vesting would have occurred with respect to such award) based upon the restated financial results or the financial results that would have pertained absent such fraudulent activity.  In each such instance, the Board will seek to recover such portion of such executive's incentive compensation for the relevant period as the Board deems appropriate after a review of any factors or information it considers appropriate or relevant.
 
Where incentive compensation covered by the Policy consists of an equity award, including circumstances where vesting with respect to such equity award is predicated on the achievement of financial results as aforesaid, the Board shall take such action as it deems appropriate consistent with the foregoing principles, including, where appropriate, seeking to the extent described above the cancellation of stock or option awards or reimbursement of gains realized on the exercise of stock options or the sale of shares.
 
The Board also amended the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines (the "Guidelines") to, among other things, add the Policy to the Guidelines.  The Guidelines are available on the Company's website at www.bedbathandbeyond.com.
 
Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation
.
 
The Company anticipates that non-binding advisory votes on compensation practices, commonly referred to as "say-on-pay," may in the future be mandated by law, in which case the Company will comply with such requirements.
 
In any event, if no such advisory vote is required by law at the time of the Company's 2011 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, the Board has approved in principle that, effective with the Company's 2011 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, the Company will implement a non-binding, advisory vote by the Company's shareholders on the Compensation Committee's compensation philosophy, policies and procedures for the Company's named executive officers.

A "" means that the number of shares properly voted "for" a director exceeds the number of votes "withheld" or cast "against" that director at a meeting of shareholders, whether in person or by proxy, and abstentions and broker non-votes shall not constitute votes cast or votes withheld, and (ii) all other corporate action shall be the affirmative vote of  a majority of the votes properly cast at a meeting of shareholders, whether in person or by proxy.

Voting
majority of votes cast
 
.  As a condition for nomination as a director, any nominee who is an incumbent director shall agree to submit a letter of resignation from the Board of Directors in the event the director fails to receive a majority of votes cast (as defined in Section 13 above) in an uncontested election.  An incumbent nominee who does not receive a majority of the votes cast shall immediately tender his or her resignation, and the Board of Directors shall decide, through a process managed by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee (excluding from such process the nominee in question), whether to accept the resignation.  Prior to making the decision whether to accept any such resignation, the Board of Directors will afford the nominee an opportunity to provide any information or statement that he or she deems relevant.  If any tendered resignation is accepted, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee shall recommend to the Board of Directors whether to fill such vacancy or vacancies or to reduce the size of the Board of Directors.  The Board of Directors in making its decision may consider any factors or information that it considers appropriate or relevant.  The Board of Director's explanation of its decision shall be promptly disclosed in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  The decision of the Board of Directors and such disclosure shall be completed within ninety (90) days from the date of the certification of the election results.  If a majority of the members of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee received a greater number of votes "withheld" from their election or cast "against" such members than votes "for" their election at the same election, then the remaining directors who are on the Board of Directors and who did not receive a greater number of votes "withheld" from their election or cast "against" such directors than votes "for" their election would consider the matter directly or may appoint a committee of the Board of Directors among themselves solely for the purpose of considering the tendered resignations that would make the recommendation to the Board of Directors whether to accept or reject them.

Item 5.03
      
Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
 
At the 2009 Annual Meeting of Shareholders of Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (the "Company") held on June 30, 2009, the shareholders of the Company approved the Company's proposals to approve the following amendments to the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the "Certificate of Incorporation") and Amended By-laws (the "By-laws"): (i) adopting majority voting for the election of directors in non-contested elections; (ii) eliminating supermajority voting provisions; and (iii) adding a new article to the Certificate of Incorporation eliminating statutory supermajority voting requirements.
 
Under Article SEVENTH of the Certificate of Incorporation, as amended by the certificate of amendment of the Certificate of Incorporation (the "Certificate of Amendment") and Article III, Section 13 of the By-laws, each vote will be specifically counted "for" or "against" the director's election.  An affirmative majority of the total number of votes cast "for" a director nominee will be required for election.  Shareholders will also be entitled to abstain with respect to the election of a director.  In accordance with New York law, abstentions would have no effect in determining whether the required affirmative majority vote has been obtained.  Director nominees in contested elections will continue to be elected by plurality vote.  An election is considered contested if there are more nominees for election than positions on the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") to be filled.
 
In connection with the filing of the Certificate of Amendment with the New York Department of State, effective as of June 30, 2009, Article III, Section 14 of the By-laws has been amended to provide for a director resignation policy consistent with the majority vote standard, so that an incumbent director who did not receive the requisite affirmative majority of the votes cast for his or her re-election would be required to immediately tender his or her resignation to the Board.  The Board then will decide, through a process managed by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and excluding the nominee in question, whether to accept the resignation.  In making its decision, the Board may consider any factors or information that it considers appropriate or relevant.  The Board's explanation of its decision would be promptly disclosed in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  The decision of the Board and such disclosure shall be completed within 90 days from the date of the certification of the election results.
 
The Certificate of Amendment and related amendments to the By-laws also eliminate the supermajority vote requirements contained in Article SEVENTH of the Certificate of Incorporation and Article VII, Section 4 of the By-laws, which provided that shareholders may amend certain provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws related to the Board and meetings of shareholders by the vote of 80% of voting power of all the then outstanding shares of voting stock of the Company entitled to vote at an election of directors, voting together as a single class, so that all such amendments, including those related to the Board of Directors and meetings of shareholders, will only require the vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote thereon, rather than the vote of the holders of 80% of such shares.
 
In addition, because the New York Business Corporation Law specifies that a vote of two-thirds of the outstanding shares entitled to vote thereon is required for certain matters unless a company's certificate of incorporation specifically provides that such matters shall be approved by the vote of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote thereon, the Certificate of Amendment adds a new Article to the Certificate of Incorporation providing that the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote thereon would be required to (i) adopt a plan of merger or consolidation, (ii) approve the sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, (iii) approve a share exchange, or (iv) dissolve the Company.
 
In addition, on June 30, 2009, the Board adopted amendments to Article V of the By-laws to provide that the Company shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, indemnify any person made, or threatened to be made, a party to an action or proceeding by reason of the fact that he or she, or his or her testator or intestate, is or was a director or officer of the Company, or serves or served another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise at the request of the Company in any capacity, against judgments, fines, amounts paid in settlement and reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees incurred as a result of such action or proceeding, or any appeal therein; provided that to the extent prohibited by applicable law no indemnification may be made to or on behalf of any director or officer if a judgment or other final adjudication adverse to the director or officer establishes that his or her acts were committed in bad faith or were the result of active and deliberate dishonesty and were material to the cause of action so adjudicated, or that he or she personally
gained in fact a financial profit or other advantage to which he or she was not legally entitled.  The By-laws previously provided that the Company shall indemnify directors, and may indemnify officers, for such costs and expenses.
 
See the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company on April 9, 2009 for a description of the additional amendments to the By-laws previously adopted by the Board which became effective as of June 30, 2009.
 
The foregoing description of the Certificate of Amendment and By-laws is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Certificate of Amendment attached hereto as Exhibit 3.1 and the By-laws attached hereto as Exhibit 3.2, each of which is incorporated herein by reference.

Exhibit 3.1
It is certified that:
 
1.  The name of the corporation (hereinafter called the "Corporation") is BED BATH & BEYOND INC.  The name under which the Corporation was originally formed is B & B TEXTILE CORPORATION.
 
2.  The original Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation was filed by the Department of State of the State of New York on October 5, 1971.
 
3.  The Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation is hereby amended by striking out Article SEVENTH which relates to the election and service term of the Board of Directors and the voting rights of the Board of Directors and shareholders of the Corporation, and substituting in lieu of said Article the following new Article SEVENTH:
 
"SEVENTH:  (a) The number of directors comprising the entire Board of Directors shall be fixed from time to time in accordance with the specific provisions of the By-laws of the Corporation.
 
(b)  At each annual meeting of shareholders, directors shall be elected to hold office until the next annual meeting and until his or her successor is elected and qualified.
 
(c)  The vote required for the election of directors by the shareholders shall be the affirmative vote of a "majority of votes cast" (as defined herein), unless the election is contested, in which case directors shall be elected by a plurality of votes cast.  An election shall be contested if, as of the record date (or such later date as may be determined by the Board of Directors based on events occurring after the record date, but in no event later than the date the Corporation files its definitive proxy statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission), the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected.   A "majority of votes cast" means that the number of shares voted "for" a director exceeds the number of votes "withheld" or cast "against" that director.  Abstentions and broker non-votes shall not constitute votes cast or votes withheld."
 
4.  The Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation is hereby amended by adding the following new Article EIGHTH which relates to the vote required for shareholder approval to adopt a plan of merger or consolidation in accordance with Section 903 of the Business Corporation Law of the State of New York (the "Business Corporation Law"), the sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all of the Corporation's assets in accordance with Section 909 of the Business Corporation Law, a share exchange in accordance with Section 913 of the Business Corporation Law or a dissolution in accordance with Section 1001 of the Business Corporation Law:
 
"EIGHTH:  The affirmative vote of the shareholders entitled to cast a majority of the votes entitled to be cast shall be required to (i) adopt a plan of merger or consolidation in accordance with Section 903 of the Business Corporation Law, (ii) approve the sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation in accordance with Section 909 of the Business Corporation Law, (iii) approve a share exchange in accordance with Section 913 of the Business Corporation Law, (iv) dissolve in accordance with Section 1001 of the Business Corporation Law, or (v) act under any successor provision to the foregoing provisions of the Business Corporation Law."
 
5.  The amendment of the Certificate of Incorporation herein certified was authorized first by vote of the Board of Directors of the Corporation and then by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80% of voting power of all of the outstanding shares of voting stock of the Corporation entitled to vote at an election of directors.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned has signed this Certificate of Amendment this 30th day of June, 2009.

Such statement or statements shall reasonably evidence the expenses incurred by the Indemnitee and, if required by law at the time of such advance, shall include or be accompanied by an undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnitee to repay the amounts advanced if ultimately it should be determined that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified against such expenses pursuant to this Article V.  The sole requirements for qualification by an Indemnitee for such advances shall be delivery of the statement and undertaking described above.

Procedure for Determination of Entitlement to Indemnification
.
 
(i)
           
To obtain indemnification under this Article V, an Indemnitee shall submit to the Secretary of the Corporation a written request, including such documentation and information as is reasonably available to the Indemnitee and reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification (the "").  The determination of the Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification shall be made not later than sixty (60) days after receipt by the Corporation of the written request for indemnification together with the Supporting Documentation.  The Secretary shall, promptly upon receipt of such a request for indemnification, advise the Board of Directors in writing that the Indemnitee has requested indemnification.
Supporting Documentation
 
(ii)
          
The Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification under this Article V shall be determined in one of the following ways:  (A) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, if a Change in Control has occurred and the Indemnitee so requests, by Independent Counsel in a written opinion to the Board, a copy of which shall be delivered to the Indemnitee; (B) if and to the extent applicable law does not permit a determination to be made by Independent Counsel, and, in any event, if a Change in Control has not occurred (or if a Change in Control has occurred but the Indemnitee does not request that the determination be made by Independent Counsel), (x) by the Board acting by a quorum consisting of Disinterested Directors, or (y) if a quorum under clause (x) above is not obtainable or, even if obtainable, a quorum of Disinterested Directors so directs: (I) by the Board upon the opinion in writing of Independent Counsel (a copy of which shall be delivered to the Indemnitee), or (II) by the shareholders of the Corporation; or (C) as provided in Section 4(c) of this Article V.
 
(iii)
         
In the event the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by Independent Counsel pursuant to Section 4(b)(ii) of this Article V, a majority of the Disinterested Directors shall select the Independent Counsel, but only an Independent Counsel to which the Indemnitee does not reasonably object; , , that if a Change in Control shall have occurred, the Indemnitee shall select such Independent Counsel, but only an Independent Counsel to which a majority of the Disinterested Directors does not reasonably object.

(c)
          
Presumptions and Effect of Certain Proceedings
.  Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Article V, if a Change in Control shall have occurred, the Indemnitee shall be presumed to be entitled to indemnification under this Article V (with respect to actions or
 
omissions occurring prior to such Change in Control) upon submission of a request for indemnification together with the Supporting Documentation in accordance with Section 4(b)(i) of this Article V, and thereafter the Corporation shall have the burden of proof to overcome that presumption in reaching a contrary determination.  In any event, if the person or persons empowered under Section 4(b) of this Article V to determine entitlement to indemnification shall not have been appointed or shall not have made a determination within sixty (60) days after receipt by the Corporation of the request therefor, together with the Supporting Documentation, the Indemnitee shall be deemed to be, and shall be, entitled to indemnification unless (A) the Indemnitee misrepresented or failed to disclose a material fact in making the request for indemnification or in the Supporting Documentation or (B) such indemnification is prohibited by law.  The termination of any Proceeding described in Section 1 of this Article V, or of any claim, issue or matter therein, by judgment, order, settlement or conviction, or upon a plea of or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, adversely affect the right of the Indemnitee to indemnification or create a presumption that the Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner which the Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation or, with respect to any criminal proceeding, that the Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe that such conduct was unlawful.

Item 1.01
  
Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On November 16, 2009, Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (the "Company") entered into an amendment and restatement of its Supplemental Executive Retirement Benefit agreement, dated January 11, 2006, with Mr. Steven H. Temares, the Company's Chief Executive Officer (the "SERP"), and a related escrow agreement (with the amendment and restatement and the related escrow agreement being hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Amendment").
 
The Amendment was entered into principally to address the requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code.  Under the SERP as previously in effect, in the event of a voluntary termination of employment by Mr. Temares after the twentieth anniversary of Mr. Temares' employment with the Company (June 12, 2012), Mr. Temares would have, in general, been entitled to receive in each year over a 10-year period an amount equal to 50% of his annual base salary, payable in accordance with the Company's normal payroll practices.  Under the Amendment, the Company would instead, six months after Mr. Temares' voluntary termination, pay to Mr. Temares an amount equal to 1/10 of the present value of the installment payments described above, and pay into escrow 9/10 of such present value, in each case, net of all taxes required to be withheld as a result of the payment (including federal and state income taxes and all other applicable withholdings), with, in general, the amount in escrow being paid to Mr. Temares in equal installments on the first 9 anniversaries of the payment into escrow.  Consistent with the SERP as previously in effect, payment of the escrow amount to Mr. Temares would be subject to acceleration upon Mr. Temares' death or a Change of Control of the Company (as defined in the SERP).  Under a separate agreement, Mr. Temares is subject to a non-competition restrictive covenant during the period of his employment with the Company and for one year thereafter.  Under the SERP as previously in effect, if Mr. Temares breaches the restrictive covenant (or engages in activities after the one-year non-competition period that would have constituted a breach during the non-competition period), any future payments during the 10-year installment payment period would have been forfeited.  Under the Amendment, in the event of any such breach (or activities after the one-year non-competition period that would have constituted a breach during such period), any remaining amount in escrow would be forfeited by Mr. Temares and repaid to the Company.  Any such forfeiture would leave Mr. Temares in substantially the same position as he was under the SERP as previously in effect.  Because any amount deposited into escrow under the Amendment would be net of the taxes imposed on the payment into escrow (including any amounts which may be subsequently forfeited by Mr. Temares and repaid to the Company), any such forfeiture would likely not make the Company whole for the taxes previously paid with respect to the forfeited amounts.  Accordingly, under the Amendment, Mr. Temares has agreed that in the event any amount in escrow is forfeited, he will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a refund of applicable taxes and remit such refund to the Company and the Company has agreed to reimburse Mr. Temares, or to pay on his behalf, reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred in connection with such a refund request.
 
As noted above, the Amendment has been drafted to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations and guidance issued thereunder; however, in light of the complexities and uncertainties surrounding Section 409A, the Amendment also provides that Mr. Temares will be protected from any impact resulting from the possible application of Section 409A to the terms of the SERP such that Mr. Temares will be entitled to a payment that places him in that same economic position he would have been in under the SERP prior to the application of Section 409A.
 
The foregoing description of the Amendment is a summary only, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2, respectively, to this Current Report on Form 8-K, which are incorporated herein by reference.

November 16, 2009
 
Mr. Steven H. Temares
Chief Executive Officer
Bed Bath & Beyond Inc.
650 Liberty Avenue
Union, New Jersey 07083
 
 
Dear Mr. Temares:
 
This letter agreement (the "Agreement") amends and restates in its entirety, and supersedes, the prior agreement, dated January 11, 2006, which set forth the terms and conditions of the supplemental retirement benefit payable to you or on your behalf by Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (the "Company").  This Agreement is effective as of January 11, 2006.
 
1.
            
If you remain employed by the Company on and through June 12, 2012 (, the twentieth anniversary of the date of your commencement of employment with the Company) or the earlier occurrence of a Change of Control of the Company (as such term is defined in Section 2(d) below) (the earliest of such dates being herein referred to as the "Vesting Date"), you will be entitled to receive a supplemental retirement benefit (the "Retirement Benefit") upon your retirement or other separation from service from the Company within the meaning of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended and the applicable regulations thereunder ("Section 409A") (a "Separation from Service"), subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.  The Retirement Benefit shall be payable in the form of a lump sum equal to the present value of an annual amount equal to 50% of your annual base salary rate on the date of your Separation from Service if such annual amount were paid to you for a period of 10 years following your Separation from Service in accordance with the Company's normal payroll practices.  This lump sum shall be calculated using as the discount rate the monthly Applicable Federal Rate for short-term Treasury obligations as published by the Internal Revenue Service for the month in which your Separation from Service occurs.  (See example set forth in Exhibit A hereto).  You may, at any time after the Vesting Date, upon at least 90 days' prior written notice given to the Company, elect to retire from the Company or otherwise incur a voluntary Separation from Service (except with respect to terminations under Section 2(a) hereof) and commence receipt of the Retirement Benefit.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, your Retirement Benefit shall be paid on the first business day following the six month anniversary of your Separation from Service and shall be includible in your income for tax purposes at such time (regardless of whether a portion of such Retirement Benefit is deposited into an escrow account pursuant to the following sentence).  Except in the circumstances described in the following sentence, in the event you elect to retire or incur a voluntary Separation from Service after the Vesting Date, a portion of your Retirement Benefit, net of withholdings, will be deposited into an escrow account governed by the terms of a separate escrow agreement as described in a separate letter agreement being executed simultaneously
i.e.
 
herewith.  For the avoidance of doubt, no portion of your Retirement Benefit will be deposited into such escrow account in the event (a) you die, (b) your employment is terminated by the Company without Cause (as defined in your December 1, 1994 employment agreement with the Company, as amended from time to time (the "Employment Agreement")), (c) you incur a Separation from Service due to Disability (as defined in Section 2(b) hereof), or (d) you incur a Separation from Service within 12 months following a Change in Control (as defined in Section 2(d) hereof).
 
2.
            
(a) If your employment with the Company is terminated (i) prior to the Vesting Date by reason of your voluntary Separation from Service or (ii) prior to or on or after the Vesting Date by reason of your voluntary Separation from Service where Cause exists or by the Company for Cause, you will forfeit any right or entitlement to the Retirement Benefit.
 
(b) Notwithstanding the reference to the Vesting Date in Section 1 above, if your employment with the Company is terminated (i) by the Company without Cause, or (ii) by the Company due to your Disability (as defined below) (in the case of either (i) or (ii), whether prior to or on or after the Vesting Date), your Retirement Benefit will become payable in accordance with, and subject to, Section 1 above.  For purposes of this Agreement, "Disability" shall mean your inability to substantially perform your duties and responsibilities under the Employment Agreement for a period of 180 consecutive days as a result of physical or mental disability.
 
(c) Notwithstanding the reference to the Vesting Date in Section 1 above, if you die (whether prior to or on or after the Vesting Date), your Retirement Benefit will become payable in accordance with Section 1, except that the six month delay referred to in Section 1 shall not apply.  In such case, your Retirement Benefit shall be paid within 30 days following your death to the beneficiary(ies) you have designated pursuant to the beneficiary designation form provided to you by the Company or, if no beneficiary has been designated, to your estate.
 
(d) For purposes of this Agreement, a "Change of Control" shall mean the first to occur of the following:
 
(i) any "person," as such term is used in sections 3(a)(9) and 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), becomes a "beneficial owner," as such term is used in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act, of 50% or more of the outstanding common stock of the Company, excluding a person that is an affiliate (as such term is used under the Exchange Act) of the Company on the date of this Agreement, or any affiliate of any such person;
 
(ii) the majority of the board of directors of the Company (the "Board") consists of individuals other than "Incumbent Directors," which term means the members of the Board on the date of this Agreement; provided that any person becoming a director subsequent to such date whose election or nomination for election was supported by two-thirds of the directors who then comprised the Incumbent Directors shall be considered an Incumbent Director;
 
(iii) the Company adopts any plan of liquidation providing for the distribution of all or substantially all its assets;
 
(iv) all or substantially all the assets or business of the Company are disposed of pursuant to a merger, consolidation or other transaction (unless the shareholders of the Company immediately prior to such merger, consolidation or other transaction beneficially own, directly or indirectly, in substantially the same proportion as they own the common stock of the Company, all the common stock or other ownership interests of the entity or entities, if any, that succeed to the business of the Company); or
 
(v) the Company combines with another company and is the surviving corporation, but, immediately after the combination, the shareholders of the Company immediately prior to the combination hold, directly or indirectly, 50% or less of the common stock or other ownership interests of the combined company (there being excluded from the number of shares held by such shareholders, but not from the common stock or other ownership interests of the combined company, any shares or other ownership interests received by affiliates of such other company in exchange for stock of such other company).
 
3.
            
Any taxes required to be paid by you as a result of payments under this Agreement shall be for your account and the Company may withhold such taxes from any amounts due to you hereunder (including from any amounts to be paid into an escrow account pursuant to Section 1 above).
 
4.
            
Payment of the Retirement Benefit pursuant to this Agreement is contingent upon your compliance with the restrictive covenant not to compete with the Company described in Section 4 of your Employment Agreement, as modified by this Section 4 (the "Restrictive Covenant").  In the event that you breach the terms of the Restrictive Covenant prior to payment of the Retirement Benefit under this Agreement, such Retirement Benefit shall immediately be forfeited.  In the event that you breach the terms of the Restrictive Covenant following payment of the Retirement Benefit payable under this Agreement due to your retirement or other voluntary Separation from Service during the 10 year period following such retirement or other voluntary Separation from Service, the Company's rights shall be governed by the terms of a separate escrow agreement to be entered into between you and the Company and any portion of the Retirement Benefit remaining in the escrow account will be forfeited.  If, in accordance with the last sentence of Section 1 hereof, no portion of the Retirement Benefit is deposited into an escrow account, the Restrictive Covenant shall cease to apply solely with respect to the Retirement Benefit following your receipt of the Retirement Benefit.  Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to require compliance by you with the Restrictive Covenant beyond the period specified in Section 4 of your Employment Agreement; the only consequence of your breach of the Restrictive Covenant after the period specified in Section 4 of your Employment Agreement and before the tenth anniversary of your retirement or other voluntary Separation from Service is the forfeiture of payment in accordance with the terms of the separate escrow agreement.
 
5.
            
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Retirement Benefit will not be paid or made available under the preceding provisions of this Agreement (excluding Retirement Benefits paid as a result of death or Disability) unless you return to the Company a fully effective release no later than 8 days prior to the six month anniversary of your Separation from Service.  A release will be deemed fully effective only if: (a) provided in a form
 
reasonably prescribed by the Company; and (b) to the extent any portion of such release is subject to any revocation period prescribed by the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, as amended, or any other revocation period in effect on the date of your retirement under any federal, state or local law, such revocation period has expired without revocation of the release.
 
6.
            
This Agreement is an "unfunded" plan for purposes of providing retirement compensation.  With respect to any payments as to which you have a fixed and vested interest but that have not yet been made to you by the Company, nothing contained herein shall give you any rights that are greater than those of a general unsecured creditor of the Company.  The foregoing shall not apply to any amount deposited into an escrow account.
 
7.
            
Nothing contained in this Agreement shall limit your eligibility to participate in or receive benefits under any employee benefit plan sponsored or maintained by the Company; provided that the Retirement Benefit shall not be considered or included for purposes of calculating any benefit under any such employee benefit plan of the Company.
 
8.
            
This Agreement is not an agreement of employment.  This Agreement does not guarantee that the Company will continue to employ or retain you for any period of time, nor does it modify in any respect any of your or the Company's rights under your Employment Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect and unchanged by this Agreement.
 
9.
            
No rights or obligations of the Company under this Agreement may be assigned or transferred by the Company, except pursuant to a merger or consolidation, or the sale or liquidation of all or substantially all the assets of the Company, provided that, in the case of such a sale or liquidation, the assignee or transferee assumes in writing the obligation to perform this Agreement (it being understood, however, that no such assignment or transfer shall relieve the Company of its liabilities or obligations under this Agreement).
 
10.
          
(a) This Agreement is intended to comply with the applicable requirements of Section 409A and shall be limited, construed and interpreted in accordance with such intent.  To the extent that the Retirement Benefit is subject to Section 409A, it shall be paid in a manner that will comply with Section 409A and any other guidance issued by the Secretary of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service with respect thereto.
 
(b) In the event it is determined that the Retirement Benefit is subject to the interest and additional 20% tax imposed by Section 409A (the "Section 409A Taxes"), then you will be entitled to a payment from the Company in an amount that places you in the same after-tax economic position that you would have been in had the Retirement Benefit not been subject to the Section 409A Taxes.  In the event that the Retirement Benefit is subject to the Section 409A Taxes before the Retirement Benefit is paid to you or otherwise includible in your income, this payment will also include (i) any other income and employment taxes imposed on the Retirement Benefit and (ii) any income and employment taxes imposed as a result of the payment of the amounts in clause (i) and this clause (ii), provided that, if the Retirement Benefit is subsequently paid to you or deposited into an escrow account, the Retirement Benefit will then be reduced by the amount in clause (i).  In addition, the Company shall
 
reimburse you for or pay on your behalf all reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred by you in connection with any tax audit or proceeding involving the application of Section 409A to the Retirement Benefit.  The additional payment and any reimbursement or payment of expenses will be made to you or on your behalf promptly upon the determination that such a payment or reimbursement is due from the Company, but in no event later than 30 days following the date you remit the Section 409A Taxes to the Internal Revenue Service (or, if no amounts are remitted as a result of the tax audit or proceeding, then the expenses will be reimbursed to you or paid on your behalf no later than 30 days following the completion of the audit or reaching a final and non-appealable settlement or other resolution of the proceeding).
 
(c) Notwithstanding subsection (b) above, the Company will not be required to make any payments to you under subsection (b) above if, after the Company makes a reasonable request to you in writing, you fail to enter into an amendment to this Agreement if such amendment could reasonably be expected to result in the avoidance of the Retirement Benefit being subject to the Section 409A Taxes and such amendment has no more than an immaterial adverse affect on your rights hereunder.
 
11.
          
This Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended and other applicable federal law.  To the extent not preempted by or inconsistent with federal law, the laws of the state of New York shall apply.  If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, the invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision of this Agreement and the Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if the provision had not been included.
 
12.
          
This Agreement is intended to be a plan which is unfunded and maintained primarily for the purpose of providing deferred compensation for a select group of management or highly compensated employees within the meaning of Sections 201, 301 and 401 of ERISA, and therefore to be exempt from the provisions of Parts 2, 3 and 4 of Title I of ERISA.
 
13.
          
For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Company" shall include any and all successors and assignees, whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise, to all or substantially all the business or assets of the Company, and such successors and assignees shall perform the Company's obligations under this Agreement, in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform if no such succession or assignment had taken place.
 
14.
          
This Agreement sets forth all understandings with regard to your Retirement Benefit payable by the Company.  This Agreement has been presented to, and duly authorized by, the Compensation Committee of the Board.  It may not be amended or terminated without the written agreement of both parties hereto.
 
 
 
The Retirement Benefit is payable in the form of a lump sum equal to the present value of an annual amount equal to 50% of annual base salary rate on Separation from Service if paid over a period of 10 years in accordance with payroll practices, discounted using the Applicable Federal Rate for short-term Treasury obligations for the month in which the Separation from Service occurs.

Mr. Steven H. Temares
Chief Executive Officer
Bed Bath & Beyond Inc.
650 Liberty Avenue
Union, New Jersey 07083
 
 
Dear Mr. Temares:
 
As you know, the letter agreement between you and Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (the "Company"), originally effective as of January 11, 2006, which set forth the terms and conditions of your supplemental executive retirement benefit, is being amended and restated in its entirely effective as of January 11, 2006, as memorialized in the letter agreement dated November 16, 2009 (the "SERP").  Capitalized terms used in this letter will have the meanings set forth in the SERP.
 
In connection with the amendment and restatement of the SERP, your execution of this letter will evidence your agreement that should you become eligible to receive a distribution from the SERP due to your retirement or voluntary Separation from Service (a "Triggering Event"), your lump sum SERP distribution, less all applicable withholding taxes, will be paid on the first business day following the six month anniversary of the Triggering Event (the "First Payment Date") as follows: (a) 1/10 of the lump sum SERP distribution (net of applicable withholding taxes) will be distributed to you; and (b) 9/10 of the lump sum SERP distribution (net of applicable withholding taxes) will be deposited into an escrow account to be held by an escrow agent, which escrow agent will be mutually agreed upon by you and the Company (but which, in any event, shall be a bank or other financial institution having assets of at least $10 billion).  In the event of a distribution from the SERP due to your death, Disability, termination by the Company without Cause or Separation from Service within 12 months following a Change in Control, no escrow account will be established and you will be entitled to receive the SERP distribution in accordance with the terms of the SERP.
 
You agree that, no later than 120 days following a Triggering Event, you will enter into an escrow agreement by and among you, the Company and the escrow agent which will set forth the terms and conditions with respect to amounts held in the escrow account.  You further agree that the escrow agreement will contain the following terms:
 
1.
            
Amounts deposited and held in the escrow account will be distributed in 9 equal annual installments to be distributed on each of the 9 annual anniversaries of the First Payment Date.
 
2.
            
You will have the right to direct the investment of the funds in the escrow account from among the permitted investments which will be: (i) debt obligations of the U.S. government, (ii) short-term investment grade obligations of U.S. and foreign corporations, including commercial paper, certificates of deposit, notes, bonds, debentures, and (iii) pooled, commingled or mutual funds which invest solely in the above.
 
3.
            
Interest, dividends and other earnings on escrow account funds during the 12-month period between distribution dates will be distributed to you annually with each annual installment.  You will be responsible for the payment of any income or other taxes arising as a result of such distributions.  A net loss incurred by the escrow account during any such 12-month period will reduce the annual installment to be paid immediately following the conclusion of such 12-month period (and, if necessary, any subsequent installments).
 
4.
            
In the event of your death prior to payment of all 9 installments, the Company will direct the escrow agent to pay the remaining amount in the escrow account, including accrued investment earnings (such total amount the "Remaining Amount") to the beneficiary(ies) you have designated pursuant to the SERP (or, if you have not designated a beneficiary, to your estate) no later than 30 days after your death.
 
5.
            
In the event of a Change of Control of the Company that occurs on or after the deposit of the Retirement Benefit into the escrow account and prior to payment of all 9 installments, the Company will direct the escrow agent to pay the Remaining Amount to you simultaneously with the Change of Control, or as soon as possible thereafter, but in no event later than 30 days following the Change in Control.
 
6.
            
In the event you do not comply with the restrictive covenant not to compete with the Company (as described in Section 4 of your Employment Agreement, but for the term of the escrow agreement) (the "Restrictive Covenant") prior to the payment of the entire Remaining Amount from the escrow account, the Company will have the right (subject to the provisions of the escrow agreement) to direct the escrow agent to pay the Remaining Amount to the Company no later than 15 days after notice to the escrow agent and to you, and you will forfeit any and all rights to the Remaining Amount.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is specifically understood and agreed that following a Change in Control that occurs on or after the deposit of the Retirement Benefit into the escrow account, no forfeiture due to a violation of Restrictive Covenant shall occur, and the provisions of the Restrictive Covenant shall no longer be applicable solely with respect to the Retirement Benefit.  Nothing in the SERP or this letter shall be deemed to require compliance by you with the Restrictive Covenant beyond the period specified in Section 4 of your Employment Agreement; the only consequence of your breach of the Restrictive Covenant after the period specified in Section 4 of your Employment Agreement and before the payment to you of the entire Remaining Amount from the escrow account is the forfeiture of the Remaining Amount in accordance with the terms of the SERP and this letter.
 
7.
            
The Company will be responsible for payment of the escrow agent's annual fees.
 
You further agree that in the event you violate the Restrictive Covenant following the Triggering Event and prior to the payment of the entire Remaining Amount, you will use commercially reasonable efforts (taking into account applicable costs, fees and tax ramifications) to obtain a refund from the appropriate taxing authorities of the withholding taxes previously remitted on the portion of the Retirement Benefit forfeited by you under Section 6 above and, in the event any such amounts are refunded to you, you will promptly remit such refunded amounts to the Company (less any other income or other taxes, penalties or interest incurred by you solely as a result of any such refund).  Upon written notice given to you by the Company, you will, to the maximum extent permitted by law, assign to the Company the right to obtain such refund.  The Company shall promptly reimburse you for or pay on your behalf all reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred by
 
you in connection with any filings or proceedings to the extent attributable to such refund request within 60 days after such fees or expenses are incurred.  Such reimbursement right shall continue for your lifetime and the lifetime of your spouse as contemplated pursuant to the objectively and specifically prescribed period requirement of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(iv)(A)(2), and will not be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit.  The amount of such expenses reimbursed to you or paid on your behalf in any one calendar year will not affect the amount of such expenses eligible for reimbursement or payment in any other calendar year.
 
This Agreement sets forth all understandings with regard to the escrow account to be established to hold your SERP distribution in the event you retire or voluntarily incur a Separation from Service with the Company.  This Agreement may not be amended or terminated without the written agreement of both parties hereto.  This Agreement will be governed by the laws of the State of New York without giving effect to its conflict of laws principles.

  In the event of a change in control of the Company, the Company will have the discretion, without the Executive's consent, to pay the value of Executive's supplemental pension payments and/or severance benefits in a lump sum in accordance with the Treasury Regulations under Internal Revenue Code Section 409A.
 
All other terms and conditions of the employment agreements remain in effect.
 
(e)

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
Merger Agreemen
t
 
On May 8, 2012, Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (the "Company") entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") with Cost Plus, Inc., a California corporation ("Cost Plus"), and Blue Coral Acquisition Corp., a California corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company ("Merger Sub").
 
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, Merger Sub will commence a tender offer (the "Offer") within 15 business days of the execution of the Merger Agreement to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of Cost Plus ("Cost Plus Common Stock") at a purchase price of $22.00 per share, without interest, net to the holder in cash (the "Offer Price"), subject to any required withholding of taxes; and as soon as practicable after the consummation of the Offer and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into Cost Plus (the "Merger") and Cost Plus will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The Merger Agreement also provides that the Merger may be consummated regardless of whether the Offer is completed, but if the Offer is not completed, the Merger will only be able to be consummated after the shareholders of Cost Plus have adopted the Merger Agreement at a meeting of shareholders. In the Merger, each outstanding share of Cost Plus Common Stock, other than shares of Cost Plus Common Stock owned by the Company or Merger Sub or by shareholders who have validly exercised their dissenters' rights under California law, will be converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to the Offer Price.
 
The obligation of Merger Sub to purchase shares tendered in the Offer is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, including the expiration or termination of applicable waiting periods under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and other customary closing conditions. In addition, it is a condition to Merger Sub's obligation to purchase the shares tendered in the Offer that the number of the outstanding shares of Cost Plus Common Stock that have been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn, together with any shares of Cost Plus Common Stock then owned by the Company and its subsidiaries, equals at least one share of Cost Plus Common Stock more than 90% of Cost Plus Common Stock outstanding as of the expiration of the Offer (as adjusted by the number of shares issuable under Cost Plus stock plans and the Top-Up referred to below). In the event that this minimum tender condition is not met, and in certain other circumstances, the parties have agreed to complete the Merger without the prior completion of the Offer, after receipt of the approval of a majority of the Cost Plus shareholders for the adoption of the Merger Agreement. In that case, the consummation of the Merger would be subject to similar conditions as the Offer conditions, other than the addition of the shareholder approval requirement and the inapplicability of the minimum tender condition.
 
Cost Plus has also granted to Merger Sub an irrevocable right (the "Top-Up"), which Merger Sub shall be deemed to have exercised simultaneously with the consummation of the Offer, if necessary, to purchase from Cost Plus the number of shares of Cost Plus Common Stock that, when added to the shares of Cost Plus Common Stock already owned by the Company or any of its subsidiaries following consummation of the Offer, constitutes one share of Cost Plus Common Stock more than 90% of the shares of Cost Plus Common Stock then outstanding (as adjusted  by the number of shares issuable under Cost Plus stock plans and the Top-Up). If the Company, Merger Sub and any of their respective affiliates acquire more than 90% of the outstanding shares of Cost Plus Common Stock, including through exercise of the Top-Up, Merger Sub will complete the Merger through the "short form" procedures available under California law.  Based upon the current outstanding shares of Cost Plus, the Top-Up would permit the Company to close the tender offer based upon the current shares outstanding with approximately 72% of the shares being tendered (subject to adjustment in certain circumstances).
 
The Merger Agreement contains representations, warranties and covenants of the parties customary for a transaction of this type. Cost Plus may not solicit or initiate discussions (and has agreed to cease any existing discussions) with third parties regarding other proposals to acquire Cost Plus and has agreed to certain restrictions on its ability to respond to such proposals, subject to the fulfillment of certain fiduciary duties of Cost Plus' board of directors. Cost Plus must give the Company three business days notice before Cost Plus is permitted to change its recommendation in response to an intervening event or superior proposal or to terminate the Merger Agreement to enter into a definite agreement with respect to a superior proposal.
 
The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for the Company and Cost Plus including, with respect to Cost Plus, in the event that Cost Plus receives a superior proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement). In connection with the termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, including with respect to Cost Plus' entry into an agreement with respect to a superior proposal, Cost Plus is required to pay to the Company a termination fee equal to $16.25 million. In addition, under specified circumstances, Cost Plus has agreed to reimburse the Company for its actual and reasonable out-of-pocket expenses not to exceed $1,500,000.
The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 2.1 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
The representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement may not be intended as a statement of fact but may instead represent an allocation among the parties to the Merger Agreement of the risks associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties to the Merger Agreement.  Consequently, persons other than the parties to the Merger Agreement may not rely upon the representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of the Merger Agreement or any other date. Cost Plus' shareholders and other investors are not third-party beneficiaries under the Merger Agreement and should not rely on the representations, warranties and covenants or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or conditions of the Company, Cost Plus, Merger Sub or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates.
 
Support and Tender Agreements.
 
Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, affiliates of Red Mountain Capital Partners LLC and Stephens Investments Holdings LLC (the two largest shareholders of Cost Plus) have entered into Support and Tender Agreements with the Company and Merger Sub pursuant to which such shareholders have agreed to tender all their shares of Cost Plus Common Stock in the Offer upon the terms and subject to the conditions of such agreements and, if requested by the Company, to vote in favor of the Merger, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of such agreements. The shares subject to the Support and Tender Agreements comprise approximately 26% of the outstanding Cost Plus Common Stock. The Support and Tender Agreements will terminate upon certain circumstances, including upon termination of the Merger Agreement.
 
The foregoing description of the Support and Tender Agreements does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Support and Tender Agreements, which are filed as Exhibit 99.1, Exhibit 99.2 and Exhibit 99.3 hereto and are incorporated herein by reference.
 
The tender offer for the outstanding common stock of Cost Plus referred to in this Form 8-K has not yet commenced. This Form 8-K is neither a recommendation, an offer to purchase nor a solicitation of an offer to sell any securities. The solicitation and the offer to buy shares of Cost Plus' common stock will be made pursuant to an offer to purchase and related materials that the Company and Merger Sub intend to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. At the time the offer is commenced, the Company and Merger Sub will file a tender offer statement on Schedule TO with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and thereafter Cost Plus will file a solicitation/recommendation statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the offer. The tender offer statement (including an offer to purchase, a related letter of transmittal and other offer documents) and the solicitation/recommendation statement will contain important information that should be read carefully and considered before any decision is made with respect to the tender offer. These materials will be sent free of charge to all shareholders of Cost Plus when available. In addition, at such time all of these materials (and all other materials filed by Cost Plus with the Securities and Exchange Commission) will be available at no charge from the Securities and Exchange Commission through its website at www.sec.gov. Free copies of the offer to purchase, the related letter of transmittal and certain other offering documents may be obtained at such time by directing such requests to Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. Investor Relations at 650 Liberty Ave., Union, NJ 07083, telephone: (908) 855-4554.

Exhibit 99.4
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
UNION, New Jersey and OAKLAND, California, May 9, 2012  (NASDAQ: BBBY) and (NASDAQ: CPWM) today jointly announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement under which Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. will acquire Cost Plus, Inc. in an all cash transaction.  Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. has agreed to make a cash tender offer for all outstanding shares of Cost Plus, Inc. common stock at a price of $22 per share, followed by a merger in which all shareholders that have not tendered would receive the same consideration.
Bed Bath & Beyond Inc.
Cost Plus, Inc.
 
The Boards of Directors of both companies have unanimously approved the terms of the transaction. A special committee of the Cost Plus, Inc. Board of Directors also recommended the transaction following receipt of a fairness opinion from its financial advisor.  In addition, Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. has entered into agreements with Red Mountain Capital Partners LLC and Stephens Investment Holdings LLC, the two largest shareholders of Cost Plus, Inc. pursuant to which each shareholder has committed to tender all of their shares, which in aggregate comprise approximately a 26% interest in Cost Plus, Inc., into the offer, subject to certain conditions.
 
"We are thrilled about the prospects of welcoming the Cost Plus team and their customers and vendors to the Bed Bath & Beyond family," said Steven H. Temares, Chief Executive Officer and member of the Board of Directors of Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. "Through the combination of the highly talented Cost Plus organization with our own dedicated associates, we expect to be able to do even more for, and with, our collective customers," he added.
 
Barry J. Feld, Chief Executive Officer of Cost Plus, Inc., stated: "We are pleased that this transaction will offer immediate and compelling value to our shareholders as well as exciting new opportunities to the thousands of people who have helped transform our business and drive its continuing growth and momentum. Our successful merchandising and product collaborations over the last two years have demonstrated that our organizations work well together and that we can make key contributions to the continued success of the combined company."
 
The acquisition is expected to close during Bed Bath & Beyond Inc.'s fiscal second quarter.  It is also expected to be slightly accretive to Bed Bath & Beyond Inc.'s net earnings per diluted share for fiscal 2012, after transaction and integration costs.  Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. continues to model a high single digit to a low double digit percentage increase in net earnings per diluted share in fiscal 2012.
 
The consummation of the transaction is not subject to financing and will be funded by Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. with available cash.  Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. continues to model completion of its current share repurchase authorization by the end of fiscal 2012, which may be influenced by several factors, including business and market conditions.
 
The tender offer is conditioned upon, among other things, expiration of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act of 1976, as amended, the satisfaction of a minimum tender condition that the holders of 90% of Cost Plus, Inc.'s outstanding shares (as increased by the number of shares issuable under stock plans and the top-up referred to below) tender and not withdraw their shares, and other customary conditions.  Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. has the right to acquire additional, newly issued shares of Cost Plus, Inc. under a top-up right if necessary to meet the minimum tender condition. In the event the minimum tender or other conditions are not met, the parties have agreed to complete the transaction through a one-step merger, subject to receipt of shareholder approval. Pursuant to the agreements described above,
 
Red Mountain and Stephens have also committed to vote all of their shares in favor of a merger, subject to certain conditions.
 
Goldman, Sachs & Co. is acting as financial advisor to and Proskauer Rose LLP as legal advisor to Bed Bath & Beyond Inc.  Peter J. Solomon Company is acting as financial advisor to and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP as legal advisor to Cost Plus, Inc.

Net Earnings per Diluted Share of $.89
            
Quarterly Net Sales Increase by Approximately 5.1%
            
Quarterly Comparable Store Sales Increase by Approximately 3.0%
            
Modeling Fiscal Second Quarter 2012 Net Earnings per Diluted Share of Approximately $.97 to $1.03
            
Continues to Model Fiscal 2012 Net Earnings per Diluted Share to Increase by a High Single to a Low Double Digit Percentage Range
 
UNION, New Jersey, June 20, 2012  today reported net earnings of $.89 per diluted share ($206.8 million) in the fiscal quarter ended May 26, 2012, an increase of approximately 24% versus net earnings of $.72 per diluted share ($180.6 million) in the same quarter a year ago.  Net sales for the fiscal first quarter of 2012 were approximately $2.218 billion, an increase of approximately 5.1% from net sales of approximately $2.110 billion reported in the fiscal first quarter of 2011.  Comparable store sales in the fiscal first quarter of 2012 increased by approximately 3.0%, compared with an increase of approximately 7.0% in last year's fiscal first quarter.
Bed Bath & Beyond Inc.
 
During the fiscal first quarter of 2012, the Company repurchased approximately $306 million of its common stock representing approximately 4.6 million shares.  As of May 26, 2012, the remaining balance of the current share repurchase program authorized in December 2010 was approximately $613 million.
 
The Company is modeling net earnings per diluted share to be approximately $.97 to $1.03 for the fiscal second quarter and continues to model net earnings per diluted share to increase by a high single to a low double digit percentage range for all of fiscal 2012, which will be 53 weeks.  The modeling of net earnings per diluted share is based upon a number of planning assumptions which will be described in the Company's first quarter of fiscal 2012 conference call.

As announced on May 9, 2012, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Cost Plus, Inc., a retailer selling a wide range of home decorating items, furniture, gifts, holiday and other seasonal items, and gourmet food and beverages.  While the Company expects the tender offer for Cost Plus, Inc.'s outstanding shares to be completed during the fiscal second quarter, the Company's planning assumptions and modeled net earnings per diluted share for the fiscal second quarter and full year 2012 exclude Cost Plus, Inc. as the transaction has not yet been completed.
 
Assuming the tender offer is completed as anticipated during the fiscal second quarter of 2012, the Company's modeling of net earnings per diluted share, including transaction and integration costs, would decrease by several cents for the fiscal second quarter.  For the fiscal second half, net earnings per diluted share, including integration costs, would increase and be slightly accretive.  For fiscal 2012, the Company would continue to model net earnings per diluted share to increase by a high single to a low double digit percentage range over fiscal 2011.
 
Additionally, on June 1, 2012, the Company announced the acquisition of Linen Holdings, LLC, a business-to-business distributor of a variety of textile products, amenities and other goods to customers in the hospitality, cruise line, food service, healthcare and other industries.  The benefit from Linen Holdings, LLC's results of operations is included in the Company's modeled net earnings per diluted share and will not have a material effect for the fiscal second quarter or for all of fiscal 2012.
 
As of May 26, 2012, the Company had a total of 1,180 stores, including 995 stores in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Canada, 72 stores, 68 stores and 45 stores under the names of or .  During the fiscal first quarter, the Company opened two stores, four stores and one store. Consolidated store space as of May 26, 2012 was approximately 36.3 million square feet.

The term of the 2012 Plan was extended through May 18, 2022.
 
                 
The 2012 Plan authorizes the grant of incentive stock options, which may provide the participant with the opportunity for favorable tax treatment under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), subject to certain conditions and requirements.
 
                 
The 2012 Plan includes additional features such as the avoidance of liberalized share recycling for stock options and stock appreciation rights, minimum vesting requirements, and restrictions on dividend payments in connection with restricted stock awards and other stock-based awards, all as set forth in greater detail in the 2012 Plan.
 
In addition to the foregoing, our shareholders reapproved the Section 162(m) performance goals under the 2012 Plan so that certain incentive awards granted under the 2012 Plan to executive officers of the Company may qualify as exempt performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code.
 
The foregoing is a brief summary of the principal modifications included in the 2012 Plan and does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the 2012 Plan, which is attached as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference.

Exhibit 10.1
The purpose of this Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. 2012 Incentive Compensation Plan is to enhance the profitability and value of the Company for the benefit of its stockholders by enabling the Company to offer Eligible Employees, Consultants and Non-Employee Directors stock-based and other incentives, thereby creating a means to raise the level of equity ownership by such individuals and provide other incentives in order to attract, retain and reward such individuals and strengthen the mutuality of interests between such individuals and the Company's stockholders.

The performance goals under the Plan were reapproved by the stockholders of the Company at the 2009 annual stockholders' meeting.  The Plan is amended, restated and renamed as the Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. 2012 Incentive Compensation Plan, effective upon the date the stockholders of the Company approve the Plan in accordance with the requirements of the laws of the State of New York.

(k)
                                
solely to the extent permitted by applicable law, to determine whether, to what extent and under what circumstances to provide loans (which shall be on a recourse basis and shall bear interest at the rate the Committee shall provide) to Participants in order to purchase shares of Common Stock under the Plan;
 
(l)

(m)

Guidelines
.  Subject to Article XI hereof, the Committee shall have the authority to adopt, alter and repeal such administrative rules, guidelines and practices governing the Plan and perform all acts, including the delegation of its responsibilities (to the extent permitted by applicable law and applicable stock exchange rules), as it shall, from time to time, deem advisable; to construe and interpret the terms and provisions of the Plan and any Award issued under the Plan (and any agreements relating thereto); and to otherwise supervise the administration of the Plan.  The Committee may correct any defect, supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency in the Plan or in any agreement relating thereto in the manner and to the extent it shall deem necessary to effectuate the purpose and intent of the Plan.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no action of the Committee under this Section 3.3 shall reduce the rights of any Participant without the Participant's consent.  To the extent applicable, the Plan is intended to comply with the applicable requirements of Rule 16b-3 and Section 162(m) of the Code, and the Plan shall be limited, construed and interpreted in a manner so as to comply
 
therewith.
 
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Committee may adopt special guidelines, provisions and procedures applicable to Awards granted to persons who are residing in or employed in, or subject to, the taxes or laws of, any domestic or foreign jurisdictions to comply with, or to accommodate differences in, applicable laws, regulations, or accounting, listing or other rules with respect to such domestic or foreign jurisdictions.

Any decision, interpretation or other action made or taken in good faith by or at the direction of the Company, the Board or the Committee (or any of its members) arising out of or in connection with the Plan shall be within the absolute discretion of all and each of them, as the case may be, and shall be final, binding and conclusive on the Company and all employees and Participants and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns.
 
3.5

A majority of the Committee members shall constitute a quorum.  All determinations of the Committee shall be made by a majority of its members.  Any decision or determination reduced to writing and signed by all the Committee members in accordance with the By-Laws of the Company shall be fully effective as if it had been made by a vote at a meeting duly called and held.  The Committee shall make such rules and regulations for the conduct of its business as it shall deem advisable.

(b)
                                
The Committee may employ such legal counsel, consultants and agents as it may deem desirable for the administration of the Plan and may rely upon any opinion received from any such counsel or consultant and any computation received from any such consultant or agent.  Expenses incurred by the Committee or the Board in the engagement of any such counsel, consultant or agent shall be paid by the Company.  The Committee, its members and any person designated pursuant to sub-section (a) above shall not be liable for any action or determination made in good faith with respect to the Plan.

3.7
                              
Indemnification
.  To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law and the Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws of the Company and to the extent not covered by insurance directly insuring such person, each officer and member or former member of the Committee or the Board shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Company against any
 
cost or expense (including reasonable fees of counsel reasonably acceptable to the Committee) or liability (including any sum paid in settlement of a claim with the approval of the Committee), and advanced amounts necessary to pay the foregoing at the earliest time and to the fullest extent permitted, arising out of any act or omission to act in connection with the administration of the Plan, except to the extent arising out of such officer's, member's or former member's own fraud or bad faith.  Such indemnification shall be in addition to any rights of indemnification the employees, officers, Directors or members or former officers, Directors or members may have under applicable law or under the Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws of the Company or any Affiliate or any agreement of indemnification.

4.1
                              
Shares
.
 
(a)
                                
Aggregate Limitation
.  The following provisions apply in determining the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock available under the Plan.
 
(i)
                                    
The aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued or used for reference purposes or with respect to which Awards may be granted under the Plan shall not exceed a total of 43,200,868, which represents an increase of 14,300,000 shares of Common Stock, plus 19,000,000 shares of Common Stock (representing the shares of Common Stock reserved under the Plan prior to the amendment and restatement of the Plan as provided herein and as approved by the Company's stockholders at its 2004 annual meeting), plus 9,900,868 shares of Common Stock available for grant under the Prior Plans (in each case, subject to any increase or decrease pursuant to Section 4.2), which may be either authorized and unissued Common Stock or Common Stock held in or acquired for the treasury of the Company or both.  Any shares of Common Stock that are subject to Awards of Options or Stock Appreciation Rights shall be counted against this limit as one share for every share granted.  Any shares of Common Stock that are subject to Awards other than Options or Stock Appreciation Rights shall be counted against this limit as 2.20 shares for every share granted.
 
(ii)
                                 
If any Option or Stock Appreciation Right granted under the Plan or any stock option granted under a Prior Plan expires, terminates or is canceled for any reason without having been exercised in full, the number of shares of Common Stock underlying such unexercised Award or Prior Plan option shall again be available for the purpose of Awards under the Plan.  If any Restricted Stock Awards, Performance Awards, or Other Stock-Based Awards denominated in shares of Common Stock awarded under the Plan to a Participant are forfeited for any reason, the number of forfeited shares of Common Stock shall again be available for the purposes of Awards under the Plan.  If a Stock Appreciation Right is granted in tandem with an Option, such grant shall apply only once against the maximum number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued under the Plan.
 
Shares of Common Stock underlying Awards (or Prior Plan options) that may be settled solely in cash shall not be deemed to use shares that may be issued under the Plan.
 
(iii)
         
If Common Stock has been delivered or exchanged as full or partial payment to the Company for payment of purchase price of an Award under the Plan other than an Option or Stock Appreciation Right, or for payment of withholding taxes with respect to an Award under the Plan other than an Option or Stock Appreciation Right, the number of shares of Common Stock delivered or exchanged as payment of purchase price or for withholding shall again be available for the purposes of Awards under the Plan.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the number of shares of Common Stock available for the purpose of Awards under this Plan shall be reduced by (i) the total number of Options or Stock Appreciation Rights exercised, regardless of whether any of the shares of Common Stock underlying such Awards are not actually issued to the Participant as the result of a net settlement, and (ii) any shares of Common Stock used to pay any exercise price or tax withholding obligation with respect to any Option or Stock Appreciation Right.  In addition, the Company may not use the cash proceeds it receives from Option exercises to repurchase shares of Common Stock on the open market for reuse under this Plan.
 
(iv)
         
Any shares of Common Stock that again become available for grant pursuant to this Section 4.1(a) shall be added back as one share if such share were subject to an Option or Stock Appreciation Right granted under the Plan or an option granted under a Prior Plan, and for Awards granted on or after the Effective Date, as 2.20 shares if such shares were subject to an Award other than an Option or a Stock Appreciation Right granted under the Plan and, for Awards granted prior to the Effective Date, 1.80 shares if such shares were subject to an Award other than an Option or a Stock Appreciation Right granted under the Plan.
 
(v)
          
From and after the date of the Company's 2004 annual stockholders' meeting at which the Company's stockholders approved the Plan (as in effect prior to the amendment and restatement of the Plan as provided herein), the Company shall make no new grants of options under the Prior Plans and the shares available under the Prior Plans shall be made available for grants under the Plan.
 
(b)
          
Individual Employee Limitations
.  The following provisions apply in determining the Awards that may be granted to an individual during a fiscal year of the Company.
 
(i)
           
The maximum number of shares of Common Stock subject to Options and/or Stock Appreciation Rights that may be granted under the Plan during any fiscal year of the Company to an Eligible Employee shall be, in the aggregate, 1,000,000 shares (subject to any increase or decrease pursuant to Section 4.2).  The maximum number of shares of Common Stock subject to Restricted Stock Awards and/or Other Stock-Based Awards that are subject to the attainment of specified performance goals that may be granted under the Plan during any fiscal year of the Company to an Eligible Employee shall be, in the aggregate, 750,000 shares (subject to any increase or decrease pursuant to Section 4.2).  The
 
maximum number of shares of Common Stock subject to Performance Awards denominated in shares of Common Stock that may be granted to an Eligible Employee under the Plan attributable to any year of a Performance Period shall be 750,000 shares (subject to any increase or decrease pursuant to Section 4.2).  If a Stock Appreciation Right is granted in tandem with an Option it shall apply against the Eligible Employee's individual share limitation applicable to Stock Appreciation Rights and Options.
 
(ii)
          
The maximum payment that may be made to an Eligible Employee under Performance Awards granted under the Plan and denominated in dollars attributable to any year of a Performance Period shall be $5,000,000.
 
(iii)
         
Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that shares of Common Stock or amounts for which Awards are permitted to be granted to an Eligible Employee pursuant to Section 4.1(b) during a fiscal year of the Company or Performance Period, as the case may be, are not covered by an Award in the Company's fiscal year or Performance Period, as the case may be, such shares of Common Stock or amounts shall be available for grant or issuance to such Eligible Employee in any subsequent fiscal year or years during the term of the Plan.
 
(c)
          
Substitute Awards
.  Substitute Awards shall not reduce the shares of Common Stock authorized for grant under the Plan pursuant to Section 4.1(a) or authorized for grant to an Eligible Employee in any fiscal year of the Company pursuant to Section 4.1(b).  Additionally, in the event that a company acquired by the Company or an Affiliate, or with which the Company or an Affiliate combines, has shares available under a pre-existing plan approved by stockholders and not adopted in contemplation of such acquisition or combination, the shares available for grant pursuant to the terms of such pre-existing plan (as adjusted, to the extent appropriate, using the exchange ratio or other adjustment or valuation ratio or formula used in such acquisition or combination to determine the consideration payable to the holders of common stock of the entities party to such acquisition or combination) may be used for Awards under the Plan and shall not reduce the shares of Common Stock authorized for grant under the Plan; provided that Awards using such available shares shall not be made after the date awards or grants could have been made under the terms of the pre-existing plan, absent the acquisition or combination, and shall be made only to individuals who were not Eligible Employees, Consultants or Non-Employee Directors prior to such acquisition or combination.
 
4.2
         
Changes
.
 
(a)
          
The existence of the Plan and the Awards granted hereunder shall not affect in any way the right or power of the Board or the stockholders of the Company to make or authorize (i)
any adjustment, recapitalization, reorganization or other change in the Company's capital structure or its business, (ii) any merger or consolidation of the Company or any Affiliate, (iii) any issuance of bonds, debentures, preferred or prior preference stock ahead of or affecting the Common Stock, (iv) the dissolution or liquidation of the Company or any Affiliate, (v) any sale or transfer of all or part of the assets or business of the Company or any Affiliate or (vi) any other corporate act or proceeding.
 
(b)
          
Subject to the provisions of Section 4.2(d), in the event of any such change in the
 
capital structure or business of the Company by reason of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, combination or reclassification of shares, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, spin-off, reorganization, partial or complete liquidation, issuance of rights or warrants to purchase any Common Stock or securities convertible into Common Stock, any sale or transfer of all or part of the Company's assets or business, any special cash dividend or any other corporate transaction or event having an effect similar to any of the foregoing and effected without receipt of consideration by the Company and the Committee determines in good faith that an adjustment is necessary or appropriate under the Plan to prevent substantial dilution or enlargement of the rights granted to, or available for, Participants under the Plan, then the aggregate number and kind of shares that thereafter may be issued under the Plan, the number and kind of shares or other property (including cash) to be issued upon exercise of an outstanding Award or under other Awards granted under the Plan and the purchase price thereof shall be appropriately adjusted consistent with such change in such manner as the Committee may deem equitable to prevent substantial dilution or enlargement of the rights granted to, or available for, Participants under the Plan, and any such adjustment determined by the Committee in good faith shall be final, binding and conclusive on the Company and all Participants and employees and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns.  In connection with any event described in this paragraph, the Committee may provide, in its sole discretion, for the cancellation of any outstanding Awards and payment in cash or other property in exchange therefor.  In furtherance of this Section 4.2(b), each outstanding Award shall be adjusted as provided herein in the event of an "equity restructuring" within the meaning of FASB ASC Topic 718.  Except as provided in this Section 4.2 or in the applicable Award agreement, a Participant shall have no rights by reason of any issuance by the Company of any class or securities convertible into stock of any class, any subdivision or consolidation of shares of stock of any class, the payment of any stock dividend, any other increase or decrease in the number of shares of stock of any class, any sale or transfer of all or part of the Company's assets or business or any other change affecting the Company's capital structure or business.
 
(c)
          
Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, fractional shares of Common Stock resulting from any adjustment in Awards pursuant to Section 4.2(a) or (b) shall be aggregated until, and eliminated at, the time of exercise by rounding-down for fractions that are less than one-half and rounding-up for fractions that are equal to or greater than one-half.  Notice of any adjustment shall be given by the Committee to each Participant whose Award has been adjusted and such adjustment (whether or not such notice is given) shall be effective and binding for all purposes of the Plan.
 
(d)
          
In the event of (x) a merger or consolidation in which the Company is not the surviving entity, (y) any transaction that results in the acquisition of substantially all of the Company's outstanding Common Stock by a single person or entity or by a group of persons and/or entities acting in concert, or (z) the sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the Company's assets (all of the foregoing being referred to as an ""), then the Committee, in its sole discretion, may terminate all vested and unvested Awards that are outstanding as of the date of Acquisition Event by delivering notice of termination to each Participant at least 20 days prior to the date of the Acquisition Event, in which case, during the period from the date on which such notice of termination is delivered to the date of the Acquisition Event, each such Participant shall have the right to exercise in full all of his or her vested and unvested Awards that are then outstanding (without regard to any limitations on
Acquisition Event
 
vesting or exercisability otherwise contained in the Award agreements), but any such exercise shall be contingent on the consummation of the Acquisition Event, and, provided that, if the Acquisition Event does not occur within a specified period after giving such notice for any reason whatsoever, the notice and exercise pursuant thereto shall be null and void.
 
If an Acquisition Event occurs but the Committee does not terminate the outstanding Awards pursuant to this Section 4.2(d), then the provisions of Section 4.2(b) shall apply.
 
4.3
         
Minimum Purchase Price
.  Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, if authorized but previously unissued shares of Common Stock are issued under the Plan, such shares shall not be issued for a consideration that is less than as permitted under applicable law.
 
5.1
         
General Eligibility
.  All Eligible Employees, Consultants and Non-Employee Directors are eligible to be granted Awards.  Eligibility for the grant of Awards and actual participation in the Plan shall be determined by the Committee in its sole discretion.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no Option under which a Participant may receive Common Stock may be granted under the Plan to an Eligible Employee, Consultant or Non-Employee Director if such stock does not constitute "service recipient stock" for purposes of Section 409A of the Code with respect to such Eligible Employee, Consultant or Non-Employee Director, unless such Option is structured in a manner intended to comply with, or be exempt from, Section 409A of the Code.
 
5.2
         
Incentive Stock Options
.  Only employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries, other than prospective employees, shall be eligible for grants of Incentive Stock Options under the Plan.  Eligibility for the grant of an Incentive Stock Option and actual participation in the Plan shall be determined by the Committee in its sole discretion.
 
5.3
         
General Requirement
.  The vesting and exercise of Awards granted to a prospective employee or consultant shall be conditioned upon such individual actually becoming an employee of or consultant to the Company or an Affiliate within a reasonable time thereafter, as determined by the Committee.
 
6.1
         
Options
.  Options may be granted alone or in addition to other Awards granted under the Plan.  The Committee shall have the authority to grant any Eligible Employee, Consultant or Non-Employee Director one or more Options.  Each Option granted under the Plan shall be one of two types: (i) an Incentive Stock Option intended to satisfy the requirements of Section 422 of the Code; or (ii) a non-qualified Option, not intended to be an Incentive Stock Option within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code.
 
6.2
         
Terms of Options
.  Options granted under the Plan shall be subject to the following terms and conditions and shall be in such form and contain such additional terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the terms of the Plan, as the Committee shall deem desirable:
 
(a)
          
Exercise Price
.  The exercise price per share of Common Stock subject to an Option shall be determined by the Committee at the time of grant, provided that the per-share exercise price of any Option shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock at the time of grant; provided, however, that if an Incentive Stock Option is granted to a Ten Percent Shareholder, the per share exercise price of any such Option shall be no less than 110% of the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock at the time of grant.
 
(b)
          
Option Term
.  The term of each Option shall be fixed by the Committee, provided that no Option shall be exercisable more than eight (8) years after the date the Option is granted; and provided further that the term of an Incentive Stock Option granted to a Ten Percent Shareholder shall not exceed five (5) years after the date the Option is granted.
 
(c)
          
Exercisability
.  Unless the Committee determines otherwise at grant or as otherwise provided herein, Options shall be exercisable at such time or times and subject to such terms and conditions as shall be determined by the Committee at grant.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Committee provides, in its discretion, that any Option is exercisable subject to certain limitations (including, without limitation, that such Option is exercisable only in installments or within certain time periods), the Committee may waive such limitations on the exercisability at any time at or after grant in whole or in part (including, without limitation, waiver of the installment exercise provisions or acceleration of the time at which such Option may be exercised), based on such factors, if any, as the Committee shall determine, in its sole discretion.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the schedule according to which any Option shall vest shall be no less than (i) one year, if the vesting terms and conditions are based (in whole or in part) on the attainment of one or more objective performance goals, including, to the extent the Committee so determines, from among those set forth in Exhibit A and (ii) three years, if the vesting terms and conditions are based solely on the continued performance of services by the Participant (with no more than one third of the shares of Common Stock subject thereto vesting on each of the first three anniversaries of the date of grant); provided, that, subject to the terms of the Plan, the Committee shall be authorized (at the time of grant or thereafter) to provide for the acceleration of vesting in the event of a change in control or a Participant's retirement (including, without limitation, Retirement), death or Disability; and provided further, that, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 4.1(a)(i), Options with respect to up to 5% of the total number of shares of Common Stock reserved for Awards under the Plan may be granted that are not subject to the foregoing limitations.
 
(d)
          
Method of Exercise
.  Subject to whatever installment exercise and waiting period provisions apply under subsection (c) above, to the extent vested, Options may be exercised in whole or in part at any time during the Option term, by giving written notice of exercise to the Company specifying the number of shares of Common Stock to be purchased.  Such notice shall be accompanied by payment in full of the purchase price (or arrangements satisfactory to the Committee made for such payment) as follows: (i) in cash or by check, bank draft or money order payable to the order of the Company; (ii) solely to the extent permitted by applicable law, if the Common Stock is traded on a national securities exchange or quoted on a national quotation system sponsored by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, and the Committee
 
authorizes, through a procedure whereby the Participant delivers irrevocable instructions to a broker reasonably acceptable to the Committee to deliver promptly to the Company an amount equal to the purchase price; or (iii) on such other terms and conditions as may be acceptable to the Committee (including, without limitation, the relinquishment of Options or by payment in full or in part in the form of Common Stock (including by attestation) owned by the Participant for such period, or acquired in such manner, as to avoid an incremental charge, for accounting purposes, against the Company's earnings as reported in the Company's financial statements (and for which the Participant has good title free and clear of any liens and encumbrances) based on the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the payment date as determined by the Committee).  No shares of Common Stock shall be issued until payment therefor, as provided herein, has been made or provided for.
 
(e)
          
Termination by Death, Disability or Retirement
.  Unless otherwise (x) provided in a written agreement between the Company and the Participant or (y) determined by the Committee at grant or (if no rights of the Participant are reduced) thereafter, if a Participant's Termination is by reason of death, Disability or Retirement, all Options that are held by such Participant that are vested and exercisable at the time of the Participant's Termination may be exercised by the Participant (or, in the case of death, by the legal representative of the Participant's estate) at any time within a period of one year from the date of such Termination, but in no event beyond the expiration of the stated term of such Options; provided, however, that in the case of Retirement, if the Participant dies within such exercise period, all unexercised Options held by such Participant shall thereafter be exercisable, to the extent to which they were exercisable at the time of death, for a period of one year from the date of such death, but in no event beyond the expiration of the stated term of such Options.
 
(f)
           
Involuntary Termination Without Cause or for Good Reason
.  Unless otherwise (x) provided in a written agreement between the Company and the Participant or (y) determined by the Committee at grant, or (if no rights of the Participant are reduced) thereafter, if a Participant's Termination is by involuntary termination without Cause or, to the extent applicable, Good Reason, all Options that are held by such Participant that are vested and exercisable at the time of the Participant's Termination may be exercised by the Participant at any time within a period of 90 days from the date of such Termination, but in no event beyond the expiration of the stated term of such Options.
 
(g)
          
Voluntary Termination
.  Unless otherwise (x) provided in a written agreement between the Company and the Participant or (y) determined by the Committee at grant or (if no rights of the Participant are reduced) thereafter, if a Participant's Termination is voluntary (other than a voluntary termination described in subsection (h) (ii) below or covered by (f) above), all Options held by such Participant that are vested and exercisable at the time of the Participant's Termination may be exercised by the Participant at any time within a period of 90 days from the date of such Termination, but in no event beyond the expiration of the stated term of such Options.
 
(h)
          
Termination for Cause
.  Unless otherwise (x) provided in a written agreement between the Company and the Participant or (y) determined by the Committee at grant or (if no rights of the Participant are reduced) thereafter, if a Participant's Termination (i) is for Cause or (ii) is a voluntary Termination after the occurrence of an event that would be grounds for a Termination for Cause, all Options held by such Participant, whether or not vested, shall
 
thereupon terminate and expire as of the date of such Termination.
 
(i)
           
Unvested Options
.  Unless otherwise (x) provided in a written agreement between the Company and the Participant or (y) determined by the Committee at grant or (if no rights of the Participant are reduced) thereafter, Options that are not vested as of the date of a Participant's Termination for any reason shall terminate and expire as of the date of such Termination.
 
(j)
           
Form, Modification, Extension and Renewal of Options
.  Subject to the terms and conditions and within the limitations of the Plan, Options shall be evidenced by such form of agreement or grant as is approved by the Committee, and the Committee may (i) modify, extend or renew outstanding Options granted under the Plan (provided that the rights of a Participant are not reduced without his or her consent), and (ii) accept the surrender of outstanding Options (up to the extent not theretofore exercised) and authorize the granting of new Options in substitution therefor (to the extent not theretofore exercised).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, an outstanding Option may not be modified to reduce the exercise price thereof nor may a new Option at a lower price be substituted for a surrendered Option (other than adjustments or substitutions in accordance with Section 4.2), unless such action is approved by the stockholders of the Company.
 
(k)
          
Early Exercise
.  The Committee may provide that an Option include a provision whereby the Participant may elect at any time before the Participant's Termination to exercise the Option as to any part or all of the shares of Common Stock subject to the Option prior to the full vesting of the Option and such shares shall be subject to the provisions of Article VIII and treated as restricted stock.  Any unvested shares of Common Stock so purchased may be subject to a repurchase option in favor of the Company or to any other restriction the Committee determines to be appropriate.
 
(l)
           
Incentive Stock Option Limitations
. To the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value (determined as of the time of grant) of the Common Stock with respect to which Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by an Eligible Employee during any calendar year under the Plan and/or any other stock option plan of the Company, any Subsidiary or any Parent exceeds $100,000, such Options shall be treated as non-qualified stock options. In addition, if an Eligible Employee does not remain employed by the Company or any Subsidiary at all times from the time an Incentive Stock Option is granted until three (3) months prior to the date of exercise thereof (or such other period as required by applicable law), such Option shall be treated as a non-qualified stock option. Should any provision of the Plan not be necessary in order for the Options to qualify as Incentive Stock Options, or should any additional provisions be required, the Committee may amend the Plan accordingly, without the necessity of obtaining the approval of the stockholders of the Company.
 
(m)
         
Other Terms and Conditions
.  Options may contain such other provisions, which shall not be inconsistent with any of the terms of the Plan, as the Committee shall deem appropriate.
 
7.1
         
Tandem Stock Appreciation Rights

(a)

10.1
                       
Other Awards
.  Subject to the share limitations set forth in Section 4.1(a), the Committee is authorized to grant to Eligible Employees, Consultants and Non-Employee Directors Other Stock-Based Awards that are payable in, valued in whole or in part by reference to, or otherwise based on or related to, shares of Common Stock, including, but not limited to, (a) shares of Common Stock awarded purely as a bonus in lieu of cash and not subject to any restrictions or conditions, (b) shares of Common Stock in payment of the amounts due under an incentive or performance plan sponsored or maintained by the Company or an Affiliate, (c) stock equivalent units, (d) restricted stock units, and (e) Awards valued by reference to book value of shares of Common Stock.

The Committee may condition the grant or vesting of Other Stock-Based Awards upon the attainment of specified performance goals, including, to the extent the Committee so
 
determines, from among those set forth on Exhibit A hereto, as the Committee may determine, in its sole discretion, including to comply with the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code.

With regard to an Other Stock-Based Award that is intended to comply with Section 162(m) of the Code, (A) to the extent any provision would create impermissible discretion under Section 162(m) of the Code or otherwise violate Section 162(m) of the Code, such provision shall be of no force or effect and (B) the applicable performance criteria shall be based on one or more of the performance goals set forth in Exhibit A hereto.

(b)
                                
Vesting
.  Any Award under this Article X and any Common Stock covered by any such Award shall vest or be forfeited to the extent so provided in the Award agreement, as determined by the Committee, in its sole discretion.  Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, the schedule according to which any Award under this Article X shall vest shall be no less than (i) one year, if the vesting terms and conditions are based (in whole or in part) on the attainment of one or more objective performance goals, including, to the extent the Committee so determines, from among those set forth in Exhibit A and (ii) three years, if the vesting terms and conditions are based solely on the continued performance of services by the Participant (with no more than one third of the shares of Common Stock subject thereto vesting on each of the first three anniversaries of the date of grant); provided, that, subject to the terms of the Plan, the Committee shall be authorized (at the time of grant or thereafter) to provide for the acceleration of vesting in the event of a change in control or a Participant's retirement (including, without limitation, Retirement), death or Disability; and provided further, that, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 4.1(a), Awards under this Article X with respect to up to 5% of the total number of shares of Common Stock reserved for Awards under the Plan may be granted that are not subject to the foregoing limitations.

11.1
                       
Termination or Amendment
.  Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, the Board (or a duly authorized Committee thereof) may at any time, and from time to time, amend, in whole or in part, any or all of the provisions of the Plan (including any amendment deemed necessary to ensure that the Company may comply with any regulatory requirement referred to in Article XIII), or suspend or terminate it entirely, retroactively or otherwise; provided, however, that, except (x) to correct obvious drafting errors or as otherwise required by law or applicable accounting rules, or (y) as specifically provided herein, the rights of a Participant with respect to Awards granted prior to such amendment, suspension or termination, may not be reduced without the consent of such Participant and, provided, further, without the approval of the holders of the Company's Common Stock entitled to vote in accordance with applicable law, no amendment may be made that would (i) increase the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued under the Plan under Section 4.1(a) (except by operation of Section 4.2); (ii) increase the maximum individual limitations for a fiscal year or year of a Performance Period under Section 4.1(b) (except by operation of Section 4.2); (iii) change the classification of individuals eligible to receive Awards under the Plan; (iv) extend the maximum option period under Section 6.2; (v) alter the performance goals as set forth in Exhibit A; or (vi) require stockholder approval in order for the Plan to continue to comply with the applicable provisions of Section 162(m) of the Code or, to the extent applicable to Incentive Stock Options, Section 422 of the Code.  In no event may the Plan be amended without the approval of the stockholders of the Company in accordance with the applicable laws of the State of New York to increase the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued under the Plan, decrease the minimum exercise price of any Award, amend the terms of outstanding Awards to reduce the exercise price of outstanding Options or Stock Appreciation Rights or to cancel outstanding Options or Stock Appreciation Rights (where prior to the reduction or cancellation the exercise price equals or exceeds the fair market value of the shares of Common Stock underlying such Awards) in exchange for cash, other Awards or Options or Stock Appreciation Rights with an exercise price that is less than the exercise price of the original Options or Stock Appreciation Rights, or to make any other amendment that would require stockholder approval under the rules of any securities exchange or system on which the Company's securities are listed or traded at the request of the Company.  The Committee may amend the terms of any Award theretofore granted, prospectively or retroactively, but, subject to Article IV above, except (x) to correct obvious drafting errors or as otherwise required by law or applicable accounting rules, or (y) as specifically provided herein, no such amendment or other action by the Committee shall reduce the rights of any holder without the holder's consent.
 
11.2
                       
Non-Transferability of Awards

Any attempt to Transfer any Award or benefit not otherwise permitted by the Committee in accordance with the foregoing sentence shall be void, and any such benefit shall not in any manner be liable for or subject to the debts, contracts, liabilities,
 
engagements or torts of any person who shall be entitled to such benefit, nor shall it be subject to attachment or legal process for or against such person.  An Option that is Transferred pursuant to the preceding sentence (i) may not be subsequently Transferred otherwise than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, except as may otherwise be permitted by the Committee and (ii) remains subject to the terms of the Plan and the applicable Award agreement.  Any shares of Common Stock acquired by a permissible transferee shall continue to be subject to the terms of the Plan and the applicable Award agreement.
 
12.1
                       
Unfunded Status of Plan
.  The Plan is intended to constitute an "unfunded" plan for incentive and deferred compensation.  With respect to any payments as to which a Participant has a fixed and vested interest but that are not yet made to a Participant by the Company, nothing contained herein shall give any such Participant any rights that are greater than those of a general unsecured creditor of the Company.
 
13.1
                       
Legend and Custody
.  The Committee may require each person receiving shares of Common Stock pursuant to an Option or other Award under the Plan to represent to and agree with the Company in writing that the Participant is acquiring the shares without a view to distribution thereof.  In addition to any legend required by the Plan, the certificates for such shares may include any legend that the Committee deems appropriate to reflect any restrictions on Transfer.
 
All certificates for shares of Common Stock delivered under the Plan shall be subject to such stop transfer orders and other restrictions as the Committee may deem advisable under (a) the rules, regulations and other requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission, (b) any stock exchange upon which the Common Stock is then listed or any national securities exchange system upon whose system the Common Stock is then quoted, or (c) applicable law, and the Committee may cause a legend or legends to be put on any such certificates to make appropriate reference to such restrictions.
 
If stock certificates are issued in respect of an Award, the Committee may require that any stock certificates evidencing such Award be held in custody by the Company until the Award has vested or the restrictions thereon have lapsed, and that, as a condition of any grant of such an Award, the Participant shall have delivered a duly signed stock power, endorsed in blank, relating to the Common Stock covered by such Award.
 
13.2
                       
Other Plans
.

13.3
                       
No Right to Employment/Directorship/Consultancy
.  Neither the Plan nor the grant of any Option or other Award hereunder shall give any Participant or other employee, Consultant or Non-Employee Director any right with respect to continuance of employment, consultancy or directorship by the Company or any Affiliate, nor shall they be a limitation in any way on the right of the Company or any Affiliate by which an employee is employed or a Consultant or Non-Employee Director is retained to terminate his or her employment, consultancy or directorship at any time.
 
13.4
                       
Withholding of Taxes
.  The Company shall have the right to deduct from any payment to be made pursuant to the Plan, or to otherwise require, prior to the issuance or delivery of any shares of Common Stock or the payment of any cash hereunder, payment by the Participant of any federal, state or local taxes required by law to be withheld.  Upon the vesting of a Restricted Stock Award (or other Award that is taxable upon vesting), or upon making an election under Section 83(b) of the Code, a Participant shall pay all required withholding to the Company.  The minimum statutorily required withholding obligation with regard to any Participant may be satisfied, subject to the consent of the Committee, by reducing the number of shares of Common Stock otherwise deliverable or by delivering shares of Common Stock already owned.  Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, any fraction of a share of Common Stock required to satisfy such tax obligations shall be rounded up to the nearest whole share of Common Stock and subject to withholding.
 
13.5
                       
Listing and Other Conditions
.
 
(a)
                                
Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, as long as the Common Stock is listed on a national securities exchange or system sponsored by a national securities association, the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to an Award shall be conditioned upon such shares being listed on such exchange or system.  The Company shall have no obligation to issue such shares unless and until such shares are so listed, and the right to exercise any Option or other Award with respect to such shares shall be suspended until such listing has been effected.
 
(b)
                                
If at any time counsel to the Company shall be of the opinion that any sale or delivery of shares of Common Stock pursuant to an Option or other Award is or may be unlawful or result in the imposition of excise taxes on the Company under the statutes, rules or regulations of any applicable jurisdiction, the Company shall have no obligation to make such sale or delivery, or to make any application or to effect or to maintain any qualification or registration under the Securities Act or otherwise, with respect to shares of Common Stock or Awards, and the right to exercise any Option or other Award shall be suspended until, in the opinion of said counsel, such sale or delivery shall be lawful or will not result in the imposition of excise taxes on the Company.
 
(c)
                                 
Upon termination of any period of suspension under this Section 13.5, any Award affected by such suspension that shall not then have expired or terminated shall be reinstated as to all shares available before such suspension and as to shares that would otherwise have become available during the period of such suspension, but no such suspension shall extend the term of any Award.
 
(d)
                                
A Participant shall be required to supply the Company with any certificates,
 
representations and information that the Company requests, and otherwise to cooperate with the Company in obtaining any listing, registration, qualification, exemption, consent or approval as the Company deems necessary or appropriate.

As previously disclosed in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed on May 9, 2012, Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. ("Bed Bath") entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger on May 8, 2012 (the "Merger Agreement") with Cost Plus, Inc., a California Corporation ("Cost Plus") and Blue Coral Acquisition Corp., a California corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bed Bath ("Merger Sub"), pursuant to which Merger Sub commenced a cash tender offer to purchase all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Cost Plus, par value $0.01 per share, upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase, dated May 25, 2012, and the related Letter of Transmittal (together with any amendments or supplements to the foregoing, the "Offer").
 
On June 29, 2012, Bed Bath issued a press release announcing the successful completion of the Offer.  A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
Union, NJ June 29, 2012 
Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. todayannounced that its tender offer for the outstanding shares of common stock of Cost Plus, Inc. was successful.
(NASDAQ: BBBY)
 
 
The depositary for the offer has advised Bed Bath & Beyond that, as of the expiration of the offer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on Thursday, June 28, 2012, a total of approximately 20,824,689 Cost Plus shares were validly tendered in the offer and not withdrawn (including approximately 1,942,077 shares delivered through notices of guaranteed delivery), representing approximately 92% of the outstanding common stock of Cost Plus. Shares tendered through notices of guaranteed delivery are required to be delivered to Computershare by Tuesday, July 3, 2012. Bed Bath & Beyond, through a designated wholly owned subsidiary ("Merger Sub"), has accepted for payment in accordance with the terms of the offer all shares that were validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to expiration of the offer (including all shares validly delivered or to be delivered through notices of guaranteed delivery).
 
Bed Bath & Beyond also announced that, simultaneously with the closing of the offer, it will acquire through Merger Sub shares of Cost Plus common stock pursuant to its "top-up" option with Cost Plus sufficient to cause it to own (excluding shares delivered through notices of guaranteed delivery) one share more than 90% of the total number of shares of Cost Plus that would be outstanding on a fully diluted basis immediately after such issuance and to effect the merger of Merger Sub with and into Cost Plus in accordance with the short-form merger provisions of the California Corporations Code, without a vote or meeting of Cost Plus's shareholders. Bed Bath & Beyond intends to effect the merger promptly following the offer closing. Pursuant to the merger, each outstanding Cost Plus share not tendered and purchased in the offer, if any (other than those as to which holders properly exercise dissenters rights, if any), will be converted into the right to receive the same $22.00 per share price, without interest and less any required withholding taxes, that is to be paid in the offer. As a result of the merger, Cost Plus will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Bed Bath & Beyond. Cost Plus's common stock will also cease to be traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on the business day immediately following the effective time of the merger.
 
In addition, as announced in its press release on June 20, 2012, Bed Bath & Beyond's previously modeled fiscal second quarter of 2012 net earnings per diluted share of $.97 to $1.03, which excluded Cost Plus, are expected to decrease by several cents, including transaction and integration costs, as a result of the merger. Bed Bath & Beyond expects the benefit of the merger to be slightly accretive to net earnings for the second half of the fiscal year.  For fiscal 2012, including the results of Cost Plus from the date of the merger to the end of the fiscal year, Bed Bath & Beyond continues to model net earnings per diluted share to increase by a high single to a low double digit percentage range over fiscal 2011.

The Company is pleased to announce that its Board of Directors has authorized a new $2.5 billion share repurchase program.

Since 2004 through the fiscal third quarter of 2012, the Company has returned approximately $4.7 billion to our shareholders through share repurchases.
 
"Our Board authorized this new share repurchase program based upon its continued confidence in our Company's long-term growth potential, financial outlook and cash flow generation," said Steven Temares, Chief Executive Officer and Member of the Board of Directors.  "It is anticipated that this $2.5 billion share repurchase program will be funded from current cash and future cash flows.  That said, our Company's Board of Directors continues to review our capital structure on an ongoing basis.  In addition to providing value to our shareholders through share repurchase programs, our strong operations should allow us to continue to invest in our infrastructure and maintain our flexibility to take advantage of opportunities as they may arise."

Comparable store sales for the fiscal nine months of 2012 increased by approximately 2.7%, compared with an increase of approximately 5.5% in last year's fiscal nine months.
 
The Company is modeling net earnings per diluted share to be approximately $1.60 to $1.67 for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2012 and, consistent with prior estimates, to be approximately $4.48 to $4.54 for all of fiscal 2012, which will be 53 weeks and includes World Market and Linen Holdings from the date of each acquisition to the end of the fiscal year.
